 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for his  indulgence.   I rise in strong support of the effort of my good friend and  colleague, Mrs. Wagner of Missouri, on H.R. 6891. I think it is  important that we speak with one voice in this body that the brutal,  reckless, and unprovoked invasion of Russia in Ukraine and the terrible  toll it has taken on the Ukrainian people is not acceptable, not to the  American people and certainly not to this Congress.   Taking the steps enumerated in Mrs. Wagner's bill is a very important  matter in isolating Russia and in raising the cost to Russia of this  reckless and brutal invasion.   It is not okay to target hospitals. It is not okay to target innocent  citizens. It is not okay to target children, including children's  cancer hospitals, with missiles raining down on their heads and killing  the innocents.   It is not okay in the 21st century to settle disputes kinetically,  that is to say, by military invasion. Until and unless Russia stops its  actions in Ukraine and withdraws from its sovereign territory  completely, we need to stand as one with our allies and as one Nation  in saying that we will resist, and we will assist the Ukrainian people  in resisting this ruthless action by Vladimir Putin and his kleptocrats  in Moscow.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for her leadership,  and I am proud to support this effort.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2201) to manage supply chain risk through counterintelligence  training, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2201         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supply Chain Security       Training Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. TRAINING PROGRAM TO MANAGE SUPPLY CHAIN RISK.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of General       Services, through the Federal Acquisition Institute, shall       develop a training program for officials with supply chain       risk management responsibilities at Federal agencies.        (b) Content.--The training program shall be designed to       prepare such personnel to perform supply chain risk       management activities and identify and mitigate supply chain       security risks that arise throughout the acquisition       lifecycle, including for the acquisition of information and       communications technology. The training program shall--        (1) include, considering the protection of classified and       other sensitive information, information on current, specific       supply chain security threats and vulnerabilities; and        (2) be updated as determined to be necessary by the       Administrator.

Such guidance shall--        (A) allow executive agencies to incorporate the training       program into existing agency training programs; and        (B) provide guidance on how to identify executive agency       officials with supply chain risk management responsibilities.        (2) Availability.--The Director of the Office of Management       and Budget shall make the guidance promulgated under       paragraph (1) available to Federal agencies of the       legislative and judicial branches.       SEC. 3. REPORTS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAM.         Not later than 180 days after the completion of the first       course, and annually thereafter for the next three years, the       Administrator of General Services shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees and leadership a report       on implementation of the training program required under       section 2.       SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees and leadership.--      The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs and the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate;       and        (B) the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee       on Armed Services of the House of Representatives.        (2) Information and communications technology.--The term       ``information and communications technology'' has the meaning       given the term in section 4713(k) of title 41, United States       Code.        (3) Executive agency.--The term ``executive agency'' has       the meaning given the term in section 133 of title 41, United       States Code.        (4) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means any       agency, committee, commission, office, or other establishment       in the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the       Federal Government.        (5) Training program.--The term ``training program'' means       the training program developed pursuant to section 2(a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2201, the Supply Chain Security  Training Act, led by Chairman Gary Peters of the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.   I thank Representatives   Joe Neguse and Scott Franklin, who did  excellent bipartisan work here to lead the House companion, H.R. 5962,  which was reported by the Oversight and Reform Committee on February 4  without opposition.   This important bill to defend our Nation's information and  communications technology supply chains cannot be enacted soon enough.   In December 2020, a Government Accountability Office report revealed  that Federal agencies had failed to fully implement supply chain and  risk management standards for information and communications  technology.   That same month, the discovery of the SolarWinds breach made urgently  clear how dangerous supply chain vulnerabilities can be. The networks  of at least nine Federal agencies were compromised by Russian actors,  allowing  [[Page H4759]]  them access to Federal systems for months before they were even  discovered.   To help address these concerns, the Supply Chain Security Training  Act establishes a training program for agency employees with  responsibilities related to supply chain risk management, better  preparing them to identify and mitigate supply chain threats associated  with the acquisition of products and services.   The training requirements created by this bill will ensure that the  acquisition workforce has the capability to identify items in the  supply chain that could be used to exploit Federal information systems.   As the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, the  Federal Government relies on a complex supply chain that spans  continents and is continuously targeted by foreign adversaries and  cybercriminals scheming to breach Federal information systems.   To protect our national security interests and guard against these  attacks, we must equip our Federal acquisition officials with the  expertise and skills they need to reinforce our cybersecurity defenses  through purchasing decisions.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from South Carolina for  her leadership and support on this important piece of legislation,  which will help guard Federal assets.    I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1097) to establish a Federal rotational cyber workforce  program for the Federal cyber workforce.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 6. SUNSET.         Effective 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act,       this Act is repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1097, the Federal Rotational  Cyber Workforce Program Act. The bill was introduced by Senator Peters  with bipartisan support here in the House  [[Page H4761]]  with the companion legislation introduced by Representatives Ro Khanna  and Nancy Mace.   The Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act enables  cybersecurity professionals in the Federal Government to rotate through  assignments outside of their regular position or agency on a voluntary  basis.   The Office of Personnel Management would establish guidelines for the  implementation of the program. The program would be authorized for 5  years, and after 3 years, the Government Accountability Office would  assess its operation and effectiveness.   Achieving cybersecurity in response to the threats the Nation faces  was identified in GAO's latest ``High Risk List'' as an area where the  government is actually regressing. GAO reported that Federal agencies  are struggling to ensure that staff have the skills required to address  the critical cybersecurity risks that continue to intensify.   The program this bill creates allows the government to have its  security employees to further develop their skills and agencies across  the government to benefit from the employees' expertise.   Recent cyberattacks in both the private and public sectors have  demonstrated the dire consequences of failing to improve the Federal  Government's cybersecurity operations.   We know that adversaries in Russia, China, and other malign actors,  state and nonstate, are consistently working to breach the U.S.  Government's communications and data. Unfortunately, at times, they  have been all too successful. In the 2020 SolarWinds breach, for  example, Russian hackers infiltrated the networks of nine Federal  agencies and went undetected for months.   This bill goes a long way toward improving Federal agencies' capacity  to strengthen cybersecurity operations, help them retain top talent in  that field, and facilitate the exchange of expertise in this critical  area.   The security of Federal information technology systems and data is a  national security priority, and it ought to be. It is essential to  preserving public trust in government institutions and ensuring that  agencies are better equipped to meet their missions in serving the  American people.   I strongly support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I inform the House I have no further  speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from South  Carolina for her leadership on a very important matter, and I urge  passage of this important piece of legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6531) to provide an increased allocation of funding under  certain programs for assistance in areas of persistent poverty, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6531         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6531, the Targeting  Resources to Communities in Need Act. This bill is bipartisan, and it  was introduced by the distinguished majority whip, Representative  Jim  Clyburn of South Carolina, and Mr. Hal Rogers of Kentucky.                                time  1745    This bill is timely and would make a difference in the lives of the  people across the Nation facing the difficulties of living in  persistent poverty.   According to the Census Bureau, in 2020 the official rate of poverty  in the United States was 11.4 percent. That statistic illustrates the  hardships faced by over 37.2 million people. As we know, poverty can be  experienced by Americans of all backgrounds in rural, urban, and  suburban communities.   The aims of this important bill are straightforward. The bill would  provide additional transparency about the areas of the country facing  persistent poverty and would target more Federal resources for program  assistance to those areas.   Specifically, H.R. 6531 would require the Census Bureau to publish a  list of all areas of persistent poverty, and the Office of Management  and Budget would work with agencies to direct additional funds to the  places where people need them most.   Reports to Congress would be submitted annually--noting the programs  included in the bill's efforts, along with assessments of the economic  impacts of the additional investments, to the extent possible.   This bill also calls for GAO to evaluate the effectiveness of the  investments over time. Those areas of the country facing exceptional  hardship require our exceptional attention and support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, let me just say, this is how it is  supposed to work--watching the collaboration between our dear friend  from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) and the dean of the House (Mr.  Rogers) on addressing endemic poverty in the United States is how this  House works best. I congratulate both of them for showing us the way. I  hope we emulate it on more than this occasion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation. Let's help our fellow Americans when we can, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
