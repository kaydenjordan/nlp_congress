 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana for yielding.   I rise today as the president of the 117th Congress Republican  freshman class to express our profound sadness that we all share for  the loss of our friend and colleague, Luke Letlow.   Luke was a great American who was committed to serving his country  and the people of his home State of Louisiana. Sadly, Luke was taken  from us way too early.   I never actually had the chance to meet Luke. He was elected on  December 5, which was the last day of the second week of New Member  orientation.  [[Page H567]]  But as the freshman class president, I felt it my duty to make sure  that he felt included by texting him, connecting him with other  Members, and making sure that he had all of his needs met as he joined  this 117th freshman class.   Our entire class looked forward to being sworn in together on January  3, and we were devastated by the news of his passing on December 29 of  2020. We all know that Luke would have been a tremendous addition and  someone who would have made a positive impact on this great Nation.    I join with all of my colleagues in sending our thoughts and support  to Luke's family, including his wife, Julia, son, Jeremiah, daughter,  Jacqueline, and I am keeping them all in my prayers.   It is interesting to see In God We Trust above the Speaker's chair  because one thing I do know is that Luke trusted God.
