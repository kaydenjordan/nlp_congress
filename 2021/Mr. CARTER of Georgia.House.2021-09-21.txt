 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  September 21 as World Alzheimer's Day.   Alzheimer's is a cruel disease that attacks a person's quality of  life. People living with Alzheimer's lose their memories, their  independence, their relationships, and ultimately their lives.   Beyond the patients, caregivers and loved ones endure immense  emotional and financial difficulties. In 2019, 16 million Americans  provided 18.5 billion hours of unpaid care for a loved one living with  Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia.   At this very moment, as I am speaking on the floor, another American  has developed this deadly illness. We have the resources and the great  scientific minds to find a cure for Alzheimer's. We must invest to find  innovative treatments and cures. Americans deserve a healthcare system  that can treat Alzheimer's better than we do today.   In honor of those who have battled and continue to battle this  disease, let's work together to raise awareness  [[Page H4563]]  and promote innovative treatments. We must fight relentlessly for our  constituents and their families impacted by Alzheimer's.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the en bloc amendment offered  by Representative Slotkin which makes seven separate and substantive  policy changes to the Armed Services Committee's bill.   This amendment, like the underlying NDAA, contains provisions that  are under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, but  we have never, never had a legislative hearing on these proposals.                                time  2310    Unfortunately, I fear the lack of due diligence on these provisions  will create implementation confusion and burdensome outcomes, not just  for the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency,  but for everyday Americans.   This amendment focuses on PFAS chemicals, an entire class of over  9,000 chemicals. Broadly speaking, everyone wants to address PFAS  contamination, but we have to do it in a smart and thoughtful way;  otherwise, there are considerable consequences.   Let me point out a few of consequences.   First, the en bloc amendment's provision related to an incineration  moratorium does not use the defined term linking these provisions to  the Defense Department, but addresses ``materials sent to another  entity or entities.''   This makes it unclear who is subject to an incineration moratorium  under section 318, potentially extending the temporary ban from just  the military to any person.   If the executive or judicial branches of our government adopt my  reading of the en bloc amendment, it would have profound policy  implications on waste, storage, and disposal practices in our country.  Of greatest concern, a policy like this has the real potential to  overwhelm existing landfill capacity and leave few viable disposal  options for Americans. This is not the outcome we want.   Setting this interpretation aside, though, this language creates a  structure where the Federal Government is now deciding on the disposal  methods of municipal solid waste. This is entirely unnecessary and  impractical.   Further, this framework disregards the Federal law governing these  matters, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.   Second, the Toxic Release Inventory reporting threshold provisions in  this amendment also contain problems. These provisions would  statutorily deem these chemicals, without scientific review by EPA,  chemicals of special concern and prohibit the use of existing  exemptions.   Complicating matters, EPA has only validated 29 measurement  techniques for PFAS in drinking water. There are 172 PFAS currently  subject to reporting, making measurements on 143 PFAS unreliable and  subject to enforcement by EPA.   Further expanding the reach of the Federal Government into areas  without proper justification.   Finally, the amount of people or entities that would need to report  is unknown and could be huge, encompassing many parties who neither  made nor added PFAS to their processes.   It is a reasonable expectation for these stakeholders that, to prove  they don't have it, they will need to use invalid tests or potentially  install filtering technology, even though there is no Federal standard.   In another area, the en bloc amendment recycles provisions from the  PFAS Action Act which the House voted on recently and E&C Republicans  largely opposed. These requirements would create duplicate reporting  and submission burdens on manufacturers and administrative resource  constraints at EPA and potentially each State.   EPA is already compelling data production on existing PFAS from the  same people for the same ultimate purpose under Section 8(a)(7) of the  Toxic Substances Control Act. It makes me wonder whether the purpose of  these and other provisions is to get necessary information to EPA to  help its essential data gaps and address PFAS contamination, or if this  is about something else entirely different.   Much of our debate about the PFAS Action Act surrounded the fact that  it would lead to a de facto ban on these chemicals, and it will.   No one opposes the effort to hold DOD accountable for its messes or  to keep the men and women of the Armed Forces and surrounding  communities safe from environmental harm. But before we act on the far- reaching language of the amendment, not to mention some of the  underlying bill, we need to know about the facts on the ground,  especially for this motley crew of amendments.   PFAS are a large class of chemicals, as I said, over 9,000, with  essential uses, including many necessary for our national defense.  [[Page H4821]]    There is a strong lesson here for the majority: Follow regular order;  hold hearings and markups, and your work could result in practical,  workable, and effective policy and a public law.   Unfortunately, my Democrat friends have done the opposite here,  seriously completing the chance this language has at becoming law. I  oppose the amendment. I urge others to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
