 Mr. President, the Senate finally completed its work  on a new longterm FAA Reauthorization bill. This 5-year bill will give  the aviation industry the certainty it needs in order to plan for  future investments and service enhancements. This bill also gives the  FAA the direction and tools necessary to address customer and community  concerns that arise from those activities.   Stable funding for the Airport Improvement Program, AIP, is an  essential program for both large and small airports. In this fiscal  year, in my home State of Maryland, 13 airports received 16 separate  grants to aid in construction related improvements. These are projects  that likely would have been delayed or postponed if it were not for  AIP.   This bill contains language that I supported to address the negative  effects of airplane noise on homeowners. Directing the FAA to review  how they work with communities impacted by airplane noise and study the  health impacts of noise is a step in the right direction toward  tackling the impacts of NextGen implementation. I look forward to  working with the FAA to ensure the provisions in this bill are  implemented and to strive for additional ways to address the perpetual  problem of noise in our communities.   Reauthorizing the Essential Air Service Program and Small Community  Air Service Development Program is important to make sure that the  rural airports in our country, like Hagerstown Regional Airport in  Maryland, receive the funding they need to maintain service in remote  areas.   I am also pleased that the bill contains S. 2792, a bill to modernize  training programs at aviation maintenance technician schools and S.  2506, a bill to establish an aviation maintenance workforce development  pilot program. The Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics has a satellite  campus at Hagerstown Regional Airport where they are training the next  generation of aviation technicians. As our airplanes modernize, so too  must aviation technician curriculum.   While the bill contains several provisions that seek to improve  customer service including the language that I offered to the TICKETS  Act that prevents the forcible removal of passengers after boarding,  setting passenger seat size minimums, and improving accessibility for  travelers with disabilities, I am disappointed that the bill does not  include the Fair Fees Act. The Fair Fees Act would have protected  consumers by prohibiting an air carrier from imposing fees for basic  services like checking a bag or rescheduling a flight that are  unreasonable or disproportional to the cost incurred by the air  carrier.  [[Page S6539]]    In addition, I am concerned about the potential impact of sections  1602 and 1919 on privacy, press freedoms, and other civil liberties. I  strongly urge the administration to implement these provisions in a  manner consistent with the First and Fourth Amendments of the  Constitution and other applicable provisions of Federal law. Providing  for the security of the American people is one of our greatest  responsibilities; however, we must equally ensure that we safeguard the  individual liberties enshrined in our Constitution.                            ____________________
