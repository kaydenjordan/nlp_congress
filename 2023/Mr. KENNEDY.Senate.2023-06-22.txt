 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use a prop  during my remarks.    Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking  about Senator Marshall's and my legislation to overturn President  Biden's squid-brained idea with respect to pistol braces.   The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Mr. President, as you  well know, gives private citizens the right to possess a firearm,  including a pistol, and to use it lawfully. That is not a right of  government; that is a right that each of us has as Americans.   Justice Scalia said it pretty well in DC v. Heller:         The American people have considered the handgun to be the       quintessential self-defense weapon.    So many people who are opposed to the Second Amendment--they say they  are not opposed to the Second Amendment. They say they just want to  regulate guns. They don't. They want to abolish guns. And many of them  wouldn't know a gun from a J.Crew catalogue. This is a handgun. This is  what we are talking about.   Our Second Amendment right is not unlimited. We know that. It is  subject to reasonable--reasonable--restriction by government,  consistent with the Constitution and the country's ``historical  tradition of firearm regulation.'' Those aren't my words; those are the  Supreme Court's words. I am quoting New York State Rifle and Pistol  Association v. Bruen by the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, in many  States, you can't own a bazooka. That is a reasonable restriction. Your  right to own a gun can also be restricted if you suffer from mental  illness. That is what we have concluded as a society as a reasonable  restriction.    The issue today is very simple. It is whether President Biden's  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms' new rule, in effect, banning  or, at a minimum, severely restricting pistol braces is a reasonable  restriction under the Constitution. That is what we are discussing  today.   Trigger warning: This is a pistol brace. I know it is scary. This is  a pistol brace. It fits on your forearm like this. Here it is right  here. To the pistol brace is added another piece that grips the  handgun. That is what we are talking about here.   A pistol brace is also known--this scary piece of equipment here is  also known as a stabilizing brace or an arm brace. It is a simple  device. It is mounted to the rear of the pistol. It is designed to  anchor the pistol to the shooter's arm, right here--it goes on the  forearm--so the shooter can shoot the pistol with one hand.   Now, why is that important? Because some Americans don't have two  hands or the use of two hands or two arms. Pistol braces were invented  to help handicapped people, particularly handicapped veterans, who  don't have the use of both of their arms.   You don't have to be a handicapped person to use a pistol brace. Some  studies have shown that there are as many as 40 million pistol braces  in the United States that President Biden wants to outlaw--not 4  million, 40 million--and most of them--I would say virtually all of  them--are owned by law-abiding citizens.   Now, this pistol brace, other than stabilizing the pistol, it doesn't  change the pistol in any way. The pistol brace doesn't change the  caliber of the pistol. It doesn't make it more powerful. The pistol  brace doesn't change the number of rounds that the pistol can hold. The  pistol brace doesn't make the pistol an automatic pistol. Automatic  weapons are forbidden in the United States. And the pistol brace  doesn't make the pistol fire any faster. The pistol brace also does not  help the shooter load the pistol more quickly.  [[Page S2204]]    Except for stabilizing the pistol, it doesn't change the pistol in  any way. It just makes it easier to hold, which is important  particularly if you are handicapped.   As one of my colleagues alluded to, pistol braces were invented in  2012. They have been legal since. As I said, millions of Americans own  them. Millions of Americans use them, especially handicapped Americans.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has never had a problem  with pistol braces--none, zero, zilch, nada--until President Biden  became President. Now, President Biden and his ATF have promulgated a  rule. It says attaching a pistol brace to a pistol somehow magically  stops the pistol from being a pistol and turns it into a short-barreled  rifle.   The ATF has defended its proposed new rule, as has President Biden,  by pointing to two mass shootings that were committed by individuals  who used pistols with pistol braces.   Now, why does it matter? Why is the ATF trying to say a pistol is no  longer a pistol if you use a pistol brace; it is a short-barreled  rifle? I will tell you why. You don't have to be a Latin scholar to  figure it out because short-barreled rifles, once again, which the ATF  says pistol braces turn pistols into, are heavily restricted by the  National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968. That is  why they want to turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle by using a  pistol brace.   Under these two Federal statutes, if the ATF can succeed, the ATF can  require the owner of the pistol with the pistol brace to register it  within 120 days with the ATF. They want to start a gun registry for  law-abiding Americans. Hello. They want to start a gun registry. If the  ATF pulls this off, this is what they can do.   This is what you have to do if you own a pistol brace and you use it  with your handgun, handicapped or otherwise. You have got to register  it within 120 days with the ATF. You have got to destroy the pistol  brace, or you have got to dismantle the pistol brace, or you have got  to surrender your pistol to the ATF, or you have to destroy your  pistol.   And violations: If you don't do what the ATF says, violations of  these two Federal statutes are punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison  and fines up to $250,000.   Stupidity should hurt more. Unless you self-identify as an idiot, you  can see what is going on here. The American people may be poorer under  President Biden, but they are not stupid.   The ATF is trying to keep Americans from owning pistols and/or they  are trying to keep Americans from owning pistol braces and/or they are  trying to use this rule to start an extensive national gun registry.  And the ATF rule is just a backdoor way to subject pistols to more  smothering regulations.   I swear to God and all the angels, Americans get so much government,  they choke on it. They choke on it. Neither the National Firearms Act  of 1934 nor the Gun Control Act of 1968 mention pistol braces, nor does  the statute's legislative history.   Under recent unambiguous decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court in West  Virginia v. EPA, in Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of  Health and Human Services, and in King v. Burwell--all Supreme Court  precedent--a regulatory Agency like the ATF does not have the power  under our Constitution to decide major questions like banning pistol  braces unless Congress says it is OK, through the text of the statute  that the Agency is relying on. The statute itself clearly and  unambiguously has to give the ATF the authority to ban pistol braces,  and it does not.   The ATF rule is unconstitutional. It is also unconstitutional under  the U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol  Association, Inc. v. Bruen, which was handed down a couple of years  ago, because banning pistol braces is not part of our country's  ``historical tradition of firearm regulation.''   The ATF rule also violates, in my judgment, the Americans With  Disabilities Act of 1990. And finally, the ATF rule and President  Biden's rule are just--the rule is just plain bottom-of-the-barrel  moronic.   Attaching a pistol brace to a pistol, which doesn't change the pistol  in any fundamental way except stabilizing it, does not stop the pistol  from being a pistol. It doesn't. And it sure doesn't turn it into a  short-barreled rifle. Pistols are pistols. Rifles are rifles. Duh. All  the pistol brace does is allow an American, especially a handicapped  American, to safely grip a pistol and control it in a safe manner. That  is all it does. Like I said, stupid should hurt more.   This ATF rule is why so many Americans wonder how so many  governmental officials in Washington, DC, made it through the birth  canal.   I yield the floor.
