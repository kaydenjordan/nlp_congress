 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2679, the Veterans Small  Business Enhancement Act.   Currently, the Federal agencies make their excess property available  to other agencies and eligible organizations that serve the public.  Today's bill is a commonsense expansion of the list of eligible  entities that receive surplus property.   By adding qualified veteran-owned small businesses to the list, it  ensures veteran entrepreneurs have the resources they need to start and  grow. With more than 2.5 million veteran-owned small firms, this bill  puts them on equal footing with other entities that provide important  services to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
