 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Countering  Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act, which passed the House  yesterday. I thank my colleague and friend from the other side of the  aisle, Representative Ann Wagner of Missouri, for co-leading this  legislation. This bill is proof that when it comes to national and  economic security challenges, we can find common ground.   The purpose of the bill is simple: to investigate and respond to  vulnerabilities caused by Chinese telecommunications companies in U.S.  embassies overseas and among our close allies. For too long, the world  has stood by as Chinese telecoms giants have operated as vehicles for  the Chinese Communist Party to commit horrific human rights violations  against the Uyghur people, conduct mass surveillance and espionage, and  supply technology to other repressive regimes around the world.   Securing these networks is imperative when it comes to national  security and human rights, as well as for our economic security. This  legislation will help us to ensure that the  [[Page H8021]]  telecoms infrastructure of our country and our allies is secure,  effective, and made right here in the United States.   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill.                            ____________________
