 Madam President, I first thank Congresswoman Murkowski  for all of her hard work. I thank the majority leader for allowing us  to move on this bill--it has been 4 to 5 years--on the lands bill. We  are very appreciative.   We continue to work with a handful of Members to try to address their  concerns and make improvements that we can add to this public package.  I again thank Chairman Murkowski and other Members.   It appears we will need to take votes on a few amendments, some of  which I am concerned could put the entire package in jeopardy. It is my  sincere hope it does not come to that situation, and Chairman Murkowski  and I are going to do everything we can to address Members' concerns  while protecting the package. This is in jeopardy.   We have an agreement with the House, with the Chairman in the House.  We have an agreement that they will take what the Senate has been  working on in a fair way, and that is what is important. A great deal  of hard work went into this package. It is a great piece of  legislation. It has many reasons to be warmly received by both sides of  the aisle in the House and Senate.   Furthermore, the package addresses many Members' long-term standing  priorities, which will improve the way our public lands are managed and  will help constituents in small towns across America.   I respectfully encourage Members with outstanding concerns to  continue working with Chairman Murkowski and me to meet their needs-- but not in this package. My door is open. I know Chairman Murkowski's  door is open. We are committed to working with those who have not been  successful in getting something they desire into this--or some people  who basically requested a vote--and keeping this thing clean, so that  we can send it over to the House and have a successful day. I think it  would be great.   It has been 4 to 5 years. It is well beyond its time.   I yield the floor.                     Recognition of the Minority Leader.     Mr. President, I also rise with Chairman Murkowski. This  is a timing problem. This is only a timing problem. As far as Senator  Lankford's amendment, I will be joining Senator Murkowski when she  moves to table the amendment, simply because of the timing situation  working with the House.   The House has been gracious. Chairman Grijalva has been wonderful,  basically sitting with us and working with us. We gave him a list of  everything we agreed on after the ``Four Corners'' that Senator  Cantwell and Senator Murkowski worked on before. We all sat down and  went through this, and it is just a matter of timing.   What I am saying to my dear friend from Oklahoma is that when I was  Governor, I insisted that my State agencies account for deferred  maintenance. I would not let them build anything in any State park or  let them do anything in our parks unless they showed me how they were  taking care of what we have already done. I understand. I am totally  committed to help with working through this, but because this is  putting a poison pill--not that we disagree--it is the timing and the  effort in the deal that we have already made. That is the poison pill  that it puts us in, and that basically sinks it because he will not  take anything more back from what we have already cleared on that side.  So the LCWF language in this bill has been terribly negotiated and not  only in the Senate but between the Houses also. I know that Senators  Gardner and Cantwell and everybody have worked so hard on this, and it  gives us permanent authorization and it is a step in the right  direction that we are finally moving to.   So I support Chairman Murkowski's motion to table this amendment. I  reluctantly do that because of our agreement with Senator Lankford's  intent on what he is trying to do, and we are committed to going back  and working with him to get it through the committee.    I second.    Mr. President, I also rise to oppose the amendment of my  good friend from Utah. I oppose his amendment, and I will be joining  Chairman Murkowski when she moves to table the bill.   In my view, this is the most significant achievement of this broad  public lands package. For the first time, we will be permanently  reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This is the glue  that holds us all together.   This is a poison pill. This will not pass if it goes over to the  House.   I encourage the adoption of tabling this amendment.
