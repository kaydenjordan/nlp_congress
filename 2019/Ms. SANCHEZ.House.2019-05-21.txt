 Madam Speaker, today marks the 100th anniversary of the  House passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to  vote.   It is hard to think that, 100 years later, for most of our Nation's  history, including my grandmother's and great-grandmother's  generations, women contributed to the building of our Nation but lacked  this basic civil right.   In America, your vote is your voice; it is what makes all of us  equal. We each have one vote. Voting is one of the most important  things that you can do as a citizen.   When the 19th Amendment passed over 100 years ago, only one woman  served in the United States House of Representatives. When I began my  congressional career here in 2003, 60 women were serving in the House.   Today, I am proud to serve in the House with 127 women, including 14  other Latinas. That, my friends, is progress.   While we have made significant improvements to expand the  representation of women in our political system, we still have a long  way to go. So let  [[Page H4021]]  us honor this anniversary by committing ourselves to continuing the  unfinished work toward achieving full equality for women in this  country.                            ____________________
