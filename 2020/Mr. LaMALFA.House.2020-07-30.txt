 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th  birthday of a great World War II veteran, Ed Ewing from Redding,  California.   Ed is a U.S. Army veteran, who once dreamed of being a doctor but  then found his way to be a longtime owner and operator of Economy 4  Cycle Marine.   Ed began his business in Redding in 1960. He tried to retire in 1985  and did so for 6 years, but he reopened his doors again and worked  until just a few years ago, finally retiring at 98 years old.   Ed knows Bearcat outboard motors inside and out, and he had people  seeking out his expertise from all over the country.   At his birthday party this past weekend, I am told that Ed still  appeared to be running on all cylinders.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Ed a happy birthday and I wish him and his family  a wonderful year ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from southern  California for yielding.   I refer back to amendment No. 87 that would prohibit expenditure  funds by DOJ for marijuana enforcement eradication.   Now, we have a huge problem in my part of northern California, and  this isn't just what some may look at as a State's rights issue. This  is a problem. We have a 50-State standard for FDA legalization of  drugs, and we are going to have a willy-nilly hopscotch way of doing  things with every State that wants to legalize it doing their own  thing. What it really boils down to is this is still in violation of  Federal law by legalizing marijuana. So we should continue to enforce  it.   Empowering States to legalize it doesn't stop illegal drug  trafficking. Indeed, it just brings it into town. It brings it closer  and increases illegal drug trafficking from my State out to other  States.   The cartels get even more nasty about this. Drug cartels have moved  on to our public lands and caused great amounts of damage clearcutting  trees, killing wildlife with their chemicals, and trying to keep them  away.   The DEA Cannabis Eradication Program found a 60 percent increase in  the amount of assets seized from raids in busting these grows.   The same year, the Forest Service eradicated nearly $1.5 million  worth of plants, so this is 2016, from 247 sites on national forest  lands in California alone. And those are 4-year-old stats because it  keeps going up.   The amount of damage they are doing and what it means to nearby  farmers and ranchers who have a very low tolerance for what they are  allowed to get away with on their operations is really unfair.   Of course, these cartels are very heavily armed, and anybody that  happens to go in there hunting or hiking or just traipsing around,  their life is in danger because these people enforce very strongly on  their grows.   They plague our forests. Many of my colleagues have a bipartisan bill  called the PLANT Act to help the Federal Government and local law  enforcement address this problem and increase penalties and do a better  job of enforcing in our forests because they are damaging them. It is  dangerous to our communities in those areas.    So before we do anything that makes marijuana  legalization easier or simpler, we must consider the side effects of  this legalization and looking the other way on enforcement of marijuana  on our lands.
