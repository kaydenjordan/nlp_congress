 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to be  removed as a cosponsor for H.R. 1748.    Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition and  commemoration of the first enslaved Africans who arrived in the United  States 400 years ago. In 1619, the first recorded year of African  slaves arriving in the land we now call the United States of America,  did not know of our future. Our blood lines have continued in this  country since that time. Our history in this country began 400 years  ago when the first captured and kidnapped Africans were put on a boat  from the Kingdom of Ndongo in Angola and landed in North America.   The African slaves who first landed in English North America didn't  know that a whole new classification of black people, African  Americans, would develop into strong advocates of equality, justice and  freedom for people of all nations around the world. They didn't know  about Martin nor Malcom; Mahalia nor Michelle; all they knew is that  they had to survive. They knew they had to live to fight another day.  And here we are still helping to build this great nation, today.   While those first 20 survived, millions of captured, kidnapped, and  enslaved Africans did not, they drowned in horrible deaths in the  Atlantic Ocean. This period of middle passage was devastating for  African people. Those who survived were traumatized by the deadly  voyage to a land of slavery, the opposite of freedom. Here in this  magnificent Capitol, built by slaves, in this great city, built by  slaves, in this great nation, built by slaves, we stand stronger than  ever before.   To those who came before us, I honor your sacrifice and continue your  fight for freedom. 400 years later, the fight for survival and freedom  continues.
