 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3771,  the bipartisan South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act,  which will not only raise awareness about the prevalence of heart  disease in the South Asian community but save lives across our country.   I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for introducing this very important  bill.   Language barriers, stigma, a lack of data surrounding AANHPI health,  and the rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and violence are just some of the  challenges communities of color face in accessing healthcare. South  Asian Americans, in particular, have four times the risk of heart  disease compared to the general population.   The factors behind this epidemic of heart disease among this  community are not understood, and, more importantly, preventative  measures are rarely shared. This bill before us today will tackle these  issues and help to reverse these frightening trends and better protect  South Asian-American communities nationwide, as well as patients of all  races and ethnicities.   Specifically, this bill will create heart health promotion grants at  the Centers for Disease Control to develop culturally appropriate  materials to promote heart health, so that no one loses out on  lifesaving information just because of the language they speak. It  would also establish a clearinghouse of information on heart health  through the NIH and conduct research on cardiovascular disease and  other heart ailments among communities disproportionately affected by  heart disease, such as South Asian Americans.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and have been proud  to support its endorsement by the Congressional Asian Pacific American  Caucus which I chair. This bill is going to save lives, and we must  pass it today.                                time  1230
