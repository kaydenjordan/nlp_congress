 Madam President, it is always good to follow my friend  from Delaware, Navy Captain Carper, who is a Vietnam vet, a naval  aviator--the whole works. It is an honor to serve with him on the EPW  and other committees. So thank you to my good friend from Delaware.                              Amendment No. 5192    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 5192 and ask that it be  reported by number.    Madam President, after World War II, European leaders  looked to the United States to help heal a fractured world and to help  provide safety against increasing communist Russian aggression. As  Winston Churchill said:         There I sat with the great Russian bear on one side of me       with paws outstretched and, on the other side, the great       American Buffalo.    Well, the Buffalo prevailed, NATO prevailed, and the world's most  successful and enduring military alliance was born.   In 1949, the Senate ratified the NATO treaty by a vote of 82 to 13.  President Truman was quoted at the signing ceremony of the NATO treaty  by saying:         In this pact, we hope to create a shield against aggression       and the fear of aggression . . . For us, war is not       inevitable.    He continued:         Men with courage and vision can still determine their own       destiny. They can choose slavery or freedom--war or peace. .       . . The treaty we are signing here today is evidence of the       path they will follow.    That was when President Truman signed the first NATO treaty.   And, indeed, since the formation of NATO, no world wars have broken  out, no country that is a signatory of NATO  [[Page S3893]]  has been invaded by another country's military forces. In fact, the  only time NATO's article V--which is the pillar of the alliance, which  states that an attack on one is an attack on all--was invoked was  actually after the terrorist attacks on America on 9/11. Our allies  came to our help to ensure Afghanistan wouldn't harbor terrorists, and  we appreciate that help. We appreciate it deeply from our NATO allies.   NATO, however, is more than just a military alliance. It is a group  of countries with shared values and beliefs and a commitment to the  principles of democracy. All of this, in addition to the military  alliance, is the heritage of NATO.   President Ronald Reagan summed it up succinctly in a speech to our  NATO allies in 1983:         What do the Soviets mean by words like democracy, freedom,       and peace? Not, I'm sorry to say, what we mean.    Replace the word ``Soviet'' with ``Russia,'' and the sentiment,  unfortunately, holds true today. We see the antithesis of these  democratic values and shared beliefs of NATO being played out in real  time before us in the streets of Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin is  leading a brutal assault on Ukraine--Russia's democratic neighbor--and  committing atrocities, horrible atrocities, against the brave people of  that country.   As both Presidents Truman and Reagan remarked, members of the NATO  alliance are like members of the same house in the same family--the  house and the family of democracy.   So, today, the U.S. Senate will welcome the nations of Sweden and  Finland into the NATO family. Like any family, we may not agree on  everything, but when it is most important, we will have each other's  back. That is the essence of NATO and the core reason for its success.   Neither Russia nor any other country will be able to invade Sweden or  Finland, now that they have become members of NATO, without its NATO  allies coming to their support.   Of course, Finland has experienced the Russian invasion. In 1939,  where, without the help from other nations, its greatly outnumbered  brave Finnish army fought off over 1 million Russian forces for 3  months. But that won't happen again to Finland. It won't happen to  Sweden. They won't be alone now.   We welcome these countries' commitment to freedom and their advanced  professional militaries, which will make NATO stronger.   To Finland and Sweden, no longer will you be working with NATO. You  will now be working in and part of the greatest defense alliance in  history. So welcome to these great countries.   As Churchill once said:         There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies,       and that is fighting without them!    I strongly support the inclusion of these two great nations, Sweden  and Finland, into the NATO alliance. Important occasions like this are  also an opportunity to reflect on the obligations of membership, not  just for these new NATO members but for all NATO members.   And on the heels of the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea in  2014, the heads of state and representatives of the then-28 member  countries who made up NATO attended a very important summit, a NATO  summit, in Wales. There, they agreed upon a common goal for all NATO  members that they would spend a minimum of 2 percent of their gross  domestic product on defense by 2024. This 2 percent of GDP NATO defense  spending goal has been strongly supported for decades by American  administrations, both Republican and Democratic: Presidents Bush,  Obama, Trump, and now President Biden.   At the time, in 2014, of the NATO summit in Wales, 10 of the 28  members of NATO met that 2-percent guideline. Now, 8 years later in  2022, of the 30 NATO country members, we only have 8 of those 30  meeting that 2-percent threshold.   I have a chart here. It lays out the 2-percent goal: who is above it,  who is below it. It is many other countries besides the ones that are  listed there. But the bottom line is, since Wales and that important  commitment, there has not been much progress in NATO on this shared  goal and commitment.   Now, I am a very strong supporter of NATO and a very strong supporter  of the U.S. military, and I want NATO to endure for decades to come.  But alliances can't endure if shared commitments and shared burdens are  not met. This is particularly true for democratic alliances like NATO.  There must be a sense among the citizens of such countries that all are  pulling their weight for the collective defense of the alliance, for  the collective defense of each other.   So as I mentioned at the outset, I am calling up an amendment to the  resolution. My amendment is to make this commitment clear. It is to  announce the U.S. Senate's expectation for all NATO members: the United  States, existing members, and now new members--expectations on what has  already been agreed to by each NATO country and its citizens.   The amendment is simple. It states the following:         The Senate declares that all NATO members should spend a       minimum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product . . . on       defense and 20 percent of their defense budget on major       equipment, including research and development, by 2024, as       outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit Declaration.    That is it. It is a simple amendment, and I hope it can pass in the  next hour by voice vote.   Let me conclude with this: A robust, expanded NATO with Finland and  Sweden as new members is needed now more than ever, especially given  the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We need to fully understand  the broader implications of this invasion. We have entered a new era of  authoritarian aggression, led by Russia and China's dictators, who are  increasingly isolated and dangerous, driven by historical grievances,  paranoid about their democratic neighbors, and willing to use military  force and other aggressive actions to crush the citizens of such  countries. These dangerous dictators, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping,  are increasingly working together to achieve their aggressive goals.   We must wake up to the fact that this new era of authoritarian  aggression will likely be with us for decades. We need to face it with  strategic resolve and confidence. The United States has extraordinary  advantages relative to the dictatorships of Russia and China, if we are  wise enough to utilize and strengthen them: our global network of  allies, our lethal military, our world-class supplies of energy and  other natural resources, our dynamic economy, and, most important, our  democratic values and commitment to liberty.   Xi Jinping and Putin's biggest weakness and vulnerability is that  they fear their own people. We should remember this and exploit this in  the months and years ahead. NATO, as an alliance, encompasses so many  of these powerful comparative advantages: a lethal military, a global  network of allies, dynamic economies, and the power of democratic  values and the commitment to liberty.   We should all welcome and celebrate the addition of Finland and  Sweden to the NATO alliance, but we should also use this moment to  recognize the seriousness of the authoritarian threats on the rise all  over the world and recommit ourselves, all NATO members, to our  obligations of collective defense, moving forward.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I just spoke an hour ago on the floor,  and I am a very strong proponent of Sweden and Finland joining NATO. I  am also a very strong supporter of NATO, and I want the alliance to  endure for decades to come. But alliances can't endure if shared  commitments and burdens are not met.   This is particularly true for democratic alliances, where there must  be a sense among the free citizens of such countries that all are  pulling their weight for the collective defense and shared goals they  all agree to.   So the amendment I just called up an hour ago, No. 5192, is meant to  make this clear. It simply states that the U.S. Senate expects all NATO  members to spend a minimum of 2 percent of GDP on defense spending as  agreed at the NATO summit in Wales in 2014. This will make NATO  stronger, as will the accession of Finland and Sweden as new members.   And I ask for a voice vote on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5192
