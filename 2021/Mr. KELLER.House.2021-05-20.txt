 Madam Speaker, motorsports are one of America's favorite  pastimes and play an important role in our economy.   Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District is home to Selinsgrove  Speedway, Clinton County Motor Speedway, Port Royal Speedway, Beaver  Springs Dragway, and thousands of racing fans, myself included. Some of  my best memories are at the raceway, enjoying the sights and sounds  with our community and family.   That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Recognizing  the Protection of Motorsports Act, or the RPM act. Automotive fans have  long altered stock vehicles for competitive racing, a practice that is  as old as the sport itself. In 2016, the Environmental Protection  Agency issued a proposed rule that would make modifying stock vehicles  for racing illegal. The  [[Page H2616]]  RPM Act would ensure that this doesn't happen, permanently protecting  this practice.   The racing industry has a rich history, and I believe it should be  protected from burdensome regulatory barriers.                            ____________________
