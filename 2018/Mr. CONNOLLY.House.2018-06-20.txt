 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell) and my good friend from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) for  their leadership. But I particularly want to thank my good friend from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings).   Mr. Cummings is not only a legislative expert, but he is also a moral  voice. He speaks with clarity and eloquence, as he did yesterday, about  innocent children being detained at the southern border as an un- American activity, something that does not reflect our values. And  today, he is lending that same moral voice to the crisis that afflicts  so many communities in America: the opioid addiction crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Coordinated Response  through Interagency Strategy and Information Sharing Act, or the CRISIS  Act, to reauthorize and revamp the Office of National Drug Control  Policy.   The chairman and ranking member of our full committee worked closely  together and with committee members to produce a bipartisan bill that  was reported out of the committee unanimously.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the CRISIS Act, which not  only reauthorizes ONDCP, but also strengthens that office so that it  has the resources it needs to coordinate an effective response to the  opioid crisis. And that is something Mr. Cummings stressed. It is not  good enough to do something symbolic. We have to ensure it is  effective. ONDCP's responsibilities are to produce a national drug  control strategy.                                time  1230    Congress created it in 1988 at the height of the crack cocaine  epidemic to oversee Federal drug control efforts and to advise the  President and the administration on drug control policies and  strategies.   It was designed to oversee the National Drug Control Budget to carry  out the goals and policies of that strategy, and to evaluate the  effectiveness of programs across the Federal Government in implementing  the strategy, and to oversee the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas  and Drug Free Communities initiatives.   Congress last authorized the ONDCP in 2006. The authorization expired  in 2010. That is 8 years ago. Since then, we have developed an opioid  crisis the magnitude of which we have never seen in America.   While ONDCP has continued to receive annual appropriations, it is  important that Congress reauthorize this program and reflect the crisis  we are in.   The opioid epidemic that is currently ravaging communities has taken  hundreds of thousands of lives and shows no signs of abating. Every  day, 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose.   The epidemic is destroying families, overwhelming first responders,  straining public health, criminal justice, and child welfare resources.   This epidemic doesn't care where you live or what political party you  belong to. The crisis has touched every community and every corner of  our country.   In my State, the Commonwealth of Virginia, opioid overdose deaths  spiked by 40 percent to 1,133 from 2015 to 2016, and deaths from  synthetic opioids rose from 263 to 692 during that time period.   Northern Virginia, where I represent the good people of Fairfax and  Prince William Counties, Fairfax County, for example, reported an  increase from 67 to 97 opioid-related deaths from 2015 to 2016. And  Prince William County, the other county I represent, increased from 26  to 59 deaths in this time period.   Last month, Dr. Rahul Gupta, Commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau  of Public Health, testified before our committee, and he said that the  crisis will get worse before it gets better. That was not welcome news.   Yet despite the President's pledges and his own Commission on  Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis recommendation that he  declare an opioid crisis national emergency, the President, President  Trump, took the lesser step of declaring a public health emergency last  October.   Seventeen months into this administration, ONDCP is still without a  confirmed director and the administration has failed to produce a  National Drug Control Strategy.   Instead, the President, President Trump, proposed cutting ONDCP's  budget by more than 90 percent. Thank goodness Congress, on a  bipartisan basis, did not heed that recommendation.   Just earlier this week, the acting head of the Drug Enforcement  Agency announced he is going to be retiring at the end of the month,  stating that running that agency in an acting capacity for so long had  become increasingly challenging.   As this administration continues to fail to address the opioid  epidemic, it is imperative that we take immediate and decisive action  on a bipartisan basis.   Reauthorizing the Office of National Drug Control Policy with  enhanced authorities will improve the coordination and effectiveness of  Federal Government drug control efforts. It is one of the many steps we  can take to address the opioid epidemic. It won't solve everything, but  it is a very important first step.   I hope the administration will join us in fighting this crisis with  real solutions and not empty rhetoric.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this  important bill.
