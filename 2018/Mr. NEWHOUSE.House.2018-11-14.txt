 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1142 and ask for its immediate consideration.  [[Page H9515]]    The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1142         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6784) to       provide for removal of the gray wolf in the contiguous 48       States from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife       published under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       November 19, 2018, through November 26, 2018--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 4.  The provisions of section 7 of the War Powers       Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall not apply to House       Concurrent Resolution 138.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1142, providing for further  consideration of H.R. 6784, the Manage our Wolves Act. The rule  provides for consideration of the legislation under a closed rule.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have  cointroduced the underlying legislation considered in this rule today,  H.R. 6784, the Manage our Wolves Act, to return management of the gray  wolf species to the States. The States are best equipped to provide  more effective and accountable management that responds to the needs of  the ecosystem, other species, as well as local communities.   On June 13, 2013, under the Obama administration, the Department of  the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published in the  Federal Register a proposed rule that would have removed the gray wolf  from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. This determination  was made after Fish and Wildlife evaluated the classification status of  gray wolves currently listed in the contiguous United States under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 and found the ``best available  scientific and commercial information indicates that the currently  listed entity is not a valid species under the act.''   Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to recover  species to the point where they are no longer considered endangered or  threatened. The gray wolf is currently found in nearly 50 countries  around the world and has been placed in the classification of least  concern for risk of extinction by the Species Survival Commission of  the International Union for Conservation of Nature.   Some of my colleagues have asked, well, if Fish and Wildlife has  proposed to delist the species, why haven't they done so?   That is a completely fair and reasonable question. Unfortunately, it  is due to the fringe environmentalist efforts that any action from  moving forward under the law has been stalled. So long as the courts  are abused to prevent the proper adjudication of the law, we will not  see progress made.   It is because of this exploitation of the law that communities like  those in central Washington suffer the consequences.   Mr. Speaker, in my home State, the great State of Washington, the  gray wolf is not listed in just the eastern third of the State, forcing  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Fish and  Wildlife to rely on an arbitrary political boundary when delineating  and managing a species.   I am sorry to share with you, Mr. Speaker, that as it turns out,  surprisingly, wolves don't know boundaries or borders.   The arbitrary nature of this current status of the law is broken, and  it is impairing the ability of Fish and Wildlife managers on the ground  to properly manage the species, as well as the ecosystem, including the  harm it poses on other indigenous species.   Mr. Speaker, this is why Congress, as a coequal branch, must act.  This legislation directs the U.S. Department of the Interior to follow  through with the proposed rule and delist the gray wolf from the list  of endangered species.   We have a responsibility to protect the incredibly diverse species  both in Washington State and across this country. These efforts to  protect our wildlife species must be based on sound science and an  open, transparent process. Unfortunately, that is far from the case  when it comes to the process dictating endangered species policies,  particularly in this case of the gray wolf.   For years now, Washington's Department of Fish and Wildlife has asked  the Federal Government to delist the gray wolf and provide relief from  the burdensome, broken process dictating species management. I have  received letters from the director of the Washington State Department  of Fish and Wildlife, one in 2015 and one earlier this year. In them,  the letters read: ``Dear Congressman Newhouse, The Washington  Department of Fish and Wildlife appreciates your continued assistance  to encourage the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to complete the  delisting of the gray wolf and remove it from Federal protection under  the Endangered Species List.''   It continues: ``In 2008, the first wolf pack was documented in  Washington State. Today, we have 22 known packs. During this time, the  State's wolf population has increased by an average of more than 30  percent per year. . . . As demonstrated with the current rate of  recovery, the Department is well suited to facilitate the recovery and  management of wolves across the State. . . . Under the current Federal  designation and management, we cannot fully implement our plan in the  western two-thirds of the State. To ensure ongoing success in wolf  recovery, the Federal listing needs to keep pace with the on-the-ground  recovery status and allow the State to fully implement its management  plan. Therefore, I support your efforts to advance the delisting of  wolves and return management to the State.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the two letters I referenced.                                Department of Fish and Wildlife,                                        Olympia, WA, April 27, 2015.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Newhouse: The Washington Department of       Fish and Wildlife (Department) would appreciate your       assistance to encourage the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service       (USFWS) to complete the delisting of the gray wolf (Canis       lupus) and remove it from federal protections under the       Endangered Species Act (ESA). As you may know, gray wolves in       the western two-thirds of Washington State remain federally       classified as ``endangered'' and are under federal       management.        The original delisting proposal was published on June 13,       2013, and then on March 27, 2014, the USFWS closed the second       round of public comments. The Department submitted letters of       support for delisting in December 2013 and March 2014. While       we have been working closely with the USFWS at the state,       regional and headquarter levels to ensure we are meeting our       shared conservation and recovery objectives, we are concerned       with the lack of progress on federal delisting.        Washington has a strong Wolf Conservation and Management       Plan that has received broad support, and we are committed to       maintaining a viable wolf population in Washington. The       Department is well positioned to facilitate the recovery and       management of wolves across the state.        Protection under Washington State Laws--The Department has       state-specific authority (RCW 77.12.020 and 77.15.120) to       designate and protect species at risk of extinction and has  [[Page H9516]]       classified wolves as endangered since 1980, an action akin to       federal protection granted under ESA). Wolves will remain       protected until their population reaches the levels       established in the state recovery plan.        The Department is equipped for wolf conservation and       management--In 2013, the Washington State Legislature acted       to provide $1.6 million per biennium for wolf management from       a permanent increase in the cost of personalized license       plates. Since then, the Department has hired two permanent       wolf biologists and has deployed 11 conflict specialists       across the state to address wildlife conflict issues.        Wolves are recovering in Washington State--In 2008, the       first wolf pack was documented in Washington State. Today we       have 16 known packs. During this time our wolf population has       increased by an average of more than 30 percent per year. At       current rates, we expect to meet our recovery objects within       six years. We want to have consistent management of wolves       across the state of Washington. For us, successful wolf       recovery means that we have a sustainable wolf population       distributed throughout the state, the public accepts the       presence of wolves on the landscape, and Washington citizens       are confident in the Department's wolf management.        The Washington wolf management plan establishes strong       expectations that livestock operators will use preventive       strategies to avoid wolf-livestock conflict. But sometimes we       may need to remove wolves that become habituated to livestock       as a food source. Under the current federal designation and       management, we cannot implement our plan in the western two-      thirds of the state. Therefore, I ask you for any help you       can provide to advance the federal proposal to delist wolves.        Thank you for considering this request. The Department is       available to assist you with any information you may need.            Sincerely,                                             James Unsworth, Ph.D.,      Director.                                   ____                                  Department of Fish and Wildlife,                                          Olympia, WA, May 15, 2018.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Newhouse: The Washington Department of       Fish and Wildlife (Department) appreciates your continued       assistance to encourage the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service       (USFWS) to complete the delisting of the gray wolf (Canis       lupus) and remove it from federal protection under the       Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The Department submitted       letters of support for delisting in December 2013 and March       2014. To date, the USFWS has not released a decision notice       on the federal status of gray wolves and we remain concerned       with the lack of progress towards federal delisting.        Washington has a strong Wolf Conservation and Management       Plan that has received broad support, and we are committed to       maintaining a viable wolf population in Washington. As       demonstrated with the current rate of recovery, the       Department is well suited to facilitate the recovery and       management of wolves across the state.

The Department is equipped for wolf conservation and       management--Since 2013, the Washington State Legislature has       provided approximately $1.5 million per biennium for wolf       management from a permanent increase in the cost of       personalized license plates. The Department uses that       funding, in addition with other sources, to support 23       positions deployed across the state that address wolf       conflict as well as other wildlife conflict issues.        Wolves are recovering in Washington State--In 2008, the       first wolf pack was documented in Washington State. Today we       have 22 known packs. During this time, the state's wolf       population has increased by an average of more than 30       percent per year.

Under the current federal designation and       management, we cannot fully implement our plan in the western       two-thirds of the state and the only means available for the       USFWS to address wolf-livestock conflicts in the geographic       area under the federal endangered designation is for the       USFWS to attempt to relocate livestock-killing wolves.        To ensure ongoing success in wolf recovery, the federal       listing needs to keep pace with the on-the ground recovery       status and allow the state to fully implement its management       plan. Therefore, I support your efforts to advance the       delisting of wolves and return management to the state.        Thank you for considering this request. The Department is       available to assist you with any information you may need.            Sincerely,                                                         Joe Stohr,                                                          Director.     So, Mr. Speaker, to close, I would just like to say  that, as a farmer and a lifelong resident of central Washington State,  I consider myself a conservationist and a steward of our rich natural  heritage, and that includes our incredible wildlife.   State governments are fully qualified to responsibly manage gray wolf  populations and are better able to meet the needs of local communities,  ranchers, livestock, wildlife populations, and ecosystems.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just a couple of points in response to my good friend  from the State of Massachusetts. Certainly, there are a lot of  important issues in front of us and things that we should and will be  addressing. But I have to say, as a representative of central  Washington who represents communities that deal with wolf populations  on a daily basis, I don't think it is fair or proper, even, for my good  friend to minimize or diminish the importance of the issue that we have  in front of us today. So with all due respect, the importance of  managing wolves in our country deserves just as much attention as many  of the other issues that my good friend from Massachusetts referenced.   Also, as relates to the Khanna resolution, just as you said, in just  a few short weeks, your party will assume the majority. You will have  the opportunity to hold the hearings and the markups and to take the  votes of the all-important regular order that you continually talk  about. I am looking forward to that. But forcing this type of vote on  Members in the remainder of this Congress, in my view, is unnecessary  at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), my good friend, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, nobody is afraid to debate anything here on the House  floor. The fact is, though, that the U.S. is no longer providing the  very support that the Khanna resolution seeks to cut off, making this  action unnecessary.   It is based on a factually faulty premise: We are not involved in  hostilities in Yemen, so the War Powers Act should not apply. As a  result, even if this resolution passed both Chambers, DOD would not  need to alter any of its activities.   Like I said, again, in a few short weeks, the Democrats will assume  the majority. They will be able to hold all the hearings and markups  and votes that they want on this matter, as it should be. Forcing this  type of vote now, in the remainder of this Congress, in my humble  opinion, is simply unnecessary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus, the  organization that stands for finding solutions to the challenges that  we face, not only in the Western United States, but all over the  country to help steer debate back to the issue on the agenda that we  are considering today.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa), a member of the House  Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing for the consideration of H.R. 6784, the  Manage our Wolves Act, wolves were once hunted to near extinction in  the lower 48 States. The gray wolf was listed by the Federal Government  as an endangered species in 1974. Today, though, gray wolves are  thriving both in my State of Washington, as well as throughout the  United States, with more than 5,000 wolves now living in the contiguous  United States.   According to Washington State's Department of Fish and Wildlife, the  State's wolf population has grown over the past 9 straight years to 22  packs that contain at least 120 wolves.    Mr. Speaker, the gray wolf reaching recovered status truly is an  Endangered Species Act success story, and we should celebrate.   Mr. Speaker, permanently listing species under the Federal Endangered  Species Act is not how the process was ever intended to work. The  process should rely on the best available science. It is a sign of  progress that the species has recovered from the brink of extinction  and no longer merits protection under the Federal Endangered Species  Act. That is the key point here. While we seek to delist the gray wolf  from the Federal ESA, we are empowering each State to manage their  respective populations.   Washington State has a strong wolf conservation and management plan  that has received broad support, and the State Department of Fish and  Wildlife is committed to maintaining a viable wolf population in the  State of Washington. Wolves remain protected in the State recovery  plan, but so long as an arbitrary Federal line divides our State and,  as you heard, the State of Oregon, listing the wolf on one side and not  on the other, our State managers are prevented from effectively  managing the population within our States. As I mentioned, wolves do  not know borders.   Mr. Speaker, States are equipped to be more responsive and  accountable to the needs of local communities than Federal agencies  are, and they deserve the flexibility to manage the growing gray wolf  populations. We should celebrate the return of the iconic species like  the gray wolf. But meanwhile, States must be empowered to manage  populations to ensure the healthiest balance between humans, wildlife,  and the ecosystem.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and its  underlying legislation, again, H.R. 6784, the Manage our Wolves Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
