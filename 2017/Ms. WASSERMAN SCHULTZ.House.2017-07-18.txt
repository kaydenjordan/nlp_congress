 Will the gentleman yield?    I represent the State of Florida. I want to  thank my colleagues for bringing up this extremely important  conversation about the, at least, 23 million people who would have lost  healthcare coverage if the ``Not Very Affordable Care Act'' that the  Republicans envisioned would have passed.   If I were the President of the United States, I might want to revise  my definition of winning, because I think that we have a leader in the  White House who repeatedly said that America would get so tired of  winning, once he became President, that we wouldn't know what to do  with ourselves.   Well, if killing their horrific healthcare bill and making sure that  we can maintain healthcare as a right and not return it to the  privilege that it once was for only people who could afford it, then I  will take that kind of winning, because we did win on behalf of the  American people, but we know that this is not the last trick up their  sleeve.   The gentlewoman from Wisconsin mentioned the huge cuts to Medicaid in  this terrible piece of legislation, and the gentleman from Texas  mentioned the 64 percent of seniors in nursing homes who are there  because they are on Medicaid.   I represent the State of Florida, Mr. Speaker, and in the State of  Florida, we have the highest percentage of senior citizens as a  proportion of our population in the country. This is just one example  of a very vulnerable population, and this is an example of a population  that our friends on the other side of the aisle were willing to just  write off and leave twisting in the wind.   What would happen if this bill became law is we would go back to the  days before Medicare and before Medicaid, in which you had families go  bankrupt trying to take care of the ever-increasing healthcare needs of  their most elderly family members, and it is just absolutely  unacceptable.    I, too, had a very similar experience. My  mother-in-law suddenly had a stroke when she was 58 years old, and she  was cut down in her prime, also suffered from diabetes, and spent 3  years really in a very debilitated condition. She had to spend down  essentially all of her assets to be able to qualify for Medicaid,  because the only way that she could get care in a nursing home and be  able to afford to get quality care in a nursing home was through  Medicaid. She did also eventually die after 3 years in a nursing home,  but I can't even imagine having to try to find a way to pay for her  care if it were not for Medicaid.    ``Mean'' was the exact word that the President  used.  [[Page H5973]]         I would be happy to. I am a member of the  Budget Committee, and we are actually going to mark up the Republicans'  budget tomorrow in that committee. Really, with all due respect, Mr.  Speaker, to the ``Commander in Tweet,'' President Trump's budget that  he proposed in May certainly did not put either families or taxpayers  first--far from it.   In fact, the budget that both he proposed and that we will mark up  tomorrow put Americans and taxpayers dead last, right behind polluters,  industry lobbyists, and climate change deniers. And like too many of  our Republican colleagues' spending priorities, this budget, this  Republican budget, is actually a brutal attack on America's families.   We all know that it fails to deliver on investments in jobs, in  infrastructure, and in education, but, my friends, nowhere is the  damage to American families as stark as when it comes to our  environment.   The Trump budget, the Republican budget that we will mark up  tomorrow, will irreparably damage our air, our water, and our climate.  The President has already managed to undermine America's position as a  global leader in clean energy frontiers by withdrawing America from the  Paris climate accord, for example. And like many of his tweets,  President Trump's climate science policies are a rejection of reality,  and a cynical embrace of falsehood and fantasy.   Ms. Jayapal represents a State that is on a coast, I represent a  State that is on a coast, Ms. Moore represents a State that is on the  Great Lakes. Sea levels are rising. Our water levels are rising, Mr.  Speaker. Property appraisers and insurance companies in south Florida  are already factoring this reality into their home value assessments.  King tides are bringing fish into the streets of south Florida.   President Trump's climate change solution is not the Paris climate  accord, it is not making sure that we make investments in alternative  energy. Let me show you what President Trump's solution to sea level  rise and climate change is. His solution is to throw people a life  vest, and they can sink or swim. Folks like the people in my district,  who have invested most of their savings, like so many people, into  their home, a life vest and being told that they can just deal with it  is unacceptable.   We have to come together and come up with solutions to make sure that  we can fight sea level rise and climate change, to make sure we can  keep our drinking water clean, to make sure we make the kinds of  investments so that we can protect the air we breathe. We have cities  like Flint, Michigan, that have dealt with lead in their water and  children being poisoned for years.   To my colleagues, this is something that is an existential threat,  that if we don't make the kinds of investments that we must, then we  are going to be in a world of hurt, and it is not at some distant point  in the future. There was an article in the Miami Herald yesterday, Mr.  Speaker, that referenced that my children's generation may not be able  to live in my own district. That is absolutely unbelievable.   I am actually thinking of sponsoring an appropriation. Rather than  making sure that we can invest in moving away from fossil fuels, maybe  we will just invest in more life vests, President Trump's solution to  global warming and climate change and sea level rise, and just issue  everybody one of these, and we are good to go.    Will the gentleman yield?    I just came from the Appropriations Committee  markup on the Interior legislation, and a large part of that  committee's work relates to the environment.   In my district, which is ground zero for sea level rise, Broward  County recently ordered the drawing of new flood maps because of  anticipated higher water levels. The city of Fort Lauderdale has  already increased the height requirement for seawalls and raised the  elevation of home sites. Miami Beach's climate plan involves building  elevated roads and installing pumps to keep out saltwater.                                time  1845    So the President's and the Republican's--our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle--solution for sea level rise is basically sink or  swim. Here is the President's coastal flood mitigation plan. We have  got the sea level rise plan and the coastal flood mitigation plan. Take  your pick. At some point, we are probably going to have to give people  both because we literally have to slosh around in galoshes when you are  walking down the street in south Florida because of how bad the king  tides are and how bad the streets flood in a normal rain.   But, God forbid, we should invest in infrastructure. And I know the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), when she was in the State  senate, was a significant leader on investing in infrastructure, which  is absolutely critical to making sure that we can keep people safe and  that we can make sure that we can create jobs. That is something that  this President and the Republicans have talked a whole lot about.   We are 178 days into this President's term, and we haven't passed a  single piece of legislation related to infrastructure investment. And I  think he actually promised to think big, because supposedly Democrats  weren't thinking big enough; and that he was going to propose a $1  trillion infrastructure plan. I am hearing crickets. I am still waiting  for that plan.    Will the gentleman yield?    Would the gentlewoman be surprised that last  night in the Appropriations Committee, we marked up the T-HUD bill--the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill? And for all the  talk about making it in America and investing in infrastructure and  transportation and making sure that we can create jobs through those  vehicles, will the gentlewoman be surprised that the Republican  majority actually zeroed out TIGER grants?   Those are the transportation grants that go directly to projects in  communities across this country, to help move people around through  people movers and investments in roads and bridges.   In my district, a TIGER grant was granted last year for complete  streets because we have the highest number of pedestrians and  bicyclists killed in the country, unfortunately, in Broward County.   So would the gentlewoman be surprised to learn the so-called big  commitment to creating jobs and investing in infrastructure actually  resulted in massive cuts in the very legislation where we would be  investing those resources and infrastructure?     I just wanted to, again, place these items on  the table and demonstrate the grave impact that will take its toll on  the American people if the cuts that have been proposed by the Trump  administration and the Republican majority go through. And we will  stand together fighting every step of the way to make sure that-- instead of galoshes, a life vest, and a surgical mask that we see so  many citizens of other countries have to walk around their streets  using because their air quality is so poor, we will stand together to  continue to fight to make the kind of investments that will help  improve, not detract, from people's quality of life.
