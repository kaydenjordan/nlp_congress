 Mr. Speaker, Northfield, New Jersey's Little League  baseball team, a little while back, won their second straight District  16 Little League baseball title.   Their pitcher, Finn Haines, who was selected to compete in the Little  League Derby in Atlanta, pitched their final two innings to clinch the  win.   Brady Arena, their leadoff hitter, scored their winning run, ensuring  that Northfield beat Ocean City 3-2.   The District 16 baseball teams are made up of 11-and 12-year-olds in  Atlantic and Cape May Counties in south Jersey, and winning this title  means that Northfield advanced to the Section 4 tournament.   When they won, the Northfield team ran a victory lap around the field  holding the District 16 championship banner in pride, along with the  United States flag.   So to all players on the team: Congratulations on your win. You have  exciting futures ahead of you. I am sure you have many, many more wins  to come.                            ____________________
