 Mr. President, today I wish to speak about S. 1900, the  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and  Security at the Southern Border Act. I understand there is some  important funding in the bill to deal with President Trump's  manufactured crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly funding for  the Department of Health and Human Services. However, I cannot in good  conscience support a bill that provides additional resources to the  Department of Homeland Security at a time when we are seeing this  agency commit so many gross human rights violations. I want to make my  position clear: I do not support this bill in its entirety, and I would  have voted against it.   Both U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and U.S. Customs  and Border Patrol, CBP, have already benefited from increased funding  in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and, as we have seen, have used that  funding to ramp up their inhumane policies. Policies like ``metering'',  which forces migrants to wait in Mexico for weeks, sometimes months, in  order to enter the United States and claim their legal right to asylum.  We know that ``metering'' has resulted in the deaths of families  seeking refuge, like Oscar Alberto Martinez and his 23-month-old  Valeria just this week. Policies like the zero-tolerance policy, which  has separated thousands of children from their families and continues  to this day. These policies are unacceptable and do not reflect who we  are as Americans. Everyone should be outraged as what is happening at  the hand of this administration and DHS.   Just last week Donald Trump tweeted that he would begin ICE  deportation raids across the United States. At a time when the Trump  administration is claiming that it does not have enough money to deal  with the humanitarian crisis at the Southwest border, it is puzzling  how DHS has enough resources to conduct large-scale raids all across  the United States. How is there money for raids that would terrorize  communities yet not enough money for providing soap, blankets, and  toothbrushes for children in the government's custody?   Repeatedly, this administration has chosen to implement policies that  cost more and are less efficient in order to pursue its extreme  immigration agenda. If ICE and CBP are in need of extra funding, then  they should implement policies that save money, like further utilizing  alternatives to detention, ATDs. The government's own statistics  [[Page S4673]]  demonstrate that ATDs work and save money.   People are frightened, and they are returning to the shadows. It is  weakening the safety of our communities, and it is an affront to the  ideals of the United States. I will not support funding which further  endangers the lives of immigrants who have every right to remain in  this country and those fleeing violence and seeking shelter in our  country. Those of us in positions of power have an obligation to stand  up for all people and stand against abuses especially at the hands of  our government. Instead of rubberstamping additional funding, I will  continue to do this and hold this administration accountable. Thank  you.                            ____________________
