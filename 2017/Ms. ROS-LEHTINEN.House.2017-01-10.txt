 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th  anniversary of the founding of Friends of St. Jude--Miami.   St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, located in Memphis, Tennessee,  is a leading institution in the fight against pediatric cancer and  other diseases that harm children.   Friends of St. Jude--Miami is made up of young professionals in south  Florida, who, like my dear friend Wendy Grant, are dedicated to St.  Jude's lifesaving mission and who have continued to help the  organization to ensure that no family ever receives a bill for the  world-class care their son or daughter requires.   To Wendy and, indeed, all of the members of the Friends of St. Jude  in south Florida, thank you for the difference you continue to make in  the lives of children across our Nation and across the world.                            ____________________
