 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of my constituent, Deputy Michael Magli of the Pinellas County  Sheriff's Office.   On February 17, Michael Magli kissed his wife and children good-bye  for the last time as he embarked on what he likely believed to be a  routine shift.   Mr. Speaker, sadly, we know now that he would not make it back home  that particular night. He put his life on the line to take the hit from  a drunk driver and save those down the road who might have been in the  pathway of danger.   As Pinellas County Sheriff Paul Gualtieri so movingly put it at his  funeral, Michael was at the right place at the right time.   Deputy Magli leaves behind a loving wife, two beautiful children, and  the blue family as they struggle to make sense out of unimaginable  grief. While Michael's earthly end-of-watch was February 17, 2021, his  heavenly watch will endure forever.                            ____________________
