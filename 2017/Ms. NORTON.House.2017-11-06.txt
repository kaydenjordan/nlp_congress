 Mr. Speaker, mass deportation of Temporary Protected  Status recipients today would disrupt our country and theirs.   More than 32,000 Salvadorans live in the District of Columbia metro  area; and Salvadorans, at 200,000, are the largest group of TPS holders  in the country today.   TPS designation requires the Attorney General to find ``extraordinary  and temporary conditions preventing returning to the state in safety.''   The most recent influx of Salvadorans, one-third of them  unaccompanied minors, shows that these conditions have been met for TPS  holders and others. With the breakdown of civil society in Central  America today, forced return of anyone now would be inhumane.                            ____________________
