 Madam Speaker, I am joined by over 80 of  my Democratic colleagues to say the quiet part out loud: MAGA  Republicans want us to default. They want to run out the clock. They  want to lead our government by chaos.   By sending us home, by refusing to do their jobs, they are making  that crystal clear.   Unless we give in to devastating cuts, they will push us into a  devastating default.   It is the American people who will suffer--teachers, seniors, kids,  families, veterans, the hungry, and the sick.   To my Republican colleagues this Memorial Day weekend: It is time to  be a patriot. Now is the time to sign our discharge petition and end  this catastrophe in the making.                            ____________________
