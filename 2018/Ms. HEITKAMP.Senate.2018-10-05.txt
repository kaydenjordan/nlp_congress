 Mr. President, I want to congratulate the  students, faculty, and parents of Central Valley School, located in  Buxton, North Dakota, on being awarded the 2018 National Blue Ribbon  School Award.   Founded in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes  public and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students  perform at very high levels or where significant improvements are being  made in students' academic achievement. A National Blue Ribbon Schools  flag overhead has become a mark of excellence in education recognized  by everyone from parents to policymakers in thousands of communities.  Since the program's founding, the U.S. Department of Education has  bestowed this coveted award to more than 8,500 of America's best  schools.   Central Valley School serves roughly 196 students and was one of  three schools in North Dakota to receive the honor of Exemplary High  Performing School in 2018. Receiving recognition as a National Blue  Ribbon School signifies the hard work and dedication of the educators,  students and parents involved, and I have no doubt the students at  Central Valley School are on a path to success. At Central Valley  School, teachers focus on each individual student using their multi- tiered system of support. This personalized teaching can consist of  one-on-one with students to focused instructional help from a web-based  program. The faculty meets eight times a year to assess what certain  students might need to be successful. Central Valley's innovative  commitment to developing student potential has resulted in high student  outcomes for which we can all be proud.   Central Valley School holds true to its motto, ``A Commitment to  Educational Excellence for Students, Staff, and Community: Achievement;  Enhancement; Involvement,'' by constantly looking at the needs of each  individual student. I wish the very best to the community of Buxton and  congratulations to all engaged at Central Valley School for achieving  this high honor. Thank you for your commitment to our children and  leaders of tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to congratulate the  students, faculty, and parents of Freedom Elementary School, located in  West Fargo, ND, on being awarded the 2018 National Blue Ribbon School  Award.   Founded in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes  public and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students  perform at very high levels or where significant improvements are being  made in students' academic achievement.

To effectively bolster reading and writing skills,  the school utilizes Sails Literacy which immerses students in oral,  written, and visual language. The ability to personalize each student's  learning plan helps ensure they are performing to the best of their  abilities. Additionally, the school receives constant feedback from  teachers on the Sails Literacy program, which allows for the program to  be molded to fit new classes. The faculty, staff, and community of  Abercrombie are leading the way on literary education in North Dakota,  and this innovation serves as a model that all schools can look towards  when finding new ways to promote student growth and development.
