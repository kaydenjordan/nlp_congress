 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 111, the  Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act.   S. 111 would require each agency, in providing notice of a  rulemaking, to include a link to a 100-word plain language summary of  the proposed rule, to be made available on the website regulations.gov.   Our job here is public service--not for our benefit, but the  enrichment of our communities, state, and Nation.   The bills we pass here directly affect the lives of everyday  Americans.   Therefore, the public must be able to access and provide their input  regarding rules.   For those who may not be experts in the subject matter of the rule,  S. 111 provides that a plain-language summary of 100 words or less be  made available by agencies at regulations.gov.   Having this clear and simplistic summary will give members of the  public the opportunity to provide specific and useful comments to those  of us who serve them.   Plain language makes it easier for the public to read, understand,  and use government communications.   As a result, Americans understand documents more quickly, call less  often for explanations, and make fewer errors filling out forms.   All in all, Americans comply more accurately and quickly with  requirements when written in plain language.   Ultimately, this helps improve government transparency and empower  greater participation in the democratic process.   Through plain language, Americans are broadly better able to  understand their options and the policies their government is pursuing.   Simply put, Americans are better able to participate in the debate  once they understand their choices.   In addition, the Congressional Budget Office expects that preparing  this short summary of proposed rules would not significantly increase  agencies' administrative costs.   Further, this remains true when the costs of implementation are  assessed over a five year period, with the Congressional Budget Office  estimating no significant costs accruing through implementation of this  policy from 2023 through 2028.   In fact, such a measure is likely to save federal government dollars  in the long run.   Because Americans understand more immediately, file documents with  greater accuracy, and have less need to seek explanations from  bureaucrats, plain language saves government employees time and allows  them to work more effectively and efficiently.   Multiple studies have shown that plain language improves bottom lines  by saving time, personnel resources, and money, all while providing  better service to Americans.   I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense measure that  improves transparency, accessibility of information, and the ability of  Americans to thoughtfully participate in the democratic process.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1418, the  ``Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023'', or  ADUFA and AGDUFA, which will enable the U.S. to lead the world in  innovation and drug development for animal pharmaceuticals.   The Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendment or AGDUFA  was designed to enhance the performance of the generic new animal drug  review process and enable the FDA to more efficiently ensure that  generic new animal drug products are safe and effective.   AGDUFA was originally signed into law in 2008 and reauthorized in  2013 and 2018.   This bill reauthorizes the FDA to collect user fees for certain  abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, generic new  animal drug products and from certain sponsors of abbreviated  applications for generic new animal drugs and investigational  submissions for generic new animal drugs.   Specifically, this bill ensures that the Center for Veterinary  Medicine can continue to meet the needs of the animal drug industry as  it evolves.   This bipartisan bill will lead to increased transparency, additional  pathways for animal drug approvals, and reduced review times for  pioneer and generic drug applications while maintaining high standards  for safety and efficacy.   Veterinarians have far fewer FDA-approved animal drugs compared to  the number of FDA-approved human drugs.   My district in Houston is home to hundreds of veterinarians working  hard to improve the health of animals.   In fact, Houston ranks fourth among metro areas for dog ownership and  was named the ``Dog Capital of the World'' in a 2022 study conducted by  Protect Our Paws.   Protect Our Paws found that Houston had the highest dog-toperson  ratio in the world with 52.1 dogs per 100 humans.   More broadly, with Texas being No. 4 in pet ownership and over 58  percent of households owning at least one pet, we have thousands ot  pets and animals to protect.   I have a vested interest in moving these reauthorizations forward  because they are critical to animal and human health and well-being.   FDA continues to make progress to mitigate the growth of  antimicrobial resistance in food-producing animals, including ending  over-the-counter access to medically important antibiotics which are  used in both humans and animals, but more needs to be done.   I remain fully committed to moving the Animal Drug and Animal Generic  Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023 through a swift reauthorization before  the programs expire on September 30th.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 1418,  the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 813,  the Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2023.   This bill will direct the Secretary of Commerce to conduct an  interagency review of and report to Congress on ways to increase the  global competitiveness of the United States in attracting foreign  direct investment.   The report will look at the economic impact of foreign direct  investments in the United States, focusing on manufacturing, services,  trade, and jobs in the United States.   This will allow Congress to better understand trends and challenges  in global cross-border investments, as well as collaborate with other  trusted partner countries.   Specifically, this bill will attract foreign direct investment from  responsible private-sector entities, which is directly linked to the  long-term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and security of  the United States.   It will promote polices to ensure that United States remains the  global leader in developing and deploying cutting-edge technologies,  such as self-driving vehicle technology and artificial intelligence.   As digital information becomes increasingly important to the United  States economy and the development of new technologies and services  that will be crucial to the country's competitiveness in the 21st  century global economy, barriers including data localization and  infringement of intellectual property rights must be further addressed.   This study will focus on the economic impact of foreign direct  investment, challenges associated with foreign direct investment by  state-owned enterprises, and the influence of protectionist policies  enacted by other countries on the advanced technology economy.   Further, this bill will allow us to reduce our supply-chain  dependence on China.   For the success of our larger economy, national security, and global  relationships, it is vital that we pass H.R. 813.    Mr. Speaker, I thank both the gentleman from  Illinois and the gentlewoman from Florida for their consistent and  determined presence to bring to the American people truth and, of  course, inspiration. I thank them both for their great leadership. I  also thank Mr. Horsford, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus,  for his leadership.   I think we are noted around the Nation and around the world for this  outstanding presentation of great information every single week that  enlightens people's minds and hearts.   Let me take just a moment to honor the Reverend Dr. Jesse Jackson,  who this past weekend made a stupendous effort, as he always does, with  Rainbow PUSH Coalition for its outstanding national convention, the  many people who have come over the years.   This will not be a moment that I will take to completely pay tribute  to Reverend Jackson, but I could not come to the floor without  expressing my deep and abiding admiration for him. I have always said  that Reverend Jackson, when no one else would be there to comfort those  who are deprived, depressed, and simply outraged because of  discrimination in this Nation, it would be the Reverend Dr. Jesse Louis  Jackson who would be present and would be in the most difficult of  situations. It is amazing that for decades he has consistently been  doing this, over 50 years, being the first African American to run for  President.   Frankly, I will say that I am in public service because of Reverend  Jesse Louis Jackson. My first run was in 1984. I would not have won way  down in Houston, Texas, had it not been for the unbelievable, positive  uprising of voters who were moved and energized, rushing to the polls,  excited.   For those of us who happened to be on the ballot for the first time,  a young African-American woman seeking to be a judge in the county of  Harris, I could not have made those steps without the unbelievable  leadership and courage of not only Reverend Jackson but his wife and  his family because they were doing it together.   Let me again express my appreciation. I know it was a stupendous  conference, and I know that he has selected and given the anchor to a  great leader. It is a great leader who can make choices of greatness,  and he has done so.   I will very quickly touch on gun violence prevention and public  safety. Excuse my raspy voice, and I will not take long, but I will  just say that--do we need to say it?--every day, 120 Americans are  killed with guns, and more than 32,000 people die from gun violence  annually, including 2,677 children under 18 years of age.   In our respective communities, we see toddlers being shot, 10-year- olds being shot, senior citizens being shot.   Let me, in particular, give credit to the Houston Police Department,  as they have worked very hard to bring down homicides, investigate  homicides, and the numbers have gone down. However, it is very clear  that they are desperately in need of Federal action. They desperately  need the universal background check, which we have not been able to do.  They desperately need, in many instances, the ban on assault weapons.  They desperately need requirements for gun storage.   My bill, H.R. 52, the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act,  named in honor of Kimberly Vaughan, a student at Santa Fe High School,  who was just 17 years of age when a student entered her art class with  a stolen gun and killed 10 people--stolen from the home. These guns  were laid out and were owned by a family member. Firearm injury is the  leading cause of death, as I said, of children.   Is it difficult to require the manufacturer to say to store guns and  provide storage devices? Is it difficult for the retailer to provide  storage devices? Is it difficult to be able to say as a nation that we  believe in the Second Amendment, but life is so much more important?   When children as young as 9 and 10 are the victims of drive-by  shootings intended for someone else, but it doesn't matter--I am  reminded of children from Chicago to Houston who have been shot  innocently, shot in their beds, or a woman who was shot in her house as  the bullet whizzed close to her.   I am rising today to say that not only must we stop the gun violence,  but we must also draw together, as the Congressional Black Caucus has  done, to support funding for gun violence intervention. That is an  important piece. We must expand responsibility to ensure that we give  tools to the community to stop violence.                                time  2030    Workforce programs, as well, are very important. We must do it with  our cities and do it with our law enforcement. Now is the time to stop  gun violence in America and save lives.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I  must shed light on the growing public safety concern regarding gun  violence.   Every day, 120 Americans are killed with guns.   More than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including  2,677 children under 18 years of age.   And each year, hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives  to gun violence, having been shot to death while protecting their  communities.   Gun violence affects us all, but our government's continued lack of  proactivity towards preventing gun violence has led to countless  unnecessary, preventable deaths.   We cannot continue to allow countless lives to be lost to guns, when  we can instead work together to save them.   It is for this reason that I, once again, stand to advocate for my  bill, H.R. 52, the Kimberly Vaughn Firearm Safe Storage Act, named in  honor of Kimberly Vaughn, a student of Sante Fe High School, who was  just 17 years of age when a student entered her art class with a stolen  gun and killed 10 people.   Firearm injury is the leading cause of death for children and young  adults in the United States.   American children are twice as likely to be shot and killed as they  are to die drowning. And still, there are more safety regulations for  pools than gun storage.   An estimated 4.6 million minors live in homes with at least one  unlocked, loaded firearm.   One in three U.S. households with children have firearms, and  firearms accounted for nearly 19 percent of childhood deaths in 2021,  which is a 50 percent increase since 2019.   My Bill, H.R. 52, establishes best practices for safe firearm storage  to protect Americans, especially children, from improperly stored or  misused firearms, to ensure that tragic deaths, such as the one of  Kimberly Vaughn, do not happen again.   H.R. 52 will require labeling for weapons that says ``Safe Storage  Saves Lives'' to spread awareness of the importance of storage to those  that purchase firearms.   My bill will also provide grants and tax incentives to incentivize  safe-storage devices to those that purchase weapons.   Gun storage will save countless lives by ensuring that weapons do not  end up in the hands of the young.   We must work together to secure firearms and protect children, by  passing legislation such as H.R. 52 to help prevent unintentional  shootings and ensure that tragic stories such as Kimberly Vaughan never  happen again.   Furthermore, despite affecting all communities, gun violence affects  all communities differently, with a disproportionate effect on Black  communities.   Black Americans are 10 times more likely than white Americans to die  by gun homicide.   Black Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to  be fatally shot by police.   And while Black Americans made up 12.5 percent of the United States  population in 2020, they were the victims in 61 percent of all gun  homicides.   According to the American Progress, ``this is due to a combination of  weak gun laws; systemic racial inequities, including unequal access to  safe housing and adequate educational and employment opportunities; and  a history of disinvestment in public infrastructure and services in the  communities of color most affected by gun violence.''   Black Americans are disproportionately impacted by gun violence and  experience gun homicide at 10 times the rate of white Americans.   Nonfatal shootings, most of our nation's gun violence, impacts Black  Americans at an even higher rate.   They experience gun assault injuries at 18 times the rate of White  Americans.   Despite not directly causing these horrific events, our government  shares in the blame.   Our role as executives in municipal government is to ensure we  utilize every tool available to us and those provided by the state and  federal government to keep our cities safe.   We need to reimagine public safety by holding law enforcement  officers who violate the public trust accountable, using public health  [[Page H3637]]  resources to address mental health crises, and ensuring all communities  are not overpoliced, well-resourced with access to job opportunities,  affordable childcare, and capable social services to improve the  quality of life.   We need to increase the use of civilian responders deployed to  incidents involving mental health concerns and disturbances or  disputes.   We need to strengthen governmental agencies dedicated to violence  intervention and neighborhood safety.   We need to pass legislation, such as H.R. 48, the Gun Violence  Reduction Resources Act of 2023, which will work to hire additional  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive agents and  investigators to enforce gun laws.   We need to pass legislation such as H.R. 46, the Mental Health Access  and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which will authorize funding to  increase access to mental health care treatment to reduce gun violence.  Being that:   Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America;   more than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result  of individuals using these weapons to commit suicide;   approximately 1 in 4 American adults have a mental illness and nearly  half of all adults in America will develop at least one mental illness  during their lifetime; and   less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health  problems receive the treatment they need.   Gun violence is a nonpartisan issue with bipartisan solutions.   We act as though as hands are tied behind our back, despite the  countless options at our disposal.   I join my CBC colleagues in advancing their bills that work to  prevent gun violence.   Protecting our communities and protecting our family's need to be a  priority.
