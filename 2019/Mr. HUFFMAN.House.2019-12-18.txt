 Madam Speaker, as we take this solemn, necessary step of  impeaching President Trump, my Republican colleagues have made up their  minds. We can't persuade them to do the right thing, so I will address  my remarks to the future.   Today's vote will be judged by future generations, including my  precious children, Abby and Nathan--maybe grandkids.   Historians will study what Members of this Congress did when our  democracy was tested like never before by a President who put personal  interests above country, who compromised national security to cheat his  way to reelection and, when caught, not only lied and refused to admit  wrongdoing, but flouted Congress' authority. He even called the  constitutional impeachment mechanism unconstitutional.   Historians will marvel how some Members of Congress continued to  stand by this man; how they put blind, partisan loyalty or fear of  Donald Trump above their duty to defend the Constitution; how they made  absurd partisan arguments and tried to obstruct these proceedings; and  how, instead of pushing back when their party fell under the dark spell  of authoritarianism, they embraced it as if the Constitution, the rule  of law, and our oath of office mean nothing.   Madam Speaker, for our future generations, our children, the judgment  of history, let me be clear: I stand with our Constitution, with the  rule of law and our democracy. I will be voting ``yes'' to impeach  Donald J. Trump.
