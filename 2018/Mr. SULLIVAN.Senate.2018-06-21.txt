 Madam President, it is Thursday, and it is one of the  best times of the week for me. I know the Parliamentarians and others  who work in the Senate know, and now the pages are going to learn this,  too, because it is the time every week when I get to talk about what I  call the Alaskan of the Week. I am referring to someone who has made a  difference in my State, someone who is doing a great job, and someone  who is oftentimes an unsung hero and doesn't get a lot of attention but  deserves it. That is what I do here.   As I like to say, Alaska is a very beautiful State. I think it is the  most beautiful State in the country, probably the most beautiful place  in the world. Now summer has arrived, and the Sun hardly ever sets. The  fish are running. The air is drenched in the energy of summer, so now  is the time to visit. Everybody who is watching or watching on TV, you  have to come visit. The Presiding Officer came a couple summers ago. We  had a great time. Her father was out there during World War II, which  was a great honor. So you will have the trip of a lifetime.    By the way, you will also have the best food in the world.  Interestingly enough, in the Senate on Thursdays, one Senator typically  hosts a lunch. Today, I am hosting. I think my colleagues will like  this. You can almost smell the aroma. Right now, we are making it in  the kitchen here--salmon, halibut, reindeer sausage. We are all going  to be treated to that in a little bit.   What is truly amazing about my State is the people who call it home-- smart, creative, energetic, caring people, folks helping each other.   Today, I want to talk about our Alaskan of the Week, Mr. Greg Brown.  He comes at the suggestion of quite a few members of my staff, who call  him Mr. Brown. The lobbying campaign in my office for Mr. Brown to be  the Alaskan of the Week has been intense.   Mr. Brown, as he is known far and wide among those who went to  Anchorage's Dimond High School, is a legend among his former students  at Dimond, where for 25 years he taught European and U.S. history, art  history, philosophy, and student government.   Many of us are fortunate enough to have had that teacher or person-- usually, it is a teacher--who really changed our lives and showed us  the pure joy of learning; as my director of constituent relations,  Rachel Bylsma, put it, that person ``that made history come alive,''  that person who made an ``indelible impact'' on someone's life or many  lives. For Rachel, Andrew--one of my interns, who is here with me on  the floor--and five members of my staff in DC and back home in Alaska,  that person is Mr. Brown. So let's talk a little bit about Mr. Brown.   Originally from Texas, when he was 15 years old, his family moved to  Alaska when his father, who was in the oil business, got transferred to  Alaska. A lot of Texans up in Alaska fall in love with it, as he did.  He moved back to Texas as a teenager, but Alaska stilled beckoned, and  it was never really out of his mind, so in 1989, when his father moved  back again, he went back--now with a master's degree and a few years of  teaching--and he never left. He was a substitute teacher for a while  and in 1993 got a full-time position at Dimond High, where he has  stayed, learned, taught, and where he has inspired thousands of  students--think about it: 25 years.   What makes a good teacher? According to Mr. Brown, it is vital that  you, the teacher, fall in love with the subject and also, just as  importantly, that  [[Page S4319]]  you listen sympathetically, and you should know how to reach your  students. Sometimes that is through books, Mr. Brown said, and  sometimes the most important thing you can do is just play a game of  chess with a student. I think that is what Andrew and Mr. Brown did.  According to his students, Mr. Brown did these kinds of things.   Mr. Brown was a demanding and exacting teacher. The papers they wrote  for him were graded hard--graduate school-quality. He demanded  excellence, which is another great attribute of a teacher. Because of  his passion for the subjects he taught and the way he treated the  students--he treated them like adults who were ready to learn and  deliver--he made a huge impact. And learn they did. They read the  classics--John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Socrates, Plato, Machiavelli,  Marx. Martin Luther, Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, and on and on. They  learned about the profound impact the Reformation had on Europe. They  learned about the ramifications of governmental authority. They learned  about how art can be a language that reflects the present. They learned  about how alliances are formed, how leaders are born, and how the  clashing of events can lead to devastating wars and world-altering  peace treaties. They learned about the roots of all different forms of  government. They learned to love--or at least appreciate and  understand--our own government and the importance of institutions like  the U.S. Senate.   This year was Mr. Brown's last year as a teacher. He is,  unfortunately, retiring. He bought a plot of land in Willow, AK, the  part of the Alaska we call the Mat-Su Valley. He is going to garden, he  is going to fish, he is going to read, and he is going to travel, but  he is still going to be with us, and he can do that in part because of  a gift he received from his students at his retirement party.   This is quite unusual. This party, which was thrown for him by his  students at his retirement, was quite amazing. Hundreds of his past  students showed up to pay tribute to Mr. Brown. Some of them gave  speeches. Many of them cried. At the end, they handed him a picture  that one of his students painted. It was a reinterpretation of the  School of Athens by the 16th-century artist Raphael, but it substituted  Mr. Brown for Plato in that very famous painting.   Then something really amazing happened at that party. The students  also handed Mr. Brown a voucher. They had individually raised $16,500  for him to travel the world. Think about that. Motivated and inspired  students, over 25 years, came together, threw a party, and raised money  for their beloved teacher just to show him their deep admiration and  abiding appreciation. That is very special for a special teacher.   What was his reaction to the gift? Mr. Brown said:         I wanted to go somewhere and gently weep. My students have       always given me more than I have given them.    Now, Mr. Brown, I am not sure that is true. You have given so much.  In fact, at the party, one of my staffers--I already mentioned Rachel-- in her speech about Mr. Brown said, ``Each student you taught . . .  carries a piece of the precious gift you gave, learning the contours of  history and the trends that have defined the course of humankind.''  Powerful stuff.   So, Mr. Brown, thank you for all you have done for our young people,  for our State--really, for the country--producing great Alaskans with a  sense of civic duty and history. Thank you for being such a great  teacher--and we have so many in our great State--and thank you, on your  retirement, for being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Andrew  Hampton, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the day.
