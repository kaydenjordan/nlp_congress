 Mr. President, I would like to call attention to the  estimated 5 million Americans suffering from gastroparesis in  observance of National Gastroparesis Awareness Month in August.   Gastroparesis is a chronic digestive disease in which the stomach  cannot empty properly in the absence of any observable blockage.  Symptoms of gastroparesis, which include nausea, vomiting, and the  inability to finish a normal-sized meal, can lead to malnutrition,  severe dehydration, and difficulty managing blood glucose levels. This  debilitating and sometimes life-threatening disease can affect people  of all ages, but it is four times more likely to affect women than men.   While there is no cure for gastroparesis, some treatments, such as  dietary measures, medications, procedures to maintain nutrition, and  surgery, can help reduce symptoms. Unfortunately, gastroparesis is a  poorly understood condition. Patients often suffer from delayed  diagnosis, treatment, and management of this disorder. As such, further  research and education are needed to improve quality of life for the  millions of Americans, including thousands of Wisconsinites who suffer  from this disease.   I want to recognize the important efforts of the International  Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, IFFGD, an  international organization based in my home State of  [[Page S5912]]  Wisconsin, as well as other patient organizations, in providing  education and support to help those affected by gastroparesis.   In an effort to improve our understanding and awareness of  gastroparesis, I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in recognizing  August as National Gastroparesis Awareness Month.   Thank you.                            ____________________
