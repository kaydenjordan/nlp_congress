 Madam President, my friend from Utah would be happy to  know not everybody in the Democratic caucus thinks this is a great  victory for President Biden. In fact, the original debt ceiling  legislation that Republicans passed in the House would have, over a 10- year period, made unconscionable cuts to programs that working  families, that children, the sick, the elderly, and the poor  desperately need. It is a totally unconscionable piece of legislation  passed by the Republican House.   And the best thing that I can say or that I think can be said about  the current deal on the debt ceiling is that it could have been much  worse. Instead of making massive cuts to healthcare, education,  childcare, nutrition assistance, and other vital programs that low- income and working-class families depend upon over the next decade,  this bill proposes to make modest cuts to these programs over a 2-year  period.   This bill will also prevent an economic catastrophe by extending the  debt ceiling until January 1, 2025, when, by the way, we will have to  go through this absurd process once again.   Having said that--having said and made clear that what we have before  us is far, far better than what emanated in the Republican House, I  have to make clear that I cannot vote for this bill.   At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, at a time when the  people on top have never had it so good while the middle class shrinks  and millions of working-class families live in desperation, I cannot,  in good conscience, vote for a bill that takes vital nutrition  assistance away from women, infants, children, and seniors while  refusing to ask billionaires to start paying their fair share of taxes.   So, again, not as bad by any means as the bill passed in the House,  this bill will cut nutrition programs for kids and the elderly; and,  yet, the billionaires continue to laugh all the way to the bank. They  don't have to pay a nickel more in taxes. I cannot, in good conscience,  vote for a bill that makes it harder for working families to afford the  outrageously high price of childcare, housing, and healthcare while  making it easier for the wealthiest people and most profitable  corporations in America to cheat on their taxes.    It is no great secret that the people on top and the large  corporations with all their lawyers and accountants know how to avoid  their fair share of taxes.   Last year, we took a step forward to put money into the IRS to  address that. This bill makes cuts in that effort.   At a time when climate change is, by far, the most existential threat  that this country has perhaps--and this world have ever faced, I  cannot, in good conscience, vote for a bill that makes it easier for  fossil fuel companies to pollute and destroy the planet by fast- tracking the disastrous Mountain Valley Pipeline. When the future of  the world and the lives of our kids and grandchildren is literally at  stake, we must have the courage to stand up to the fossil fuel industry  and tell them and the politicians they sponsor that the future of this  planet is more important than their short-term profits.   At a time when we spend more on the military than the next 10 nations  combined, I cannot, in good conscience,  [[Page S1823]]  vote for a bill that increases funding for the bloated Pentagon and  large defense contractors who continue to make huge profits by fleecing  American taxpayers with impunity. Let me remind my colleagues that the  Pentagon, which now gets over $800 billion a year--a year--is the only  Federal Agency that cannot pass an independent audit or account for  trillions of dollars in spending.   At a time when the pharmaceutical industry is charging the American  people, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,  I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a bill that does nothing to take  on the greed of the big drug companies that are bankrupting Medicare  and cancer patients while spending tens of billions on stock buybacks  and dividends. If the United States paid the same price for  prescription drugs as paid in Europe, we could cut Medicare spending by  approximately $1 trillion over 10 years. But, apparently, we don't have  quite the courage to take on the powerful pharmaceutical industry. It  is easier to take on children and the elderly.   At a time when over 45 million Americans are drowning in student  debt, I cannot, in good conscience, vote for a bill that eliminates the  moratorium on student loan payments that has been a lifeline to  millions of working-class families during the pandemic.   Deficit reduction cannot just be about cutting programs that working  families, that children, the sick, the elderly, and the poor depend  upon. They are the easy targets. You see, they don't have any lobbyists  here. They don't make big campaign contributions. They don't wine and  dine Members of the House and Senate. They are an easy target. We can  cut programs that working-class and low-income people depend upon.   But when it comes to demanding that the billionaire class and  profitable corporations start paying their fair share of taxes, when it  comes to reining in out-of-control military spending and taking on the  very powerful military industrial complex, when it comes to reducing  the price of prescription drugs and taking on the pharmaceutical  industry, and when it comes to ending billions of dollars in corporate  welfare that goes to the fossil fuel industry and other corporate  interests, well, that is another story. That is not something we are  comfortable in doing. They are too powerful; make too many campaign  contributions; have too many lobbyists. It is easy to go after the weak  and the vulnerable.   The fact of the matter is that, in my judgment, this bill is totally  unnecessary. The President of the United States has the authority and  the ability to eliminate the debt ceiling today by invoking the 14th  Amendment. I look forward to the day when he exercises that authority  and puts an end, once and for all, to the outrageous actions of the  extreme rightwing to hold our entire economy hostage in order to get  what they want.                                 H.J. Res. 45    Madam President, I would like to say a few words on another subject,  and that is the effort here on the part of some of my Republican  colleagues to repeal President Biden's student debt plan.   I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 45 that we will be voting on  tomorrow. This resolution would repeal President Biden's plan to  provide up to $20,000 in student debt relief to over 40 million  Americans who desperately need that relief.   Almost 90 percent of this student debt relief would go to Americans  who make less than $75,000 a year. So anytime you hear Republicans say  this is going to the wealthy, that ain't the case. Ninety percent of  student debt relief goes to Americans who earn less than $75,000 a  year. These are working-class people who are struggling to pay the  rent--rents which are, in many cases, skyrocketing. They are struggling  to pay for groceries. They are struggling to pay for the basic  necessities of life. And they desperately need this relief.   Despite what our Republican colleagues have told us, President  Biden's student debt relief plan does not benefit the wealthy. In fact,  the top 5 percent of American households would not see a nickel in  benefits under Biden's student debt relief plan--not one nickel.   And let us be clear. Not only would this resolution that we vote upon  tomorrow deny up to $20,000 in student debt relief to over 40 million  Americans, it would retroactively overturn the moratorium in student  loan payments during the pandemic.   What does that mean? It means that tens of millions of Americans  would be forced to pay back thousands of dollars in student loans and  interest that were paused during the pandemic.   This is a program that started under President Trump and was  continued under President Biden. Further, this resolution would  retroactively claw back student debt that was previously canceled for  more than 260,000 teachers, nurses, veterans, firefighters, librarians,  and other public servants who successfully completed 10 years of public  service. That would be absolutely unacceptable.   Over and over again, I have heard my Republican colleagues tell us  that the time has come for younger Americans to pay for their college  education just like they did 40 or 50 or 60 years ago. Well, I have got  news for my Republican colleagues.   Back in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, even 1980s, the cost of a college  education, housing, healthcare, childcare, and the basic necessities of  life were a heck of a lot cheaper then than they are today.   When I was a young man, I attended Brooklyn College in 1959. Do you  know how much I paid for tuition during that 1 year? Zero, at a very  good college. And that was not unusual. The reality is that back then,  tuition at many of our Nation's public colleges and universities was  either free or virtually free. Young people don't know that, but that  is, in fact, the case.   The University of California system, the largest public college  system in the country, considered to be the crown jewel of public  higher education in America, did not begin charging tuition until the  1980s.   In 1970, the average tuition at a four-year public university in  America was just $814 a year. Today, it costs more than $9,300 a year.  And the total cost of attending a public college or university in  America--including room and board--is over $25,000.   In 1978, a student could get a minimum wage job in the summer and  fully pay for a year of tuition at virtually any public college or  university in America. Today, the only way that millions of working- class Americans can get a college education is to take out student  loans with very high interest rates and graduate with tens and tens of  thousands of dollars in debt. And if you go to graduate school, we are  talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Talk to medical  students who will tell you they are going to graduate $4- or $500,000  in debt.   But it is not just the price of a college education that has soared.  In 1970, the median cost of a home was $188,000 in real inflation- adjusted dollars. Today, it costs $497,000. And that is why many young  people today are unable to afford to buy the kind of home that their  parents were able to purchase.   In 1970, the average monthly rent was $805 in real dollars. Today, it  costs nearly $2,000 a month. Over 40 years ago, a Federal Pell grant  paid for over 80 percent of tuition, fees, room and board at a four- year public college. The Pell grant paid 80 percent. But today, because  of massive cutbacks in education, Pell grants cover less than a third  of those expenses.   Add all of that up and you understand why more than 45 million  Americans are drowning in over $1.7 trillion in student debt.   So when my Republican colleagues in their sixties, seventies, and  eighties lecture young people about the need to pay off their student  debt, to get out of their parents' basement and to buy a home, just the  way it used to be, I am afraid that they are way out of touch with the  economic reality that so many young people are forced to live in today.   Further, my Republican colleagues want you to believe that it is just  too expensive and too unfair to provide up to $20,000 in debt relief to  a Pell grant recipient with an income of less than $60,000 a year--just  too much. Can't afford it. We have big national debt; how can we  possibly pay for it?   Well, actually, that is a pretty funny argument, given where many of  my Republican colleagues are coming from. I remember not so long ago  that my Republican colleagues had no problem  [[Page S1824]]  voting to give away over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1  percent and large corporations when Donald Trump was President--without  paying for it. No concern about the national debt back then when it  comes to tax breaks for the very wealthiest people and largest  corporations.   My Republican colleagues had no problem voting for a $700 billion  bailout for Wall Street when George W. Bush was President--without  paying for it. Hey, we have to bail out the crooks on Wall Street. Not  a problem; don't worry about the deficit; we have to do it.   My Republican colleagues had no problem with voting for an $858  billion budget for the Pentagon this year, despite the fact that the  Department of Defense is the only Federal Agency in America that cannot  pass an independent audit and cannot account for trillions of dollars  in spending. Don't worry about the deficit; don't worry about the  national debt. Can't afford to help young people struggling with their  student debt. Can't do that. But we can pump all kinds of money into  the military, an institution which is wasting huge amounts of money and  has not been able to do an independent audit.   But now, my Republican colleagues want you to believe--after giving  huge tax breaks to the rich and large corporations and spending  unbelievable amounts of money on the military, they want you to believe  that we cannot afford to provide $20,000 in student debt relief to a  Pell grant recipient who is struggling to put a roof over his or her  head, pay for childcare, or put food on the table.   Let me be as clear as I can be: If we can afford to provide trillions  of dollars in tax breaks and corporate welfare to the wealthy and  powerful, we can and we must cancel student debt. If we can afford to  provide a $1.4 billion tax break to the Koch family--Charles Koch  family, one of the wealthiest families in America, worth $120 billion-- we can afford to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for a struggling,  working-class college graduate.    And my understanding is that within a few weeks after all the  discussion about the national debt and how we are going to deal with  that, my Republican colleagues in the House are going to come up with  another bill to give even more tax breaks to the people on top.   If Donald Trump could take Executive action to pause student debt  payments when he was in office, please don't tell me that President  Biden cannot take the same action to cancel student debt for working  families who desperately need it.   Let's be clear: Canceling student debt is the right thing to do, not  only from a moral and economic perspective, it is precisely what the  American people want us to do.   According to a recent Fox News poll, 62 percent of the American  people support canceling at least $20,000 in student debt for  individuals making $125,000 a year or less. The American people  understand that we cannot continue to crush our young generation with a  mountain of debt for doing the right thing--getting a college  education. A vote for this resolution would deny relief to over 40  million Americans across every State and every Congressional district.   A vote for this resolution would reinstate tens of billions of  dollars in interest charges and loans that have already been canceled  for teachers, firefighters, and other public service workers throughout  America. We cannot allow that to happen. I urge my colleagues to vote  against this resolution.   I yield the floor.   THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.                            ____________________
