 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Cheryl Dozier, who will be retiring as president of Savannah State  University on July 31.   Dr. Dozier served for 8 years as the 13th president of Savannah  State, a historically Black university located in the First  Congressional District of Georgia. Because of her work, the university  has made a number of exceptional improvements in different areas.   Dr. Dozier reactivated the honors program, with more than 70 students  participating. She established a college of education offering a  bachelor of science in education, created a scholarship to help  students who needed emergency financial support in their last semester,  and opened two new STEM buildings.   Thank you, Dr. Dozier, for your work educating students in coastal  Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I wish Savannah State University the best of luck in  finding their next president.                            ____________________
