 Mr. President, as you know, late last year, Congress  passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I supported this legislation  because of its potential to spur investment, stimulate economic growth,  and ease the tax burden on millions of small businesses. While our  economy continues to grow, small businesses often don't receive due  attention for their accomplishments and contributions. Owners and  employees of small businesses nationwide continuously display resilient  attitudes and a tenacious work ethic, proving that the American  entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well. This law gives Americans the  tools they need to grow and flourish, and their success stories  encouraged me to begin this series of speeches highlighting the ways  tax reform benefits small businesses.   Today, I am pleased to share the story of Centennial Bolt, INC,  located in Denver, CO. Founded in 1979 by Mark Cordova, Centennial Bolt  specializes in manufacturing top-of-the-line fasteners. The Cordova  family story serves as an inspirational example for hardworking  American families. From humble beginnings, Mark's father, Moses, worked  his way to a managerial position at Triangle Steel, Inc., and started  his own business, Cordova Bolt, in San Diego, CA. After graduating from  the University of San Diego, Mark moved to Denver and followed in his  father's entrepreneurial footsteps by founding Centennial Bolt. This  business became the premier fastener company in the Rocky Mountain  region because of its ability to assist clients with projects of all  shapes and sizes. After years of hard work and perseverance through  tough economic times, Mark is now the CEO of both Cordova and  Centennial Bolt.   Tax reform's impact on Centennial Bolt and other small businesses  nationwide cannot be overstated. Changes in the tax law offer necessary  relief to both Centennial Bolt's employees and their families. Due to  an increase in savings from tax reform, Mark plans to expand his  workforce from 50 to 65 employees, while increasing employee salaries.  This past year, the company surprised all 50 of its employees with an  unexpected Christmas bonus for their hard work. In order to compete on  a larger scale, Mark also plans on reinvesting the company's savings  from tax reform into an additional facility and existing infrastructure  upgrades. Across the country, tax reform continues to provide owners  and entrepreneurs with increasing opportunities that help them and  their employees to realize their dreams.   Mark is optimistic about his company's future and believes the  benefits his company receives from tax reform will give Centennial Bolt  a competitive advantage. They are one of the many small businesses  nationwide that can now more freely raise salaries, hire new employees,  and compete with larger businesses in their industries. As tax reform  continues to drive our economy forward, I will continue to acknowledge  its positive impact on small businesses. I am proud to recognize  Centennial Bolt and all of the small businesses that are thriving as a  result of tax reform, and I look forward to watching the continued  growth of the American small business community.                            ____________________
