 Madam Speaker, it is with great excitement today that  I stand in strong support of the bill to establish the women's museum  in the Smithsonian chain of museums in our country.   I want to share a story with you, Madam Speaker. When I walked  through the doors of the Smithsonian African American Museum, someone  asked me: How do you feel?   I said, I feel like this country has finally recognized the  contributions and who I am in this country.   We have not been able to make that commitment to women. When we all  walk into museums in this great country, it is a reflection for the  generations to come of the struggles and the accomplishments that  different cultures and populations have had on this great country.   I stand here today because of the women before me who have struggled  and fought. I stand on their shoulders. I want to be a woman of whom  the girls behind me will be able to say: Because of her, I can be.   This is a vote for our children, the girls who are coming after, and  the little boys who need to learn and respect the history of women in  this great country.   I stand in support, and I ask all my colleagues to please support  this. This is a step that we, as women, must not let go of.   I want to recognize my colleague, Chairwoman Maloney, who has never  given up on this.   Madam Speaker, as women, we know we have to work twice as hard, but  we get the job done.   Vote on this museum.
