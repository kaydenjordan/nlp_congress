 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of John  David--he was known as ``JD''--Smith, a volunteer firefighter with the  Red Lion Fire Department.   JD passed away on Sunday due to injuries sustained during a  motorcycle accident.   JD officially joined the Department in June of 2016, though he was  involved in years prior as well. His sister, Megan, said, ``He was a  very dedicated firefighter. It was like his second home. He ran just  about every call he could without hesitation. He had a kind heart and  would help anyone who needed it. If you were sad, he was the first to  ask you what's wrong and if you need anything.''   Mr. Speaker, we appreciate JD's compassion and service to his  community. We recognize that those who volunteer with our local fire  companies are special, and their dedication to the protection of others  is admirable.   I ask that the community join me in keeping JD's family, friends, and  fellow firefighters at the Red Lion Fire Department in our prayers  during this difficult time.                                time  1045                          National Foster Care Month     Mr. Speaker, May was National Foster Care Month, and I  would like to recognize all of the loving and caring foster parents in  my district.   Nearly 670,000 young people have foster parents across this great  Nation, and it is in a loving home that they are able to grow and  thrive. Today, I would like to thank the foster parents, volunteers,  family members, social workers, child welfare professionals, and  countless others across the district that I represent who help them  find permanent homes and build strong foundations.   In particular, I would also like to recognize the work of two  outstanding nonprofit organizations in my district that do great work  in assisting foster children and families: Bethany Christian Services  and COBYS Family Services.   This is an issue we should all care deeply about. I was very proud  that my very first legislation to become law was bipartisan language,  cosponsored with Representative Terri Sewell, to help place foster  children in the home of family members.   When it comes to finding loving homes for children, there are no  Republicans or Democrats, just mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles,  and sons and daughters who believe that each child should have a bed to  be tucked into at night in a loving home. Our thanks are with those  foster parents who provide just that.                 Congratulating Warwick Girls Track and Field     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the State champions,  PIAA AAA Girls Track & Field champions, the Warwick Warriors. The  Warriors bested the competition last week, bringing home the school  district's fifth State championship. The team took home seven medals  from the State championship games.   ``Every time those girls were asked to do something, they did it,''  said Coach Alex Decker. ``They rose to every occasion, from the time  they were sophomores to now, and they are just unreal.''   Certainly, there is much to be proud of. The lessons that these young  women have learned together will stay with them throughout their lives.   When asked what she learned from graduating seniors on the team,  junior Meaghan Quinn said: ``No matter how many medals or how many  awards you get as a team, it always comes back to the people who you  are and the friendships that you've made along the way. . . . We can't  do it without each other.''   Mr. Speaker, the community is proud of the efforts of these young  women. We congratulate them on their tremendous success and continue to  wish them well in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this Thursday, June 6, will mark the 75th  anniversary of D-Day, and I rise today to honor the sacrifices and  efforts of those brave soldiers.   It is critical for us always to remember those who took part in the  invasion of Normandy on D-Day. Their efforts,  [[Page H4298]]  in the words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, brought about ``the  elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe and  security for ourselves in a free world.''   Mr. Speaker, over 160,000 soldiers, sailors, and airmen participated  in the invasion, which would precede the long and difficult battle  across Europe, ending in the full victory that Eisenhower asked of his  men on June 6, 1944.   Of the many brave soldiers from Pennsylvania's 11th District, perhaps  none is better known than Major Dick Winters, who was born in Lancaster  County and attended Franklin & Marshall College. Dick offered the world  his memories and the memories of his fellow soldiers in the book and  later HBO miniseries ``Band of Brothers.''   One day, Dick Winters was asked by his grandson, ``Grandpa, were you  a hero in the war?'' He said to him, ``No, I'm not a hero, but I have  served in a company full of them.''   Mr. Speaker, we offer thanks and unending gratitude for the heroes  who have served.                            ____________________
