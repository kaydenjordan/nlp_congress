 Mr. Speaker, July 20, 5 years ago, we had a terrible  tragedy in Colorado. Twelve young people were killed, 70 were injured,  and countless suffered emotional trauma.   Today I want to recognize these 12. Despite the tragedy we suffered  and the impact on our community, there were at least two bright spots:  the response of law enforcement, firefighters, ambulance drivers, and  medical personnel in dealing with what was a war zone.   Over the 5 years, the families have come together and become great  friends, recognizing and celebrating the lives of the people who were  taken by that crazed shooter.   I want to recognize them, I want to recognize the dedicated people  who assisted them, and just let everybody know that we won't forget.  Time goes on and the memories dim a little bit, but these were great  young people. Our first responders were wonderful.                            ____________________
