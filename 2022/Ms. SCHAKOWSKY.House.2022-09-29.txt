 Mr. Chairman, Americans are tired of monopolies that  saddle them with less choices and higher prices.   The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice must have  the resources that they need to aggressively combat anticompetitive  mergers.   This commonsense, bipartisan legislation that we are considering  today is absolutely needed right now in order to protect consumers. It  makes giant companies pay their fair share, improves transparency, and  streamlines litigation.   This should not be--and it isn't--a partisan piece of legislation. At  a hearing I was chairing as the chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer  Protection and Commerce, we had testimony last year from a Bush- appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission, Bill Kovacic, who  called for a tripling in the FTC budget. He recognized that this agency  should play a leading role in enforcing our laws that protect  consumers, workers, and innovation.   I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a very compelling statement made  by both Senator Klobuchar and Senator Durbin in favor of the  legislation.      (By Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Senator from Minnesota, Sept. 29, 2022)     Klobuchar, Durbin Issue Statement Urging House to Pass Bipartisan              Legislation to Strengthen Antitrust Enforcement         Washington.--U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chairwoman       of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition  [[Page H8260]]       Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, and Dick Durbin (D-      IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the       statement below urging the House of Representatives to pass--      H.R. 3843, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act.        ``The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act is the product of       years of bipartisan work in both the House and Senate to       improve the enforcement of our antitrust laws and protect       competition and consumers. This package of bills will update       merger filing fees and help ensure that the federal antitrust       agencies can be properly funded, that information on foreign       subsidies is made available to federal enforcers, and that       state antitrust enforcement can proceed more efficiently and       without needless delays. We call on all House Members to       support this important bipartisan legislation.''        The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act includes the House       companion to Klobuchar's merger filing fees reform bill with       Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Senator Durbin to help       ensure antitrust enforcers have sufficient resources to       protect consumers by updating merger filing fees and lowering       the burden on small and medium-sized businesses. It also       includes the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act,       Klobuchar's legislation with Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) to       empower state antitrust enforcement by allowing state       attorneys general litigating antitrust cases to remain in       their selected courts. H.R. 3843 has been endorsed by a       coalition of State Attorney Generals:     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record Mr.  Kovacic's testimony.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,    Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce   Safeguarding American Consumers: Fighting Frauds and Scams During the                                  Pandemic             Testimony of William E. Kovacic, February 4, 2021    Federal Trade Commission Budget and Compensation Levels for Employees         There is a grave mismatch between the duties Congress has       assigned the FTC and the resources it has given the agency to       carry out its mandate. There is a serious need to raise the       FTC's budget, but not simply to build a larger staff by       hiring more people. Reforms to the federal compensation       system are necessary to attract and retain a larger number of       elite personnel. I do not see how the FTC or many other       public agencies can recruit and retain necessary personnel       without a significant increase in the salaries paid to       managers and staff.        Consider two possibilities for compensation reform. The       first is to align FTC salaries with the highest scale paid to       the various US financial service regulators. One model would       be the compensation scale used to pay employees of the       banking regulatory agencies; the salary scale for these       bodies exceeds the General Schedule (GS) federal civil       service wage scale by roughly twenty percent. In adopting the       Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in       2010, Congress concluded that the importance of the mission       of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)       warranted higher salaries for the agency's personnel. If the       higher salary scale made sense for the CFPB, I see no good       reason why a more generous compensation schedule is not       appropriate for what is the nation's leading consumer       protection agency (and its leading federal data protection       authority.        A second, more ambitious alternative would be to triple the       FTC's existing budget of about $330 million per year and use       the increase mainly to raise salaries and partly to add more       employees. This experiment might be carried out for a decade       to test whether a major hike in pay would increase the       agency's ability to recruit the best talent, retain the       talent for a significant time, and apply that talent with       greater success in a program that involves prosecuting       numerous ambitious cases and devising other significant       policy initiatives.        A major increase in compensation, either by adopting the       CFPB model or trying our my more ambitious proposal, is a       crucial test of our national commitment to improve the       foundations for effective consumer protection enforcement.       The nation should spend what it takes to get the best       possible personnel to run the difficult cases (and carry out       other measures, such as the promulgation of trade regulation       rules) that will be the pillars of a new, expanded       enforcement program. Such steps will become even more       important if new political leadership seeks to close the       revolving door, which has operated as a mechanism to       encourage attorneys and economists to accept lower salaries       in federal service in the expectation of receiving much       higher compensation in the private sector at a later time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 466.
