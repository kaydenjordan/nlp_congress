 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding.   What a great tribute, to be naming this Coast Guard reauthorization  bill after Don Young. While we mourn his loss today and pay tribute to  Don in Statuary Hall, his family was here, and as you are paying  tribute to a great life, the dean of the House who served 49 years in  this great Chamber from the 49th State of Alaska, you can't  [[Page H3923]]  help but think of all the Don Young stories.   Clearly, there is a tie to this bill because Don served on the Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee for his entire tenure  that the committee was in existence. Don loved the Coast Guard, loved  the relationship they had in Alaska, just trying to get more  icebreakers so that we could keep up with Russians continuing to open  up their shipping lanes, but our not having the ability to get enough  Coast Guard cutters to break ice in Alaska.    Don Young was always a champion for Alaska. He was a great friend.  He was somebody who you knew where he stood all the time. And if you  stood in his way, he would make it clear that he was going to keep  moving forward.   As we look at the seat that Don Young always sat in, in a Chamber of  435 people where there are no reserved seats, everybody knows that is  where Don Young sat. When you look over there today, it is a little bit  sad, but you can only think of great memories of Don Young when you see  the black cloth draped over that seat.   We will always remember Don Young, a man who loved this country,  surely loved the Coast Guard, and epitomized what is the great State of  Alaska. No better champion they had in Congress than Don Young.   I look forward to passing this bill with overwhelming support.
