 Mr. Chairman, my colleagues have already done a good  job of talking in great detail about why this bill is really a festival  of bad choices, of wrong choices for America, but I want to focus on  one issue in particular: executive pay.   This ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act actually takes away provisions that rein in  irresponsible pay to executives, the very people who decide decisions  that get us into this entire mess in the first place.   Number one, this bill eliminates a rule barring incentive-based  executive pay that encourages ``inappropriate risks.'' It puts the  average American in danger of having to pay for another bank bailout.  Giving out bonuses for putting our national financial stability at risk  is flat wrong.   Number two, it eliminates a requirement for corporations to disclose  how their CEO's pay compares to the average employee's salary. This  bill eliminates transparency.   And number three, if you can believe it, this bill even abolishes a  rule requiring companies to disclose whether executives and board  directors are allowed to bet against their own stock. This bill takes  us back to the days of Enron.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this irresponsible  legislation.
