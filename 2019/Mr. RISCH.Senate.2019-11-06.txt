 Mr. President, I am reserving the right to object.   With all due respect to my good friend and colleague from New  Hampshire, we both served on the Foreign Relations Committee. The  Foreign Relations Committee is, as it has been noted, the committee of  jurisdiction on this matter. We are talking about the Paris climate  agreement. What Senator Shaheen is attempting to do with this--and,  again, with all due respect, I understand where she is coming from on  it--is to stop the President from withdrawing from the Paris climate  agreement that was made by his predecessor, President Obama.   Let me say, first of all, that the Senator is right that the changes  we are experiencing are great. They have large effects. They are of  great magnitude. Just as importantly, the changes we make attempting to  address this are going to have great magnitude. In a great magnitude,  they are going to affect the American people both financially and in  the quality of life and the lifestyle they enjoy.   We can't do anything about the changes that are occurring right now,  but what we can do is to do something about the way we attack this, the  way we make changes to our lifestyle and what we will give up and what  people are willing to give up in order to address this.   The way this is done is nations get together to talk about this--the  200 nations get together. They did, and they came up with the Paris  climate agreement. Under article II of the U.S. Constitution, section  2, the President is given the power to make treaties with other  countries, and that is what President Obama attempted to do with this.  However, section 2 goes on to say that the President can make these  treaties provided two-thirds of the Senate present concur. So that is a  treaty, and that is how ordinarily agreements are made between nations.   Obviously, we can do things ourselves without having a two-thirds  vote--with a 60-percent vote in the Senate and a simple majority vote  in the House. We can do that amongst ourselves if we want to change  U.S. law as to how we are going to change the way we do industry and  the way we lead our lives. We can do that with that kind of a vote. If  we are going to agree with other countries, on the other hand, it takes  a two-thirds vote.   Now, at the time this was negotiated, I disagreed with President  Obama, and I disagree with the accord at this time. The reason I do is  I really believe this is a bad deal for the people of the United  States. I really believe we can get a better deal. I think what we need  to do, if we are going to do that, is we need to do it on a bipartisan  basis. There is not going to be a two-thirds vote without a bipartisan  agreement on this issue.   I would like to see this addressed. I would like to see us, as the  Foreign Relations Committee, and us, as the first branch of government,  constitutionally protected as such, be a part of this and not just the  second branch negotiating and then entering into the agreement.   The President has, No. 1, every right to withdraw from this  agreement, just as President Obama had the right to enter into this  executive agreement. I, for one, agree that he should withdraw from the  Paris accord. In fact, I encouraged him to do so personally when he was  running and then when he was elected and continuously since then. That  doesn't mean we should walk away from this by any stretch of the  imagination. I think what we should do is do what the U.S. Constitution  envisions; that is, you have a negotiation between us, the United  States, and other countries, and then the matter is submitted to the  U.S. Senate for a vote to see if two-thirds of us can agree that this  is the way to do this.   So based on that, with all due respect to my good friend from New  Hampshire, I object.    Mr. President, first of all, I don't question the  sincerity whatsoever of my good friend from New Hampshire. Indeed, she  is quite correct that the United States has been a leader as far as  developing methods by which we clean up the air and clean up the water.   There is nothing that is happening here today, at this moment, that  is going to affect that at all. American companies are going to  continue to be on the front edge of this, on a very innovative basis,  and I have every confidence that American businesses will rise to the  occasion and will continue to actually be the world leader in this  regard.   What I object to is making an agreement with other countries that  truly binds U.S. citizens by doing it without going through the  constitutional process of submitting the agreement that is between our  country and others, as is specifically--very specifically provided in  article II, section 2.   I think if we did that, I think we would wind up with a better  agreement. I think we would wind up with a bipartisan agreement. We all  know that when we have a bipartisan agreement, we do substantially  better as far as rising to the occasion and all getting behind the  effort.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11 this month, I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure to  recognize Popular Patch in Hayden as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small  Business of the Day for November 6, 2019. Don McGrogan joined the U.S.  Navy at age 18 and served for the next 26 years, bearing witness to the  Cuban missile crisis, the Dominican Republic occupation, and the  Vietnam war. Over the course of his Navy career, McGrogan collected  more than 1,000 military patches as a hobby. Upon reentering civilian  life, he drew inspiration from his experiences in the Navy and opened  McGrogan's Patch Designs, a small  [[Page S6446]]  business dedicated to preserving America's history. Recently, McGrogan  merged his business with his grandson's company, Popular Patch, where  he works as a business partner with his son and grandson.   Popular Patch's goal is to become the world's foremost military patch  business by replicating designs for each U.S. military patch ever made.  The company has an inventory of more than 8,000 military patches, and  its selection of Navy patches is one of the largest in the world. The  company also creates custom patches using original designs, including  patches for hunters, fishermen, bikers, and zombie fans. Its designs  are popular among veterans, collectors, and actors, such as Hollywood  actors in ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Clear and Present Danger.''   Congratulations to Dan McGrogan and all of the employees at Popular  Patch for being selected as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small Business of  the Day for November 6, 2019. You make our great State proud, and I  look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
