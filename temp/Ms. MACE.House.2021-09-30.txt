 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Charleston  RiverDogs on a defining victory in the Low-A East championship series  this week. This 9-2 win is the City of Charleston's first minor league  baseball title in 99 years and the first in franchise history for the  Charleston RiverDogs.   The Charleston RiverDogs are a Lowcountry staple and are a vital part  of our tourism and hospitality industries.   This team worked extremely hard during their record-breaking season  and showed great determination while representing our beloved  Charleston.   I am excited for the opportunity to go back-to-back, like Jordan in  1996 and 1997.                          Recognizing Lambs for Life     Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of Lambs for Life and  its founders, Alex and Brandon Arrieta.   On April 25, 2016, Alex Arrieta, age 10, was told his cancer was gone  and a bone marrow transplant was scheduled for the next month. The very  next day Alex passed away.   In honor of Alex's favorite childhood toy, Lamby, his parents founded  Lambs for Life. Lambs for Life delivers Lamby Packs filled with toys  and a stuffed lamb for Child Life departments of children's hospitals,  brightening the days of thousands of pediatric cancer patients.   Lambs for Life, led by Alex's dad, Brandon, has spent the last 5  years working with Congress and the White House to bring focus and  solutions to pediatric cancer.   I commend Brandon for working through his grief at the loss of two  sons to make our country better.                          Recognizing Dean Stephens     Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of Dean Stephens, a  local news anchor, who is retiring after 31 years with ABC News 4.   Generations of Lowcountry families have welcomed Dean into their  living rooms. I grew up with Dean, watching him in the Lowcountry. His  first job with the station was as a weekend sportscaster, and he would  eventually become a news anchor.   Dean's presence on our televisions will be greatly missed by our  community. I wish him well on his much-deserved retirement.                   Recognizing Porter-Gaud School Students     Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the great work  done by some amazing students at Porter-Gaud School in Charleston.   Last month, as part of the school's Senior Day for Caring, 100  Porter-Gaud seniors packaged over 20,000 meals for the James Island  Outreach Center and One80 Place, feeding the hungry across the  Charleston area. They also packaged over 350 hygiene kits to take care  of our fleeing Afghan allies seeking refuge right here in the United  States.   The leaders of these nonprofits tell me the tremendous work these  students did saved them thousands of dollars in manufacturing costs,  not to mention the good works that they are doing for our community.                         Remembering Lucille Whipper     Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of former South  Carolina State Representative Lucille Whipper.   Dr. Whipper was the first African-American woman elected to the South  Carolina State House from Charleston County. She served her community  as an activist during the civil rights movement. She was a teacher and  a guidance counselor. She was also an administrator in Charleston  County public schools. Dr. Whipper was also the first African-American  administrator at the College of Charleston, where she developed the  school's diversity program all the way back as early as the 1970s.   Dr. Whipper will be greatly missed, but her influence will live on in  our community. We thank her for her leadership, and we offer our  sincerest condolences for her family during this time.                            ____________________
