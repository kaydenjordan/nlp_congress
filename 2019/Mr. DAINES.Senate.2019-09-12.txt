 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Deputy Cody Criner of Sweetgrass County for his brave  action in service of his community.   On February 6, 2019, Deputy Cody Criner was performing a routine  check at a rest stop along I-90 near Big Timber, when he came across a  Toyota Prius. At first, he believed the car to be abandoned. The car  was covered in snow, and the hood and the exhaust were completely  frozen over. Abandoned cars are common along this stretch of highway;  however, Deputy Criner knew in his gut that something was wrong.   Deputy Criner approached the vehicle to inspect the windows, and that  is when he saw the hand of a 33-year-old man. The man's eyes were  rolled into the back of his head, and he wasn't responding as Criner  pounded on the window. In temperatures 10 degrees below  [[Page S5472]]  freezing, Criner knew time was working against him.   Criner took quick action and grabbed a hammer and broke the passenger  side window. He proceeded to cover the man with as many blankets as he  had and even took the beanie off his own head to keep the man warm. On  that cold February day, Criner saved a man's life.   Deputy Criner's quick action and commitment to service is exemplary  of the Montana sprit. I know that Sheriff Alan Ronneberg and the entire  Sweetgrass community are thankful to have a faithful public servant in  Deputy Cody Criner.   In recognition of Deputy Cody Criner's bravery and service, I ask  unanimous consent that his name be entered into the Record and  recognized as Montanan of the week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor CAPT Nicholas  A. Mungas, commodore of Training Air Wing One, at NAS Meridian, for his  25 years of service to the U.S. Navy.   CAPT Nicholas Mungas grew up in Kalispell, MT. Following his  nomination, Captain Mungas attended and graduated from the U.S. Naval  Academy in 1995, with a degree in economics.
