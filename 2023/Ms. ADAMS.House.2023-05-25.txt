 Madam Speaker, today, I rise for the millions of American  families that will suffer due to the manufactured debt ceiling crisis.  Defaulting on our sovereign debt will be a disaster from Wall Street to  Main Street to streets in my district and to the kitchen table.   Our economy is being held hostage for so-called ``work requirements''  that disproportionately harm women and people with disabilities and  people of color. Just one example: Food insecurity is at the highest  level in 4 years, but MAGA Republicans will only prevent a financial  catastrophe if we cut SNAP benefits for families, for veterans, for  students, and for our seniors.   This would only deepen the hardships that vulnerable Americans face.  Shame on you, Republicans. There is a simple solution to averting  catastrophe: Pass a clean debt ceiling bill. Quit playing games with  our country's future and come on back to Washington and do your job.                            ____________________
