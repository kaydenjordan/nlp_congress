 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize G.P.  ``Bud'' Peterson, who will retire as president of Georgia Tech in the  summer of 2019.   After 10 years serving Georgia Tech, President Peterson is certainly  leaving it in a better place than he found it:   Under his leadership, Georgia Tech became the first university in a  decade to be invited to join the Association of American Universities;   Research funding increased and nearly doubled;   The size of enrollment grew, including the number of women enrolled  at the university.   And these are only a few of President Peterson's most notable impacts  on campus.   Thank you, President Peterson, for your service to Georgia Tech as a  premier research university that cultivates innovative leaders in  Georgia, across the U.S., and throughout the world. I wish you the best  of luck in your future endeavors.   And to Georgia Tech, I wish you the best of luck in your search for a  new president.                         National Pharmacist Day 2019     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Pharmacist Day 2019 on January 12.   According to Census data, there are over 200,000 pharmacists across  the U.S., with another 25,000 pharmacy aids. Each day, these  pharmacists are providing vaccines for a number of illnesses and  carefully counseling patients on prescriptions to help heal sickness  and reduce pain.   Through this work, pharmacists are considered one of the top three  most trusted professions in America. Today, and throughout the rest of  the year, I encourage everyone to visit your pharmacist, ask questions  about your prescriptions, and get to know the people who provide your  medicine and work to keep you healthy.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am proud to  recognize the work these individuals are doing every day to serve their  local communities across the country.                            ____________________
