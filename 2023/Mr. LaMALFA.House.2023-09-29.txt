 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dear friend, an  aviator, a northern California agriculture community leader, and an  American, Nick Macy.   Tragically, Nick received his heavenly wings recently at the final  Reno Air Races, where my son and I were in attendance. This loss will  be felt deeply throughout my district, the Klamath Basin, Siskiyou and  Modoc Counties, and most especially in Tulelake. I feel his pain deeply  myself.   Nick was a friend to myself and my office, as we worked closely with  him for over a decade to try to resolve a silly bureaucratic issue in  his airport.   A soft-spoken leader, Nick was a preeminent figure in his community.  He valued his hometown, his family's history in aviation and the  agricultural industries, and the rural roots that brought him up.   Nick is the son of a World War II B-24 instructor. He grew to become  an expert in many areas of farming, water, crop dusting, fighting fires  throughout the basin, and aviation as a six-time national champion in  the T-6 Gold Class in the Six-Cat Air Racing Team.   Nick and Macy's Flying Service were incredibly important to the  people in both Siskiyou and Modoc Counties. He truly loved his  community, family, and friends, and he would do everything within his  ability to ensure their prosperity. Nick was a cornerstone of the  agriculture community up there.   Nick was devoted to his family and neighbors. One could always count  on Nick.   My prayers are for his lovely wife, Beth, and his children and  grandchildren. To all of his family and friends--so many who were  gathered at the air race--may they feel God's presence in this moment  of terrible loss.   Nick, Godspeed to you. Thank you for all you were to us. Your legacy  will live on in Tulelake and our hearts. We won't forget you.  [[Page H4900]]                                ____________________
