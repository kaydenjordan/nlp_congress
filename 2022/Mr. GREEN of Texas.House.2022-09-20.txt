 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.   Mr. Speaker, a monumental motif of American jurisprudence is the  basic premise that no one is above the law. It doesn't matter your  station in life, it doesn't matter whether you are the President of the  United States, and it doesn't matter how much money you have. No one is  above the law.   I would also remind us, Mr. Speaker, that there is a compelling  corollary to this premise, and it is that no one is beneath the law. No  one is above the law, yes, but no one is beneath the law. It doesn't  matter how poor you are. It doesn't matter what kind of job you have.  It doesn't matter whether you are a janitor or you are a sanitation  worker. It doesn't matter. You are not beneath the law in this country.  Even if you are an asylee coming here from another country, you are not  beneath the law.                                time  1015    I'm so proud, Mr. Speaker, to announce to my colleagues that the D.C.  Council will vote on a migrant bill today. It seems that on Tuesday  there will be an emergency bill to establish an Office of Migrant  Services for the thousands who are being brought here by Governors of  Texas and Florida.   These persons in Washington, D.C., they are doing the righteous  thing. They are trying to help lawful asylees as they traverse to their  destiny. The Governors of Florida and Texas, they would have derailed  the Underground Railroad. They would have been the persons who were out  looking for those who were seeking freedom.   I am proud of the Mayor of Washington, D.C. I don't know how  efficacious the program will be, but I do know that they are making an  effort. For this effort, I not only commend them, I will do whatever I  can to help them. It is time for us to realize that no one is beneath  the law. Asylees are not beneath the law. They are law-abiding persons.  The mere fact that they have submitted themselves and seek to have this  opportunity to live in this country means that they have broken no law.   I have a question for the Governors of Texas and Florida. Here is my  question: You are spending millions to bring people out of their way  and to some extent put them in harm's way. I have a question for you:  How much will you spend to help them get to their hearings? How much  will you spend to help them continue their journey?   Yours is not a righteous cause. Yours is a cause to do what you can  to prevent lawful, law-abiding asylees from having their day in court.  History will not be kind to you. You ought to be ashamed of what you  do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott, as well, for the  outstanding job that he has done.   Mr. Price, I don't know what more you can do. I really don't. This  bill is  [[Page H7998]]  bipartisan; it is bicameral; and, by God, we ought to pass it.
