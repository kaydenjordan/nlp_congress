 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill that invests in the love and commitment we have for our families,  from the very young to the very old.   It gets our children off to a good start with historic funding for  pre-K and child care, and makes sure all children have access to high- quality public education regardless of their ZIP Code.   We want our children to have a chance to live out their dreams, so we  make unprecedented investments in Pell grants for college students,  including DACA recipients.   And our grandparents have given us so much. To help them age with  dignity and comfort, the bill increases funding for home and community- based services and research on Alzheimer's and other conditions that  impact older Americans.   And, of course, we want our families to be safe and healthy, so this  bill doubles funding for research on gun violence, pluses-up mental  health treatment, and makes historic investments in combatting climate  change and protecting Florida's Everglades, drinking water for  millions.   And this is a country that honors our veterans. I am proud to  champion Centers of Excellence for Student Veteran Success programs  that help veterans transition from Active Duty to civilian student  life.   And today we celebrate reproductive freedom with historic investments  in Title X Family Planning program, which provides health service to  millions of low-income patients in our  [[Page H3928]]  most underserved communities, and we eliminate provisions blocking the  use of Medicaid funding for abortion.   No matter how we feel about abortion, politicians should not deny  someone's health coverage just because they are struggling financially.  Women must have the freedom to decide when and if to become a parent.  This is monumental.   This is a bill filled with love and hope and justice that lifts up  our families. I am proud to support it.                                time  1315
