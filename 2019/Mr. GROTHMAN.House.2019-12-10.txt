 Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk a little bit about  the border, which is probably the most important issue facing America  today as we determine what kind of country we have 10 or 15 years down  the road, but I am going to lead off by talking a little bit about the  past topic of capitalism versus socialism, because I don't think a lot  of people realize exactly what socialism is about.   Socialism is about absolute government control.   People who are socialists want everybody to have to work for the  government. Because they control the means of production, they want to  determine what we have the right to buy, and they want to determine  what we have the ability to invest in.   Obviously, if you have to work for the government, which you have to  in socialism, they can determine who gets hired, who gets promoted,  what job you get. In other words, they will eventually use that  absolute power that comes with being everybody's employer or  everybody's regulator to promote you or hire you based upon your  feelings, based upon your ideas.   Not long ago, I went to Berlin and I saw the StasiMuseum, where, in  the wonderful socialist country of East Germany, the government kept  track of how you thought--kind of the way they do in China today--how  you thought and if maybe you didn't say the right things. And maybe if  the government becomes anti-Christian or doesn't like your other  beliefs, they will miraculously fire you, you can't get the key job,  you can't get promoted or whatever. That is why people who like to  control lives more frequently become socialists.   You look at the red flags under socialism that existed in the 1930s,  and you will see those red flags--at the time, red meant socialism--all  were adapted by leaders who liked absolute control of their  populations.   So, if anybody out there wants to vote socialism, what they are  voting for is to get rid of their freedoms. They are saying: I turn my  life over to the government. I want the government to tell me where I  can work and what I can do when I am working. I want the government to  tell me what I can buy.   And if anybody accumulates wealth, they are saying: I want the  government to be able to tell me where I can invest.   That is the mindset of the socialist.   There are fears that someday America may go socialist. Actually, that  shouldn't happen, because socialism is unconstitutional under the U.S.  Constitution, and any academic who pushes socialism should be aware of  that.   If you want to be, I guess it would amount to being a real serf. If  you want to be a serf and have the government tell you where you have  to work, tell you whether you can be promoted or not, tell you what you  can invest in, and tell you what you can buy, you should go to another  country, because the people who put together our Constitution, a goal  was that we would never become anything like socialism.                                 Immigration     Mr. Speaker, now, let's talk a little bit about what  was a major issue that used to be covered by the press, including the  conservative press, before we started down the path to this  impeachment, and that was the issue that was the primary reason why  President Trump was elected: That issue is immigration and who we are  going to let in this country.   I don't think it has been well publicized, but just yesterday, we got  the information from Border Patrol that they processed 42,000 people  trying to come in this country either under asylum or inappropriately  during the month of November.   That is down from 45,000 in October, so I suppose you could say we  are moving the ball in the right direction. It is down from 145,000 in  May.   Of those 42,000, under 5,000 actually got to come in the country. The  vast majority who were not let in immediately, thanks to the work of  President Trump, are currently being held in Mexico pending hearings.   This is something President Trump has done without any help from the  people in this body. He has done it by negotiating with Mexico and  negotiating with the triangle countries in Central America. He has  reached agreements or is receiving help from Guatemala, from Honduras,  from El Salvador, and from Mexico itself.   To a certain extent, through threat of tariffs, he has the Mexican  Government patrolling its southern border--not doing that great a job,  but they are patrolling their southern border.   He has Central American countries doing what they can to hold on to  their current population and allowing countries from which people are  seeking asylum to settle in their country, which only makes sense. If  you wanted to leave Venezuela, you speak Spanish. It doesn't make any  sense that you would come to an English-speaking country. It makes more  sense, if you really feel threatened at home, to go to countries like  Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras and Mexico.   So these efforts by President Trump have dropped the number processed  from 145,000 down to 42,000 and the number of people being let in our  country from over 100,000 to under 5,000 a month.   But it is always possible we are going to have a court decision  undoing some of the efforts of President Trump, and, God forbid, it is  possible we might have an election and a future President may not agree  with the efforts made by President Trump.   So what should this body be doing? We have to remind this body that,  right now, we are only two of the 40 wealthiest countries on the globe  to allow birthright citizenship.   If somebody went down to the border, it is obvious that women who are  near having birth are coming into this country to have children, which  would make their children U.S. citizens and would create a situation in  which, as a practical matter, they would stay there with them.    We have a situation of chain migration in which people are coming  here not because they are qualified to work here, but because they have  relatives who are here, and we may be taking people who are not  necessarily a good economic bargain for the United States.   We need more ICE beds for single adults to be held right now. It is  very difficult for ICE to do their job without these beds. As we are  working through appropriations bills, it is time to pass a bill with  that in there.   We need more Border Patrol agents. Can you imagine what it is like at  night doing the border patrol, finding 20 or 40 or 50 people coming  across the border at once, and it is 2 o'clock in the morning and you  are the one expected to bring people in? We have to respect our Border  Patrol.   We have a huge problem that, under current law, we are encouraging  separation of families, and that is not President Trump's fault. He  would be happy to change it.   Right now, we have a law in which, if a child comes here from Canada  or Mexico, they could be sent back, but children coming from Central  America,  [[Page H10014]]  Africa, other places in Latin America, we have to let them in the  country. That is a horrible thing.   We wouldn't like it if a 15-year-old child left the United States and  wound up in Nicaragua or Honduras. We would expect them to be returned  to their parents.   We are asking this body to pass a law allowing the United States to  return single children to their parents and other countries. The other  countries would like it.   It is very arrogant of the United States and arrogant of this body to  continue the current system in which a child, unaccompanied by their  parents, comes here and we have to keep them.   Right now, under the Flores settlement, we have to stop holding  people after 20 days near the border, families with children. It is  time that we statutorily change that and allow the holding of people  for a longer period of time.   We have to do something with sanctuary cities. We have to do  something so that, if people break the law and are being held in  prisons and being held in jails, the Federal Government has the ability  to remove these people from the country.   For whatever motivation, there are people in this country going down  the path of having their city--and including people in this House  encouraging cities--not ask people about immigration status and  forbidding our immigration service from removing criminals from this  country. That is another thing that we ought to be doing now.                                time  1915    Other things that President Trump is trying to do--but he needs a  little bit of help here--we currently have illegals in low-income  housing. I am not sure we need more low-income housing in this country,  but a lot of people feel we do. Right now we have the rather bizarre  situation in which people who are here illegally are sitting in low- income housing, while American citizens are on a waiting list,  including people like homeless veterans.   I want to point out that President Trump and myself are not anti- immigrant to say this. It recently came to my attention that the number  of immigrants sworn in in this country in the last year available is  830,000. Two years prior to that we were under 700,000.   So President Trump has presided over a dramatic increase in the  number of people who are coming in this country legally, showing his  compassion and understanding that we do need immigrants in this  country.   However, it is time Congress stepped to the plate and did what was  necessary to rein in out-of-control illegal immigration. So I encourage  my colleagues not to forget about this crisis. I encourage the media,  particularly the conservative media, not to take their eye off this  ball, which will determine what the United States looks like 5 and 10  and 25 years from now.   I realize there are a lot of people who want the media to only focus  on immigration, but we cannot forget what is going on in the  immigration front.   I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________
