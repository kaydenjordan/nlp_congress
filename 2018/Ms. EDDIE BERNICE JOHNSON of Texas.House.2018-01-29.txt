 Mr. Speaker, labor unions have  played a crucial role in the formation of United States. Since 1869,  unions have provided a platform for workers to collectively bargain for  better wages, better hours, and safer working conditions. Every single  worker living in the United States today has benefitted in some way  from the role of unions, helping to shape our nation into the country  that we all know and admire.   Today, unions play a more important role than ever before in recent  history, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of our  population, such as women and communities of color. When unions are  strong, communities are stronger. Yet now, as union membership  declines, so have opportunities for working and middle class families.  In 2016, there were 14.6 million unionized members in the United  States, down from 17.7 million in 1983. Union membership in the private  sector has fallen to below seven percent. Wages have also remained  stagnant since the 1970s, while people continue to work longer hours  and often  [[Page H671]]  times multiple jobs just to make ends meet. These consequences can be  traced back to deliberate attacks against workers' rights and their  ability to organize.   The Supreme Court case in Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, is a clear  manifestation of these attacks on collective bargaining rights. The  U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on this case on February  26, 2018, which will question the future of ``fair share fees''--or  fees requiring non-union members to help cover the costs of a union's  collective bargaining activities--in the context of our First Amendment  rights. The Supreme Court has the potential to upend more than 40 years  of unanimous precedent supporting a states' ability to determine its  own labor policy. It is truly another important milestone in our  nation's history which will define who we are for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, as wages remain stagnant and more workers fail to find  gainful employment, we need to question the direction in which our  country is headed. Do we want all bargaining power to be concentrated  in the hands of only the wealthiest corporations? Or do we believe that  American workers should retain reasonable means to organize when wages,  benefits, and working conditions decline? I believe in the latter. I  believe in the American people. This Congress must do more to protect  the collective bargaining rights of working families, not only because  it is the right thing to do but because our nation is stronger when we  do so.                            ____________________
