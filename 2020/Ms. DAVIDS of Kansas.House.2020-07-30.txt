 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  amendment introduced by Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, which would  prevent the Department of Justice from spending taxpayer dollars on a  lawsuit that would tear down the landmark Affordable Care Act.   To effectively fight the coronavirus, we have to make sure that every  person has access to affordable, quality healthcare. But even during a  global pandemic, when so many people are finding themselves without  health insurance, this administration is determined to eliminate every  last protection and benefit afforded by the ACA.   These benefits include allowing young adults to stay on their  parents' plan until age 26, ensuring women and men are charged the same  rates, and protecting people with preexisting conditions, things like  asthma and diabetes.   If this lawsuit is successful, 94,000 Kansans would lose their  healthcare coverage, people like Danny Robeson. I met Danny when he was  7. He lives in Prairie Village, in the district that I represent.   He was born prematurely, has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and a cortical  vision impairment, health conditions that surely are considered  preexisting conditions. Without the protections of the ACA, his family  fears that they would go bankrupt and be unable to get Danny the care  he needs.    Mr. Speaker, during this time of uncertainty,  no Kansan should have to worry about whether they will afford the care  that they or their families need to stay healthy.   We should build on the progress of the ACA, not tear it down.   I urge my fellow colleagues to support the amendment introduced by  Representative Underwood.
