 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support my bill, H.R. 8026,  which designates a USPS facility in Minneapolis as the Charles W.  Lindberg Post Office.   I am proud to have the opportunity to honor Charles ``Chuck'' W.  Lindberg, not to be confused with the aviator Chuck Lindbergh. He was a  highly decorated U.S. Marine Corps corporal who received the Silver  Star medal, Purple Heart medal, and Combat Action Ribbon, and one of  the two U.S. Marines who raised the original American flag over Iwo  Jima during World War II.   Mr. Lindberg lived in the city of Richfield in my district for 50  years and was laid to rest at the Fort Snelling National Cemetery in  Minneapolis.   Mr. Lindberg spent decades explaining that it was his patrol, not the  one in the famous Associated Press photograph, that raised the first  flag on the morning of February 23, 1945. He shared that his commander  ordered the first flag replaced and safeguarded because he was worried  someone would take it as a souvenir. It was hours later, while Mr.  Lindberg was in combat, that six men raised the second flag, a larger  flag.   The photo of the second flag-raising became one of the most famous  images of the war and the model for the Marine Corps' War Memorial in  Washington, D.C.   After the war, Mr. Lindberg returned to Minnesota, where he spent 40  years as an electrician. He was a proud union member of the  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, IBEW Local 292, and  had a JATC Electrical Training Center named in honor of him just weeks  before he passed away.   Mr. Lindberg spent his final years raising awareness of the first  flag raising and speaking to veteran groups and at schools.   Madam Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking Chuck W.  Lindberg for his bravery and service to our country. I urge everyone to  join me in honoring his life by passing this bipartisan bill.
