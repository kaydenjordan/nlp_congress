Mr. President, our economy has made tremendous strides  over the past 2 years. Americans on the whole have access to more jobs,  higher wages, and more opportunities. Unfortunately, our Nation's  agricultural economy is trailing behind the broader economy.   A combination of low commodity prices, protracted trade disputes, and  natural disasters and weather-related issues have left many farmers and  ranchers struggling. Nationwide, net farm income is about half of what  it was in 2013--half.   In my home State of South Dakota, farmers and ranchers are currently  facing the fallout from severe winter storms, heavy rainfall, bomb  cyclones, and spring flooding. Less than half of this year's acreage  intended for corn has been planted. Compare that to this time last  year, when 96 percent of our State's corn was in the ground and  growing. Today, just 14 percent of South Dakota's soybeans have been  planted, compared to 83 percent this time last year. To make matters  worse, for many farmers, this year's planting season is already over,  as their land is completely flooded and will not dry out in time for  anything to be planted. Other States that produce the bulk of our  country's corn and soybeans are facing similar planting challenges.   There have been some recent wins for farmers and ranchers. The  administration's announcement that it is lifting the ban on the year- round sale of E15--15 percent ethanol-blended fuel--is great news for  corn producers in South Dakota and around the Nation. It is a big win  for consumers, too, who will have access to this cleaner, lower cost  fuel during the summer driving season for the first time. I have spent  nearly my entire time in the Senate advocating for higher blends of  ethanol, and I am pleased the Trump administration has followed through  on its commitment to address this issue.   Another recent win was Japan's announcement that it was lifting age  limits on U.S. beef imports, giving America's ranchers full access to  the Japanese market. CNBC reports that the U.S. Meat Export Federation  predicts that Japan's move could increase U.S. beef sales to Japan by  $150 million to $200 million per year.   While these victories are important, there is a lot more work to be  done to get our Nation's farmers and ranchers back on their feet. I  hear regularly from South Dakota ag producers about the challenges they  are facing, and I constantly share their concerns with  [[Page S3234]]  the administration, whether I am meeting with the President or other  officials.   One of the biggest things we can do for our Nation's farmers and  ranchers is secure trade deals that will open new markets for American  agricultural products.   I support the President's efforts to secure more favorable treatment  for American products and his determination to ensure that China honors  the trade commitments it has made, but I believe we need to wrap up  negotiations on these various agreements we are discussing as quickly  as possible. Along with increased market access, farmers and ranchers  need certainty about what international markets are going to look like.   I am committed to doing everything I can to advance trade agreements  with Japan and with the European Union. I am also doing everything I  can to move the United States-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement  through Congress in the near future. This agreement would benefit  American agriculture, create jobs, and grow our economy, and we should  pass it as soon as possible. We should be wary of any action that might  jeopardize this trade agreement and the markets it will open for our  producers.   Another issue of concern to farmers and ranchers is the  implementation of the 2018 farm bill. Getting a pro-agriculture, pro- farmer bill to the President was one of my top priorities last year,  and I am proud of the bill we delivered.   I took ideas and suggestions from South Dakota farmers and ranchers  and developed more than 40 proposals aimed at making life better for  American agricultural producers. Nearly 20 of my proposals were  included in the final bill, including my new short-term, soil-building  conservation program for farmers who don't want to tie up ground for 10  years or more in the Conservation Reserve Program.   Now that the farm bill is law, we have to make sure that it is  implemented in a timely manner and as Congress intended. I have spent  years pushing for an increase in the Conservation Reserve Program's  acreage cap, and we finally got a substantial increase in last year's  bill.   The Department of Agriculture needs to expedite both general and  continual CRP signups to allow farmers to take full advantage of that  cap increase. I have been strongly urging the Department to make sure  that farmers can sign up in a timely manner. Taking millions of acres  of environmentally sensitive land out of crop production in the next  year could have a big impact on the farm economy by driving up  commodity prices and increasing farmers' profits, but in order for this  to happen, we need to make sure that farmers can get their least  productive land enrolled in the CRP program and out of crop production  by next year.   South Dakota farmers and ranchers are the lifeblood of our State, and  I am committed to doing everything I can to address their needs here in  Washington. In addition to working on trade issues and farm bill  implementation, I am working with the Department of Agriculture's Risk  Management Agency to ensure that our farmers are treated fairly under  crop insurance prevent plant and cover crop rules.   I have been working with the Agriculture Department to make certain  the recently announced second round of Market Facilitation Program  payments do not affect this year's planting decisions. I have also  requested that this second round of MFP payments provide equitable  assistance to all producers, especially those with failed and damaged  crops or who were prevented from planting this year's crops due to  adverse weather.   And, as I said, I will continue to push for trade agreements with  China and other countries so that our Nation's farmers receive a check  from the sale of their products overseas instead of from the Department  of Agriculture.   I also recently led a letter to the President in support of Governor  Noem's request for a major disaster declaration in South Dakota, and 2  weeks ago I voted in favor of the Additional Supplemental  Appropriations Act, which would provide additional disaster funding for  States and Territories harmed by last year's hurricanes and wildfires  and this year's flooding. The bill also includes $3 billion to provide  assistance for farmers' crop losses from the 2018 and 2019 natural  disasters.   Our Nation's farmers and ranchers have a tough, backbreaking job.  Instead of air-conditioned and heated offices, they labor in the hot  Sun, the cold rain, and the snow. They start their days before the Sun  rises and often end them long after the Sun falls. Most Americans never  think about the blood, sweat, and tears that have gone into that loaf  of bread or that gallon of milk that they grab off the grocery store  shelf, but we are all the beneficiaries of the hard work and the  dedication of our Nation's farmers and ranchers. It is an honor to  represent so many of these hard-working people here in the Senate.   To South Dakota's farmers and ranchers, I want to say I hear you. I  know that things have been incredibly tough for you all over the past  few years. I know that you are fighting through a lot of challenges,  and I am committed to making sure that Washington addresses your  priorities, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that you  have access to the support and the resources you need to continue  feeding our Nation and the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran) would have voted ``yea.''    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran) would have voted ``yea.''    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran) would have voted ``yea.''    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe),  the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Florida (Mr.  Rubio), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea'', the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran) would have voted ``yea'', and the Senator from Florida (Mr.  Rubio) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me just  say that the plans to which the Senator from Wisconsin is referring are  plans that tens of thousands of people are buying, and one of the  reasons they are buying them is because it allows them to buy the  insurance they want at a price they can afford.   I can tell you, as I am sure the Presiding Officer can and probably  everybody here can, when they travel across the country and talk with  the farmers and ranchers and people who are buying their insurance on  the individual market, the individual market has blown up. It has  exploded. People are paying $3,000 a month in premiums--$36,000 a  year--and have huge deductibles. So what they are doing is they are  dropping coverage because they can't afford it. One of the reasons they  can't afford it is because, under ObamaCare, there were so many  mandates and requirements, it drove up the price. So they have these  skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and higher copays.   I think that is precisely why the administration decided that, let's  take these plans and give people an opportunity to buy the insurance  they want at a price they can afford.   Literally tens of thousands of Americans are now in these plans. What  the Senator from Wisconsin is saying is, we are going to throw all  these people off these plans. What does that do? That puts them back  out, probably uninsured, which is what a lot of farmers and ranchers in  places in South Dakota are doing--they are just dropping coverage  because they can't afford it. Who can afford to pay $3,000 a month?  That is what ObamaCare has left us. That is why we need new solutions.  This solution is one that allows people to buy a plan they want at a  price they can afford, coupled with association health plans--which  Democrats, I think, here in the Senate are also objecting to and  opposing--which are also giving individuals opportunities to join  larger groups and spread their risk and drive down their premiums. We  need plans that people in this country can afford, or more and more  people are going to be in the ranks of the uninsured.   So, Mr. President, I object.
