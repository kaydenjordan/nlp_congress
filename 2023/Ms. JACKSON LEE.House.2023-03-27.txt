 Mr. Speaker, a nightmare, a day of horror, and one  that prayers and sympathy cannot quash the deep and piercing pain that  the parents of these babies in an elementary school, a Christian school  in Nashville, had to experience this morning at 10 a.m., and the loved  ones of the adults that suffered an untimely death. How long is this  Congress going to diddle-daddle around?   How long are we going to be divided over the reality that a 28-year- old who went to the school had two AR-15s and a handgun?   Oh, there is always the talk about the Second Amendment. I honor the  Second Amendment, but I do not honor the violence of an assault weapon.   How many more babies can we lose?   How many more stories like Uvalde can we tolerate?   How many more parents, whose children's lives are just going to be  snatched from them, are going to walk around like zombies?   It is time now to ban the assault weapons. Ban them now. It is time  to address mental health issues in a larger way. It is time for this  Congress to come together. It is time to stop the nightmare and to stop  the horror.   How many more parents have to cry over dead babies? Ban assault  weapons and do it now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for  his leadership on a very important topic this evening that brings us  all together.   I thank Congresswoman Cori Bush for the vibrancy, along with  Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, in the organizing of the ERA Caucus. It  is important that we work together to ensure that the equal rights  amendment becomes law.   I am reminded of my entering Congress. I don't know if anyone would  realize that there was a statue for suffragette women, women in the  early 1900s who were seeking the women's right to vote. Even earlier  than that, Sojourner Truth, who we galvanized around, with the National  Congress for Black Women, to provide an opportunity for Sojourner Truth  to even  [[Page H1458]]  have a statue here as an early suffragette and abolitionist.   When I came, the statue honoring women, who fought for women's rights  and the right to vote, was in the basement. It was women, Members of  the House and the Senate, who had to organize and fight to lift that  very awesome sculpture out of the basement, covered by dust, to be able  to be put in the rotunda.   We still have work undone, because it was a half-finished sculpture.  African-American women argued that they did not have Sojourner Truth in  that statue, who was an abolitionist and leader on women's rights.                                time  1945    We did it through legislation, myself and Senator Clinton, we did, in  fact, get a statue sculptured by an African-American woman of Sojourner  Truth, she now remains in Emancipation Hall, and our task is not yet  finished to be able to place her in the rotunda along with the other  statues.   I say that to say that this Caucus, this announcement, couldn't be  more important, and the reason is because Black women were very  instrumental in having the loudest voices; realizing even then that  Black women had the lowest hourly wage, Black women were still domestic  workers, Black women were not, in fact, equal in many aspects of the  law.   Pauli Murray, who I honor; Shirley Chisholm, Flo Kennedy, all of whom  I remember and know, and Barbara Jordan, are a few of the prominent  Black women who have advocated for the equal rights amendment in the  1970s.   Many Black organizations endorsed the ERA, including the National  Black Feminist Organization, the NAACP, and the Coalition of Black  Trade Unionists. A 1970s Gallup poll showed that 60 percent of Black  women wanted the ERA. This has been a long history.   There is a long history of activism that Black women and women of  color in support of women's rights and the ERA, stated by historian and  professor of Africana studies, Dr. Mary Phillips.   Today, Black women still play a critical role in pushing for the ERA.  In three States, to recently ratify the ERA, Black women were at the  forefront. Nevada Senator Pat Spearman led a successful campaign for  the ratification of the ERA in her State in 2017, and Representative  Juliana Stratton made extensive floor speeches in support of the ERA in  Illinois.   As well, Jennifer McClellan led the successful effort to ratify the  ERA in Virginia, finally bringing the total ratification of the ERA to  38 States required to become part of the Constitution.   And yet, we did not make our mark. Yet, we have more work to do. Yet,  we are struggling to ensure that in 2023 Black women will have equal  rights in the court. Black women will have equal rights in healthcare.  Black women will have equal rights in education. Black women will have  equal rights in the issue of sexual assaults and rape when women are  charged with agreeing or consent, which is not true. Equal rights to be  heard. Equal rights in work. Equal rights in payments.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support my colleagues, and really to  acknowledge these brave and historic women. I am so proud that my  predecessor, the Honorable Barbara Jordan, was one of those who stood  regally tall along with the first African-American woman in the United  States Congress, Shirley Chisholm.   Of course, who could forget Flo Kennedy wearing those hats. Who could  forget feminist and civil rights advocate Pauli Murray, who testified  for the equal rights amendment at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing  in 1970. In her testimony, Murray drew up upon her own experience of  race and sex, and these are her words:   ``Although my motivation, energy, and effort to meet the highest  standards of performance have been operative throughout my life, I have  experienced numerous delays in my career, not for the traditional  reasons given for the failure of women to develop on par with men in  our society (marriage, childbearing, et cetera), but by a combination  of individual and institutional racism and sexism--Jim Crow and June  Crow.''   As a constitutional lawyer, a woman, and a Black person, I can say  with conviction that Black women, as a group, have the most to gain  from the adoption of the equal rights amendment. All that has been said  about the frustration and deprivations of American women, generally  because of discrimination by reason of sex, can be said with special  force about the position of Black women.   My concluding remarks--maybe she didn't call herself a fighter for  the ERA, but Harriet Tubman was a fighter for justice and took slaves  out of the Deep South. Her words were this:   If you hear the dogs coming, keep on moving. If you hear the noise,  keep on moving. If you see the lights, keep on moving. Because if you  want a taste of freedom, keep on moving.   Tonight we stand here for freedom and the equal rights amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a timeline of the equal rights  movement.         1840:        Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton are barred from       attending the World Anti-Slavery Convention held in London.       They decide to hold a Women's Convention in the U.S.        1850:        Massachusetts, is the site of the first National Women's       Rights Convention. Frederick Douglass, Paulina Wright Davis,       William Lloyd Garrison, Lucy Stone, and Sojourner Truth       attend. A strong alliance is formed with the Abolitionist       Movement.        1851:        At a women's rights convention in Akron, Ohio, Sojourner       Truth, a former slave, delivers her speech, ``Ain't I a       woman?''.        1870:        The Fifteenth Amendment gave Black men the right to vote.       The National Woman's Suffrage Association refused to work for       its ratification. Frederick Douglass broke with Stanton and       Anthony over this position.        1890:        The National Woman Suffrage Association and the American       Woman Suffrage Association, merged to formally expand the       National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). NAWSA       focused on enfranchisement solely for white women.        1913:        The Alpha Suffrage Club was founded, with Ida B. Wells as       one of the co-founders and leaders, this is believed to be       the first African-American women's suffrage association in       the United States.        1920:        Three quarters of the state legislatures ratify the       Nineteenth Amendment.        1940:        Jim Crow laws such as poll taxes and literacy tests are       enacted, designed to keep Black citizens from voting.        1965:        500 activists march from Selma to Montgomery, AL to demand       voting rights for Black citizens. They are brutally attacked       by law enforcement.        1965:        President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act       into law.        2011:        Record numbers of state restrictions are enacted on voting,       including voter ID laws and restrictions to early voting.        2013:        The Supreme Court strikes down the heart of the Voting       Rights Act by a 5-to-4 vote, freeing states to change their       election laws.    The first Equal Rights Amendment was drafted by the National Women's  Party in 1921 to enshrine equality for women in the Constitution.   Fifty-one years later, the Equal Rights Amendment won the requisite  two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives and passed the Senate.   In 2020, Virginia became the thirty-eighth state to vote in favor of  the ERA, but whether the ERA has accordingly been ratified remains  politically and legally contested.   Since 2013, Black Lives Matter has been a global social movement  advocating against anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence,  including but not limited to police brutality against Black men and  women.   The movement has attracted broad participation by non-Black activists  and lawmakers following the police murder of George Floyd.              Suffrage in America: The 15th and 19th Amendments    During the 19th and 20th centuries, Black women played an active role  in the struggle for universal suffrage.                       Who got the right to vote when?    August 18, 2020 marked 100 years since the ratification of the 19th  Amendment to the United States Constitution granting women the right to  vote.   However, obstacles like poll taxes, literacy tests and other  discriminatory state voting laws would keep Black women (and men)  disenfranchised for a further 45 years.         Black Women Had to Fight for the Right to Vote on Two Fronts    They were suffragists combating both racism and sexism long after the  19th Amendment was passed.   Women of color were crucial to women's suffrage--it's time we  acknowledge them.  [[Page H1459]]    Wagner, who is behind books such as Women's Suffrage Anthology and  Sisters in Spirit, has for almost 30 years studied the Haudenosaunee  (or the Iroquois) influence on the early feminist movements.                             More to the Movement    While Seneca Falls is considered the first American convention to  focus exclusively on women's rights, the first convention to consider  women's rights as an issue was the May 9, 1837, Anti-Slavery Convention  of American Women in New York City.                          LEGISLATION: H.J. RES. 25    Women have done the work of preserving and defending our democracy  for centuries, and it is past time our laws recognize our contributions  and the historic role that we have played.   The first time the ERA was put forward, women of color were not part  of the conversation. Now, we're leading and working in coalition to  advance this priority.   Our resolution will help address centuries of gender disparities in  America by removing the unnecessary barriers that have prevented us  from enshrining the dignity, humanity, and equality of all people into  our Constitution.   We as women have done our job, the states have done their job, and  now it's time for Congress to do its job and pass this resolution.   I know how transformative the ERA will be for millions of women and  our LGBTQ siblings across this country.                   H.J. Res. 25 History/What the bill does    The ERA has been introduced in every session of Congress until it  passed in 1972 in both the House and Senate.   Congress then placed an arbitrary deadline on the ratification  process.   Our resolution would remove the arbitrary deadline imposed by  Congress and affirm the ratification of the ERA as the 28th Amendment.   The only thing standing in the way of ratification is Congress  passing legislation to remove that arbitrary deadline and declare the  ERA valid, since 38 states, making up three-fourths of the country,  have now ratified the ERA.   80 percent of countries across the world have enshrined language  within their Constitutions that establishes equal rights and protection  for women. The United States must do the same.                      Black Women Suffragists In History       Frances Ellen Watkins Harper   An abolitionist and women's suffrage leader who became one of the  first Black writers to popularize African American protest poetry.      Ida B Wells-Barnett   Wells-Barnett was a prominent journalist, activist, and researcher,  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.   In her lifetime, she battled sexism, racism, and violence.   As a skilled writer, Wells-Barnett also used her skills as a  journalist to shed light on the conditions of African Americans  throughout the South.      (Isabella Bomfree) Sojourner Truth   Formerly enslaved, Sojourner Truth became an outspoken advocate for  abolition, temperance, and civil and women's rights in the nineteenth  century.   She challenged the notions of racial and gender inferiority through  notable speeches and a lecture tour, including ``Ain't I A Woman?''   Her work to help formerly enslaved peoples find jobs and build new  lives after the Civil War earned her an invitation to meet President  Abraham Lincoln in 1864.      Mary Church Terrell   One of the first African American women to earn a college degree,  Terrell helped found the National Association of Colored Women, was a  key activist in the suffrage movement, and helped desegregate  restaurants in D.C.      Daisy Elizabeth Adams Lampkin   Lampkin spent her life fighting for the right to vote and centered  her work around many women's organizations, including becoming the  president of the Lucy Stone Woman Suffrage League in 1915.      Nannie Helen Burroughs   A prominent African American educator, church leader and suffragette,  Burroughs also helped found the National Association of Colored Women  and was a lead writer on injustices endured by the African American  community.      Sarah Parker Remond   Born in 1824, Remand brought a legal case against a theater after  being forced out when she refused to sit in segregated seats.   She won the case and the theatre was ordered to stop segregated  seating.   She became a speaker for the American Anti-Slavery Society and fought  for voting rights in the US as well as abolition on an international  scale.
