 Mr. President, recently, my hometown of Warner  Robins, GA, and indeed the entire State of Georgia, lost a true leader.  I lost a good friend and mentor.   During his career, Matt Arthur made a difference in the lives of  countless students and families. He was raised in Fitzgerald, GA, one  of six children. He graduated from Fitzgerald High School in 1952 and  received a football scholarship to the University of Georgia. In  addition to playing football, he served as battalion commander of the  university's ROTC unit, and earned a bachelor's degree in industrial  arts. He would also later earn master's degrees in industrial arts and  administration and a specialist's degree in education leadership. After  graduating college, Matt served in the U.S. Army at Fort Benning in  Columbus, GA. He served from 1957-1959, ultimately rising to the rank  of first lieutenant.   In 1959, Matt became a high school football coach, winning a Triple-A  State championship in 1961. The following year, he moved his family to  Warner Robins and embarked on a career that would truly make a  difference. He was the first head coach and athletic director of my  high school alma mater, Northside High School, and served as its  principal from 1968-1980.   In 1980, Matt became superintendent of the Houston County School  System. He succeeded my father, David A. Perdue, Sr., in this role and  served until retiring in 1988. His enduring contributions to the  community were commemorated with the opening of Matt Arthur Elementary  School in Warner Robins in 1999.   For years, my father and Matt Arthur were close friends. I was also  proud to call Matt a friend. Our family and the entire Middle Georgia  community will miss him.   Throughout his life, Matt led by example and always put family first.  He is survived by his high school sweetheart and wife of 64 years Sarah  Bob Arthur, two adult children, five grandchildren, and one great- grandchild.   My wife Bonnie and I join everyone in our hometown and countless  others Matt Arthur impacted for the better in lifting up his family  during this very difficult time. Matt Arthur was a great American and  will be greatly missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in November, Georgia tragically  lost a true public servant.   Former Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Harris Hines leaves behind  a lasting legacy of service and bipartisan respect.   Chief Justice Hines was born in 1943 and grew up in Atlanta. He  attended Grady High School, lettering in multiple sports. After  graduation, he attended Emory University, where he attained both a  bachelor's degree and his juris doctorate.   Justice Hines went on to serve on the bench in Georgia for over four  decades. In 1974, then-Governor Jimmy Carter chose him to fill a slot  on the State court of Cobb County. He served there for 8 years until  becoming a judge on the Superior Court of Cobb County.   Thirteen years later, in 1995, Governor Zell Miller appointed Justice  Hines to an open seat on the Georgia Supreme Court, a capacity in which  he served for another 13 years.   In 2016, Justice Hines was voted by his colleagues to be Chief  Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. He was the first resident of Cobb  County, GA, to become chief justice.   Justice Hines retired from the bench earlier this year. He was known  as an intellectual powerhouse, with a deep appreciation and  understanding of the rule of law. However, Justice Hines was better  known as a dedicated husband, father, and grandfather. He is survived  by his wife Helen, two adult children, and four grandchildren.   Bonnie and I join all Georgians in continuing to lift up the Hines  family in our prayers during this very difficult time. Harris was a  dear personal friend, and I will miss him greatly.                            ____________________
