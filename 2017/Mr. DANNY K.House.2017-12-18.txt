 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank  Representative LaHood for organizing this opportunity for all of us  from Illinois to talk about the greatness of our State.   We have had on the floor individuals from very different parts of the  State, but Illinois has always had a reputation of having one of the  most congenial delegations in Congress any way you cut it. We have  always had that during the time that I have been here, and to be able  to talk about the diversity.   As Representative Krishnamoorthi was making his comments, you could  hear the emotion in his voice as he talked about how Illinois had  welcomed his family. And that is what Illinois has done. It has  welcomed individuals from all parts of the world. Individuals, large  numbers of Puerto Ricans who came from Puerto Rico; Mexican Americans;  individuals who were immigrants; African Americans, like myself, who  migrated from the rural South.   No, I didn't grow up in Illinois. I wasn't born in Illinois. As a  matter of fact, I was born in Arkansas. Of course, it is the only State  in the Bible that Noah looked over his ark and saw.   Large numbers of individuals from my State, from Mississippi, from  Louisiana, from Texas, from Tennessee, from Alabama, and from other  places migrated to Illinois, and especially to Chicago.   I have the opportunity to represent what I consider to be the most  fascinating piece of geography in North America that is compressed into  a political subdivision. My district begins at Lake Michigan. You can't  go any further east. It abuts the lake. It is downtown Chicago. It is  The Loop. It is the Magnificent Mile. It is Water Tower Place. It is  the future's industry. It is the big banks. It is home to corporate  America. Major corporations have their headquarters in downtown  Chicago.   But it also has more hospitals than any other single district in  America, which means that it is a health mecca. It also has some of the  first of the community health centers, the federally qualified health  centers, that were organized, the Mile Squares, the Near Norths, the  Martin Luther Kings, Access Healths.   It is a fascinating place, but then a part of it is home to Ernest  Hemingway. There are more Frank Lloyd Wright structures in my district  in a place called Oak Park than any other place in the world.   With the exception of a few places, it is the museum capital of the  Nation, every kind of entity. But the diversity of its people, some  very wealthy individuals, but then the areas that were devastated by  the riots after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.   But some of the greatness of people like John H. Johnson, who  started, developed, and owned Johnson Publishing Company. Parker House  Sausage. We don't do a great deal of farming, but we do a lot of other  kinds of things, businesses like Ariel Capital, Loop Capital.                                time  2030    These businesses provide an opportunity for others to interact. Great  people, I have had the good fortune to just know a whole bunch of young  athletes: Isaiah Thomas, Kevin Garnett, Doc Rivers, and Darryl  Stingley. All of these guys grew up in my district--not just in  Chicago, but in my district.   I represent the Chicago Bulls. I represent the Bears, the Black  Hawks, and a little bit of the White Sox. Unfortunately, the Cubs are a  little further  [[Page H10175]]  north where Congressman Mike Quigley is and represents, but we embrace  them also.   President Barack Obama lived right at the edge of my district.   Chicago, Illinois, is filled with inclusivity. Carol Moseley Braun  was the first African-American woman to be elected to the United States  Senate from the State of Illinois. Of course, Barack Obama was also  elected to the Senate. Roland Burris was a member of the Senate, and  Abraham Lincoln.   I grew up as a fan of Abraham Lincoln because of the role that he and  Illinois played in the abolition of slavery. My mother was a great  Abraham Lincoln fan, so as a little boy, I knew every story that you  could think of about Abraham Lincoln.   The thing that I am most proud of, though, is the inclusivity and the  diversification of our State.   Representative LaHood has represented and demonstrated what Illinois  is all about, and that is bringing all of us together to extol some of  the virtues of our great State. I thank the gentleman for his  leadership, and I thank the gentleman for his action.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it was really fun  interacting with my colleagues and learning about the great State in  which we live and have the opportunity to represent.   But, Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to vote on the GOP tax plan, I  decided that I would grade the bill and look a little bit at the  difference between what has been promised and the reality of what is in  the final legislation.   We were told that there would be middle class tax relief and that  nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase. We have been  looking for it, but instead, after 10 years, millions of middle class  taxpayers will be paying more, and the majority of the tax cuts will go  to the corporations and to the 1 percent.   We were told that it would eliminate tax breaks for the wealthy and  that wealthy proponents of the bill will personally take a hit from the  GOP tax plan--another failure. This bill and this plan violates every  principle and every tenet of economic justice.   The vast majority of the benefits go to the large corporations and  the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. All major tax breaks remain and  many new ones have been added, including the insidious new 20 percent  deduction for so-called passthrough entities like real estate  developers and others. Because of the fact that the new language wasn't  in the bill passed by the House and Senate, floor amendments to  eliminate the provision will not be permitted.   The alternative minimum tax, that safety net designed to thwart  clever tax dodgers, is gone. The biological heart of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is handed over to oil companies for  minimal return of Federal tax dollars.   We were told that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid would be  protected, that this was going to be a revenue-neutral tax reform and  that the bill would pay for itself--failure again. The trillion-plus  dollars in new deficit spending will be blamed on these programs, and  pressure to cut them will begin shortly after the new year.   We were told that tax cuts will spur economic growth--again, failure.  U.S. corporate profits are already historically high, but corporations  are not making investments in plants, research, and new technology to  grow the economy.   What we need is increased demand, higher wages, returning dislocated  workers to the economy, rebuilding aging cities, and rebuilding  infrastructure to revitalize communities. The redistribution of income  away from low-to high-income households reduces consumption spending,  which reduces demand.   The bill will be disastrous to the work of charitable nonprofits,  reducing charitable giving by $13 billion or more, annually, destroying  more than 220,000 nonprofit jobs and impairing the ability of  nonprofits to address community needs.   Repatriating overseas corporate profit will stimulate the economy;  that is what we were told. U.S. multinationals currently have $752  billion in taxes on the $2.6 trillion in profits that they are holding  offshore. They have already found creative ways to use those dollars  here at home without paying taxes. Worse yet, the repatriation  provision helps conceal the permanent and growing costs of tax  provisions that would lose revenue over the next decade.   What is needed is linking tax breaks to specific targeted investment  here at home, such as the new market credit, which, as of the end of  fiscal year 2016, had generated $8 of private investment for every $1  of Federal funding; created 178 million square feet of manufacturing,  office, and retail space; and financed over 5,400 businesses.   We were told that we were going to be able to reduce health costs and  health insurance for everybody--failure again. The elimination of the  penalty for people who go without health insurance will result in some  13 million Americans losing their health insurance. That includes more  than 500,000 Illinois residents.   Healthcare premiums will rise by about 10 percent in most years, and  for the lowest income working families, with 10 million children under  17, there will either be no improvement in their child tax credit or a  token increase of $1 to $75. Low- and modest-income working families,  with another 14 million children, will receive a child tax credit  increase of more than $75 but less than the full $1,000 per child  increase that families at higher income levels would receive.   We were told that we were going to be able to file our taxes on a  postcard, simplify and reduce the size of the Tax Code. That is not  going to happen.   Final grade, corporations and the 1 percent--the wealthiest people in  the country--will win, and the rest of society will lose.   For me, Mr. Speaker, that is not an acceptable result. I could never  vote for this bill, so count me out. I vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H10176]]                                ____________________
