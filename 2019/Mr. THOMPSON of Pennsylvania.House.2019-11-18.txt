 Mr. Speaker, recently, I had the  pleasure of joining the Pennsylvania Game Commission for a briefing to  highlight the importance of bats and voluntary conservation. I was also  joined there by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   The U.S. bat population plays an important role in Pennsylvania's  ecosystem and agricultural industry. They also help producers with  insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal.   This is a good thing for our environment, too, and for the health of  our agricultural yields, because when the bat populations can eat  thousands of insects a night, that means fewer pesticides.   These creatures are truly amazing. Several years ago, it was that  vampire bat saliva could be used to create anti-stroke medication. With  more than 1,300 different species, the potential for lifesaving  medication, innovative agricultural practices, and any number of new  discoveries is limitless.   That is why I introduced H. Res. 663, to establish October 24 to  October 31 as Bat Week. Whether we realize it or not, bats play a role  in our everyday lives, and they deserve our commitment to conservation.                            ____________________
