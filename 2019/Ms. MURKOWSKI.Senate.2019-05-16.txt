 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the  countless men and women in Alaska and across the Nation who have  dedicated their talents to ensuring that young children and their  parents have the tools they need to succeed. I speak of all those  involved in their local Head Start and Early Head Start programs, the  program directors, teachers, aides, and parent leaders.   This week marks the 54th anniversary of Head Start and the 25th  anniversary of Early Head Start. Since 1964, more than 36 million  children have participated in Head Start, a program that research has  shown reduces intergenerational poverty by helping parents to gain  parenting, work, and leadership skills and which gives young children  at risk the academic, health, and nutritional services they need to  build a foundation for success.   Children who attend Head Start begin school with better literacy,  [[Page S2919]]  numeracy, cognitive, and behavioral skills than they otherwise would  have had. They are more likely to graduate and complete college. They  are more likely to live healthy, productive lives as adults. Today,  Head Start alumni are strong, resilient individuals who make positive  contributions to their communities as doctors, nurses, athletes,  parents, entrepreneurs, teachers, police officers, CEOs, authors,  artists, and more.   Head Start and Early Head Start are more important now than they ever  have been, helping families across the country so tragically hurt by  the opioid crisis. Head Start and Early Head Start directors, teachers,  aides, and parent leaders are on the frontlines, helping our most at- risk children survive and thrive in the face of the adverse childhood  experiences caused by homelessness, neglect, and abuse. They are there  in times of natural disaster, community violence, and personal crisis.  They are helping parents and grandparents provide stable and nurturing  environments. In Native communities, they are helping to revitalize  languages and strengthen traditional ways of knowing and living. Our  communities and the Nation as a whole are stronger because Head Start  and Early Head Start programs help millions of families find their way  to strength and resilience.   Head Start staff in Alaska and across the country are dedicated,  innovative, caring, and motivated people who work hard each and every  day to ensure that the children and families they serve have the tools  they need to achieve their full potential. Beyond the voluminous  research showing the positive impact of these programs, I know what  they do makes a lasting difference. When I visit elementary schools  across my State, principals tell me that the students who have  participated in Head Start are better prepared in every way for school.   So I take this opportunity to wish every Head Start and Early Head  Start staff member and participant. Happy anniversary. As a longtime  supporter, I recommit to doing all I can to ensure that our Head Start  and Early Head Start programs continue to make a positive difference  for many more years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Bill  Williams of Saxman, AK, a businessman, community leader, an Alaska  statesman, and my friend, who died on Sunday, May 12, just short of his  76th birthday.   Bill's story exemplifies how far one can go in Alaska if one works  hard and exhibits a devotion for community service. Bill was lifelong  Alaskan and a graduate of Ketchikan High School. He was a longshoreman,  a proud member of the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's  Union. He was a business leader, serving as president of the Cape Fox  Corporation, his ANCSA village corporation. He was a fisherman. He  served on the Saxman City Council and was mayor of Saxman. Bill was a  leader in the Alaska Native Brotherhood and Tlingit and Haida.   In 1993, Bill was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives,  serving until 2004. A strong advocate for development of Alaska's  natural resources and preservation of the traditional subsistence way  of life, Bill distinguished himself in the Alaska Legislature. He rose  to cochair the finance committee of the Alaska House of  Representatives, one of the most powerful positions in the State of  Alaska. Bill knew how to make deals, and because his word was his bond,  he knew how to keep a deal. I proudly served alongside Bill throughout  my tenure in the Alaska Legislature. He was both a friend and a mentor  to me.   Tributes are pouring in from those who knew and loved Bill Williams.  State Senator Bert Stedman, who is cochair of the senate finance  committee in the current legislative session, had this to say about  Bill: ``He understood that political differences don't need to divide  Alaskans. In the Capitol, he was known for keeping his words and  putting Alaska's interests above politics. He took the lead on both  subsistence and development issues. He was known for working with our  federal delegation and governors to keep jobs in the Tongass. He was a  strong voice on Alaska Native issues.''   The Ketchikan Daily News, in an editorial, remembered Bill as an  honorable man who represented the community and the region with quiet,  steadfast dignity: ``Those who met Williams would not likely forget  him. He was quiet and humble, possessing eyes of both twinkling good  humor and the glint of iron resolve. Others in public life learned  quickly not to underestimate the good representative from Saxman.''   Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has also reflected on the loss of Bill  Williams this week. Governor Dunleavy said, ``Real leaders do not come  along very often, so it is especially tough when we lose one with the  ability and character of Bill Williams. He worked both hard and smart  for the constituents and communities he represented.'' Governor  Dunleavy has ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff this week in  Bill's memory.   From the central council of Tlingit and Haida Tribes, ``Gunalcheesh,  Haw'aa to Bill for his lifelong dedication to Southeast Alaska and its  people.''  [[Page S2921]]    On behalf of my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate, I extend my  condolences to Bill's wife Caryl, his family, the Saxman community, and  all who hold this very special Alaskan dear in their hearts. It is a  privilege to honor the late Bill Williams, an outstanding Alaskan, in  the U.S. Senate today.                            ____________________
