 Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the important  legislation we are now considering.   Earlier this week, I explained some of the reasons the Senate needs  to consider tax reform legislation and gave a general overview of the  bill. Today I want to talk about some of the specific provisions of the  bill.  [[Page S7697]]    First, I want to talk about the relief this bill provides to hard- working Americans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces tax rates for  individuals, almost doubles the standard deduction, and doubles the  child tax credit. This will allow families to keep more of the money  they earn in their pockets. The independent Tax Foundation estimates  that this will amount to about $2,500 more in after-tax income for a  middle-income family in Wyoming.   This bill also will provide relief to small, family-owned businesses  that currently employ the majority of the private sector in Wyoming.  The bill cuts taxes for these businesses while enhancing deductions  that are important to them, like the section 179 deduction that  promotes business investment. The Tax Foundation believes changes like  this will add more than 1,700 full time jobs in my home State.   While these individual Tax Code provisions are important to so many  Wyomingites and small businesses in my home State, I am also especially  proud of the international tax provisions in this bill, which I worked  on with Senator Portman and Chairman Hatch.   Right now, our tax rules are written so that many businesses could be  better off if they are headquartered outside of the United States.  Those rules, which were written in the 1960s, are completely outdated.  Many of the U.S. major trading partners, including Canada, Japan, and  the U.K., have moved to what are called ``territorial'' tax systems.  Those systems tax the income generated within their borders and exempt  foreign earnings from tax.   The United States, on the other hand, taxes the worldwide income of  U.S. companies and provides deferral of U.S. tax until the foreign  earnings are brought home. Deferring the tax incentivizes companies to  leave their money abroad and invest it there. That is certainly not a  recipe for U.S. growth and U.S. job creation.   The dominance of U.S.-headquartered companies in the global  marketplace is waning. In 2000, 36 percent of the Fortune Global 500  companies were headquartered in the United States. In 2009, that number  dropped to 28 percent. In 2017, we are down to 26 percent. Clearly,  America is losing ground, and our international tax rules are part of  the problem.   I have been working to change that since the 112th Congress, when I  introduced the United States Job Creation and International Tax Reform  Act. My goal then was to incentivize American companies to create jobs  in the United States while leveling the playing field for U.S.  companies in the global marketplace. I believe the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act achieves that goal.   This bill would reform and modernize the rules for taxing the global  operations of American companies. These reforms, along with reducing  our corporate tax rate, would help make America a more attractive  location to base a business that serves customers around the world.   With these provisions in law, families would hear fewer stories about  how U.S. companies are moving their profits to tax haven countries and  avoiding U.S. tax on those earnings. Families would hear fewer stories  about how U.S. multinational companies set up post office boxes in the  Cayman Islands and Switzerland without an employee or officer of the  company anywhere in sight and attribute a significant portion of their  foreign earnings to these jurisdictions. Instead, families would hear  more stories about how U.S. companies are generating the ideas and  inventions of tomorrow right here in America.   The international tax rules are not easy or simple, and a lot of work  went into these provisions. I want to again thank Senator Portman and  Chairman Hatch for their work with me in this area. I look forward to  continuing to work with them and the rest of my colleagues to pass this  bill that our country desperately needs.   Thank you.    Madam President, the Sanders amendment is nongermane and  would gut this legislation. The bill before us does not cut Social  Security. It does not cut Medicare. It does not cut Medicaid benefits.  So I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment and--does  the Senator have any time remaining?    I yield back the remainder of my time.   The pending amendment No. 1720 does not produce a change in outlays  or a change in revenues, and this is extraneous to the instruction in  H. Con. Res. 71, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal  year 2018. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure  pursuant to section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of  1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Madam President, while this amendment expands the child tax  credit provisions, it makes the credit available to fewer taxpayers. It  also raises the corporate tax rate to 25 percent. The underlying bill  already provides for a generous enhanced child tax credit with  increased refundability that reaches far up into the middle class,  giving relief to millions of families.   This amendment would undermine the balance struck in the drafting of  this bill and diminish its potential to generate growth.   Has all time expired?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has not expired. The Senator has 20  seconds.    The pending amendment No. 1854 would cause the underlying  legislation to exceed the Finance Committee's section 302(a) allocation  of new budget authority or outlays. Therefore, I raise a point of order  against this measure pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, earlier this week, I said it was historic  that we began the consideration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Today is  even more  [[Page S7713]]  significant because we are one step closer to enacting that bill.   The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, has called this  a once-in-a-generation opportunity. I agree.   As an accountant, one of my goals when I came to the Senate in 1996  was to serve on the Finance Committee. When I joined the committee in  2009, I said that positive, pro-growth changes to our tax policy could  help us out of the economic downturn. I believe this bill makes those  types of changes and will jump-start our economy.   This week, 137 economists agreed with that assessment. In a letter to  Senators and Representatives, these economists wrote: ``Economic growth  will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more  jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American  people.''   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle dispute that analysis.  But after a decade of below-average growth and official projections  showing real economic growth will average less than 2 percent annually  over the next decade, isn't it time that we tried something new?   Some of my colleagues have also suggested that this bill hasn't gone  through regular order. I have already reminded folks of the 70 tax  hearings in the Senate Finance Committee held over the last 6 years,  but that isn't all we have done. In the last Congress, Chairman Hatch  organized five bipartisan groups to propose changes to the Tax Code. I  was party to those groups, which made many recommendations that have  informed this package. I would say that those working groups were also  bipartisan.   While I don't sit on the Energy Committee, I understand that Chairman  Murkowski led a similarly robust process. The issue of oil and gas  exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has  been an issue since before I was a Senator. We have been considering  and debating the matter for years. This year alone, Senator Murkowski  has introduced a bill, held a hearing, and then marked up legislation  on this issue. Now the bill that is a product of the Finance and Energy  Committee's efforts is on the floor.   We have not bypassed committees. We have not filled the tree. We have  not cut off debate by filing cloture, which was a common practice in  recent years. I think this is as open and transparent a process as I  have seen in many years, and I appreciate the leader, I appreciate  Chairman Hatch, and I appreciate Chairman Murkowski for their work to  make that happen.   I also want to thank my Budget Committee staff for their work on this  bill. In particular, I want to thank my staff director, Betsy  McDonnell, who has done a remarkable job shepherding both the budget  resolution and reconciliation bill through the committee and on the  floor. She has been new to that position. She has been in a number of  positions in the Senate that trained her well to be able to do that,  and she did a marvelous job.   I also want to thank her team: Matt Giroux, Paul Vinovich, Becky  Cole, Thomas Fuller, Elizabeth Keys, Joe Brenckle, Jim Neill, Steve  Robinson, Greg D'Angelo, Tom Borck, Rick Berger, Jeremy Dalrymple,  David Ditch, Susan Eckerly, Alison McGuire, Will Morris, Steve  Townsend, Kelsie Wendelberger, and Eric Ueland.   I would like to thank my personal office staff who worked hard on the  tax provisions in this package and kept all of my other issues going at  the same time. Particularly, I want to thank Bart Massey, who is a CPA  and who has been my special person to work on these finance issues with  me for more than 3 years.   I also want to thank Tara Shaw, my chief of staff, who had to put  together a new staff because a lot of good people I had were taken to  the administration and to the Budget Committee. She did a marvelous job  on that.   Landon Stropko is the legislative director, and he has coordinated  well. I thank Liz Schwartz, Natalia Riggin, Aniela Butler, Charlie  Carroll, Shawna Newsome, Garnett Decosimo, Chris Lydon, Aron Wehr,  Dylan Mitchell, Coy Knobel, Max D'Onofrio, Rachel Vliem, and the rest  of my Wyoming team that worked out in Wyoming collecting the  information and doing casework out there while we got this work done.   I thank the Budget Committee's bipartisan staff: Kim Proctor, Katie  Smith, George Woodall, Grace Bruno, and Kevin Walsh, as well as Celina  Inman, who has been on loan to us from the Government Publishing  Office.   We have also been supported by the great work of our leadership, the  floor, and the cloakroom staff. Specific thanks are owed to Sharon  Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane Lee, Brandon Dunn in the leader's  office, Monica Popp, John Chapuis, Emily Kirlin, Sam Beaver, Jody  Wright, and Noah McCullough in the whip's office and especially Laura  Dove, who coordinates all of this activity on the floor and who knows  the rules backward and forward and is able to give good advice--some  very definite advice sometimes but always helpful advice--and Robert  Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Mike Smith, Katherine  Kilroy, and Chloe Barz in the cloakroom.   I would really be remiss if we didn't thank the Senate  Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team: Leigh Hilderbrand,  Michael Beaver, and Allison Markoski. Reconciliation bills are subject  to special rules and procedures, and I know they have given up a lot of  their nights and their weekends, as well as their regular job time, to  work in detail on this product. People wouldn't even realize the file  cabinets full of precedents that they have to search through as they  listen to both sides make cases about what can and can't be in a budget  reconciliation bill.   There are also many other staffers who deserve to be thanked for  their work on this product, including the entire Finance and Energy  Committee staffs, but in the interest of time, I will just say that I  appreciate them and look forward to working with all of them to help  finish enacting this bill that will benefit hard-working Americans and  make our economy and country stronger.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar Nos. 510 through 522  and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk; that the  nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative  session.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 3003 of H. Con. Res. 71, the  concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, allows the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations,  aggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation  considered under the resolution's reconciliation instructions.   I find that S. Amdt. 1855 fulfills the conditions found in section  3003 of H. Con. Res. 71. Accordingly, I am revising the allocations to  the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources, and other enforceable budgetary levels to account for the  budgetary effects of the amendment.   This adjustment supersedes the adjustment I previously made for the  processing of S. Amdt. 1618 on November 29, 2017. This adjustment  applies while this amendment is under consideration. Should the  amendment be withdrawn or fail, this adjustment will be null and void  and the adjustment for S. Amdt. 1618 shall remain active.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.
