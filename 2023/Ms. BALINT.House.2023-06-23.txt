 Mr. Speaker, I often say that Vermont is held together  with duct tape, twine, and hundreds of volunteer hours.   I rise today to highlight the work of Lewis Lyman Sumner. His 54-year  commitment to the Halifax community has been immeasurably impactful. He  served for over half a century on the Halifax Select Board and gave 6  years of service to the National Guard. He is also a 50-year member of  the Grange--such incredible public service.   The Sumner family has deep roots in Halifax and has been a staple in  that community since they settled there in 1783. Lewis and his family  continue to operate their family farm.   Lewis served his community as emergency management director for eight  FEMA disasters, working tirelessly to keep Vermonters safe during these  emergencies.   Lewis and his wife, Laura, are both dedicated public servants. Laura  served as town clerk for 43 years until her retirement in 2010.   I close by thanking Lewis, Laura, and their family for their years of  service to southern Vermont.                            ____________________
