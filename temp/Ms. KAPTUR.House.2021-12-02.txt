 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to address this latest short-term budget fix  before us. We have a bipartisan responsibility to pass a full-year  appropriations package. Democrats have worked in good faith to find  common ground that will allow us to meet our national obligations to  the American people and deliver essential services that they expect.   Unfortunately, Republicans have decided that engaging in partisan  politics and throwing up needless speed bumps in delays and roadblocks  is more important than doing their job.   The people harmed most by this obstruction are the hardworking  families,  [[Page H6875]]  seniors, and veterans I represent. In fact, our Great Lakes region  deserves so much better, and Americans deserve better. Let's govern our  Nation. No more stalls.   Our bipartisan Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee worked diligently to craft a forward-thinking bill. It  invests new resources to meet America's needs and create good jobs in  clean energy and water technologies allowing us to secure our Nation's  energy independence, create good-paying jobs, and confront the climate  crisis that is impacting every coast in every region and, frankly,  continent.   A full-year bill will ensure our water resource agencies are able to  meet the needs of the American people and solidify our waterway and  port infrastructure driving our economy forward, meeting the backlogs  that are there, and creating good jobs from coast to coast.   The people's business must be conducted, and for the sake of our  Nation, Republicans should work in a constructive manner, not  destructive.   We look forward to passing these bills and investing in the American  people. For now, I urge my colleagues to support this bridge to the  future and move our Nation forward again.                                time  1530
