 Mr. Speaker, I will vote ``yes'' on the HEROES Act  today because it will help the small towns I represent and keep our  first responders on the job. I wish that my colleagues would listen to  the Republican and Democratic local leaders who are pleading with us to  do that.   I will vote ``yes'' because it pays for the testing we desperately  need to go back to work safely.   I will vote ``yes'' because it will help every American exercise our  right to vote without jeopardizing our right to life.   I don't expect Senator McConnell to agree with everything in this  bill, but the time has come for him to start negotiating and find  common ground.
