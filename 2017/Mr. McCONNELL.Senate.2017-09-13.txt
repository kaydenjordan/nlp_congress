 Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act  is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the  Senate each and every year. It is, after all, the measure that  authorizes the resources, the capabilities, and the pay and benefits  that our men and women in uniform need to perform their mission. It is  always worth remembering that our country fields an all-volunteer  force. We owe a special obligation to all those who volunteer to fight  on behalf of each and every one of us.   This year the bill, thanks to the good work of the Armed Services  Committee under the leadership of Chairman McCain and Ranking Member  Reed, passed out of committee with unanimous bipartisan support. It  recommends a national defense level of authorization that will allow  the Department of Defense to begin to rebuild our military and deliver  a well-deserved pay raise to our men and women in uniform. That is  especially important today. Our Nation faces a myriad of challenges  around the world from both state actors and terror organizations that  threaten American national security. These growing pressures require  that our forces have the training and resources they need to combat  those challenges and win.   Yet, due to a combination of the last administration's actions and  the harmful consequences of sequestration, our military does not have  the resources it needs to address the many global challenges before us  in either a comprehensive or responsible way. We have to keep faith  with the force. So we have to correct this situation, and doing so  means equipping our servicemembers with the weapons and the training  they need to sufficiently defeat these threats.   As I said yesterday, this spring's government funding bill made an  important down payment toward rebuilding our forces, and the NDAA bill  before us can build upon that progress further. As we consider the  NDAA, I remain firmly committed to the men and women in the Armed  Forces, including to those stationed in my home State.   I am proud to represent three Army installations and the Kentucky Air  and Army National Guard. One of these installations, Fort Campbell in  Christian County, is home to the 101st Airborne Division, the 5th  Special Forces Group, and the 160th Special Operations Aviation  Regiment.   Since World War II, the 101st Airborne Division has responded to  threats around the globe, including, most recently, during multiple  deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. This highly decorated unit, known  as the Screaming Eagles, is contributing to keeping our Nation and  national interests secure.   The NDAA will authorize the resources and capabilities to ensure that  the troops at Fort Campbell, as part of the joint force, are prepared  to continue responding to threats against our Nation.   Another Kentucky military installation is Fort Knox. With a  distinguished history during both World Wars, Fort Knox has remained an  essential Army facility with numerous responsibilities. Home to the  Army's Cadet Command, Fort Knox hosts about 10,000 ROTC cadets every  summer for Cadet Summer  [[Page S5244]]  Training. Fort Knox is also home to the Army's Recruiting Command--a  critical mission for increasing readiness--and in 2009, the Army Human  Resources Command center relocated to Fort Knox, bringing with it an  entirely new mission. Responsible for career management and  development, the Human Resources Command represents a fundamental part  of the Army.   The NDAA will reform the Pentagon to streamline administration, and  it will also take action to improve troop morale and restructure the  benefits that servicemembers and their families, like the many  stationed in Kentucky, rely upon.   Kentucky is also home to the Blue Grass Army Depot, located in  Madison County. As a munitions storage and disposal site, the Blue  Grass Army Depot is responsible for the maintenance, storage, and  demilitarization of both conventional and legacy chemical weapons. For  decades I have fought to ensure that Congress allocated necessary funds  to this installation to support the continuation of safe  demilitarization efforts.   The NDAA will help us prepare for a wide range of threats, and  munitions depots like the one in my State play an integral role in  supporting our Nation's efforts to rebuild our military.   I am also proud to represent the Kentucky Air and Army National  Guard, including the 123rd Airlift Wing, which deployed to assist in  the relief efforts of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma.   Last week, I had the privilege of welcoming the National Guard  Association of the United States to Louisville for their annual  conference. These citizen soldiers and airmen have proved time and  again that during a crisis at home or abroad, the National Guard is  always ready.   The NDAA legislation will authorize funds for military construction  for National Guard units across the country, including in Kentucky to  help the Guard carry out its critical missions.   As we continue to debate this bill, I will be thinking of these men  and women at these military installations in Kentucky and of the  Kentucky National Guard. I will cast my vote for what will help them  receive the equipment, training, and resources they need to address the  threats facing our Nation.   I know many colleagues feel the same way about their own States. I  know many colleagues are determined to continue the hard work of  rebuilding our military and restoring our combat readiness. Passing the  bill before us will take us closer to that goal.   Also, Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote to table an  amendment that would rescind the authorization for the use of military  force, or AUMF, which authorizes the operations of forces currently  battling al-Qaida, ISIL, and associated forces. Sixteen years after the  terrorist attacks of September 11, our enemies are not gone and our  troops are still in harm's way.   Ayman al-Zawahiri remains hidden somewhere in the tribal areas of  Pakistan, and he continues to lead al-Qaida as he plots to kill  Americans and strike our homeland. Al-Qaida's affiliates have proved to  be resilient and lethal. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has not  ceased attempting to kill Americans. Its online magazine, Inspire,  created a manual for terrorists and set an early example for what ISIL  perfected in the use of social media and propaganda.   ISIL, of course, emerged from al-Qaida in Iraq, which continues to  threaten the United States, as does the al-Nusrah Front.   To rescind the AUMF that authorizes action against these forces--and  to leave nothing but uncertainty for our deployed forces and our  allies--is simply irresponsible, and it breaks faith with our volunteer  force.   Al-Qaida and its affiliates have not been defeated. The myriad  programs and operations that rely upon the AUMF for legal authority  have contributed to keeping America safe.   Why would we vote to rescind the authority to defeat al-Qaida and  leave our forces in the field questioning whether the elected officials  here in Washington have any understanding as to what is occurring in  the theaters of active hostilities? All that we do to defeat al-Qaida  and ISIL rests on this AUMF.   We honored those killed on September 11 earlier this week. Let's  honor those pursuing terrorists by defeating this amendment and  ensuring they have the tools they need to keep us safe.   Once again, we have an all-volunteer force that protects all of us  and fights for us. We cannot break faith with these brave men and women  by removing the authority they rely upon to pursue the enemy and  leaving them questioning whether elected officials in Washington  understand what they are doing abroad.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks, there be 60 minutes of debate on the motion to proceed  to H.R. 2810, equally divided between Senator McCain and Senator Reed.    Mr. President, it is with deep regret that I announce  to the Senate the passing of our dear friend and colleague Senator Pete  Domenici.   Pete had a long and notable career, one that took him from pitching  on the baseball diamond to teaching mathematics at an Albuquerque  junior high school, from city politics to the U.S. Senate.   In fact, when he ran for the Senate in 1972, Domenici became the  first Republican elected from his home State in nearly four decades. By  the time he retired, he did so as the longest serving Senator in New  Mexico history. Like others in this Chamber, I served for a number of  years with Senator Domenici. I came to know him as smart, hard-working,  dedicated and as a very strong advocate for his home State of New  Mexico.   We are all saddened by this news today. The Senate offers its  condolences to Senator Domenici's family and especially his wife Nancy.    Mr. President, I call up the Paul amendment No. 871.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Madam President, I call up amendment No. 545.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the McCain substitute amendment No. 1003, as modified.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the underlying bill, H.R. 2810.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls with respect to the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for  consideration of Calendar No. 109, the nomination of Pamela Patenaude  to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development. I further ask that there be 40 minutes of debate on the  nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that following the use  or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the confirmation with no  intervening action or debate; and that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 293.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate and that, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate return to legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
