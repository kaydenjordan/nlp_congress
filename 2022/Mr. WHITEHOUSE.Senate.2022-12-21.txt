 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the       order for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, I am here to profess my appreciation       to Senator Tom Cotton and to our colleague Senator Bob Menendez,       Chairman Menendez, for their persistence in achieving a vote here on       what is now called Senate amendment No. 6560, which would expand the       U.S. Victims of State-Sponsored Terrorism Fund's coverage to the       American victims of the Beirut bombing.        This matters a lot to Rhode Island because October 23, 1983, the day       when a truck full of explosives drove into the Marine barracks in       Beirut and exploded, killing 241 servicemen, was probably the bloodiest       day for Rhode Island in any war at any time in our history. There was       an unusually high deployment of Rhode Islanders there. Nine were killed       that day, including two brothers-in-law. So some families took a       terrible, terrible blow.        I am just very grateful that Senator Cotton put the relentless       initiative into making sure that it happened and to Chairman Menendez       for supporting that, allowing that to happen. And I hope in my own way       I was also able to clear some of the obstacles and the difficulties to       make sure we had this vote.        I strongly urge all of my colleagues, let's get together on this, and       let's pass this amendment, and let's make sure the victims of the       Beirut bombing of the Marine barracks is not forgotten.        Two things happen on this anniversary in Rhode Island. One is that at       the Portsmouth Historical Society, a memorial ceremony is conducted. It       is a beautiful old building, and we go upstairs, where there is a       really nice, very old-fashioned auditorium. There is usually a very       impressive speaker, very often from the Naval War College, almost       inevitably a U.S. marine.        The marines were the casualties that day. It is an important day for       the U.S. Marines, and with my dad having served as a U.S. marine in       World War II, it means something to me as well to have this take place.        We have also built a memorial to those Rhode Islanders along the       shore of the Providence River. Providence is known for its WaterFire,       where they light braziers around the river. It is right along that       riverway where this beautiful glass memorial is, and we go to that as       well.        So this is a big deal, and I just want to take a moment, as we have a       chance on the Senate floor, to make sure that the names of those Rhode       Islanders are remembered. They were Sgt Timothy Giblin; Cpl Rick R.       Crudale; Cpl Edward S. Iacovino, Jr.; Cpl David C. Massa; Cpl Thomas A.       Shipp; Cpl Edward Soares, Jr.; Cpl James F. Silvia; Cpl Stephen E.       Spencer; and LCpl Thomas A. Julian.        In their honor, colleagues, I commend to all of you an ``aye'' vote       on the Cotton-Menendez amendment.        I should make one small correction. I shall also add a thank-you to       Senator Dan Sullivan, a Marine colonel, who serves here as well and who       has been very supportive of this effort. So to Dan, to Tom, to Bob, and       mostly to all of the families who remember with such love these lost       lives, my appreciation.        I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.
