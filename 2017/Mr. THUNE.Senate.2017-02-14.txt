 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks before the Senate recesses.    Mr. President, yesterday we began yet another week of  considering Cabinet nominations in the Senate--our fourth week, to be  precise--and we still have a long way to go. If anyone is wondering  whether this is a normal confirmation process, the answer is no, it is  not. Historically, Senate practice has been to quickly confirm a  President's Cabinet nominees. President Obama had six nominees  confirmed on his first day as President and nearly all the rest within  the first 2 weeks. This tradition of speedy confirmation goes back a  long way. By the point in every Presidency since President  Eisenhower's, most, if not all, of the President's Cabinet nominees had  been confirmed by now. Between 1881 and 1933, every incoming President  had all of his Cabinet nominees confirmed on day one.   What is the reason for this? Historically, Senators of both parties  have recognized that Cabinet officials play an essential part in  getting an administration up and running, doing the business of the  American people. Once the American people elect a President, the  thinking historically has gone that it is only right that the President  be given the advisers he needs to do the job he was elected to do--that  is, until now.   This year, Democrats decided that they have had enough of timely  Cabinet confirmations, that they have had enough of bipartisanship.  Since President Trump was inaugurated, Democrats have done everything  they can to drag out his Cabinet nominations. We don't have to take my  word for it; here is what Politico had to say:         Senate Democrats . . . are slow-walking the installation of       Trump's Cabinet to a historic degree. . . . They are voting       against Trump's Cabinet picks in unprecedented numbers.    Two weeks ago, the Washington Post published a piece titled ``Trump's  confirmations really are taking longer than his predecessors.''   ``Democrats,'' the Post noted, ``have tried to slow the process,  invoking arcane parliamentary procedure to force delays, and boycotting  committee meetings to prevent votes.''   For a party that has spent a lot of time complaining about  obstruction, Democrats really are taking it to new heights. Thanks to  Democrats' obstruction, the Senate has had to spend so much time  confirming nominees that we have had very little time for actual  legislative business. We still have a long way to go to finish  confirming the President's Cabinet, unless the Democrats decide to stop  their obstruction. Democrats aren't even really accomplishing anything  with their delays.    Thanks to the rules change that they put in place in 2013--that was  something that was engineered in 2013 where they literally broke the  rules to change the rules--they can't actually prevent President  Trump's nominees from being confirmed. The only thing they can do is to  tie up the business of the Senate and delay work on legislation to  address the challenges that are facing American families.   Democrats may not like President Trump, but it is high time they get  used to the fact that he is our President. Democrats are not helping  anyone by preventing the President from having a fully functioning  administration. It is time for Democrats to abandon the obstruction,  confirm the President's nominees, and allow the Senate to move forward  with the business of the American people.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. President, in addition to Cabinet nominees, the Senate will be  considering another key nomination in the coming weeks, and that is  Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.   I met with Judge Gorsuch last week, and our meeting confirmed my  opinion that President Trump could not have made a better pick for the  Court. By now, I think Judge Gorsuch's qualifications are well known:  his exceptional intelligence, his gift for the written word, his  outstanding resume, and, most of all, his clear understanding of the  proper role of a judge.   In his remarks at the White House after accepting the nomination,  Judge Gorsuch spoke of judges' obligation to follow the law ``as they  find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs.''   ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad  judge.'' Judge Gorsuch has said those words more than once. Why?  Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making  decisions based on something other than the law.   That is a problem. The job of a judge is to interpret the law, not  write it--to call the balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of  the game. Everyone's rights are put in jeopardy when judges step  outside of their role and start changing the meaning of the law to suit  their personal opinions.   Judge Gorsuch doesn't just understand judges' responsibility; he  lives it. He has won respect from liberals and conservatives alike for  his deep commitment to following the law wherever  [[Page S1149]]  it leads, even when he doesn't like the results.   Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President  Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:         I have seen him up close and in action, both in court and       on the Federal Appellate Rules Committee (where both of us       serve); he brings a sense of fairness and decency to the job,       and a temperament that suits the nation's highest court. . .       . I, for one, wish it were a Democrat choosing the next       justice.        But since that is not to be, one basic criteria should be       paramount: Is the nominee someone who will stand up for the       rule of law and say no to a president or Congress that strays       beyond the Constitution and laws?        I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help       to restore confidence in the rule of law.        His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial       independence--a record that should give the American people       confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the       president who appointed him.    Again, those are not the words of a Republican. That is what Neal  Katyal, formerly an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had  to say about Judge Gorsuch. It is pretty high praise coming from a  Democrat.   One of the Democrats' favorite tactics is to accuse Republican  nominees of being extremists, no matter how mainstream they actually  are. No matter how hard they try, I don't think they are going to have  much success with that tactic against Judge Gorsuch.   When liberal after liberal attests to his fairness and impartiality,  it is pretty hard to pretend he is anything but an excellent pick for  the Supreme Court.   Then there are the stats from his time on the Tenth Circuit. Last  week, the Wall Street Journal reported:         Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining       the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006.        Only 1.75 percent (14 opinions) drew dissents from his       colleagues.        That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous, even on a       circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by       Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans.    So it is a very divided circuit court in terms of the composition.  Let me repeat that last line.         That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a       circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by       Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans.    When 98 percent of your opinions are unanimous, it is pretty much  impossible to argue that you are somehow outside of the judicial  mainstream. Very few of Judge Gorsuch's decisions have gone to the  Supreme Court. When they have, they have been almost universally  upheld--often, unanimously. I wish Democrats luck in portraying Judge  Gorsuch as an extremist. I think they are going to have a very uphill  climb.   Both liberals and conservatives recognize that Judge Gorsuch is a  supremely qualified jurist who would make a terrific addition to the  Supreme Court. I hope that Senate Democrats will listen to the  consensus in favor of his nomination and abandon their threats of  obstruction. Democrats spend a lot of time talking about the importance  of confirming a ninth Justice to the Court. Now they are going to have  a chance to confirm an outstanding nominee. I hope they take it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I withhold my suggestion.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have four requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
