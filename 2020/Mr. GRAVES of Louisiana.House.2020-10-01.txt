 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I thank my friend from Michigan, and I want to thank Chairman  Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop for their work on this legislation,  the DESCEND Act.   Mr. Speaker, years ago, the Federal Government tried to tell our  communities--all of us grew up fishing and, many, for sustenance and  for recreation. It is our outdoors. The Federal Government told us that  we would only get 3 to 9 days to fish for red snapper.   Mr. Speaker, when I was a kid, we did it year-round. That is our  recreation. As much as I would love to have them, we don't have  mountains and the other recreational opportunities that go along with  those types of elevation changes.   I will say it again: Fishing is our outdoors. It is what we do at  home, and that was being taken away from us.   Congressman Huffman from California and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker,  we totally disagreed on the solution there. He and I butted heads for  years trying to work through a solution. On this bill, my most-of-the- time friend Mr. Huffman and I are in lockstep. We are joined as  cosponsors on this bill and are moving this one together because we  believe this is the right solution, as you heard Mrs. Dingell just  explain.   What happens is that we do have a season on red snapper. You can only  fish for a certain number of days a year, yet you can't tell which fish  is going to bite your line when it is down under the water.   Red snapper spend the majority of their life at 100 feet or below.  They have a swim bladder, as was explained, that operates somewhat like  a ballast and allows them to stay at certain depths. When they are  caught and reeled in, they are brought up too fast. The ballast does  not exhaust, and, therefore, you have a fish that cannot go back down.   They have technologies, Mr. Speaker, as simple as ones like this, a  descending device like this, where you can release the fish back down  at the proper depth. They have venting tools that look like a fortified  straw that also can help release the pressure. They are very easy tools  to use.   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about 2\1/2\ million fish every 5 years  that are discarded or lost. If we are having conflicts between  recreational and commercial fishers in terms of the access to the  fisheries, the pounds, the days, and we are discarding 2\1/2\ million  fish every 5 years, it is a huge opportunity for us to actually grow  the pie, and, as my friend from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell) stated, to  actually ensure the sustainability of these fisheries not just for us,  but for our children and grandchildren for generations to come. It is a  better management tool, and it is successfully used in other areas.   This legislation would provide for the use of descending and venting  tools as well as freeing up additional research dollars associated with  red snapper and descending tool use and the further management of the  fisheries.   So I want to thank, again, Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member  Bishop for their work. I want to thank Bill Ball, Christine Sur, Lora  Snyder, and all the staff that did a great job working on this, as well  as Dustin Davidson in our office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.  [[Page H5178]]    I want to thank my friend from Georgia. I appreciate him bringing  that cute little picture of the fish for us to see the size. Of course,  that fish was actually born in Louisiana and swam over there.   I did notice, Mr. Speaker, in the picture, my friend from Georgia  appeared to be more slim than he is today, and so my explanation  earlier of the swim bladder, perhaps my friend from Georgia's swim  bladder is a little elevated right now from not being able to go to the  gym.   In any case, Mr. Speaker, I do seriously want to thank my friend from  Georgia, all the Republicans and Democrats, and Mr. Wittman from  Virginia, everyone, for coming together and working on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Sportfishing Association, Angler Action Association, BoatUS, Center for  Sportfishing Policy, Coastal Conservation Association, Congressional  Sportsmen's Foundation, Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, International Game  Fish Association, Marine Retailers Association of the Americas,  National Marine Manufacturers Association, Theodore Roosevelt  Conservation Partnership, and Wild Oceans that expresses support for  the legislation.                                                September 29, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader McCarthy: On       behalf of the nation's recreational fishing and boating       community, thank you for bringing H.R. 5126, Direct       Enhancement of Snapper Conservation and the Economy through       Novel Devices Act of 2020 (DESCEND Act), to the floor of the       U.S. House of Representatives. The DESCEND Act unanimously       passed the Committee on Natural Resources on March 11. We       urge final passage of this bill sponsored by Congressmen       Garret Graves (R-La.) and Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and thank       them for their leadership in support of Gulf of Mexico reef       fish conservation.        The Gulf of Mexico's recreational fisheries contribute       $13.5 billion to the economy annually and support 138,817       jobs. The region's recreational fishing community is       comprised of 2.6 million saltwater anglers and thousands of       fishing-dependent businesses who strongly support healthy       marine resources. Part of this commitment to conservation       includes minimizing bycatch and maximizing survival of       released fish to ensure the health of our fisheries for       generations to come.        Red snapper and other reef fish are often thrown overboard       for a variety of reasons (e.g., being caught out of season or       undersized). Due to the rapid change in pressure from being       brought to the surface from depth many of these fish cannot       swim back down and end up dying at the surface. As a result,       hundreds of thousands of Gulf red snapper are wasted each       year. This is an economic and conservation travesty.       Unfortunately, a bureaucratic roadblock related to an       important oil spill recovery-funded project has prevented       regulation from moving forward at the Gulf of Mexico Fishery       Management Council that would address this problem.        For fisheries as important and valuable as Gulf reef fish,       we should be doing everything we can to conserve these fish       stocks. By requiring reef fish fishermen in the Gulf of       Mexico to possess devices that help fish avoid the fatal       effects of barotrauma, and by clarifying that oil spill       recovery funds can be used for related projects, the DESCEND       Act would be a tremendous step toward reducing wasteful       discard mortality and ensuring the sustainability of the       iconic Gulf red snapper and other reef fish. Furthermore, it       would align Gulf regulations with several West Coast states       and South Atlantic federal waters where descending devices       are required on board.        We are grateful for the many victories during this Congress       benefiting natural resource conservation, and we hope you       will add to that legacy by passing the science-based       conservation measures included in the DESCEND Act.            Sincerely,        American Sportfishing Association, Angler Action       Foundation, BoatU.S., Center for Sportfishing Policy, Coastal       Conservation Association, Congressional Sportsmen's       Foundation.        Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation, International Game Fish       Association, Marine Retailers Association of the Americas,       National Marine Manufacturers Association, Theodore Roosevelt       Conservation Partnership, Wild Oceans.     Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank a  number of people who were really instrumental in helping us to strike  this bipartisan balance: Mike Leonard with the American Sportfishing  Association; Cmac, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation  Partnership; David Cresson and Rad Trascher with the Coastal  Conservation Association; and Jeff Angers with the Center for  Sportsfishing Policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  West Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Sam  Graves for their work on this legislation.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, this is a demonstration of bipartisan  cooperation, what we were sent here to do, as opposed to the politics  that we have all seen that have hijacked our government in recent  months. The reality is that they are real needs of the American public,  and this is an example of that.   This legislation is very simple. Airports are not like traditional  roadways. You have a runway that is usually, at most airports, one  runway, and that is it. So when that runway goes down, that airport  can't function. You can't have flights come in. You can't have  commercial or general aviation operations. So this legislation, very  simply, allows for incentive-based contracting, where you can reduce  the amount of time that it takes you to do your construction project.  It diminishes delays on vacations, family visits, business travel, and  all the important things that are facilitated by our aviation  infrastructure by airports.   Again, it simply allows us to more quickly address safety issues,  capacity issues, and expansion issues in airports. The bottom line is  this ultimately is a saver for taxpayers, because if we can resume  operations, it allows the traveling public to advance and the economy  to flow, and it allows aviation taxes to also continue flowing.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. DeFazio, Congressman Larsen,  Congressman Sam Graves, and all those who worked together on this  important legislation, and I urge adoption.
