 Mr. Speaker, I request the press corps one more time  that sometime, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps sometime next week, to release  the new numbers of people coming  [[Page H5667]]  across our southern border, what we sometimes refer to as illegal  aliens.   It is a story the press should never get tired of reporting, but  apparently, they are. I remind them that every month lately 230,000  people cross our border, about 11 times the number of people who were  crossing the border a little over 2 years ago. Of those, 70,000 are  got-aways, which means they don't even go through the perfunctory  checking in that you do if you ask for asylum. About 9,000 are  unaccompanied minors.   It seems to me, about 5 years ago we were screaming bloody murder  about families being torn apart when people were held apart from their  parents who were breaking the law for just a couple weeks. Here we have  9,000 people who are permanently coming across the border without their  parents, and apparently, we don't even care. Indeed, the Biden  administration has stopped asking for DNA tests to sometimes see if  they are related.   We are told by the Border Patrol that the people coming across are  more aggressive than they have been in the past.   No issue is more important than this. If the press corps is on the  ball in this country, we should be reporting every day, every week, the  number of people coming across the border, as well as the countries  they are coming across from.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 32 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday next,  November 13, 2023, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
