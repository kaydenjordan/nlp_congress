 Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The bill before us today fixes a drafting error from legislation  enacted last December. The unintentional error occurred accidentally  against a longstanding rule under which California is able to use  Medicaid funding to reimburse hospitals serving uninsured and Medicaid  patients.   Today's bill fixes that drafting error. It makes no other changes to  law and does not provide additional funds to California or any other  State. CBO says that this provision has no budgetary effect.   Because of the sheer number of Medicaid and uninsured patients that  receive care in California's safety net hospitals, Congress, in 1997,  granted the State additional flexibility. It can use Federal funds it  receives to cover hospital expenses for those in need.   If the Scott amendment passes, hospital care for half of the children  in California and the vulnerable populations most affected by COVID  would be at risk.   Please vote no on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1411
