 Mr. President, the bipartisan government funding bill       before this body is imperfect but strong. It will make huge new       investments in our Armed Forces, while cutting nondefense, nonveterans       baseline spending in real dollars.        So let me say that again. The world's greatest military will get the       funding increases that it needs, outpacing inflation. Meanwhile,       nondefense, nonveterans spending will come in below the rate of       inflation for a real dollar cut.        This is a debate about American security, American servicemembers,       and American interests on the world stage.        Month after month, year after year, competitors such as China are       methodically pouring money and planning into upgrading and modernizing       their own militaries. They are constantly probing new ways to expand       their military, intelligence, economic, and political reach, indirectly       or directly threatening American forces and our allies' and partners'       forces.        So under these perilous circumstances, cutting defense spending in       real dollars, as Democrats first wanted to do, is simply not an option.        And embarking on a potentially endless cycle of continuing       resolutions that give our military real dollar funding cuts because of       inflation and giving Defense Department leaders no certainty whatsoever       to either plan or to invest is simply not an option that we can adopt.        There is no question the bipartisan funding bill is certainly       imperfect. If Senate Republicans controlled this Chamber, we would have       handled the appropriations process entirely differently from top to       bottom.        But given the reality of where we stand today, Senators have two       options this week--just two: We either give our Armed Forces the       resources and the certainty that they need, or we will deny it to them.        Finally, on a related matter, today, Members of Congress will have       the opportunity to assemble in a joint meeting and hear from President       Zelenskyy of Ukraine.        I look forward to welcoming President Zelenskyy to the Capitol and to       hearing from the Ukrainian people's elected leader at a critical moment       in their struggle for their safety and their sovereignty against       Russia's unhinged aggression.        The people of Ukraine have reminded the entire free world about the       meaning of sovereignty and the price of freedom. They have fought back       against the invaders with inspiring bravery.            [[Page S9713]]              And let's be clear: The reason that a big bipartisan majority of the       American people and big bipartisan majorities in Congress support       continuing to assist Ukraine is not primarily about inspiring speeches       or a desire to engage in philanthropy.        The Ukrainian people are courageous and innocent, and they deserve       our help. President Zelenskyy is an inspiring leader. But the most       basic reasons for continuing to help Ukraine degrade and defeat the       Russian invaders are cold, hard, practical American interests.        Helping equip our friends in Eastern Europe to win this war is also a       direct investment in reducing Putin's future capabilities to menace       America, threaten our allies, and contest our core interests.        Defeating the Russians will help prevent further security crises in       Europe. It will prevent even further economic chaos that would roil key       American trading partners and hurt American workers and families       directly.        It will massively wear down the arsenal that is available to Putin       for future efforts to use bullying and bloodshed to redraw still other       borders down the road.        And it will send a stark warning to other would-be aggressors like       the People's Republic of China.        By assisting Ukraine today, America is directly demonstrating our       commitment to the basic principles of territorial integrity and       national sovereignty--changing the calculus for others considering       military aggression and lowering the odds of far costlier and far more       deadly conflicts in the process.        So I will say it one more time. Continuing our support for Ukraine is       morally right, but it is not only that. It is also a direct investment       in cold, hard American interests.        That is why Republicans rejected the Biden administration's original       request for Ukraine assistance--because it was insufficient. The       administration's initial plan assumed there would be a lull in fighting       over the winter and so the disbursement rates of weapons would actually       decrease.        But hoping for the best cannot mean that we fail to prepare for the       worst. Rather than slowing assistance, we should be speeding up       international deliveries to Ukraine to help them take back more       territory and better prepare for whatever they need wherever they next       go on their offensive.              So Republicans pushed hard here in the Senate to increase the amount       of security assistance in this bill. I am glad our Democratic       colleagues came around.        The agreement on the table increases weapons purchases to support       Ukraine beyond the President's request. This assistance is in our       national security interest, but it is also in America's economic       interest. These investments will help expand our defense manufacturing       capacity and contribute to an industry that supports high-paying       American jobs.        The money is tied to strong oversight requirements to ensure that       America's investments reach only the intended targets.        There has been meaningful oversight over our Ukraine assistance all       along the way, including by three separate inspectors general and the       Government Accountability Office.        And on top of that, last week's NDAA will put in place even further       expansions in oversight, more end-use monitoring, and stricter       reporting requirements.        And the oversight won't stop there. Just as Senate ranking members       have worked hard to maximize the impact of our assistance, the incoming       House Republican majority will be able to use their gavels to keep an       even closer eye on Ukraine aid and make sure the Biden administration       is doing everything possible to rebuild our defense industrial base.        While America is uniquely capable of leading this effort, we should       not and are not doing so all by ourselves.        Vital Eastern Front allies and partners in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania,       Estonia, and Finland have risen to the challenge of backing Ukraine in       the fight against tyranny.        So too have some Western European powers.        And some allies across Europe deserve credit for changing course,       making substantial investments in their own militaries, and starting to       unwind years of neglect of national defense.        But some other European allies have lagged behind. They can and must       do more, both to stand with Ukraine today and to rebuild their own       strength going forward.        Finally, we all know that Ukraine's fight to retake its territory is       neither the beginning nor the end of the West's broader strategic       competition with Putin's Russia.        Increasing the pressure on Putin's regime can and should be a       bipartisan priority. That will take concrete steps, like sanctions with       teeth, not empty symbolism.        If our Democratic colleagues are serious about joining this effort,       Republicans stand ready to expose Russia's long trail of wartime       atrocities and meaningfully ratchet up the economic and political costs       that Russia pays for its misdeeds, from Ukraine to Georgia to Moldova       to the Middle East and beyond.        These threats and atrocities require more than symbols and       resolutions. They require concrete actions and consequences.        The plight of the innocent people of Ukraine is offering the world       the starkest, most painful, and most personal reminder imaginable that       global security and national self-determination do not uphold       themselves; that peace is far from inevitable and freedom is far from       self-fulfilling; that countries who benefit from global stability need       to help deter countries who want chaos.        But even against the barbaric horrors of a war they never asked for--      even in the face of torture, executions, and inhuman attacks on       infrastructure, and systemic terror campaigns against civilian cities--      against all these things--all these things--against the cold fate that       Putin has tried to deal Ukraine, we have seen the warmth of the       Ukrainian people's spirits win out. Their love for their homeland, for       their families, for their freedom--the United States Congress will be       honored to hear the message that their courageous President brings to       us on behalf of the brave citizens he represents.
