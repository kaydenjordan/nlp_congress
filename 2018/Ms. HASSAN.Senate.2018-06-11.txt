 Mr. President, I wish to recognize and extend my  sincerest congratulations and happy birthday wishes to Lorence M.  Bertone, who celebrated her 100th birthday on June 9, 2018.   Lorence was born in 1918 in Danvers, MA, where she worked at Sylvania  until she retired and moved to Seabrook, NH, 38 years ago. Lorence is  married to Ricce Bertone, and they have five children: Richard,  Clarice, Bonny, Robert, and Linda. Lorence also has many grandchildren  and great-grandchildren and still travels to California to visit her  grandsons, Rod and Dave.   Today Lorence enjoys taking trips to Vegas, crocheting, baking, and  playing bingo every week at the Seabrook American Legion and Seabrook  Fire Association.   I hope you join me, Lorence's friends and family, and many people in  the town of Seabrook and across the Granite State in wishing Lorence M.  Bertone a very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
