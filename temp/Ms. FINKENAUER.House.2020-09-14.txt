 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez for  yielding. It is an honor to get to serve on the Committee on Small  Business with her, and I appreciate her support as we dive into these  issues that are obviously of big importance to me and to my State of  Iowa.    Mr. Speaker, that is why, today, I rise in support of the bipartisan  State Trade Expansion Program Improvement Act.   As the Congresswoman from Iowa's First Congressional District, I know  firsthand that for our small businesses, the ability to access new  markets and export goods promotes economic success at home and in our  communities.   Given the importance of trade in my home State--especially for our  farmers, small businesses, and manufacturers--I have made it a priority  to improve and strengthen the State Trade Expansion Program. The State  Trade Expansion Program gives small businesses the tools they need to  start exporting and expanding into new markets. Many small businesses  operate within razor-thin margins and have only a few employees.   They don't always have the resources to attend a trade show, design  an international marketing campaign, or navigate foreign countries'  complex rules and regulations. That is where the State Trade Expansion  Program comes in.   It is important that we reauthorize this program before it expires at  the end of the month. At the same time, we also need to fix some of the  program's administrative challenges, which we have heard about from  folks in Iowa and other stakeholders who have come before my  subcommittee.                                time  1415    In the Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade, and Entrepreneurship  Subcommittee that I chair with Ranking Member Joyce from Pennsylvania,  we held two hearings dedicated to better understanding and addressing  challenges with the State Trade Expansion Program. I also held a  roundtable in my district to hear from the Iowa Economic Development  Authority, and small businesses have actually used this program.   What we heard was that the State Trade Expansion Program is a great  resource for our State, but we also heard about confusing application  processes, tight timelines, and poor communication from staff at the  Small Business Administration.   That is why today, taking all of that feedback I have heard here in  D.C. and back at home, I am proud we are here to pass the bipartisan  STEP Improvement Act of 2020.   This bill would reauthorize the State Trade Expansion Program for 4  more years and make improvements; like creating a standard timeframe  for applications; opening up more channels for input and communication  between the Small Business Administration and the States; and  collecting better data on how the program helps small businesses, which  is the ultimate goal here.   I want to thank Congressman Ross Spano from Florida, whom I worked  with on introducing this bipartisan legislation, as well as Congressman    Jim Hagedorn from Minnesota for cosponsoring this bill.   I will also note that this legislation passed through the House Small  Business Committee unanimously. I want to thank my Republican and  Democratic colleagues for working together to move this forward.   I urge all Members of this body to join Congressmen Spano, Hagedorn,  and me in supporting this bill.
