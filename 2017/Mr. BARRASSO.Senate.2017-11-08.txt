 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, 1 year ago, the American people went to  the polls. The American people demanded a change. They demanded a  change from 8 years of too little economic growth and too much  government control and regulations. The effect was immediate, and the  effect was incredible.   In the past year, we have gotten a lot of very good news about the  American economy. Right after the election, businesses became much more  optimistic about the direction of our country and they started hiring.  Last Friday, we learned that in the United States we have created more  than 2 million jobs since election day 2016. Someone said to me: Well,  you shouldn't count it from election day. You should count it from  Inauguration Day. Certainly, in my home State of Wyoming, on election  day there was a confidence, an optimism, a positive feeling that  started just at the moment it was announced that Donald Trump had been  elected President of the United States.   Right now we have the lowest rate of unemployment since the year  2002. We have seen the economy grow at more than 3 percent for the past  2 quarters. Consumer confidence just reached the highest level in  almost 17 years. All of this is happening since President Trump was  elected, and this is very good news for America.   We can't stop now. We have to do all we can to keep on this path  toward a more prosperous country. Americans are optimistic because they  know that President Trump is focused on easing the regulations that  have held back our economy for the last 8 years. We know that  government can create opportunity or crush opportunity based on a  combination of regulations, mandates, and taxes. We are now in the land  of opportunity, eliminating the regulations and pulling back on taxes  to helping our economy grow.   The President has signed legislation that we passed in this Congress  repealing one after another of the Obama administration's rules,  regulations, and restrictions. President Trump has issued Executive  orders cutting back on excessive redtape. President Trump has appointed  very good people to important jobs who are committed to reining in  Washington's out-of-control bureaucracy. All of these things are  important and critical to keeping our economy growing.   Another big part is what we are trying to do now in terms of cutting  taxes for the American people. People want to keep more of their hard- earned money in their own pockets.   Here in the Senate we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  cut taxes in a way that will actually help American families. We can  help families directly by raising their incomes, and we can help them  indirectly by growing the economy. Here is how we can do both, because  that needs to be our goal.   The first thing we can do is to give people a raise by doubling the  standard deduction. If we raise the deduction, people keep more of  their hard-earned money, and it makes taxes simpler. Right now, the  standard deduction for a married couple is $12,000. Two-thirds of  Americans take this deduction. If we roughly double it, people will not  pay any Federal income tax at all on the first $24,000 they earn. That  is a big cut. It means that a lot more people will decide to take this  deduction instead of having to go through the painstaking process of  itemizing their deductions on their tax return. It saves them a lot of  time, it saves them a lot of headaches, and it saves them the cost of  accountants and lawyers who have to help figure out the very  complicated tax system in this country. Millions of families will be  better off just from this one tax cut alone.   A second thing Republicans are looking to do is to reduce the tax  rate for small businesses, the people who are creating jobs all across  the country. If someone owns a small business in my home State of  Wyoming, she probably ends up paying the taxes on her personal tax  return rather than on a separate business tax return. If we cut her tax  bill, that is money she can then use to give her workers a raise, to  hire more people, and to create more jobs in our community. She can put  money back into the business to help grow the economy as well.   When you leave more money in people's pockets, they get to decide how  to use that money--what they decide to spend, what they decide to save,  and what they decide to invest. People are much better watching their  own money than the government ever was, giving people value for that  money.   So we want to make sure that tax reform includes a break for small  businesses. Around here, they use the  [[Page S7083]]  words ``tax reform.'' To me, it is about tax reduction, tax relief, and  tax cuts. Republicans also want to bring down the rates that Washington  charges other businesses. If we can cut the rate businesses pay from 35  percent down to 20 percent, that could be an enormous boost to the  economy. Economists who look at this say it is like giving the average  American family a $4,000 a year raise. That is how much the average  household's income would go up, because workers actually bear most of  the burden of taxes that businesses pay.   Now, Democrats actually think the money belongs to Washington. It  doesn't. It belongs to the people at home who earn it. Democrats often  think that if you give Americans even a single dollar in tax cuts, you  are taking away Washington's money. It is not Washington's money. The  money belongs to the people at home.   We know the exact opposite of what the Democrats believe to be true.  Republicans know that giving Americans a tax cut is the same as giving  them a raise. Every dollar a family doesn't have to send to Washington  in taxes is a dollar they can use for something better. It is a dollar  they can use for food, for shelter, for kids, for education, for things  that matter to their family. It is another dollar a small business can  use to pay its workers more or reinvest in the business to help grow  the economy in that community. Tax cuts mean that people decide how to  spend their own money; Washington doesn't decide. Families know how to  use money much better than Washington ever will.    As we debate these issues and ideas with regard to tax relief, we  have an exciting opportunity to give the American people a raise and to  give the American economy a boost. This is something a lot of people  have been working on for a long time in the Senate. Over the past 6  years, the Finance Committee has held 70 hearings on how to make our  Tax Code better for all Americans.   Republicans are working, and we are listening to make sure that we  get the tax reform right that the American people and families need.  When it comes to tax cuts, I believe the more the better. The more  people who get a tax cut, the better. The more we grow our economy, the  better. It is our job. It is about paychecks. It is about jobs. It is  about prosperity. It is about a strong and healthy economy for America.  That is what we as Republicans are committed to. We cannot let this  opportunity pass.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, President Trump has been in office now  for more than 9 months. He has laid out his agenda to cut punishing  regulations, to grow the economy, and to help hard-working Americans.   President Trump's administration has already taken important steps to  roll back the regulatory rampage of the last 8 years. During the last  administration, the Environmental Protection Agency issued harmful and  punishing, overreaching regulations that hurt workers in my home State  of Wyoming.   According to the chamber of commerce, from 2008 to 2016, the EPA  issued regulations that cost our economy over $60 billion each year-- significantly more than any other Federal agency. These rules had real- life impacts. The Obama administration's so-called Clean Power Plan  would have closed powerplants and cost America jobs. We can have both  clean air and a growing economy. We have proven it.   My goal is to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we  can, without raising costs on American families. President Trump shares  that goal. That is why EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has led the  charge in cutting redtape. The EPA has taken important steps to roll  back the Clean Power Plan and other punishing EPA regulations.   It is interesting. The annual cost of high-impact rules by agencies  from 2008 to 2016--there were 13 rules by the EPA--in the red right  here, billions and billions and billions--over $60 billion.   Administrator Pruitt needs his full leadership team in place at the  Agency to complete the task, so today the Senate is going to vote on  cloture so we can consider the nomination of Bill Wehrum. He has been  nominated to serve as EPA's Assistant Administrator for the Office of  Air and Radiation. Mr. Wehrum has more than three decades of experience  in environmental policy. He has worked as an environmental engineer, a  public servant at the EPA, and is an environmental lawyer. His time at  the EPA includes 2 years of service as the Acting Administrator of the  Office of Air and Radiation--the same office he has now been nominated  to lead.   EPA's Office of Air and Radiation is critically important in terms of  a division within the Agency. It develops national programs, policies,  and regulations for limiting air pollution and radiation exposure. One  of the responsibilities of this office is implementing the Clean Air  Act, and it is a big job.   Here is a chart. Most EPA regulatory burdens come from EPA air  regulations; 94.5 percent from the Office of Air and Radiation  regulatory burden in 2014; only 5.5 percent from all other EPA offices'  regulatory burden of that same year. So under the Obama administration,  the air office was one of the biggest regulatory abusers. According to  the Office of Management and Budget, the EPA's air regulations were  responsible for 95 percent of the cost of the Agency's regulations. Now  Mr. Wehrum is going to play a key role in undoing this redtape.   The American people need a qualified leader in the EPA air office.  Bill Wehrum is the right man for the job. Don't take my word for it;  former environmental Obama Justice official John Cruden said this of  Mr. Wehrum: ``I believe he is committed to achieving clean air for all  citizens and carefully following sound and current science.'' Marcus  Peacock, an EPA Deputy Administrator during the Bush administration,  praised Mr. Wehrum, saying that his ``understanding of the Clean Air  Act may be second to none. His desire to pull up his sleeves and  actually make the Clean Air Act work as a practical matter is second to  none.''   Mr. Wehrum's expertise and experience will be tremendously helpful as  he pursues policies that will protect America's air, undo regulatory  overreach, and allow our economy to grow. I urge all Senators to vote  for cloture on Mr. Wehrum's nomination.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Washington.
