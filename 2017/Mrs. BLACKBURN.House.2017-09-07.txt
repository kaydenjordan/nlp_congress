Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.                                time  2200     Mr. Chairman, I know that we have a lot of activity  on the House floor tonight, which I think is a good thing. It shows  that the people's House is here, that we are working, and that we are  meeting the needs of the American people. One of those is making  certain that we fund the activity of this government, and that we do it  in a responsible way.   I think that as I come to offer my amendment, that I offer every  single year, on this piece of legislation, Mr. Chairman, it is very  important to note that this Appropriations Committee has done a  phenomenal job of reining in out-of-control spending.   One of the lessons that should have been learned over the past couple  of years is that it is very clear the American people understand that  Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.  As I said, Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has a  spending problem.   We know that the bureaucracy has an insatiable appetite for the  taxpayers' money. We see it all of the time. It is why we are having a  vote to raise the debt ceiling. It is why we are right at $20 trillion  in debt. It is because the spending is, indeed, out of control.   The work that has been done by this committee to prepare these  appropriations bills is so vitally important, and it is to be  commended. I think we have to look at this Interior Appropriations bill  and realize that last year it was a $32.28 billion bill. This year,  they have worked that spending down to $31.4 billion, and that is,  indeed, commendable. In this bill, they have cut the spending at the  EPA a total of 27 percent, and that is, indeed, commendable.   The amendment that I bring forward tonight is to reduce that budget  authority by an additional 1 percent. And I do this in calling for a  penny-on-a-dollar cut, to challenge the bureaucracy to match the great  work that has been done by our colleagues, on both sides of the aisle,  as they have worked through to reduce what we spend to cut out waste,  to look for fraud, to find ways that the taxpayer dollar is being  abused, and to end that abuse.   And, indeed, we know that saving a penny on a dollar is something we  can do. It is important to our children and grandchildren. Indeed, I  think we have a moral responsibility to do that.   And there are areas where we can do this. I will give you a couple of  examples where there is more that we could be doing.   One is in ceiling fan regulations through the EPA. Some of the  regulations they have put on ceiling fans, which actually reduce energy  consumption, are absolutely ridiculous. We know that they yield a  benefit, especially for people that live in areas, like I live in, in  Tennessee.   So while we recognize the vital work of the Department of the  Interior, we also realize there are areas where more could be done to  curb the waste, and where we could challenge the rank and file  employees in these bureaucracies.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the chairman's work,  and the committee's good work.   I do want to point out that across-the-board cuts work. We see them  work in our State governments, and we see them work in our local  communities. And certainly families see these work, where they go in  and they just shave a little out of everything that they are spending.   If you look at the discretionary spending components of our Federal  budget and you say, Let's find a way to save one penny out of every  dollar that has been appropriated, then you put yourself on the road to  reducing what the Federal Government spends, what they take from the  taxpayer and then spend.   We are spending too much money on programs that we don't need,  programs that have outlived their usefulness, and programs that future  generations don't even realize that they are going to have to pay for.   So, let's do the fiscally responsible thing. Let's challenge these  agencies, let's cut one more penny out of the dollar, and do this for  our children, for our grandchildren, and for the fiscal health of our  Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee  will be postponed.
