 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate  Mary Ellen Stone on her retirement, after 44 years of service leading  the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, KCSARC. Over that time,  she has laid essential foundations, establishing and strengthening the  organization into what has become a respected, comprehensive nonprofit  provider of supportive services for survivors of sexual assault and  their families. Her passion, tenacity, and leadership have shaped  KCSARC into the strong, vibrant nonprofit it is today.   Mary Ellen began at KCSARC in 1979, serving about 100 clients with a  staff of 3 and a budget of $50,000. As she retires in 2023, the  nonprofit serves 5,000 survivors and their families with a staff of  more than 70 and an annual budget of $8.2 million. Over four decades,  Mary Ellen has been a bold, visionary advocate for sexual assault  survivors throughout King County and the State of Washington. Mary  Ellen was influential in establishing the State's first accreditation  process for sexual assault providers, professionalizing service  delivery and ensuring core services are available to survivors in every  county of the State.   Under Mary Ellen's leadership, KCSARC published one of the first  educational pieces in the Nation for parents to talk with their  children about sexual assault called ``He Told Me Not to Tell.'' It was  a milestone for community awareness about child sexual abuse. Today,  this publication remains a foundational educational tool, and its  importance and relevance remain to this day as half of KCSARC's clients  are children and teens under 18 years old. Mary Ellen's vision and  tenacity allowed KCSARC to respond to specific unmet needs in the  community, including to sexual assault survivors who are experiencing  homelessness, children and youth survivors, and Latino survivors.   Mary Ellen has shared her time and expertise in so many ways to  better inform systems and communities about the needs of victims,  including serving on the Seattle Archdiocese Review Board, Mental  Illness Drug Dependence Oversight Board, Seattle Chief of Police Search  committees, Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, Sex  Offender Management Committee, Women's Funding Alliance, and Municipal  League Seattle-King County.   It has been a great privilege to work with Mary Ellen--a true  trailblazer--over the last four decades. And it is my honor to thank  her for her lifetime of dedicated service to people in King County, the  State of Washington, and the entire country. I wish her the very best  during her well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
