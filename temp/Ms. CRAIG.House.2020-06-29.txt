 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I ask you: What good is a cure if you can't access it because you  can't afford it?   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is immensely personal  to me. See, I grew up for a portion of my childhood without health  insurance. I also spent more than 20 years working in two healthcare  manufacturing companies and was responsible for providing healthcare to  18,000 Americans at a U.S. company.   These experiences and the stories I have heard across my district are  why I am here today working to reduce out-of-pocket costs and the price  of prescription drugs.   Today, Les and his family, they farm in my district. They pay over  $20,000 a year in premiums with a $12,000 deductible.   Another family farms by flashlight and works another job during the  day, just for the family health insurance.   These examples show the heart of the problem: If healthcare isn't  affordable, it is not accessible.   I am proud that the base of this bill is my bipartisan bill, H.R.  1425, the State Health Care Premium Reduction Act, the first healthcare  legislation that I authored as a Member of Congress. This bill will  allow States to lower the cost of premiums in the individual  marketplace and to expand access to healthcare to more Americans. I am  also pleased that this package includes the transformational drug price  negotiation mechanism from the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now  Act, which finally takes on the high cost of prescription drugs.   For the 51 percent of nonelderly with preexisting conditions in my  congressional district, the ACA was a lifeline. This is a moment that  requires us to come together as Americans to strengthen the ACA and  reduce the cost and increase the access to healthcare.
