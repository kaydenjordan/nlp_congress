 Thank you, Mr. President.   I rise today to talk about the Republican effort happening in total  secrecy behind closed doors under the direction of Leader McConnell to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid in order to give huge  tax breaks to the wealthiest Georgians, the wealthiest Americans.   Just about 5 months ago, I came before this body. I issued a simple  request to Republicans. I asked you to show me your plan to repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act.   I asked you to show me the plan that was going to be ``terrific.''   As to the bill that President Trump promised during his campaign and  the one Republicans had 7 years to come up with, I asked you to explain  how you would meet the standards set by one of President Trump's top  advisers, Kelly Anne Conway, who said: ``We don't want anyone who  currently has insurance to not have insurance.''   I asked you all to show me the plan that retains coverage for the  nearly 20 million people who have gained it, continues to contain  healthcare costs, and ensures that nobody gets denied or has to pay  more because of their gender or because of preexisting conditions.   I never got that plan from you. Instead, what we received was the  American Health Care Act, or the AHCA, a heartless, terrible bill that  passed the House in early May, a bill that President Trump heralded in  the Rose Garden, after its passage, as ``great.''   The AHCA is a far cry from what President Trump and his allies  promised. If the AHCA becomes law, 23 million more people would be  uninsured. The bill ends protections for people with preexisting  conditions and drives up healthcare costs dramatically for older,  sicker folks. Worse still, the AHCA would end the Medicaid expansion  and slash Medicaid by $834 billion over 10 years. For what? To offer  massive tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, for the wealthiest  Georgians in the Presiding Officer's State. The average tax savings for  the 400 richest families under this plan is $7 million apiece each  year--$7 million each for every year, because they need it.   No wonder people are outraged. Just 8 percent of Americans think the  Senate should pass this bill into law unchanged. Well, 8 percent has to  be a new low.   Americans do not want TrumpCare. Three in four Americans want  President Trump and his administration to do what he can to make the  ACA work rather than undermining it.   Even President Trump reportedly now considers the House bill to be  ``mean.'' It went from ``great'' to ``mean.'' In the Rose Garden, it  was great. Now, a few weeks later, that same great bill is mean.   Instead of listening to the American people, Republicans are pursuing  a strategy that former Acting Administrator of CMS Andy Slavitt has  described as sabotage, secrecy, and speed.   Up first, sabotage.   In a few years, Republicans have choked off the Risk Corridors  Program, which was designed to help stabilize premiums in the first  years of the new exchanges. The Trump administration has gone even  further. It has stopped enforcing the individual mandate, has  undermined outreach efforts to help people sign up for health  insurance, and has cut in half the amount of time that people have to  sign up for health insurance coverage.   Perhaps the most troubling of all is that Republicans have refused to  commit to funding cost-sharing reduction payments. These payments help  low-income families cover their out-of-pocket costs. Since insurers are  not sure if they can count on the administration to continue to provide  these payments, some are pulling out of the individual market or are  dramatically increasing their premiums to account for this instability,  this uncertainty.   There is much more we can do to shore up the individual market, but  my colleague Senator Stabenow had it right when she said to Secretary  Price, of the Presiding Officer's State, regarding the administration's  sabotage efforts: ``It's like pulling the rug out from under somebody  and going, `Oh, my gosh. They fell down.' ''   That was from Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan.   The next tenet of the Republican approach is secrecy.   A group of 13 men has been meeting in secret to draft the Senate  version of the AHCA. What little we do know is that Senator Cornyn  estimates there will be about an 80-percent overlap between the Senate  and House bills. Prior to now, our understanding was that the Senate  Republicans would completely rewrite the bill, with Senator Burr even  saying the House bill was ``dead on arrival.'' It sounds like that plan  has been jettisoned, but we cannot be sure because the Senate has had  precisely zero hearings, zero days of public floor debate, and we have  yet to see or hear about the revised draft of the AHCA, despite the  forthcoming vote.   I urge my Republican colleagues to recall that during the long debate  over the Affordable Care Act, the Senate held nearly 100 bipartisan  hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs, and had 25 consecutive days of  public floor debate. Let me repeat that--nearly 100  [[Page S3597]]  bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs in the Senate alone,  with 25 consecutive days of public floor debate on a bill that affects  one-sixth of our economy. In the Senate HELP Committee, Senators  considered nearly 300 amendments during a 13-day markup--one of the  longest in congressional history--and ultimately accepted more than 160  Republican amendments in the process.   In 2009, then-House Budget Committee Ranking Member Paul Ryan argued:         Before Congress changes healthcare as the American people       know it, we must know the likely consequences of the House       Democrat legislation, including the number of people who       would lose access to their current insurance.    The irony is palpable. Feel the palpable irony. Do you feel it? Does  everybody feel it?   That brings me to the final component of the Republican approach, and  that is speed.   Leader McConnell would prefer to have a vote on the Senate plan  before the July 4 recess or shortly thereafter. That timing only leaves  us with a few days to go. There will just not be enough time to truly  understand how this bill would affect the healthcare system, which,  again, is one-sixth of our economy and affects all of the millions of  Americans who rely on it.   Republicans plan to schedule the vote in such a way as to keep the  American people in the dark about this bill for as long as possible.  The American people deserve a chance to weigh in on a bill that would  affect their lives and those of their friends and families in my State  of Minnesota and the Presiding Officer's State of Georgia.   My office has received over 15,000 letters from very worried  Minnesotans these past few months, and I have gone to visit rural  healthcare facilities that would be among the hardest hit by the AHCA.  My constituents--the people of Minnesota--are frankly scared about what  will happen to them or their families if they lose their health  insurance, and I am too.   As I did in January, I would like to encourage my Republican  colleagues to join me on a trip to Minnesota to meet Leanna. Leanna's  3-year-old son Henry has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic  leukemia. His treatment will last until at least April of 2018. He  needs around-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain, and  sleepless nights. Henry's immune system is so compromised that he is  not supposed to go to daycare so Leanna left her job to care for him.  Henry and Leanna are supported by Leanna's spouse, but they cannot pay  for his treatment on one salary.   Leanna says:         It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper healthcare.       Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to maintain his       health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is still with       us because of the ACA.    He is 3.   Let me say that again: ``Henry is still with us because of the ACA.''   I will do everything I can to fight the Republican effort to repeal  the Affordable Care Act, strip away consumer protections, and gut  Medicaid.   To all of my constituents who care about this, I need you to keep  fighting. Now is the time to make your voices heard.   I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
