 Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, as we get ready to leave  the House today and go home for Thanksgiving, I think it has been  alarming that, as we read the newspapers, as we listen, we find that so  many families are not going to be celebrating Thanksgiving together  because of the political divide that is taking place, not only here on  the floor of the people's House, but in our homes.   It is incredible to me that we have allowed our political rhetoric to  divide not only Republicans and Democrats on the floor, but also our  families back home. This has never happened before in the Speaker's  House. We should never have this happening on the floor.   Now, look, I know that we have differences of opinions. The  relentless pursuit to delegitimize the election of Donald Trump has  taken over any activity that should be taking place on the floor of the  people's House.   Madam Speaker, as we stand here in the House, on the floor of the  people's House, and we get ready to depart for Thanksgiving  celebration, it is hard to imagine what it is that this majority has in  mind when it comes to legislation because we are not doing legislation.  We have concentrated on impeachment.   Now, I would ask all Members to recommit, and recommit for the  purposes that the American people elected us: to do legislation that  makes sense, to do legislation that is long overdue, to do legislation  that is critical, to do legislation that makes sense for every single  American.   I appeal to you, not as a Republican, but as an American.   Have we left this floor and decided that we can no longer work  together? Because the American people are drawing that conclusion.  [[Page H9153]]    And when I go home, they say to me: Can't you all agree on anything?   And I say: Yes, we can.   Madam Speaker, we have wasted precious time and millions of  hardworking American taxpayer dollars on a pursuit of an effort to  impeach a President of the United States. We have done nothing to  legislate and to act in the best interest of every American.   I would ask again that we look at what we are doing as Americans and  not as Republicans or Democrats, because the people back home can't  understand why it is that they sent us here to do what we are not doing  today. Why? Why are we not doing it?   Madam Speaker, at some point, I would hope and pray that the greatest  nation the world has ever known, the defenders of liberty and freedom  all over the world, could take a look and see what we are doing right  now and ask: What is the message we are sending to the rest of the  world?   Really? America is caught up in an effort to impeach the duly elected  President of the United States? And why? Because we have been so  consumed with hate that we can no longer see straight.   Look, why are we not passing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade  agreement, which is a jobs bill?   Why are we not passing the National Defense Authorization Act for  fiscal year 2020, which is critical to our safety?   Why are we not passing the Department of Defense Appropriations Act?   Madam Speaker, I appreciate you, but I am going to ask my colleagues  to please extend to me the same respect that I extend to you.    I would, Madam Speaker, but I don't think  the other side is interested in hearing what I have to say.   Madam Speaker, we also have not passed the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act. Can you believe we are that irresponsible?   Legislation to secure operational control of our southern border, we  are not doing that.   And we are not doing bipartisan legislation to lower prescription  drug prices and handle surprise billings and preexisting conditions.   Why are we not doing those things that are the most important things  to our citizens back home?   I would ask that we look into what we are doing and if we are doing  it strictly for political purposes and in a power grab. That is not why  the American people sent us here. That is not why the majority on the  floor of the House changed during the last election.   But now people are seeing exactly what happens when the majority  switches up, and when I go home, people ask me: Why aren't you doing  something about what is happening in Congress today?   I say: You know what. That was America's choice, not ours. When we  are in the majority, we are able to govern.   Madam Speaker, I would like to sincerely wish all of our colleagues a  happy Thanksgiving. God bless America.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Madam Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the  Chair.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
