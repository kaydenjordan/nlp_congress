 Mr. Speaker, I heard my colleague on the other side of the  aisle and I certainly appreciate his friendship and service.   I would take some disagreement with my celebrating the extent to  which the President of the United States has announced beforehand the  race and sex of the next Supreme Court Justice. And I would remind my  friend, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in general, the  extent to which the current President rejected, filibustered, blocked  Janice Rogers Brown--notably both Black and female--he did so because  she wasn't the right kind of Black and female. You see, she was a  conservative. She was not a leftist, a liberal.   So the current President blocked, when he was in the United States  Senate, filibustered, fought, broke the rules and the traditions of the  Senate to do it. By the way, Janice Rogers Brown, a Black female,  qualified but conservative, judge. So he refused to let her advance.  Why?   Now, the President of the United States is going out and lauding,  praising his predetermination that the next Justice must be Black or  female, undermining the nominee before even making the nomination.   I would note also that the President blocked, attacked, voted against  Miguel Estrada. And did so, we know, for one reason. He was a Hispanic  conservative. Now, how do we know that? We have a memo. Yes, indeed, a  memo in black and white, spelled out among Democrat Senators and  staffers back in 2003. I happen to know this because I was a lawyer on  the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. But my, how this town loves to  sweep aside little details, like the current Democrat President of the  United States working in coordination with Democrat Members of the  United States Senate when he was a Senator to stop, to block, to  filibuster Miguel Estrada because he is a Hispanic conservative.   And we can't have that, can we? Because it breaks the narrative. It  destroys the narrative. Republicans are anti-Hispanic. Republicans are  anti-Black. We can't have a Black conservative woman advance under a  Republican President, George W. Bush. We can't have Hispanic Miguel  Estrada advance under a Republican, George W. Bush.   But, no, no, will you hear Jen Psaki talking about that at the podium  at the White House? Or will you hear more lies, lies about the whipping  of migrants at our border? Will you hear her talk about the fact that  no report has been generated by the Department of Justice or the  Department of Homeland Security or anybody else about the alleged  whipping of migrants, which did not occur, which we know didn't occur.  By fact, we know it didn't occur.   But yet, the President of the United States and his own White House  Secretary sat at the podium and accused them, ``them'' being our Border  Patrol agents, standing on the front lines, being ignored, underfunded,  chastised, refused to say any apology since that day. They refused to  look at the Border Patrol agents and say, You know, we are sorry. We  got that wrong. No report forthcoming.   Anybody sensing a theme that my Democrat friends and colleagues in  the White House on the other side of the aisle love to make race an  issue? But they are going to sweep aside the killing of Miguel  Estrada's nomination because he is a Hispanic male, Hispanic  conservative; sweep aside the blocking of Janice Rogers Brown; sweep  aside running to cry racism and whipping of the Rio Grande when it is  the policies of the Secretary of Homeland Security that is specifically  and intentionally endangering the American people; causing our young  children across this country to die from poisonings and overdoses;  causing bullets to be fired upon our law enforcement officers in Texas;  ranchers to get overrun, livestock to get out, cartels to get  empowered. And the Secretary of Homeland Security literally refuses to  enforce any of the laws to stop that from happening.   But, oh, no, he can't bring himself, and Jen Psaki can't bring  herself, and the President can't bring himself to look in the eyes of  the Border Patrol and say they apologize for saying that they were  whipping human beings.                                time  1445    That is the state of the Democrat Party's commitment to race. It is  all a fraud. It is all a fiction. It is all a front. It is all about  continuing to foment racial division for partisan political gain. It  has nothing to do about judging people by the content of their  character and not the color of their skin because if it were, Janice  Rogers Brown would not have been blocked and Miguel Estrada would not  have been blocked. The President of the United States wouldn't be  standing up at a lectern today predetermining the race and the sex of  the next Justice of the United States Supreme Court.   Mr. Speaker, I came down here today to talk about our law enforcement  [[Page H1106]]  community. A year and a half ago, I sat here on the floor of the  House--maybe in the same spot--with the number 43 similarly positioned  on a board. That 43 represented the number of law enforcement police  officers killed in the line of duty at that time.   Well, saying to the Speaker and to my colleagues--who, of course,  notably, as I like to observe, are not here. This is our idea of  debate, you know, in the United States House of Representatives. On  fly-out day, everybody is getting home. Nobody is here.   We never have actual debate. We never offer amendments. We never have  a back and forth. We come back and have showboats and give speeches on  the Capitol steps about how Republicans are better than Democrats or  Democrats are better than Republicans. We never sit down here and  actually debate. If we did, then we could have honest debate about  policies that will protect this country and protect law enforcement  officers from the constant barrage and attack levied against them  across this country.   I am sick and tired of seeing nonstop attacks on our law enforcement  community for being the ones on the front lines every day dealing with  crime and figuring out how to protect our communities yet getting  tossed under the bus, cast aside as being the ones that we should be  targeting.   Eighty-four dead law enforcement officers across this country last  year; 346 officers were shot in the line of duty; 103 ambush-style  attacks on law enforcement officers, up 115 percent from the year  before; 4 police officers were beaten to death; 3 were stabbed to  death.   Sergeant Joshua Bartlett, Lubbock County Sheriff's Office in Texas,  shot and killed during a barricade at a home on July 15 of last year.  Earlier in the morning, the subject had been stopped by a Texas Highway  Patrol trooper for reckless driving and attempted to bait the officer  into a confrontation. He returned home after the encounter and began  walking around the neighborhood with a firearm at 1:15.   When officers of the Levelland Police Department arrived, the man  opened fire and barricaded himself inside. The regional SWAT team was  requested as the man randomly fired shots from the home.   Sergeant Bartlett was a United States Army veteran. He is survived by  his wife, four sons, parents, and a brother.   Police Officer Mitchell Aaron Penton, Dallas, Texas, was struck and  killed by a vehicle operated by an intoxicated driver on February 13,  2021. At the time of his death, he had a stepson, and his wife was  expecting.   Police Officer Brandon M. Stalker, Toledo Police Department, Ohio,  was shot and killed during a barricade involving an arson suspect.  Officer Stalker was on a perimeter position and was struck in the head  and fatally wounded. He is survived by his two children and fiance.   Police Officer Jimmy Inn was shot and killed while responding to a  domestic violence call on May 11, 2021. He had served with the Stockton  Police Department for 6 years. He is survived by his wife, 7-month-old  son, and two stepchildren.   Sergeant James Smith, Iowa State Patrol, Iowa, was shot and killed  while attempting to arrest a subject who had assaulted and disarmed  another law enforcement officer during a traffic stop on April 2, 2021.  He is survived by his wife, two children, mother, brother, and sister.   Lieutenant Michael Boutte was shot and killed after responding to a  call involving a subject attempting suicide. He was a United States Air  Force veteran and served with the Hancock County Sheriff's office for 8  years. He is survived by his wife and two children.   Police Officer Chris Oberheim, Champaign Police Department, Illinois,  was shot and killed at about 3:20 a.m. while responding to a domestic  disturbance call. He had been on the job 20 years. He was 44 with a  wife and four children.   Trooper Chad Michael Walker, Texas Department of Public Safety, March  28, 2021, succumbed to gunshot wounds sustained 5 days earlier when he  was ambushed while stopping to assist what he believed was a disabled  vehicle near Mexia, Texas. He served with the Texas Highway Patrol for  6 years. He had 18 years in law enforcement. He is survived by his  wife, 15-year-old son, twin 7-year-older daughters, and a 2-month-old  daughter.   Here are some of the quotes from my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle and at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue about police  officers.   Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, while criticizing FOX News  coverage of soft-on-crime policies, stated, while laughing, ``What does  that even mean?'' and referred to the coverage as an alternative  universe.   President Biden famously expressed support for the defund the police  movement in 2020 and then had to walk that back after backlash.   Vice President Kamala Harris applauded Los Angeles Mayor Eric  Garcetti for defunding the police.   Representative Ocasio-Cortez said, ``Defunding police means defunding  police,'' arguing the cuts to the New York Police Department weren't  enough.   Representative Ayanna Pressley said she supports efforts to defund  police departments.   Representative Rashida Tlaib called for ``no more'' police. Tlaib's  campaign has paid over $150,000 to defund the police activist Rasha  Mubarak.   Representative Ilhan Omar said:         Not only do we need to defund, we need to dismantle police       departments.    Representative Cori Bush said that she would ``make sure'' she has  private security for her protection while simultaneously promising to  defund the police. This weekend, Representative Bush doubled down in  her support for defunding our police departments on Twitter.   President Biden's Assistant Attorney General, Kristen Clarke,  supported efforts to defund the police.   President Biden's Associate Attorney General, Vanita Gupta, said  officials must heed calls to ``decrease police budgets and the scope,  role, and responsibility of police in our lives.''   President Biden's Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh, proposed a budget  to divert funding from law enforcement.   We see now what is happening in Minnesota, where you have one of the  individuals who was a part of the mob violence riots in the summer of  2020, who burned down a store, a commercial property, and did so with  video footage indicating the glee of doing so--this being an individual  with a very long criminal record.   The man who owned or worked at the establishment, I think, had five  kids and died as a result of the fire set by this individual in  Minnesota. The United States Attorney's Office in Minnesota filed a  sentencing brief that read exactly like the defense lawyer's brief,  citing all the events of the summer, completely offsetting the dead  father of five with a store burned to the ground during mob violence  rule in the summer of 2020.   This United States Department of Justice, this United States  Attorney's Office in Minnesota, downward departed from the sentencing  guidelines of 20 years down to 10 years, purposefully citing the  political interest of the summer of 2020, the political cause of the  summer of 2020, in recommending that downward departure despite the  criminal record of the perpetrator of the crime, despite the destroyed  and burned down building, despite the death of the owner of the store  and the fact that he had multiple children. All of that was cast aside  in the political judgment, not even of the judge, but of the United  States Attorney's Office.   Lo and behold, that acting United States attorney a few months later  is now working at Main Justice. I would sure like to know why. I would  sure like to know who was involved. I would sure like to know who made  the calls. I would sure like to know from the current acting United  States attorney if that acting United States attorney agrees with the  sentencing recommendations of the so-called prosecutors in the  Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office who turned a blind eye to their duty  to keep the streets safe, to prosecute them under their oath to the  Constitution and defense of the laws of the United States to protect  the people of Minnesota, and chose to choose a political path, and  chose to follow politics rather than do their job.   We want to know. We are going to ask questions in the House Judiciary  Committee. I can assure you that if the good people of the United  States were to give the majority to the Republicans in January 2023,  there are going to be  [[Page H1107]]  some questions asked and some answers delivered by this administration  for their failure to enforce the laws of the United States while  American people die, lose property, are harmed, are killed. At the  border of Texas or in Minnesota--it doesn't matter--the laws of the  United States are supposed to be enforced, and we should be standing up  for the rule of law.   We are going to demand answers to questions. I want answers from the  United States Attorney General for targeting parents for daring to  stand up to school boards. I want answers from the Secretary of  Homeland Security for his clearly impeachable conduct for recklessly  ignoring the laws of the United States, endangering my people and  constituents in Texas, endangering the people of this country while  empowering cartels and allowing fentanyl to pour into our schools. I  want answers. We are going to demand answers.   We are going to want answers and demand answers from Anthony Fauci  and all the bureaucrats at NIH and CDC for shutting down our schools,  shutting down our economy, lying about what we were seeing in terms of  gain of function research in China.   We are going to want answers, and we are going to get those answers.  While this body fiddles, we will demand answers if the American people  will give us the ability to get them.   I mentioned our situation at our border. We are in the midst of a  fentanyl, opioid, and drug crisis in this country, the likes we have  not seen before.                                time  1500    Those of us who grew up in the eighties know what we saw with the  cocaine epidemic. I was a 14-year-old when Len Bias notoriously died  from an overdose within a week of being drafted by the Boston Celtics  after his career at the University of Maryland.   We know the horrors of the cocaine epidemic that led, by the way, to  the crime bills of the 1990s supported by this President, supported by  Black Americans across this country and lobbied for by Black pastors  and Black leaders across this country because of the violence and the  epidemic of drugs across our cities and across our towns in the 1980s  and 1990s. We responded, and as a result, the crime rate went down.   And now what are we seeing?   Massive spikes in crime, massive spikes in drug use, carjackings in  our Nation's Capital where it is easier to get carjacked than to order  a hamburger while we are under lockdowns, and vaccine mandates and  vaccine passports in the Nation's Capital.   Side note: Yet another reason why we should never let the District of  Columbia be a State. It is not supposed to have the political interest  of a State. It is supposed to be our National Capital where people can  come and go, where they can petition their government, and where they  can come and do the business of the people. So we will address that  issue as well in the next Congress.   I am proud to represent Texas, but Texas is under assault. Texas is  under assault every day by cartel-driven violence fueled by China and  driven by the profit motive of pouring fentanyl into our communities,  destroying our children's lives, causing addiction, causing death, and  causing destruction. And this administration not only does nothing, it  is worse than that, this administration purposefully--purposefully-- ignores the laws of the United States to the detriment and the  endangerment of the American people.   There is no other way to put it when our laws require operational  control of the border and we do not have it.   There is no other way to put it when our ranches are overrun, fences  are cut, and livestock gets out.   There is no other way to put it when there are stash houses in  Houston, in San Antonio, in Laredo, in Del Rio, in McAllen, in Arizona,  and in California. In every big city across this country there are  stash houses where human beings are being moved for profit.   There is no other way to put it when the current administration is  releasing people into the United States. They are knowingly, in  violation of law, releasing people into the United States under the  guise of so-called asylum. They know it is not asylum, and they know it  is not credible fear. They know they are releasing single, adult males.  They are lying about it because we see them talking about the lies on  tape.   And the American people are the ones holding the bag. The American  people are the ones who have their kids dying because they take a Xanax  that is laced with fentanyl. And this administration doesn't care.   This administration ignores the rule of law, ignores the Secure Fence  Act, lets fencing rust in the field, and fails to require the fence to  continue to be constructed which would help support Border Patrol and  the communities in south Texas.   But let me send a very clear warning signal to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle: My colleagues take for granted the people of  south Texas, as a political matter. And I can tell you, the people of  south Texas are tired of it. The people of south Texas are tired of  being on the front lines of a cartel-driven drug-and-human-trafficking  war with bullets flying, people dying, morgues filled, and rape trees  being used.   And this body, the people's House, not only sits silent, they  facilitate it, and they facilitate the Department of Justice and the  Department of Homeland Security who does nothing but fuel the crisis  even more.   Mr. Speaker, 100,306 Americans are dead as a result of drug overdoses  or poisonings.   Mr. Speaker, how many minutes are remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I do want to finish by saying, it is our duty  to secure the border of the United States. It is the duty of the  Secretary to secure the border of the United States. There are 100,000  dead Americans as a result of wide-open borders, and it is impeachable  conduct by the Secretary of Homeland Security. We are going to address  that issue if the American people will give us the ability to be in the  majority.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman's remarks about  China, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
