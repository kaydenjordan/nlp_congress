 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of this very important  legislation, the Raise the Wage Act.   Mr. Speaker, they are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters,  your grandmothers. They are your childcare workers, your home health  aides, your retail workers, your maids. They, too, have to pay rent,  buy food for their families. By the time many retire, they live in  poverty.   Women play an essential role in the economy of the United States of  America yet make up two-thirds of minimum-wage workers. They are our  mothers, our sisters, our grandmothers, our daughters. They deserve a  raise, and they need a raise.   When women succeed, America succeeds.
