 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  commission to study the events of January 6, as well as spending $2  billion in a security supplemental.   The question that comes to mind is this: What about all the riots  that happened during the summer of 2020 after the death of George  Floyd? What about all the damage caused to Federal buildings, churches,  people's businesses, and innocent people that were killed, like David  Dorn?   This past summer, Minneapolis city officials estimate 700 buildings  were damaged, burned, or destroyed, including 360 local businesses.  Riots caused an estimated $55 million in damages in Minneapolis alone.   BLM and antifa established an autonomous zone in Seattle and  attempted to burn government buildings in Portland. Is that not an  insurrection?   On one Friday night alone in New York City, BLM protesters caused  over $100,000 in damages, and 150 people were arrested.   Just one Monday night in Philadelphia resulted in a crowd of 1,000  people looting stores, setting fires in the middle of the street, and  30 police officers injured.   Protests in Kansas City resulted in $2.1 million in damages, mostly  over the course of one weekend. Several officers were injured as well.   Protests in Wichita, Kansas, cost the police department about $1.5  million in overtime.   Protests in Salt Lake City cost at least $100,000 in damages.   Protests in Denver cost the city at least $5.5 million in damages and  overtime.   BLM protesters in Nashville set a Federal courthouse on fire. The  destruction is estimated to have cost $1.2 million in damages. Again,  is that an insurrection?   Protesters in Portland destroyed barriers and attempted to burn down  government buildings, resulting in $2.3 million in damages, including  $1.6 million in damages to the courthouse downtown.   In St. Louis, following a night of violence, buildings were looted,  vandalized, and burned.   Protestors in Louisville set the courthouse on fire and shot two  cops, resulting in a state of emergency order being declared.   Protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, injured police officers, set off  fireworks near the police and courthouse, and set at least two city  trucks on fire.   In Guilford County, North Carolina, a courthouse was broken into and  set on fire, resulting in roughly $200,000 in damages.   Protests in Oakland, California, resulted in a courthouse being set  on fire and vandalized.   The LAPD was defunded by $150 million, and some smaller crime units  were eliminated entirely.   Studies show 570 protests in 220 U.S. locations turned violent over  the summer. Are those not insurrections?   The $1-plus billion in riot damages is estimated to be the most  expensive in insurance history. It resulted in up to $2 billion of  damages in 20 cities across the U.S., mostly concentrated in L.A.,  Detroit, Miami, D.C., and New York.   Indeed, we should have a commission to study the violent BLM and  antifa mobs that have plagued American cities this past summer, and  that is for the American people who, by the way, pay the taxes that  fund everything we do here.   Also, we should have a security supplemental to fund all the police  departments that have been defunded due to the pressure from radical,  violent, and socialist groups. We should back the blue because they  certainly back us.   Also, while it is catch-and-release for domestic terrorists, antifa,  BLM, the people who breached the Capitol on January 6 are being abused,  some even being held for 23 hours a day in solitary confinement.   So, Mr. Speaker, my questions are these: Who placed the pipe bombs at  the RNC and the DNC, which is an attack on both Republicans and  Democrats? Why was President Trump's request on January 5 for 10,000  National Guard denied, and who denied it, and what chain of command did  they follow? Also, who killed Ashli Babbitt, and why is that not being  revealed? Does her family not deserve justice? Lastly, when will the  witch hunt of Donald J. Trump come to an end, and all of those who  support him?                            ____________________
