 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and  to the Republican tax scam.   The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people  who play by the rules are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live  on. Wages are not keeping up with rising costs. Too many families today  struggle to make ends meet. They have the rising cost of healthcare, of  child care, and of housing.    Meanwhile, big corporations, millionaires, and billionaires write the  rules to make government work for them--and Republicans are their  comrades in arms in rigging the game against the middle class. Enough  is enough.   It cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans, raises taxes on the  middle class, and it increases the deficit. And worse, it encourages  companies who outsource American jobs. Congress must put middle class  families and jobs before corporations that have not been loyal to their  employees and to our country. When you outsource jobs, you drive wages  down here at home.   Let me mention the child tax credit to you. The Republican proposal  leaves behind vulnerable families--military families, rural families,  large families, minimum wage workers, and those with the youngest  children.   Do not let them get away with this scam. This is not reform. It is  tax cuts for the wealthiest, and I oppose it.
