 Madam President, today I want to discuss legislation I am  introducing, the End Shutdown Act.   When Congress is unable to come to an agreement about government  funding, Federal employees, government contractors, and Americans who  depend on critical government services all suffer the consequences of  using government shutdowns as a negotiating tactic. This bill prevents  government shutdowns by initiating an automatic continuing resolution  on October 1 if no appropriations bill is passed by that date and stops  Congress from considering any nonemergency legislation until it reaches  a long-term spending deal.   For Federal employees who are forced to go without a paycheck through  no fault of their own during a government shutdown, furlough can mean  falling behind on mortgage, rent, or student loan payments and  uncertainty about how to put food on the table for their families. I am  glad my colleagues and I were able to guarantee backpay for all Federal  employees in 2019, but the potential for prolonged shutdowns continues  to threaten families' budgets and local economies. Virginia is home to  more than 170,000 Federal employees and tens of thousands of Federal  contractors. They are not a bargaining chip to be played in these  negotiations.   Government shutdowns disproportionately harm Virginia's economy, but  over 80 percent of Federal workers live and work outside of the DC  area. Shutdowns inflict pain on communities across the Nation, as they  disrupt Federal contracts and loans to small businesses, complicate  supply chains, and stall the release of data business owners need to  make decisions.   Further, government shutdowns halt the essential services that  furloughed employees are unable to provide, from food inspection  services to passport renewals and Social Security card replacement.  Over the past two decades, government shutdowns have put some of our  most essential programs like Medicare, SNAP, TANF, and WIC in jeopardy.  Using government shutdowns as a negotiating tactic has the potential to  inflict senseless pain on millions of Americans who rely on these and  other Federal programs.   By ending the threat of government shutdowns, Congress can ensure no  one can ever again hold public servants and critical programs hostage  by using a shutdown as a negotiating tactic. I encourage my colleagues  to support this common-sense proposal that is needed for both the  American people and the Federal employees across the country on whom we  rely.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Merkley, and Mr.          Whitehouse):   S. 2730. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish a  national usury rate for consumer credit transactions; to the Committee  on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
