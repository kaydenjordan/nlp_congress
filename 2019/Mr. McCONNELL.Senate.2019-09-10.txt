 Madam President, the Senate is in the midst of  confirming several more of the President's well-qualified nominees to  important Federal posts. After we complete today's vote on Ambassador  Kelly Craft, whom we confirmed a month ago to serve as Ambassador to  the United Nations, we will turn to several more public servants whom  the President has asked to serve at the Departments of State, Treasury,  Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs, among others.   Meanwhile, the Appropriations Committee is working to produce  government funding legislation. With a good-faith, bipartisan,  bicameral approach, we will be able to build on the agreement the  President signed into law last month and ensure adequate funding for  the American people's priorities. As always, I know my colleagues and I  are grateful to Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for their  work. I hope we are able to consider significant bipartisan funding  legislation here on the floor this month before turning to a temporary  continuing resolution while work continues.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on an entirely different matter,  today Congress observes the 400th anniversary of a reprehensible moment  in the history of our land. In August 1619, an English ship landed at  the tip of Virginia's Lower Peninsula. On board were 20-some Africans  whom the crew had captured from a Portuguese slave ship. These men and  women were sold to the Colonies, and with that, England's American  Colonies had taken their first step into the already massive  transatlantic slave trade. The shameful history of slavery in what  would become our Nation had begun.   In many ways, slavery is the original sin of the United States of  America. This systematic racial exploitation wove its way into the  Colonies' economies and societies. Almost two centuries later, the  disgusting practice was a stumbling block in our founding debates. It  ultimately was allowed to continue for the sake of union.   Some of our Founders participated personally even as they argued the  philosophical case for equality under God and under law. Thomas  Jefferson owned slaves while he wrote the Declaration of Independence-- and the shameful inconsistency was not lost on him. Jefferson wrote:  ``Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just:  that his justice cannot sleep forever.''   Indeed, justice did not sleep forever. The last century and a half  has seen the moral truths on which this Nation is founded slowly  overcome one racist evil after another. After an unthinkably bloody  Civil War, slavery in America was no more. Almost a century later--much  too late--the failures of Reconstruction and the cruelty of Jim Crow  began giving way to the heroism of the civil rights movement.   Change has come too slow. The process has been incredibly imperfect.  But every American should take pride in the undeniable progress we have  made  [[Page S5374]]  in overcoming the terrible chapter that was opened 400 years ago. We  should take pride that our American ideals of equality and justice--not  the sins of our forefathers--are the true, deepest bedrock of this  great Nation.   Today, with the Nation, Congress looks back to 1619 and remembers the  size and scope of slavery's stain on our history. We mark this somber  anniversary with grief for all the slaves whose God-given freedoms were  so brutally denied. We reflect gratefully on the tremendous, rich  contribution that generations of African Americans have made to this  Nation despite this violence and adversity. We give thanks that true  American values slammed the door on this unjust part of our Nation's  history and continue to prevail today.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
