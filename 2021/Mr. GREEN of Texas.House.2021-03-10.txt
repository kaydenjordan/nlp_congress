 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and I rise with  gratitude and appreciation for the Biden administration. This  administration did not give up, did not give in. This administration  has become now a symbol of hope and help for working class people. It  is time for us to put more emphasis on the workers and less emphasis on  the billionaire class.                                time  1145
