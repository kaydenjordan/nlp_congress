 Mr. Speaker, I stand here  this morning for Nicole, Miriam, Antonio, Karen, Leo, Adriana, and  hundreds of thousands of other young Americans who dream and pray for  only one thing: that this esteemed body of elected Representatives,  endowed with a solemn responsibility to enact laws, will see a piece of  themselves in them; that they will see beyond the circumstances by  which they came to call America home and, instead, see the American  values that they hold deep in their heart of hearts.   I would surmise that there isn't one congressional district that  isn't home to a DREAMer, and, by God, we are all lucky for it because,  to our kids, DREAMers are their friends; to our students, DREAMers are  their teachers; and to our seniors and elders, DREAMers are, in fact,  their caretakers.   DREAMers are entrepreneurs with the grit and determination to do  something with nothing, following in the footsteps of intrepid  explorers who forged new paths that led us to amazing discoveries.   To our economy, DREAMers are a well-oiled engine of valedictorians,  doctors, software engineers, and technicians hoping to give back to  their communities. Their imagination and determination is a driving  force in the offices of Fortune 500 companies and the Main Streets of  our towns and cities.   And every year, for the next decade, DREAMer ingenuity and tenacity  will quite literally pump billions into our economy. Their efforts help  America grow faster and stronger. And collectively, for our Nation,  they represent our future and are a reflection of our values.   DREAMers are wide-eyed American optimism. They work so hard because  they are so grateful and, despite setbacks, they persevere. Despite  struggles, they overcome, just as Americans always have. And in the  face of unbelievable adversity, DREAMers beam the hopefulness and  dynamism that gives meaning to the American promise.   Our Founders knew that our democracy wasn't perfect, but they  believed that, as lawmakers and representatives, we would work every  day to live up to the ideals they set forth. And today, we have an  opportunity to do just that.   All we have to do is enshrine the promise that unlocked the  incredible potential of these young Americans by passing the Dream Act  now. With one vote, we have a chance to unite our country around young  people who embody our belief that hard work actually pays off.   So I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that  we can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide  certainty for Americans like Nicole, Miriam, Antonio, Karen, Leo, and  Adriana who want to continue to contribute to the country that they  love, the only country they have ever known. We cannot afford to wait  another day.                                time  0340
