 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Thanet Natisri of  Marion, Illinois, for his role in rescuing 12 young soccer players and  their coach from a flooded cave in Thailand earlier this month.   Thanet, a groundwater expert educated at SIU Carbondale, began doing  charity work in his native country of Thailand 3 years ago. He was in  Thailand assisting rural residents in fixing their water problems when  he got the call from the Thai military. Within 3 hours, he was on a  plane to go help divert rising water levels in the cave.   The rescue operation used his expertise to divert water and allow  divers to reach the soccer team. After 18 grueling days, which  captivated the world, the boys and their soccer coach were safely  rescued.   Thanet, you played a vitally important role in saving 13 lives.  Southern Illinois is proud.                       Recognizing Officer James Holder     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer James Holder  of Pinckneyville Police Department for receiving the Illinois State Bar  Association's Law Enforcement Award. The Law Enforcement Award  recognizes officer conduct that promotes justice and brings honor and  respect to the entire criminal justice system.   Officer Holder was acknowledged for his involvement in a search and  rescue operation during a major fire in an apartment building next to  the Perry County Jail. He forcibly entered the building, notifying  residents to immediately evacuate and clearing housing units to ensure  no one was present.   He proceeded to identify the source of the fire and work with other  first responders as traffic and crowd control.   Thank you, Officer Holder, for your brave service, and thank you to  all of our first responders who are out there risking their lives every  day to keep our communities safe.                            ____________________
