 Madam President, today, the Senate will have a chance to  act on a pernicious issue that has recently become an increasingly  prevalent component in America's gun violence epidemic: the evil spread  of White supremacy and domestic terrorism.   In the past 2 weeks, the United States has endured two of the most  traumatic mass shootings that we have seen in recent history. In my  home State of New York, in the beloved city of Buffalo, 10 Black  Americans were gunned down in broad daylight by a White supremacist  armed with an AR-15 and whose mind was poisoned by online  conspiracies--White supremacist conspiracies.   And 2 days ago, 19 children--19 children: 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds,  10-year-olds, kids on the verge of beginning summer, kids with their  entire lives ahead of them; we saw them holding up their trophies and  proudly in their T-  [[Page S2714]]  shirts, and a few hours later they were gone--slaughtered in the  predominantly Latino town of Uvalde, TX. Two teachers, including a  mother of four, were killed alongside them. Many more were injured and  remain in critical condition.   It was the worst school shooting in America since Sandy Hook. Last  night, I looked at the pictures of each of those kids online, and I  wept--taken from us, taken from their families through senseless gun  violence. I can't stop thinking about the parents, too, who lost their  kids. I can't stop imagining the paralyzing horror of being one of the  parents showing up to the school after the shooting, wondering where  their kid was--the anxiety that will live with these parents forever-- forced to wait hours before a DNA test--a DNA test--confirmed that  their son or daughter was gone. I cannot imagine a hell--a hell--worse  than that.   And these families, my colleagues, don't want thoughts and prayers.  They want their elected leaders to respond to their suffering. They  don't want to be lifted up. They don't want good intentions. They want  something to change. They want results.   Yet the MAGA Republicans don't want to get results. They are ossified  in their opposition to any action on gun safety. No matter the cause of  violence and no matter the cost on families, nothing seems to move  them.   Yesterday, after Beto O'Rourke confronted Texas Governor Abbott's  press conference, the MAGA Governor gave some empty platitudes about  healing and hope. He asked people to put their agendas aside and think  about someone other than themselves.   My God, how dare he. What an absolute fraud the Governor of Texas is.  And this is the same Governor Abbott who tomorrow--tomorrow--will go  speak at the NRA convention in Houston.   Governor Abbott, will you ask your MAGA buddies and your NRA pals to  put aside their agendas and think of someone other than themselves like  you asked the families to do? Will you ask the gun manufacturing reps  who swarm over the NRA convention to put aside their agendas and think  about someone other than themselves? Of course not.   The Governor--Governor Abbott--is more likely to outline some new  plans to further loosen gun restrictions. No amount of bloodshed seems  to be enough for MAGA Republicans.   This Nation is enraged as well as being exhausted. It has been  through this over and over and over again over the last two decades.  People are sick of mourning again and again while listening to the same  string of hollow words from the MAGA Republicans that never lead to  action.   So in a few moments, the Senate will have a chance to vote on one  important cause of gun violence. The legislation before the Senate  today is the Domestic Terrorism Protection Act, which I scheduled for a  vote earlier this week before what happened in Uvalde occurred. It was  done to respond to the massacre in the supermarket in Buffalo.   The bill is so important because the mass shooting in Buffalo was an  act of domestic terrorism. We need to call it what it is: domestic  terrorism. It was terrorism that fed off the poison of conspiracy  theories like ``White replacement theory''; terrorism that left 10  people dead, a community forever torn asunder. This bill will give the  government the tools to monitor, find, and arrest these evil actors  before they have a chance to inflict violence on their communities. I  thank my colleague Senator Durbin for championing this bill.   I have been going to bed every night thinking about the families I  met in Buffalo in the aftermath of the shooting. I think about this  little 3-year-old boy. He lost his dad who went to that Tops grocery  store to buy him a birthday cake--a birthday cake for his son. That  little boy is going to live with that the rest of his life--the rest of  his life. I think about all the families impacted by other racially  motivated shootings over the year. Buffalo, certainly, unfortunately,  wasn't the first--Charleston, El Paso, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and so many  others; the shooting of Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, gay  Americans, Jewish Americans, as well as Black Americans all because of  this horrible ``White replacement theory.''   So today is the day we can begin to debate on how to make these  shootings less likely. And there is an additional benefit to moving  forward today. It is a chance to have a larger debate in considering  amendments for gun safety legislation in general, not just for those  motivated by racism, as vital as it is to do that.   I know that many Members on the other side hold views that are  different than the views on this side of the aisle. So let us move on  this bill. Let us proceed and then they can bring them to the floor.   Senator Johnson brought a bill to the floor yesterday about school  security practices. I didn't agree with the bill, and I don't think it  is the answer to mass shootings. We don't need more guns in the  schools. There were security guards at the supermarket in Buffalo,  police and security at the school in Uvalde, but we can debate it. The  same with Senator Cruz's plan to limit schools to only one door. Fire  marshals and tactical experts totally and vehemently disagree. Let's  debate it.   And there are other Senators with other proposals--proposals that  come from our side of the aisle--background checks, red flag laws, the  Charleston loophole, assault weapons, and other ideas.   Look, I know the chances of getting 10 votes on this bill are small,  unfortunately, given the influence of MAGA Republicans. Many  Republicans have made their opposition clear. Again, there are a lot of  MAGA Republicans for whom no amount of gun violence--whether it is  domestic terrorism, a school shooting, a neighborhood shooting, or  something else--will ever--ever--convince them to take any action.    If Republicans obstruct debate today, we are prepared to have an  honest and realistic discussion, conversation, negotiation for a little  more time to see what they can come to the table with.   We are under no illusions that this will be easy. We have been burned  in the past when Republicans promised to debate only for them to break  their promise. But even with long odds, the issue is so important, so  raw to the American people, so personal to countless families who are  missing children, that we must pursue that opportunity. We also know  that the American people--as many as 80 percent or 90 percent--support  gun safety legislation.   We have an obligation to pursue every path and explore every  realistic option to break the cycle of suffering and inaction. Not  trying everything is not acceptable to the families who have lost their  loved ones to our Nation's gun epidemic. To those beautiful children we  see pictures of in the newspaper and their families, we have to try  everything. We must not leave a single stone unturned.   Senator Murphy, who has been such a strong and valiant leader within  our caucus on gun safety legislation and who has seen the suffering  firsthand of the families at Sandy Hook whom he has become very close  to, has asked for space to see what progress can be done with Senate  Republicans.   Neither he nor I is under an illusion that this will be easy; it will  not. But his view, my view, and the overwhelming view of our caucus is  that we need to give it a short amount of time to try. There are  others, too, in this caucus reaching out to our Republican colleagues  as we speak--Senator Blumenthal, Senator Coons, Senator Heinrich,  Senator Manchin, and others. We have also been in talks with our allies  across gun advocacy groups, and we all have a strong and burning desire  to see something real, something tangible come across, come together  here in the Senate.   Again, none of us are under any illusions that it will be easy. None  of us want to let this drag out. We know all too well the vice grip  that the NRA and MAGA wing hold over the GOP, and we have been burned  in the past. America has been burned in the past.   After the shootings in El Paso and Dayton 3 years ago, the Republican  leader promised red flag laws and background checks would be front and  center in the Senate debate. He didn't put them on the floor, and  Republicans did nothing. But that is not an excuse for Democrats not to  try. Too many families have suffered, too many kids have been lost, too  many communities have  [[Page S2715]]  been destroyed. This is too important not to explore every option.   I want to be clear. This is not an invite to negotiating  indefinitely. Make no mistake about it, if these negotiations do not  bear fruit in a short period of time, the Senate will vote on gun  safety legislation. Let me repeat. If these negotiations do not bear  any fruit, the Senate will vote on gun safety legislation when we  return. But our hope, even amidst our deep skepticism, is, during this  week, Democrats and Republicans, at long last, will come to agree on  something meaningful that will reduce gun violence in a real way in  America. Senator Murphy and some of our colleagues believe that it is  worth a chance, and we will give it that chance.   Unfortunately, though, Republicans haven't come forward in too long a  time. There hasn't been this debate in too long a time. But even though  it hasn't happened in too long a time, we feel an obligation to give it  a chance.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, now let me explain. I entered my ``no''  vote so we can bring this up again and gain more support. So I enter a  motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 477.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 388,  H.R. 3967.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, May 26, be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 707, 743, 769, 964, 894, 895, 905, and 906; that  the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action  or debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table; that any statements related to the nominations be  printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 927 through  963 and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Air Force, Army,  Marine Corps, Navy, and Space Force; that the nominations be confirmed  en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order to any of the nominations; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate resume  legislative session.
