 Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about our Nation's economy. On Friday, we saw new inflation numbers,  and we found inflation remains the worst that it's been in 40 years.   We also found out that in the first three months of this year, the  American economy actually shrank.   Why did it shrink? Well, because of the inflation that is hitting  hard every family in America. So now we have a terrible situation with  soaring inflation and a stagnant economy--both at the same time. People  are paying more and more, and they are getting less and less.   Now, the last time this happened, was in the 1970s. It was called  ``stagflation.'' Back then, all the liberal economic experts said it  was impossible, you couldn't have soaring inflation in a stagnant  economy, but we did. And now here we are 50 years later, same thing  again.   This is hitting American families like a sledgehammer, and the people  are suffering all across this country. Inflation has been so high for  so long, the experts tell us it might lead to a recession.  [[Page S2260]]    Now, a recession is when the economy shrinks for six months. We are  already halfway there. Joe Biden, the other day, said everything was  fine. He said he was not concerned at all about a recession.   He said no one is predicting a recession right now.   Well, that is just not true. Maybe he is not listening, but people  within his own administration are predicting additional dire economic  times ahead.   Look, our economy has underperformed projections in four out of the  last five quarters since Joe Biden has become President. Joe Biden's  own Labor Secretary admits a recession is a real likelihood. Last  month, Deutsche Bank predicted a recession by the end of next year.  Three days later, the Bank of America told investors inflation shock is  worsening; interest rate shock is just beginning; and recession shock  is coming.   Bank of America went on to say that ``inflation is out of control and  inflation causes recessions.''   Last month, Larry Summers pointed out that the United States has  never had the current inflation rate and the current unemployment rate  without a recession coming within 2 years.   Larry Summers went on to say:         Recession in the next couple of years is more likely than       not.    More likely than not.         I suspect that is how the consensus will evolve.    Well, Larry Summers is right. He has been right before. He has been  right about inflation. This is economics 101. It is also American  history 101.   High inflation brings about a change in the Federal Reserve, so they  raise interest rates, and when they raise interest rates, the economy  slows down. That is what we are seeing.   Inflation is the worst it has been in 40 years, and in March the  Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time in 4 years. The Fed is  widely expected to raise rates again very soon. It is easy to see where  this is all going. Joe Biden's inflation will soon lead to Joe Biden's  recession. Now, maybe Joe Biden is hoping that stagnation will be  transitory, just like he said of inflation for month after month after  month after month after month.   The American people have seen this before. Unlike Joe Biden, the  American people are concerned about inflation and they are concerned  about a stagnant economy and they are concerned about a recession.   Apparently, the President likes to laugh about it. In the last 12  months, we have seen the highest inflation ever recorded for household  staples--chicken, lunch meat, baby food. It is hard to get infant  formula now. There is a shortage of that all across the country. The  American people are feeling stuck in place. They are very stressed, and  they feel the squeeze every day.   One estimate says the typical family will pay $5,200 more this year  than they did last year just to buy the same things. That is $100 a  week. This is in addition to the inflation that we suffered last year.  Add the two together, working families are paying much, much more to  buy the same things that they bought 2 years ago.   The truth is painful, and the painful truth is that the average  American family is poorer today than they were the day that Joe Biden  took office. People have had to change so much in their lives because  of this. They have had to change the way they drive, had to change the  way they shop and eat, had to change the way they live.   A poll last week found that two out of every three American families  have had to cut back on spending because of inflation. Half said they  are struggling to pay rent. Nearly 90 percent of the American people  said they want Congress to bring down inflation.   So what have Democrats had to do about this over the last 15 months?  Well, last week, the Democratic leader said this: He said he wants to  raise taxes. He said it is the only way to conceivably bring down  inflation--raising taxes.   Well, that may be the only way that Chuck Schumer knows, but I would  just say that is not going to bring down inflation, and it is not going  to help the economy.   Prices are up. Interest rates are going up. Now Democrats want taxes  to go up on top of it. Energy prices are at record highs. You have to  empty your wallet to fill your tank, and yet Chuck Schumer's answer is  higher tax rates.   With a recession ready to hit the country, Democrats want to take  more money out of the pockets of hard-working people. Well, there is  not a lot left to take, I would say to the majority leader of the U.S.  Senate and to the President of the United States.   It is really no wonder, then, that two out of every three Americans  disapprove of the way the President of the United States is handling  the economy. The American people know that Democrats--every one of them  voted in lockstep with Joe Biden for 15 months. They remember every  single Democrat in the Senate voted with Joe Biden on his major  spending bill. The American people remember every Democrat supported  Joe Biden's economic priorities, which, of course, hurt the economy.   The results have been disastrous for the American people. We know  what we need to do. We need to lower costs. We need to reduce these  burdensome regulations. We need to get back to American energy-- American energy, affordable energy, reliable energy--not going hat in  hand to people around the world. We do much better if we are American  energy dominant, selling energy to our friends rather than having to  buy it from our enemies.   We have had the strongest economic times in the United States in my  lifetime prior to the pandemic. We know what brought it to us. It was  lower taxes, more American energy, limiting regulations. Those are the  things that make a difference. Those are the things that Joe Biden has  chosen to ignore.   The American people are struggling and suffering, and it is about  time they get an administration focused on their needs, not on the  needs of an administration which is woefully out of touch with the  American people.
