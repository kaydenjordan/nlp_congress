 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here today to address Democrats'  deceptively labeled ``For the People Act,'' which should more  accurately be labeled the ``For the Politicians Act.''   This legislation represents a breathtaking, unprecedented power grab.  In a 50-50 Senate, this is a blatant attempt by those who are in power  by the slimmest possible margin to take over and rewrite the election  and campaign rules for all 50 States in one fell swoop.   This would be done on an entirely partisan basis to ensure candidates  from that same party win elections. In fact, while the only supporters  of the bill are Democrats, there is bipartisan opposition to this  legislation.   This legislation would disenfranchise every American through the  Federal seizure of the authority of each State's representatives to set  election rules for their State in accordance with the wishes of their  citizens.   This partisan legislation would wash away election integrity  measures, making it easier to cheat. Each invalid vote cast dilutes the  strength of each valid vote cast.   Our form of government for the people and by the people rests upon  voters' faith in the integrity of our elections. If we allow that faith  in our elections to continue to be compromised, we are allowing the  very foundation of our American system to be eroded.   Democrats don't want to talk about the details of this legislation.  They don't want you to peek under the hood. They want to just slap a  voting rights bumper sticker on it, jam it through, and then disparage  and name-call anyone who opposes it.   So let's take a look at exactly what is in this legislation.   Under this legislation, a Federal politician running for election can  take millions in taxpayer money for his or her own campaign.   The legislation says that States must then allow that politician to  pay political operatives to visit nursing homes, dormitories, emergency  shelters, and other residences to collect thousands of ballots and,  then, choose which ones to be dropped into unmanned drop boxes, maybe  in the middle of the night.   This bill would make it illegal for States to verify the identity of  voters at the polls. Under this bill, ballots arriving even a week  after election day would still be counted.   It would require States to adopt universal mail-in voting practices.  States would be forced to allow murderers, rapists, and child molesters  to vote, even if a State's citizens have adopted laws to prevent it.   It would require States to allow unregistered voters to cast ballots  by simply showing up on election day and signing a form, without an ID  and with no vetting allowed.   The bill would silence political speech by religious and nonprofit  organizations while politicians can use taxpayer dollars to air attack  ads with which many Americans would find distasteful.   The bill provides that if anyone disputes any of this, that is OK.  They can lodge their complaints with the Federal Election Commission, a  body that has been bipartisan since its creation. But wait. In addition  to changing the rules to benefit one team, the legislation also ``buys  off the umpire'' by transforming the FEC into a partisan, Democrat- controlled body--a body that could hound the opposing party candidates  to the ends of the Earth. This bill transforms the judge into the  prosecutor.   I wish that was all this legislation did. It also snatches the  responsibility for drawing Congressional districts from the elected  representatives of all 50 States, who have done that job for the last  230 years, and sets up a Byzantine process that would ultimately hand  it over to an academic consultant hired by a liberal judge right here  in Washington.   Let me repeat that: A consultant hired by a judge in Washington, DC,  will be drawing every congressional district in the country.   Using government power to seize control of elections, to limit  speech, to pack tribunals, to ensure the ruling party stays in power-- that sounds like a headline you would hear in Venezuela, Russia, Iran,  or even China, not in the United States of America.   Not too long ago, both parties would have considered this partisan  power grab beyond the pale. But far-left operatives want permanent  power, and Democrats, eager to keep the power for themselves, are  afraid to tell them no.   Democrats are now characterizing this legislation as an emergency  response to recent legislation in a few States. This legislation isn't  just a solution in search of a problem; it is a power grab that for  years has been in search of a crisis--any crisis, manufactured or  otherwise--that can be used to justify it.   Democrat operatives introduced a previous version of this bill on  January 24, 2017, 4 days after President Trump took office. The  purported crisis then was the American people's election of Donald  Trump, which the Democrats found unacceptable. They continued this  effort by introducing yet another version of the ``For the Politicians  Act'' in 2019, which at that time passed the House without a single  Republican vote. Like the bill the Senate will consider this week, this  bill was a Democrat operative's electioneering fantasy--federalizing  unlimited mail-in voting, prohibiting voter ID requirements, and  allowing unregistered voters to show up and vote on election  [[Page S4647]]  day. Wisely, the Senate, in 2019, never took it up.   Then, as the pandemic took root in the spring of 2020, Democrats, in  search of yet a new crisis to justify this bill, included it in a  pandemic relief bill that the House passed--again, without a single  Republican vote. Once again, the Senate dismissed it and wisely focused  on providing bipartisan pandemic relief, rather than using the pandemic  as a justification to federalize elections.   With the pandemic now in the rearview mirror, this legislation is  being pitched as necessary to preserve voting rights, using cartoonish,  overheated, and false characterizations of a few sensible, measured  voting integrity laws that have recently been enacted by States. Why?  Because Democrats have to invent a new crisis every 6 months or so to  conceal this quest to install themselves permanently into power.   Don't let them fool you. This isn't about some State election law.  The House passed virtually the same bill last year. Most of the  components of this bill have been floating in Democrat National  Committee back rooms for years.   This isn't about voting rights. This legislation protects voting  rights like banning security guards at banks would protect bank  depositors.   Now, why are the Democrats so desperate to pass this bill? Well, a  recent report from POLITICO explains it. POLITICO says:         What's at stake is . . . potentially the future Democratic       majorities. Many in the party privately worry that frontline       Democrats could lose their seats if Congress doesn't [pass       this bill].    So, to keep power, Democrats have determined that they have to take  over State elections. This is about holding on to power and nothing  else. There doesn't seem to be a power grab that is too extreme for the  modern left, whether it is this bill, legislation to pack the Supreme  Court, suddenly changing their position and pushing to scrap  fundamental Senate rules in order to obtain short-term political gains  or adding Washington, DC, as a State. It is all about one thing-- fulfilling a fantasy of permanent Democrat power.   Under this legislation, American elections would no longer be about  earning the support of voters by communicating a powerful vision.  Rather, American elections would be all about creating the largest  machine, identifying favorable voters, and mass-gathering their ballots  door-to-door as efficiently as possible.   The winning campaign would be the one with the largest army of ballot  harvesters to drive voters--registered or unregistered, with or without  ID--to fill out and hand over a ballot that will be ``dropped'' on  their behalf in unmanned ballot boxes.   Americans want commonsense laws that make it easier to vote and  harder to cheat. Such laws currently exist throughout the country. That  is why we had recordbreaking voter participation in 2020, including in  my State of Tennessee.   This legislation is as unnecessary as it is misguided and dangerous.  It is a politician protection measure that would do irreparable damage  to the fabric of this country, and it should be soundly rejected by  this body   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
