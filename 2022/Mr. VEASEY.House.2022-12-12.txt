 Mr. Speaker, in October of 2019, on the south side of  Fort Worth, Texas, on East Allen Avenue, Atatiana Jefferson, a young  Black woman, who was inside of her home playing video games with her  nephew, was killed by a police officer--again, inside of her home.   This week, we are witnessing the trial of that police officer, and  the Black community in Fort Worth is obviously watching this trial very  closely.   Mr. Speaker, for far too long, when these killings have taken place,  people have not been held accountable by our court system, and  rightfully so. People in Fort Worth, again, particularly in the Black  community, want to see justice in this case; because let's be clear,  these killings are too much of a reality in Black and Brown communities  all across our country. We want justice, we demand justice, and we want  justice now.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to be watching this case very closely. I  pray for this family and pray for the right outcome for Atatiana  Jefferson. She deserves justice.                            ____________________
