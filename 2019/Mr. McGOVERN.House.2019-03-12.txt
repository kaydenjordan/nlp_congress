 Mr. Speaker, in September 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by  two major hurricanes, Irma and Maria, both of which caused catastrophic  damage, displaced thousands of families, and killed almost 3,000  American citizens. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration  organized an embarrassingly slow and ineffective response during Puerto  Rico's time of need.   Last July, FEMA released a report acknowledging many of their  shortcomings in responding to Hurricane Maria. And I am sure we all  remember images of the President tastelessly throwing paper towels at  families during his relief visit, as if he were shooting free throws at  a basketball game.   It has been a year and a half since Hurricane Maria, and Puerto Rico  has made incredible strides to rebuild, but many, many families are  still struggling. These are American citizens who pay taxes and who  work hard, just like mainland Americans, but for some reason, the Trump  administration is having a hard time empathizing.   When I think of all the ways the Trump administration has attacked  low-income and working families, I can't say I am surprised.   Last week, The Washington Post reported that Puerto Rico was forced  to start cutting its Nutrition Assistance Program, NAP, benefits.  Puerto Rico's food assistance program is funded by a capped block grant  separate from SNAP. While other Federal nutrition programs like WIC and  school meals operate in Puerto Rico the same as in other States and  territories, Puerto Rico remains disadvantaged because their Nutrition  Assistance Program funds are static.   In order to receive nutrition assistance in Puerto Rico, you have to  have a lower income--to receive less assistance--than someone who lives  on the mainland. It also limits the program's flexibility to respond to  changes in demand. When the hurricane struck, additional funds had to  be given to NAP to accommodate more participants.   These forced cuts will reduce Puerto Rico's food assistance benefits  by 25 percent for 1.3 million people. That is 43 percent of Puerto  Rico's population. While it is true that this cut will restore the  overall benefit amount to where it was before the hurricane, we must  remember that these participants often need more assistance, given the  circumstances. It is not easy to rebuild your entire life on an empty  stomach.   Mr. Speaker, on more than one occasion, House Democrats have asked  for an additional $600 million to help Puerto Rico through this rough  patch, only to be shut down by the President and his misplaced, ill- informed prejudices toward Puerto Rico. Even Leader McConnell seems to  be helping the President do his dirty work by refusing to take up the  supplemental appropriations bill that we sent to the Senate during the  shutdown in January, probably because it would force them to address  relief funds for Puerto Rico.   Pulling out the rug from beneath Puerto Rico does not solve the  problem; it creates a bigger one. This won't disappear. That is why I  urge my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to appropriate an additional $600  million for Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance Program.   I also urge my colleagues in the House to support these funds and  speak out on this issue. The least we can do is empathize with our  fellow Americans who are recovering from a natural disaster.   It doesn't happen overnight. It doesn't take months. It takes years  to recover from the devastation that Hurricane Maria caused, and Puerto  Rico has continued to fight and advocate for disaster funds, unlike  States on the mainland.   Time is running out, and we can't allow these cuts to continue. This  is a moral question for all of us here in this Chamber. This is about  how are we going to treat our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico.   It is all on us to act. It is all on us to end hunger now.                            ____________________
