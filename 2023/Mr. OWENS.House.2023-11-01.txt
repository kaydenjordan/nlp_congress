 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 798) condemning the support of Hamas, Hezbollah,  and other terrorist organizations at institutions of higher education,  which may lead to the creation of a hostile environment for Jewish  students, faculty, and staff, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 798         Whereas both Hamas and Hezbollah are recognized by the       United States Department of State as Foreign Terrorist       Organizations;        Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise       attack to deliberately target Israeli civilians, including       the killing and abduction of men, women, children, and the       elderly;        Whereas Hamas' stated goal is the entire destruction of the       State of Israel and the murder of its Jewish citizens;        Whereas a disturbing number of student organizations at       institutions of higher education placed blame solely upon the       State of Israel for the attack and expressed support for the       terrorist actions of Hamas through the glorification of       violence and the usage of antisemitic rhetoric;        Whereas on October 9, 2023, the national leadership of       Students for Justice in Palestine declared a ``day of       resistance'' calling on student chapters across the United       States to demonstrate by ``not just slogans and rallies, but       armed confrontation with oppressors'' and following this       announcement many chapters issued pro-Hamas statements;        Whereas on October 10, 2023, a Stanford University lecturer       targeted Jewish students during a class on colonialism,       justifying the actions of Hamas terrorists by calling them       ``freedom fighters'' and asking Jewish students to identify       themselves and stand in the corner to illustrate what ``Jews       were doing to Palestinians'';        Whereas on October 15, 2023, in a complete disregard for       humanity, a Cornell University professor grabbed the       microphone at a campus rally and pronounced that, ``Hamas has       challenged the monopoly of violence'' and ``it was       exhilarating. It was energizing. . .I was exhilarated,'' in       reference to Hamas' terror attack on Israel;        Whereas on October 22, 2023, the Brandeis University       student government voted down a simple resolution condemning       Hamas and calling on the immediate release of all hostages       back to their families unharmed;        Whereas on October 24, 2023, George Washington University       students at a vigil to support Hamas' surprise attack       prominently projected signs on the walls of the university's       library including, ``Glory to our Martyrs'';        Whereas many administrations of institutions of higher       education do not follow the practice of institutional       neutrality and frequently speak out on public issues, but       have failed to speak out clearly after the October 7 attack       by Hamas, and have exposed their  [[Page H5202]]       lack of regard for their Jewish and pro-Israel students; and        Whereas the glorification of violence and usage of       antisemitic rhetoric creates a hostile learning and working       environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the support of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other       terrorist organizations at institutions of higher education,       which may lead to the creation of a hostile environment for       Jewish students, faculty, and staff;        (2) calls on campus administrators--        (A) to condemn all forms of antisemitism on college       campuses; and        (B) to ensure Jewish faculty, students, and guests can       exercise the same Free Speech rights as are guaranteed to all       other faculty, students, and guests without intimidation; and        (3) urges enforcement of Federal civil rights laws to       protect Jewish students from antisemitism.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Res. 798, as amended, the resolution now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 798, condemning the  hateful acts of anti-Semitism spreading like wildfire across American  college campuses.   Last year, I made my first trip with a few of my colleagues to  Israel, where we were welcomed by Jewish citizens of all backgrounds-- Black, European, Russian, Arabian, and Palestinian.   During a visit to a Jewish family's home near the Gaza border, I held  a bomb fragment that had landed in their front yard. I saw a lifestyle  where the norm was always being on edge. There were bomb shelters built  on both ends of elementary soccer fields and at every bus stop.   One of my colleagues asked our guests: You live so close to people  who literally hate you simply because of your religion and culture. Why  do you stay?   The answer stuck with me: Because I love my country, and this is our  home.   None of us could have imagined, a little over a year later, the pure  evil that would visit that home. They never knew how vulnerable they  were to satanic barbarism. Those who would film, call home, and bolster  the torture and death they rained down on innocent, defenseless men,  women, and children.   What does evil look like? The German Nazis attempted to hide their  acts, but these nazis have posted their acts on social media for the  world to see and remember: a pregnant mother shot in the face, her baby  cut from her womb and then beheaded; a female raped with such evil  voracity that her pelvis was broken, and she was then murdered;  grandmothers, children, and babies huddled together and then burned  alive; a young 20-year-old woman who was shown half-naked and  unconscious as she was paraded through the streets of Gaza, tortured  and desecrated by these cowardly devils. She was later found beheaded.   Within hours, 1,400 innocent, defenseless men and women, children in  their bedrooms, and teenagers celebrating peace at a music festival  were murdered without mercy.   What was the response on American campuses?   At Cornell University, a professor called the Hamas attacks  exhilarating and energizing.   At George Washington University, less than 4 miles from where I  stand, students projected the phrases ``from the river to the sea,''  and ``glory to our martyrs'' on the side of Gelman Library, a building  named after a Jewish alumni. These phrases are an explicit anti-Semitic  call for the violent eradication of Jews in the State of Israel.   At Cooper Union, Jewish students were forced to lock themselves in  the library to avoid a rabid mob chanting: ``Murder to the Jews.''  These hate-filled college students have no shame and no fear. Imagine  the accountability they would face if they were chanting: ``Murder to  the Blacks,'' or ``Murder to the trans.'' As this mob pounded on the  front door of the building, the Jewish students were quietly ushered  out the back door.   This is America 2023, not 1960. No students, regardless of race,  creed, color, or religion, should ever have to use the back door of a  campus library out of fear for their safety--not now, not ever in the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today to strongly condemn the pure evil of  Hamas, affirm Israel as our greatest ally in the Middle East, and  proclaim our unwavering support as they assert their right to self- defense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 798, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Houchin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Kiley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Bean).    Madam Speaker, in concluding this discussion, I have five  words for American colleges: You reap what you sow.   After failing miserably to condemn student support for terrorism on  your campuses, Jewish students are now living in fear. The violent  anti-Semitic protests of students educated on your campuses have  brought to light what for decades has thrived in the dark.   Many American universities are fundamentally adrift. Instead of an  environment of enlightenment and one that unites diverse ideas, they  have become incubators of hate. They call for inclusion yet exclude the  Jewish people. They call for neutrality yet stoke the flames of culture  wars that have brought us here.   Deep in the humanities department, seas of bigotry have taken root.  The poison fruits of a sanction ideology are now ripe for all to see.  In the Committee on Education and the Workforce, we will call out  rotten ideologies when we find them.   At this moment, though, we must offer in the clearest terms the  condemnation of Hamas brutality and violence. Now is the time for  Congress to shine as an example of moral clarity both at home and  abroad.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 798, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
