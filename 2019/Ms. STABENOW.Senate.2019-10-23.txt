 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I think you have heard me say before on  the floor that healthcare is personal--not political. I think it is for  all of us and our families.   Healthcare affects everybody, whether they are Republican or  Democrat, urban or rural, cheer for the Washington Nationals--go Nats-- or the Houston Astros or my Detroit Tigers that didn't make it this  year.   When people tell me their healthcare stories, I can assure you they  don't start with their political affiliation or with anything else.  They start with what is happening with them and their family. That is  because, when it comes to their health and the health of their  families, none of those other things matter. People in Michigan simply  want to know that if they or their loved ones get hurt or sick, they  are going to be able to go to the doctor and that they are going to be  able to get the healthcare they need.   Unfortunately, Michigan families have reason to be concerned right  now. Any day now, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals will rule on the  Texas v. United States case. Everything is at stake--everything-- including coverage for 17 million people through the Medicaid  expansion. People earning minimum wage will not have to pick between  having healthcare and not working or working, not getting healthcare or  not working, getting healthcare--now they can work and get healthcare-- or the ability for children to remain on their parent's health  insurance plans until age 26, coverage for preventive services like  cancer screenings and flu shots, and protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   Misty, who runs a consulting company in Leslie, MI, knows all about  preexisting conditions. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 52.  Her diagnosis came entirely out of the blue, 3 days after her husband  lost his job. She said:         We were the lucky ones. He found another job 3 months later       before our COBRA ran out.    She added this:         Insurance loss and job loss at the same time as a cancer       diagnosis are stresses that I wonder if any of those people       who are looking to get rid of coverage for people with       preexisting conditions have ever thought they would have to       confront. I doubt it.    It is estimated that about half of Michigan families includes someone  with a preexisting condition--about half--everything from heart  disease, asthma, to breast cancer. Nationwide, we are talking about 130  million people who could lose their ability to have health insurance if  healthcare reform is overturned. Think about that--130 million people.   There is another side effect of overturning healthcare reform.  Prescription drug costs could skyrocket. Now, 43 million seniors  enrolled in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are saving money  thanks to healthcare reform and thanks to the Affordable Care Act,  which helped close the prescription drug doughnut hole--what we call  the gap in coverage where you are able to get coverage. Then the  coverage is not there for a certain amount of time, and then you can  get it once your drug costs get at a higher level.   In fact, healthcare reform saved more than 11.8 million Medicare  beneficiaries almost $27 billion on their prescription drugs--almost  $27 billion on the cost of their medicine. Instead of attacking  healthcare reform, we should be working hard to reduce the ridiculous  cost of medicine, as I have talked about many times on the floor of the  Senate.   In 2017 alone, the average price of brand-name drugs that seniors  often take, just in 2017 alone, rose four times the rate of inflation-- four times the rate of inflation according to the AARP. That is one of  the reasons why 72 percent of seniors in a recent poll said they are  concerned about the cost of their medicine, whether they are going to  be able to get the lifesaving medicine they need and that the doctor is  prescribing for them.    It is absolutely shameful that people in America, one of the richest  countries in the world, are going without medicine they need to  survive. How is that happening? How are we allowing that to happen? I  have always believed that healthcare is a basic human right, and, yes,  that includes medications.   We need to do something about this. We know the No. 1 thing we can do  to lower prices is to let Medicare negotiate. Let Medicare negotiate.  The fact is, when Medicare Part D was passed, the language that the  drug companies got into the bill--specific language--to ban negotiation  slipped into the middle of that bill.   We originally were excited about it because we thought it was going  to help get Medicare prescription drug coverage, and then, of course,  the lobbying force--the largest lobbying force in DC--prescription drug  companies snuck in some language to make sure we couldn't have the  bargaining power of Medicare insurance to lower prices.   So it is real simple. We want to do something that can lower prices.  Let Medicare negotiate. Just let them negotiate like every other  insurance company. We know it works because the VA does it for  veterans. We know it works. The VA is allowed to negotiate the price of  prescription drugs, and, surprise, surprise, it saves money. It saves  40 percent compared to Medicare. Medicare could have saved $14.4  billion on just 50 drugs if it paid the same price as the VA--$14.4  billion if they paid the same price for seniors and people with  disabilities as our veterans are able to receive.   So what is stopping us? Well, we can't get the bill passed to take  off the prohibition. I offered it in the Senate Finance Committee.  Unfortunately, not one Republican colleague voted for it. We are going  to bring it up again on the floor. We are going to bring it up every  opportunity we have to make it clear that we, as Democrats, know--we  know the best way to bring down prescription drug prices. Let Medicare  negotiate. Just let them negotiate.   We know the reason we can't ever get a vote on this. In 2018, there  were 1,451 lobbyists for the pharmaceutical and health product  industry. That is almost 15 for every Member of the Senate. Think about  that. There are 100  [[Page S6086]]  Members, and there are almost 15 pharmaceutical lobbyists for every 1  Senator, and they are doing everything they can. Their job is to stop  competition, keep prices high, and they have done a very good job of  it. It is wrong for people, but they have done a very good job of what  they were assigned to do.   As I mentioned before, back in 2003, when Medicare Part D was signed  into law, they blocked Medicare from harnessing the bargaining power of  43 million American seniors to bring down the cost of their  prescription medicines. Now, 16 years later, pharmaceutical companies  are still doing everything they can to put their company profits before  people.   It is time--it is past time to help people afford their prescription  medications and protect people with preexisting conditions. People in  America, right now, shouldn't be worried about a court case in the  Fifth Circuit and what is going to happen and what that will mean for  their family and their healthcare.   We could do something about that right now--today. We could do  something right now if people wanted to. Let me remind you that it has  now been 167 days since the House passed legislation protecting people  with preexisting conditions. It has been 167 days ago the U.S. House of  Representatives passed a bill and sent it over to the Senate, and we  have not been allowed to vote on that. It has not been brought up for a  vote. It needs to come up for a vote. It needs to be taken out of the  legislative graveyard and walked to the floor of the U.S. Senate so we  can vote to really protect people with preexisting health conditions.   Misty and other cancer survivors across Michigan and across the  country shouldn't have to wait a day longer. This isn't about politics.  It is about saving lives.   Misty closed her letter to me with this: ``If [these elected  officials] are truly as concerned about life as many of them claim to  be, they need to be concerned about my life and the life of millions of  others with cancer.''   Here is my question for the majority leader: What are you waiting  for? It is time for us to act. Healthcare is personal. It should not be  political on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is time to act in  protecting people with preexisting conditions and lowering the cost of  prescription drugs.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
