 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week is National Police Week. It is  an opportunity to show our gratitude to the men and women in blue who  risk their lives every day for our safety, as well as honor those who  have lost their lives in the line of duty.   This Police Week I want to tell a story of a police chief in my home  State of Nebraska.   Local broadcast outlet KETV recently interviewed the new police chief  of Ashland, a city of about 3,000 on the eastern side of the State.  According to KETV, Chief Ryan Brady worked 19 days in a row at one  point last year. He logged over 170 hours in a 2-week period. Chief  Brady clocked more than 800 overtime hours last year. But he is on  salary. So he is not paid for any of it.   I am amazed at Chief Brady's dedication to the job. He works day  shifts, night shifts, and picks up his partners' shifts when they get  sick.   But why does he have to do all that work? Why does he have to do so  much? Well, because his department has encountered a staffing crisis.  Between retirements and trouble recruiting, the Ashland Police  Department has dwindled down to only a handful of officers.   Chief Brady told KETV:         Somebody's got to work. So the buck stops here. So, you       know, if no one else can work, I work.    I have spoken with police officers and sheriffs all over my State,  and I can tell you this is not a problem that is unique to Ashland. No,  it is not even a problem unique to Nebraska. Severe police staffing  shortages are affecting departments all across our country.   The Police Executive Research Forum found that agencies are losing  officers faster than they can hire new ones. There were 47 percent more  resignations in 2022 than in 2019, in addition to 19 percent more  retirements over the same time period. That means that large groups of  officers are leaving the force while few are trickling in. Understaffed  staffs are doing their best to keep up with these changes, but there  are also roadblocks we can help them remove when it comes to hiring.   Over the past year, I have worked with police departments across  Nebraska, as well as national law enforcement groups representing  departments across this country. From these conversations, I introduced  the Recruit and Retain Act, which would help police departments tackle  these staffing roadblocks.   This bipartisan bill would boost officer recruitment opportunities  through the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services  hiring grants. These grants can keep departments afloat. But  recruitment expenses like background checks, psychological evaluations,  and other tests are not currently included in the eligible expenses. So  this bill would allow COPS grants to cover these specific costs and  make it easier to onboard new officers. Reducing the cost of hiring  would go a long way in helping law enforcement raise staffing levels.   My bill would also establish the Pipeline Partnership Program, a new  initiative aimed at fostering youth interest in law enforcement  careers. Departments and local schools would work together to launch  mentorship opportunities, job fairs, and other activities that give  young people better insight into law enforcement work. This program  would bolster community relationships. It would help to open up  stronger local hiring pipelines for police departments too.   Finally, the bill would direct the Government Accountability Office  to study both the causes of this latest recruitment and retention  challenge as well as the effects they have on public safety.   I would like to thank Senator Coons for working with me on this bill  for many months, as well as Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar. It was great  that we saw the Judiciary Committee pass this bill by voice vote today,  and I look forward to its advancement.   I was also glad to join my colleague Senator Cornyn to help introduce  two bills that further support law enforcement's tireless work. The  Project Safe Neighborhoods Act of 2023 would reauthorize the Project  Safe Neighborhoods program through fiscal year 2026. The PSN program is  an effective bipartisan solution to violent crime that has been working  since 2001.   In Nebraska, PSN coordinates enforcement and prosecution partnerships  among Federal, State, and local law enforcement, in addition to  involvement with Nebraska communities to bring violent offenders to  justice.   The second bill, the Back the Blue Act, would protect police officers  by creating new Federal criminal penalties for attacking law  enforcement officers. Too often police officers are harmed rather than  honored in our country, and it is time that we make a Federal statement  that attackers will be punished.   Another vital area to continue addressing is the mental health of our  police officers, who face daily strains from the intensity of their  jobs. I am planning to reintroduce a bill that would direct the  Department of Health and Human Services to create a publicly accessible  online dashboard so that organizations, including law enforcement  groups, can easily search for Federal funding opportunities that  support mental health. Potential applicants would be able to search for  the  [[Page S1732]]  right mental health grants and track the status of those grants. This  bill could truly be a lifeline to officers reeling from staffing issues  or difficult cases.   In his interview, Ashland Police Chief Brady said:         I love this community. The hours that I'm putting in are       because of my care for the people.    That dedication is what we honor during National Police Week, but  let's not leave our appreciation for our selfless hard-working police  officers behind on Saturday when Police Week ends. I urge my colleagues  to continue backing the blue throughout the year and, especially, to  pass these very critical bills.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
