 Madam Speaker, I have become increasingly concerned that  the consolidation and monopolistic nature of pharmacy benefit managers,  or PBMs has negatively impacted competition in the pharmaceutical  marketplace, leading Americans to spend more on prescription drugs than  any  [[Page H5781]]  other country. These PBMs not only raise patient costs but are  potentially engaged in anticompetitive behavior.   The legislation before us today includes language requiring PBMs to  issue reports to employer sponsors of health plans outlining  information that they have been unwilling to provide to their  customers, including copays applied by insurers to drug manufacturer  costs, rebates received from manufacturers, and the PBM's rationale for  choosing certain brand name drugs over more affordable biosimilars,  generics, or therapeutics for their formularies.   Simply providing this information to the participants in group health  plans is expected to save over $2 billion over 10 years. These  biannual, employer or sponsor-specific reports will allow participants  in group health plans to make informed decisions about the services  their PBM is providing and reduce patient costs for prescription drugs.   We cannot have a serious conversation about lowering drug prices in  America without examining PBMs' ever-growing influence.
