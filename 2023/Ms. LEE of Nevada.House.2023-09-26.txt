 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my Republican  colleagues to end this MAGA meltdown and come together to avert a  government shutdown and the chaos it will bring our country.   I just returned from my hometown of Las Vegas--the entertainment  capital of the world--and spent the weekend talking to my constituents  who are fed up with the political theater here in Washington.   They can't understand how extreme Members of this body won't stop  until they force this country into a government shutdown.   Maybe those Members should have spent the weekend talking to the  thousands of TSA agents who are going to be forced to work without pay;  or the 53,000 women and children in Nevada whose vital nutrition  assistance will be put in jeopardy; or maybe the 200,000 Nevada  veterans whose VA claims processing and wait times will grow; or the  tens of thousands of Nevadans whose Medicare and Social Security  inquiries will be put on hold.   Most importantly, maybe they should have listened to the thousands of  hospitality workers and small businesses who make Las Vegas the magical  place that it is, and whose livelihoods will be put at risk by a  shutdown.   Have no doubt, without funding to keep the 50 million visitors moving  through Harry Reid International Airport each year, our city, our  hardworking families, and our local economy will suffer the  consequences of these extremists' political games, and the rest of the  country will, too.   The U.S. Travel Association estimates that a government shutdown will  cost the U.S. travel economy as much as $140 million every single day.  Let's be clear: we all know how this story ends. It ends by working  across the aisle, that is what will get us out of this mess.   House Democrats are ready to fund the government to avert a shutdown.  The question right now is: Can Republican leadership stand up to the  most extreme minority wing of their party and end this nonsense?   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.
