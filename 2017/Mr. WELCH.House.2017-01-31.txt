 Madam Speaker, I wish to introduce President Trump to two  Syrian families who made it to safety in Rutland, Vermont, just a week  before he slammed the door.   The al-Hallak family is from Damascus, and the Khatib family is from  Aleppo. These families survived a home being bombed, al Qaeda and ISIS  terrorists, and the brutal violence of the Assad regime. They found  temporary refuge in Turkey. They have now found permanent freedom in  Vermont. These good people endured all of this hardship to do what all  parents strive to do--protect their children from harm.   Madam Speaker, I wish President Trump were with me last Thursday in  Rutland to meet the al-Hallaks and the Khatibs. Do we really fear these  families when they have been so rigorously vetted?   I wish President Trump were with me to meet the generous people of  Rutland. They had good questions about the refugee program--its cost  and their security. Yet, Madam Speaker, unlike President Trump, the  folks in Rutland never, never wanted to ban Muslims and welcome only  Christians.                            ____________________
