 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 70th  anniversary of the creation of the bilateral US-UK Fulbright  Commission.   I would like to take this opportunity to honor the many exchange  scholars who have crossed the Atlantic to strengthen the special  relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. In doing  so, these individuals have forged a bond between our two nations,  rooted in Senator Fulbright's vision at the end of the Second World  War.   I quote his vision: ``The vital mortar to seal the bricks of world  order is education across international boundaries, not with the  expectation that knowledge would make us love each other, but in the  hope that it would encourage empathy between nations, and foster the  emergence of leaders whose sense of other nations and cultures would  enable them to shape specific policies based on tolerance and rational  restraint.''   The Fulbright program stands out as a symbol of collaboration and  friendship between nations. It enables students and scholars of all  stages of their academic careers to garner a deeper understanding of  and appreciation for a culture and nation different from their own.   While much has changed since the first US-UK Fulbright exchange  nearly 70 years ago, much remains the same.   As chairman of the British-American Parliamentary Group, I am proud  of the broad bipartisan and bicameral support for the US-UK Fulbright  Commission. The special relationship we have with the United Kingdom  has undoubtedly been further cemented by the friendships forged as  succeeding generations have come to a deeper understanding of each  other through academic exchange.   Important scientific discoveries have been made and Nobel Prizes won.  A Fulbright scholarship has been the catalyst for great novelists and  playwrights, economists, scientists, entrepreneurs, and, yes, even  politicians.   Today, I invite my colleagues to commemorate this 70th anniversary of  the US-UK Fulbright program by celebrating the achievements of its  alumni and pledging their continued support to ensure its enduring  success.                            ____________________
