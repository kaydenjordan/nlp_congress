 Mr. President, I recognize and honor the life of  Gus Machado, a long-time businessman and entrepreneur in Hialeah, FL,  for his contributions to the south Florida community.   Mr. Machado was born in Cuba and moved to the United States at the  age of 15, where he founded a vehicle export business. When the U.S.  and Cuba broke ties in 1960 as part of the Cold War, Mr. Machado  remained in his new home of Miami and built three more businesses that  sold General Motors vehicles to inhabitants of Puerto Rico. During the  1980s, he began selling Buicks and Fords as well, and he eventually  became the No. 1 Ford dealer in Miami-Dade County.   Mr. Machado's entrepreneurial legacy continues to employ and support  the people of south Florida to this day. Moreover, he will be  remembered for his charitable contributions, especially to St. Thomas  University in Miami--where College of Business students study in the  proudly named Gus Machado Building--as well as the American Cancer  Society.   Mr. Machado's story is an inspiring example of the American Dream and  a testament to the contributions of Cuban immigrants to South Florida.  I admire his hard work and his commitment to his community and know  that Mr. Machado's efforts will bear fruit for years to come. I send my  deepest sympathies and condolences to the entire Machado  family.                            ____________________
