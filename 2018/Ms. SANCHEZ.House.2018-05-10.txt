 Mr. Speaker, very shortly we will be losing a Member of  the House of Representatives. Charlie Dent, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, will be leaving this body. I would be remiss if I didn't  come to the floor and talk about his tremendous service to the House of  Representatives.   I had the honor and the privilege of serving with Mr. Dent on the  Ethics Committee. Not that serving on the Ethics Committee is a great  honor or a great privilege, but serving with him truly was. He is a man  of integrity, a man who kept his word, a man who worked hard to get  through the business at hand, somebody whom I could trust, and somebody  with a really great sense of humor, which, in this body, is becoming a  rarer and rarer thing.   He is truly a likeable individual, somebody who took his job and his  responsibilities seriously. And I want to wish him the best of luck in  his future endeavors, and I want him to know that he will be sorely  missed in this body.                            ____________________
