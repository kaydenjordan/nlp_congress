 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from North Carolina,  Representative Butterfield, for yielding.   Yesterday, we observed the anniversary of the ratification of the  13th Amendment, which provided that ``neither slavery nor involuntary  servitude . . . shall exist within the United States.''   It was one of the most dramatic expansions of civil rights in  American history, and for the first time, our Constitution made mention  of the institution of slavery.   155 years ago, the self-evident truth that all men are created equal  had not been fully realized. But with every generation, with every  chapter written in America's story, the people of this Nation have  fought to secure the unalienable rights which were endowed by our  Creator.   As we enter a new era, we must not forget that we stand on the  shoulders of those who came before us, giants like John Lewis, Elijah  Cummings, and C.T. Vivian who helped pave the way for millions of  little boys and little girls who believed that they could do anything  that they set their minds to, that they could become whomever they  wanted to be.   155 years after slavery, we reflect on how far this Nation has truly  come. There are many who lived a century ago who would not believe that  America today would welcome the great-grandchildren of slaves to serve  their communities and their country and our government.   We commemorate that long march toward justice and celebrate all who  have played a role in making the lives of their children better than  their own.   Today, and every day, we must continue the work of all those whose  shoulders we now stand upon. We must continue to strive toward that  more perfect Union, toward a future free from hatred, bigotry, and  violence.   The work we do in this Chamber can advance the cause for freedom,  justice, and peace. Each and every day, I pray that we continue to rise  to meet that moment.
