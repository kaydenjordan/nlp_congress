 Madam Speaker, 7 months ago, Democrats passed a  historic tax cut for middle-class families and lifted millions of  children out of poverty.   Since then, some of my conservative colleagues have had the audacity  to complain that we helped too many children.   In my district, here is what it means when 97 percent of families are  eligible for the child tax credit:   For Yvette, it means healthy food on the table.   For Sara, it means being able to afford her child's preschool  tuition.   This money goes straight into our local economy, helping parents get  back to work and build the future that their children deserve.   But without a clean extension of the child tax credit, American  families will lose this critical support just as the economy begins to  recover.   This tax credit isn't a handout. It is about putting hard-earned tax  dollars back in the pockets of working families with children.   For any of my colleagues who won't vote to help their constituents,  let me be clear: I will vote for the families in your districts and  mine because our children deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
