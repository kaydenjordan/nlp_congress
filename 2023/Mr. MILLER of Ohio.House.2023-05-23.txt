 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight a hero  of Ohio's Seventh District, Navy veteran Joe Burdick. Joe promotes  patriotism by hand-carving wooden American flags.   Like Americans themselves, each of Joe's flags is unique. They are  imperfectly perfect, complete with knots, dings, and rings, yet each is  beautiful in its own way.   From the strength and sacrifice of Old Glory red to the pure  innocence of the white, the flag represents sacrifice, independence,  and hope. Joe captures these qualities in his art.   The flag is an integral symbol of our Nation, and Joe and I agree  that desecrating the American flag is not a legitimate act of protest.  Doing so tramples on the service and sacrifice of millions who have  defended and still defend the values it stands for.   I thank Joe for using his talent for patriotism. I urge all Americans  to follow his example by always treating our flag with the solemn  reverence it deserves.                            ____________________
