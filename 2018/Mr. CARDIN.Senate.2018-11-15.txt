 Madam President, I rise to discuss the firing of Attorney  General Jeff Sessions by President Trump immediately after the midterm  elections, as well as the ongoing Justice Department investigation by  Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016  U.S. Presidential elections.   The only transparency to be found in the Trump White House is the  President's disdain for the Mueller investigation into the 2016  elections. After multiple guilty pleas and convictions among the  President's campaign advisers on this ongoing investigation, President  Trump remains relentless in his campaign to find any way possible to  limit the scope of the ongoing investigation.   I did not support Jeff Sessions' nomination to be Attorney General,  but he followed the law and rightly recused himself from overseeing the  work of Mr. Mueller and his team of professional investigators. Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should continue to oversee the Mueller  investigation. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has shown his  fidelity to the rule of law with the much needed announcement of a  special counsel to investigate potential criminal activity and  collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian Government in the  2016 elections. His choice of Robert Mueller was solid. Mr. Mueller  served as the FBI Director under both Democratic and Republican  Presidential administrations. He has a well-earned reputation as a  nonpartisan professional.   Let me remind my colleagues that when Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein made the special counsel appointment in May of 2017, he  wrote:         I determined that it is in the public interest for me to       exercise my authority and appoint a Special Counsel to assume       responsibility for this matter. . . . What I have determined       is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public       interest requires me to place this investigation under the       authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence       from the normal chain of command. . . . Considering the       unique circumstances of this matter, however, I determined       that a Special Counsel is necessary in order for the American       people to have full confidence in the outcome. Our Nation is       grounded on the rule of law, and the public must be assured       that government officials administer the law fairly. Special       Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to       conduct a thorough and complete investigation, and I am       confident that he will follow the facts, apply the law and       reach a just result.    That is what Mr. Rosenstein said when he appointed Mr. Mueller as  special counsel. Now we know just how right Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein was to worry about protecting the independence and integrity  of the special counsel's investigation so that the rule of law would be  followed and the special counsel could follow the facts, apply the law,  and reach a just result regardless of what the President wants. Indeed,  at every turn, President Trump has tried to undermine the rule of law  and interfere with this investigation. He has relentlessly criticized  the Mueller investigation in the court of public opinion, somehow  characterizing it as a ``witch-hunt'' by conflicted, ``angry  Democrats,'' notwithstanding the dozens of guilty pleas and convictions  already obtained by the special counsel, as well as Mr. Mueller's  professional, nonpartisan legacy of service.   The new Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, who is an  unconfirmed political appointee, is already on the record making  inflammatory comments on how to limit the scope of the investigation  and cut off resources. He should immediately recuse himself from the  investigation. Serious legal questions have been raised about the  legality and constitutionality of the designation by President Trump of  Mr. Whitaker, who has not been confirmed by the Senate and is heading a  Cabinet Department. The Constitution's appointment clause requires all  principal officers of the government to be nominated and have the  advice and consent of the Senate.  [[Page S7021]]    This action by President Trump imperils the very leadership of the  Justice Department and its day-to-day operations and calls into  question any decisions made by Mr. Whitaker during his temporary  service. The Senate already confirmed Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, by a 94-to-6 vote, in  April of 2017. Under Justice Department guidance and current law,  Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, who has served with distinction  under both Democratic and Republican administrations and was nominated  by President Trump, should be designated as the Acting Attorney General  until such time as the President nominates and the Senate confirms a  successor to former Attorney General Sessions.   Under the current oversight of Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein,  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation must continue until its  conclusion. The President must stop trying to impede its progress.  Congress has a responsibility to finally take legislative action to  protect the investigation from meddling by the White House, especially  from interference by the President.   The Senate has an obligation to pass legislation that would ensure  the independence of the special counsel, provide judicial review for  the removal of the special counsel, and require additional reporting to  Congress and the American people on the special counsel's  investigations, documents, and ultimate findings. S. 2644 does exactly  that and is a bipartisan bill that passed the Judiciary Committee by a  vote of 14 to 7 in April of 2018. It has sat on the Senate's calendar  for more than 6 months. The full Senate should be able to vote on this  measure immediately given the active and ongoing interference by  President Trump into the special counsel's investigation.   I hope my colleagues agree that the special counsel should be allowed  to finish his work without interference. No one under the  Constitution--not even the President--is above the law, and Congress  cannot allow the President to obstruct the special counsel's  investigation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
