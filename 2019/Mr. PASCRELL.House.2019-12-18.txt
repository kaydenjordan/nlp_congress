 Madam Speaker, we are here today because of the failure  of so many to cast aside narrow ambition to confront the threats  standing before us. Offered the chance to investigate this government  together, the President and his party stonewalled and obstructed. We  are here today because we choose comfort over courage and avarice over  the Republic.   This is the ongoing tragedy of our age. And it is ongoing. The matter  is now solely in our hands and belongs to us and us alone. The buck has  stopped. Many have invoked the judgment of history as an anecdote to  this threat, but the threat to democracy is here today, not tomorrow.   We need not and we must not await the verdict of time for Donald  Trump's abuse of power and obstruction.   We can offer that verdict right now, and we are.
