 Mr. President, I come to the floor to highlight what I  consider to be a grave injustice, and I urge us to do something about  it. I do so because I remain deeply concerned about an issue that often  flies under the radar, which is our Nation's severe lack of diversity  when it comes to broadcast station ownership.   Three years ago, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights  published a report titled ``The Abysmal State of Media Ownership  Diversity in America.'' That is an apt title, especially because,  according to the Federal Communications Commission--the Agency  responsible for regulating broadcasters--minorities in America make up  less than 3 percent of all broadcast station owners. For women, the  numbers aren't much better. They account for less than 6 percent of all  station owners.   These abysmal figures from the FCC--consistently in the single  digits--are unacceptable. They are an affront to the incredible  diversity that makes America the exceptional Nation that it is. And  simply put, we do ourselves an enormous disservice when the vast  majority of TV and radio stations in America are predominantly owned by  White men. This lack of diversity in broadcasting is a problem that  materially affects the people I represent in New Jersey.    Even as trusted sources of local news continue to be decimated,  broadcast media stations play a crucial role in educating the public.  They are an invaluable source of information, a safe harbor,  particularly for minority communities at a time when new consumers  continue to be bombarded with misinformation and disinformation.   Very often--speaking in one element of the Hispanic community--radio  is what the community turns to in the case of an emergency. During the  pandemic, it is where they turned to to get trusted information about  how to take care of themselves and their families. In storms,  tornadoes, and hurricanes, they are the preferred entity.   So all of us in this Chamber have a duty to be responsible stewards  of the public airwaves, and we do this by ensuring that the ownership  of stations reflects the audiences they reach. When minority  communities turn on the radio and the television, the programming  should be about events in their community, very possibly in a language  they understand, speaking about a culture they know, and addressing  issues they care about the most. We can only achieve this by having  broadcast station leaders with similar life experiences to their  listeners and viewers alike.   Make no mistake, if we hope to raise the appalling numbers of  minority-owned broadcast stations in America, it starts with seizing  every opportunity in front of us to increase their ranks.   It is long past time that the regulators at the Federal  Communications Commission prioritize diversity in broadcast ownership.   Right now, the FCC has before it the case of Soo Kim, a Korean- American entrepreneur who has applied to acquire TEGNA Broadcasting.  Should the deal go through, it would make TEGNA the largest minority- owned broadcast station group in the country. However, for more than a  year, this deal has been in limbo.   I am not here to speak about all the details of this deal or the pros  and cons of its merits, but basic fairness dictates that the FCC should  make a decision one way or another and not just veto it through, in  essence, inaction. That is not the American way. A vote is a fair shot  and a way to see how the Commission will react to diversity issues when  they become available.  [[Page S1336]]    Diversity, for me, means the fullness of diversity. It means African  Americans. It means Hispanic Americans. It means women. It means LGBTQ  Americans. And, yes, it means Asian Americans.   We need the FCC Commissioners to commit to increasing diversity in  media ownership not just in words but with actions. I, for one, will  not support nominees for the FCC if they are unwilling to support  diversity, including by acting in a way that denies a vote to a diverse  applicant. They cannot argue that broadcast station owners should  reflect their audiences, publicly saying--this is the FCC--``We need to  do better.'' Well, that is great. Then you miss the opportunities to  expand diversity in broadcasting when it is before you.   In the past, I have tried to address this issue head on through  legislation. I will continue to follow that route as well.   Last Congress, alongside Senator Peters, I introduced a bill, the  Broadcast VOICES Act, that would help address the lack of diversity in  the industry through innovations in our Tax Code. Through a Federal tax  incentive, our bill would ensure that women- and minority-owned  stations can compete on a level playing field to provide a benefit to  audiences.   It would reestablish a program in order to reincentivize broadcast  ownership. I say ``reincentivize'' because Congress has actually done  this before. During the nearly two decades that this tax incentive as  outlined in the Broadcast VOICES Act was active, minority ownership and  diversity in the broadcast media industry grew fivefold. It grew  fivefold. So think about where it was when I referred to the earlier  percentages and where we are today. This tax provision helped increase  it from virtually nothing to fivefold. That is right--the number of  minority owners quintupled when the incentive was in place.   So make no mistake, the task in front of us is clear. Government  regulators at the FCC have identified that there is a diversity problem  in broadcast ownership. As I have said, there are steps this body can  take to address it through the Broadcast VOICES Act, but the FCC has  its share of the burden as well. It must more than talk the talk; it  must walk the walk on the issue of diversity in media ownership.   I pushed for diverse candidates at every Agency. I will continue to  do so. I am hopeful that the administration seizes the opportunity  before them to nominate a diverse candidate to the Federal  Communications Commission because part of taking proactive steps on  industry diversity is ensuring that the regulator itself is more  diverse.   My first question to any FCC nominee I meet will be ``What actions  will you take, if confirmed, to expand diversity in broadcast  ownership?'' If they are a present FCC Commissioner seeking to be  reestablished at the Commission, voted on again to return to the  Commission: ``What actions have you taken to expand diversity in  broadcast ownership?''   Only if we as Members press this issue will things change. It is time  to afford our communities the representation in media they deserve, not  just representation that others think they deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
