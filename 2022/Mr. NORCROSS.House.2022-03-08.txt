 Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk about a company you  might have heard about: Starbucks. They made the $8 cup of coffee a  little popular.   The workers there through the pandemic are now struggling to form a  union. Well, Kevin Johnson, the CEO, got a 39 percent raise. Not bad.  The workers took a cut.   Those profits didn't magically appear. Starbucks didn't pour their  own coffee. It was the men and women who went out during the pandemic  and went to work. Yet, Kevin Johnson gets a $20 million bonus.   If Kevin is listening, he should do the right thing.   We hear the ethical sourcing that Starbucks talks about helping  people thrive. Well, he needs to do it right here in America and treat  his employees right.   Mr. Speaker, Kevin should do the right thing and take care of his  employees.                            ____________________
