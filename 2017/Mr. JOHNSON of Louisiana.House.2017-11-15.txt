Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Louisiana?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot in this  debate today. One thing is abundantly clear. Virtually every  hardworking citizen in this country recognizes our genuine need for tax  reform.   Let me summarize some of the facts that have been presented today.   The burdensome 70,000-page U.S. Tax Code has grown to be unreasonably  complex, increasingly unfair, and filled with special interest  loopholes. American companies are taxed at the highest rate in the  industrialized world, and the government takes even more from our  small-business owners and our entrepreneurs. As a result, our economic  growth is stagnant, companies have gradually shifted their  manufacturing and operations overseas, and families are struggling just  to keep up.   Today, the hurdles in our system seem almost insurmountable for  hardworking people as they are afforded fewer and fewer opportunities  for economic mobility.   For previous generations, it was a different deal. We had the  American Dream. The American Dream was defined by a simple promise: if  you were willing to work hard and sacrifice and play by the rules, you  could make a better life for yourself and your family. But today, our  outdated Tax Code has pushed that dream beyond the grasp of more and  more people.   The good news is we can fix this problem, and we are going to do that  in this Chamber tomorrow. For the first time in over 30 years, Congress  has a historic opportunity to pass landmark tax reform that will be a  turboboost to this economy, and it is going to lead us to a fairer  system, as we said so many times, with more jobs and bigger paychecks  for everyone.   Our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1, will deliver significant tax  reductions for low- and middle-income earners, and it will help  Americans in every level of our economy. The bill, which draws from 6  years of intensive work and expert analysis from more than 40 different  congressional hearings, lowers individual income taxes by consolidating  the existing seven brackets into four and doubling the standard  deduction for everyone.   It also establishes a new family tax credit. It provides higher  education benefits. It repeals the death tax. It preserves deductions  for mortgage interest and charitable donations and property taxes, and  it incentivizes saving for retirement.   Tax returns will become incredibly simple for the first time in my  lifetime because 9 out of 10 Americans will be able to complete their  annual filing on a form the size of a postcard.   The bill's business tax reforms are equally seismic because we are  going to slash our draconian corporate tax from 35 percent, the highest  in the world, to 20 percent, and we are going to institute the lowest  rates for small business job creators since World War II. U.S.  companies will finally be allowed to compete again on a level playing  field and bring their jobs and operations back home from overseas.   The independent Tax Foundation estimated that our plan will result in  the creation of approximately 975,000 full-time American jobs and an  increase in family incomes of 4.4 percent, on average. In Louisiana,  for example, that would mean 13,293 new jobs and $1,857 of additional  after-tax income for our average middle class families.   The American people have long deserved a simpler, fairer, and  effective system that rewards hard work and allows taxpayers to keep  and invest more of what they earn. Our plan will finally provide that  relief and spark the dramatic economic growth our Nation has so  desperately needed.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is about more than just smart legislation.  It is about a revival of that American Dream I referenced. That has one  agenda that should unite every single one of us, and we hope all of our  colleagues will support this historic landmark piece of legislation  tomorrow.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Budd), a great American small-business owner himself.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas, who is always eloquent.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Madam Speaker, there is a trend here  tonight. Those who are addressing the House this evening have had their  own experience with this burdensome Tax Code. They have been small- business owners, entrepreneurs, job creators, and farmers, like my  friend from Kentucky. I appreciate their zeal for this issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett),  a former prosecutor, an Army veteran, and always a good voice to  reason.    Mr. Speaker, we have heard some compelling  arguments here on the floor in the last few hours and some important  facts have been shared.   I appreciate so much the eloquent words of my colleagues from Texas  and Kentucky and Virginia and Pennsylvania and Florida and all over  this great land of ours who have shared with us the importance of this  landmark bill and this historic vote that we will take in this Chamber  tomorrow.   I just thought there were a few more facts that were important to  summarize here at the end of our debate this evening.   I wanted to quote the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because they looked at  this bill and they gave an exhaustive review of this, as so many have.  This is their summary: ``The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a growth bill,  achieving faster economic growth, encouraging job creation, and getting  more money in Americans' pockets each year.''   I think that is a pretty good summary of what the bill will do and  what it will accomplish.   We brought just a couple of graphics here to illustrate the national  impact of this landmark reform. When we pass this bill and we get this  to the President's desk, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will lead to the  creation of an additional 975,000 new full-time jobs across this  country.   It will raise after-tax income for middle class families by $2,598  each. That is an increase of 4.4 percent. That is real money to  families who are struggling to make ends meet around this country.   It will generate economic growth sufficient to increase Federal tax  receipts by $1 trillion. That is real money. That is a real boost to  the American economy.   I brought another graphic here to show what this will mean in my  district, by way of example, in Louisiana. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  will mean a whole lot for my State.   It will lead to the creation of an additional 13,293 jobs in my State  of Louisiana alone. Those are good-paying, full-time jobs. It will  raise after-tax income for middle class families in Louisiana by  $1,857. That is real money. That will mean a lot to the families in my  State.   More specifically, let me talk about the Fourth Congressional  District in northwest and west Louisiana, 15 parishes, about one-third  of our State by land area; good, hardworking, God-fearing Americans.  Let me tell you what it will mean to the people of Louisiana's Fourth  Congressional District.   Here are just four highlights. It will be a larger child tax credit.  In my district, there are 53,918 taxpayers who claim the child tax  credit every year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the child  tax credit from $1,000 per child to $1,600 per child for each of those  families.   Let me give you another one: the tax relief for small businesses.  This is a big thing in my district. 49,929 taxpayers in the Fourth  Congressional District of Louisiana have small business income, and  that is a business that a taxpayer operates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  reduces taxes for small-business owners.   First, the bill implements a new, lower 9 percent tax rate on the  first $75,000 of net business income for active small-business owners  earning less than $150,000 through their businesses. That is a whole  lot of people, a whole lot of LLCs and small companies in my district.   Second, the bill lowers taxes on small business investment by  creating a new 25 percent small business tax rate. That is capped at 25  percent. That is a big deal to people who are struggling to make ends  meet.   Number three, a third feature, the elimination of the alternative  minimum tax, the AMT. 4,049 taxpayers in the Fourth Congressional  District of Louisiana are impacted directly by the AMT. The Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act eliminates that factor.   Another one is simpler taxes. Listen to this number: 67,543 taxpayers  in the Fourth Congressional District, in my district back home in  Louisiana, itemize their taxes.   As a result of the near doubling of the standard deduction and other  simplifications, many taxpayers will have much simpler returns. It is  estimated, as we have said so many times tonight, that nine out of ten  Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form the size of a  postcard. That is a big change and a great simplification for the  people of my district. We owe this to them.   I wanted to share a few other facts that I think are important to  highlight tonight, Mr. Speaker.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is more than just a win for our American  economy. It is a win for our American values. Let me give you a couple  examples of that.   First, it is a win for free speech. The bill incorporates the  language of our Free Speech and Fairness Act, which we filed as a  standalone piece of legislation earlier this year in February. That  will stop the IRS from policing the speech of churches and charitable  organizations. That is a huge relief for men and women of faith, in  particular, who watched the IRS breathe down the necks of nonprofits  and religious entities, threatening to take away their tax-exempt  status if they dare talk  [[Page H9365]]  about the moral and social and political issues of the day. That is a  big win for free speech and a big win for them.    This bill is also a big win for American families. Let me give you a  few examples of important features of how this helps the family in this  country. The adoption tax credit has been restored. This is section  1102 of the bill. Now, this is a critically important thing to advance  the policy, to advance and encourage and incentivize adoption in this  country. This is something that all of us should agree on.   Over 60 percent of adopted children are adopted by middle- and low- income taxpayers in this country. Almost half of the children adopted  from foster care live in families with household incomes at or below  200 percent of the Federal poverty level.   Listen to this statistic: a study reported by the Federal Children's  Bureau showed that the government saves between $65,000 and $127,000  for each child who is adopted rather than placed in long-term foster  care.   Studies comparing children who remain in foster care to children who  are adopted show that adopted children are 54 percent less likely to be  delinquent or arrested, 19 percent less likely to become teen parents,  and 76 percent more likely to be employed.   Can we all agree that the adoption tax credit being restored is an  important part of this bill?   I think we can.   Here is another way it helps families, Mr. Speaker: the family tax  credits. This is something that everybody back home should pay  attention to. The child tax credit, section 1202 of the bill, this  increases the child tax credit, as I mentioned a moment ago, from  $1,000 per child to $1,600 per child. It provides a credit of $300 for  each parent and nonchild dependent to help all families with their  everyday expenses.   The child dependent care tax credit helps families care for their  children and other dependents, such as a disabled grandparent who may  need additional support.   Here is another feature: unborn children are recognized in the 529  education savings account provisions of the Tax Code. Our tax reform  bill allows a 529 education savings account to be opened, for the first  time, for an unborn child or a child in utero. We recognize the  humanity and the sanctity of life of the unborn child.   Here is another feature: the marriage penalties are finally removed.  For too long, we have effectively penalized married couples in this  country simply for being married. Our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changes  that. In most cases, married couples will no longer be penalized just  for their choice to be married.   Mr. Speaker, I will close with just a few more remarks. A lot has  been said here tonight, more will be said in the morning preceding our  vote, but this is a big day for Congress and a big day for the country.   It has been over 30 years since we last updated our tax system. For  reference, I was in the eighth grade the last time tax reform was  accomplished in this Chamber. Many of those entering the workforce  weren't even born yet the last time Congress fulfilled this  responsibility.   Today, Americans are struggling to make ends meet, to find decent- paying jobs, and to prepare for retirement.   We must do right by our children and our grandchildren and give them  a better future than our own. Fortunately, my Republican colleagues and  I have put forth a framework to do just that.   We have discussed for the last few hours in this Chamber as we have  been talking that our plan will create more jobs, fairer taxes, and  bigger paychecks for working class Americans and small businesses.   When businessowners are able to keep more of their profits, they will  invest that money in their companies and in their employees, and that  will spur economic growth, because they will expand their facilities,  they will create and expand new product lines, they will add more jobs,  and that is good for all of us.   Passing meaningful tax reform isn't about sticker shock talking  points that we have heard so much about. It is about real everyday  Americans who want to grow their businesses, offer better wages to  their employees, provide for their families, but who have struggled to  do so because of our oppressive and outdated tax policy.   Our plan puts Americans first and it offers real relief to those who  need it most.   The Federal Tax Code today is more than 70,000 pages long. For  context, that is more than 60 times longer than the King James Bible,  and it contains none of the Good News.   It is time to simplify this Code and it is time to unleash the free  market in our American economy again. We have that chance. This will be  the biggest Christmas gift to the American people in over 3 decades. It  is truly historic and it is long overdue.   Mr. Speaker, we urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on this floor tomorrow. Let's make  history together. Let's do right by the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
