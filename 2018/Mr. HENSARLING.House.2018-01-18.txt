 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 693, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2954) to amend the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of  1975 to specify which depository institutions are subject to the  maintenance of records and disclosure requirements of such Act, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 693, the  amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on  Financial Services, printed in the bill, modified by the amendment  printed in part B of House Report 115-518, is adopted, and the bill, as  amended, is considered read.

The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of  the Committee on Financial Services.      The online version has been corrected to read: The SPEAKER pro  tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Financial Services.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today in support of H.R. 2954,  the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act.   H.R. 2954, which was introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Emmer), a very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee,  is a very important piece of legislation  [[Page H514]]  that will provide much-needed regulatory relief for our community banks  and credit unions from onerous CFPB regulations that are impeding their  ability to make home loans to our constituents.   On January 1 of this year, draconian changes went into effect related  to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act known as HMDA. These changes, which  were mandated by Dodd-Frank and blindly implemented by the CFPB,  radically expanded the information that lenders are required to  collect, record, and report about mortgage applications and loans. But  like many things the CFPB is involved in, the rule went far, far beyond  what was originally intended by Congress, and effects have far-reaching  and negative consequences on community financial institutions and home  buyers.   To be more specific, the CFPB's updated HMDA rule now requires  financial institutions to collect 48--48--unique, different data fields  on each mortgage loan they make. This is more than double--double--the  number, Mr. Speaker, of data fields lenders were required to collect  before the rule went into effect.   Now, as if adding 25--two dozen--more data fields weren't enough, the  CFPB rule also modified 20 of the 23 existing fields in this constant,  constant changing of the regulatory scheme to fit the narrative of  regulators rather than focus on the cost and benefits to our  constituents of existing statutes.                                time  1530    Mr. Speaker, again, the constant changing of this regulatory scheme,  the increased complexity and cost, we do not fully appreciate the  impact on our community financial institutions, and we do not fully  appreciate how this is impeding the success and growth of our community  financial institutions in the communities we represent.   You don't have to take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. A community  banker in Kansas has said that: ``As crazy as it seems, our current  HMDA process includes four people verifying HMDA data on each loan.''   Mr. Speaker, that was before the changes we are discussing today.   According to that same community banker, who is trying to fund homes  in his local community, doubling the number of data fields, as required  in the CFPB's HMDA rule, ``will almost be overwhelming for a bank such  as ours.''   As a community banker from Nebraska has stated: ``All the new  mortgage lending rules have made it almost impossible to provide timely  service to our local customers.''   So home buyers are feeling this effect, Mr. Speaker. As one community  banker from Ohio explained, he was working with a woman who recently  went through the tragedy of divorce. She was trying to refinance her  home in order to make ends meet. But after filing mountains and  mountains of paperwork and wading through all the different forms, she  looked up at the banker and said: ``Jim, just tell me it will be  okay.''   As Jim put it: ``At that point, I realized just how overwhelming all  the forms and disclosures were to a customer.''   Sadly, we all have--the lawmakers, the regulators, and the bankers-- forgotten the most important item in this entire process: the customer.   This community banker is right, Mr. Speaker. Our local financial  institutions, our community banks, our smallest financial institutions  especially, they have to spend less time in resources meeting  Washington's complex, burdensome, onerous paperwork requirements.  Instead, we need to give them more freedom to do what they do best, and  that is to help people in their communities get into homes they can  actually afford to keep.   But doubling--doubling--HMDA data requirements needlessly-- needlessly--makes home buying more expensive, more confusing, and more  difficult for the very people that we should be trying to help.   Home buyers like April from Kentucky wrote that the process to get a  home: ``Is almost impossible and extremely frustrating.''   Or a home buyer from Michigan by the name of Rob, who explained:  ``The very people this was supposed to be helpful to, lower income  working Americans, have been the parties most devastated by the  overreach.''   And that is exactly what this is, Mr. Speaker, overreach. And it is  not only these individuals, but even charities--great charities like  Habitat for Humanity, who said: ``Thanks to the CFPB's burdensome  regulations and rules, charities such as Habitat that provide these  loans have found it more difficult to do their important work.''   H.R. 2954, from the gentleman from Minnesota, simply addresses the  fact that in order to make home loans, small financial institutions  should not and cannot afford to keep pace with the massive laws that  disregard their businesses, their business models, and create an uneven  playing field.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason and for the others I have stated, I urge  all colleagues to help struggling would-be home buyers in our districts  and to support H.R. 2954.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2954, the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, which would undermine efforts to  monitor trends in mortgage lending, combat discriminatory and predatory  lending, and ensure that consumers who reside in low- and moderate- income communities have fair access to mortgage credit.   In 1975, Congress enacted the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, also  known as HMDA, in response to concerns that despite their  responsibility to provide adequate home financing to qualified  applicants on reasonable terms and conditions, some lenders' failure to  do so had contributed to a decline in housing conditions in communities  of color.   HMDA data provide the only comprehensive picture of the rates at  which American consumers' requests for mortgages are approved and  denied. As a result, it has many important uses.   HMDA data provide information on mortgage lending patterns and trends  that allow regulators, lenders, researchers, and the public to better  understand and address redlining concerns by identifying possible  discriminatory lending patterns, and monitoring compliance with and  enforcement of statutes, like the Community Reinvestment Act; and  Federal antidiscrimination laws, like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act  and the Fair Housing Act.   Local governments also use HMDA data to determine which financial  institutions are meeting the needs of their communities and should  receive important benefits funded by the taxpayers of those  communities.   For example, in Antioch, California, the local government uses HMDA  data when selecting banks for contracts and participation in local  programs.   HMDA data are also used by government officials to determine areas of  disinvestment that are in need of targeted assistance. Take Flint,  Michigan, for example. There, HMDA data has been used to target funds  to remediate blight.   Communities also use HMDA data to identify discriminatory lending  patterns and enforce antidiscrimination statutes. HMDA data, for  example, were used in Chicago to identify discrimination and lending  patterns in its neighborhoods, leading to a large discriminatory  lending settlement.   It was precisely because of HMDA data that Congress learned during  the run-up to the financial crisis that African Americans were  routinely steered into predatory subprime loans, even when they  qualified for prime mortgages, and they received these loans at higher  rates than White borrowers.   Following the financial crisis, Congress updated HMDA when it passed  the Dodd-Frank Act, directing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  to close information gaps about mortgage lending patterns and practices  that contributed to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, as well as other  data that could better identify discrimination.   Accordingly, in 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  finalized a rule that required sufficient information to shed light on  predatory practices in the mortgage market, and it considered  compliance costs and burdens imposed on institutions that collect,  maintain, and report the data. Through this rule, the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau added and  [[Page H515]]  implemented additional data fields that must be reported in order to  further close information gaps about mortgage lending patterns and  practices.   The new data fields include basic loan facts, such as the address of  the property, interest rate of the mortgage, and the borrower's credit  score.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule only excluded truly  small lenders; banks that originate fewer than 25 closed-end loans,  like mortgages; and 100 open-end lines of credit, like home equity  lines, because providing broader relief would negatively affect low-  and moderate-income communities.   Specifically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wrote: ``The  loss of data in communities at closed-end mortgage loan volume  thresholds higher than 25 would substantially impede the public's and  public officials' ability to understand access to credit in their  communities.''   Despite the harm posed to low- and moderate-income communities around  the country, H.R. 2954 would permanently raise the threshold for new  HMDA data for both mortgage loan-type data and lines of credit to 500  without a good understanding about the real impact of doing so.   At this level, 85 percent or 5,400 depository institutions and 48  percent of nonbanks or 497 institutions would be exempt. That is 6,000  financial institutions that would no longer report important lending  data.   By prohibiting these important new data fields from being reported  under HMDA, regulators would not be able to fully determine the extent  of redlining, discrimination, and other harmful practices. This will  make it harder for fair lending violations to be detected, as HMDA data  are routinely used by the Department of Justice to identify and remedy  discrimination in lending.   These new data fields are essential for shedding light on the kinds  of discrimination, like age, that now flies under the radar. It is not  surprising that over 170 civil rights, fair housing, consumer and  community organizations across the country have come out strongly  against this bill. These groups have stated that: ``The updated HMDA  data will provide critical information about whether similarly situated  borrowers in underserved communities are receiving equitable access to  mortgage credit, data that we lacked a decade ago when the crisis  hit.''   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the need for Congress to consider tailored  and sensible regulatory relief to community financial institutions, but  this bill is not that relief.   Financial institutions are already required to collect this data as  part of existing mortgage regulations or as part of the mortgage  underwriting process.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support H.R. 2954 because it undermines  effective fair lending enforcement by reducing HMDA data. This bill  will contribute to unequal access to affordable credit for people of  color, low- to moderate-income families, and borrowers in rural areas.   History has repeatedly shown us that when financial institutions are  merely trusted to operate in good faith, American consumers are left  vulnerable to discriminatory and predatory lending, communities are  stripped of wealth, and our economy is weakened.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this  rollback of a key fair lending tool and to join me in opposing H.R.  2954.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a very valuable member of our committee and the  sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of our  Financial Services' Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I am now very pleased to yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), a member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the vice chairman of our  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that it  was a most interesting and passionate speech that my colleague gave.   I have some good news for him. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to  the Constitution are not repealed by this bill, and neither is HMDA.  HMDA is not repealed. Even the new CFPB regulations that double the  data of HMDA are not repeal.   I would urge the gentleman from Minnesota to actually read the bill,  which happens to be four pages long, and he would find out that a  current--a current--exemption that exists under current law for our  smallest financial institutions that are trying to make loans to the  very people he claims he wants to protect, that is slightly enlarged.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill), who is the majority whip of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), who is another hardworking member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), who is another hardworking member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Georgia an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Georgia an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Diaz-Balart). The gentleman from Texas  has 6 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is fascinating listening to my friends on the other  side of the aisle. It is fascinating because they tell us they want to  protect the single mothers. They tell us they want to protect the  people of color. They tell us they want to help and protect the poor,  but they are protecting them out of their home ownership opportunities.   Because of the increased HMDA compliance on our smallest community  financial institutions, they are ceasing to make these loans. But they  will sleep well tonight in their apartments and in their rental homes,  knowing that my good friends on the other side of the aisle protect  them out of their ability to finally realize their portion of the  American Dream and have that shot at home ownership.   Mr. Speaker, how many people have to lose their home ownership  opportunities due to the onslaught of the onerous Federal regulations?   What is fascinating about this debate is that what they would  discover is that HMDA is still the law of the land. Again, I would  encourage my friends to actually read the bill. I think it is 3 pages  long; maybe 3\1/2\ pages long.    HMDA doesn't go away if we enact H.R. 2954. But what it says is that  for our smallest financial institutions, the HMDA requirements, the  doubling of HMDA requirements, the increased burden, will not be placed  on our smallest financial institutions, as we are losing one every  single day. As we lose them, we lose that credit opportunity for the  least of these that my friends, I know in their heart, want to help,  but they are not helping them.   Listen to those who are actually trying to make these loans. By the  way, I don't know of a successful business model for any bank that  says: You know what? I am going to make more money if I don't lend it  to you. If I refuse to make loans, if I refuse to serve my community,  if I practice active racism, that will be good for my bottom line.   I am not seeing it in the Fifth District of Texas, and I highly  suspect that it is difficult to find in the United States of America in  the 21st century.   So I hear from the community banker in Nebraska, who says:         Go to any community bank reporting HMDA and have them sit       down and watch bank staff review a loan file. Then document       the data showing how difficult it is to prevent errors.    This bank got out of the business of loaning. They said:         We don't need the ulcers created by such stress from the       fear of the regulators.    I heard from a community bank in Oklahoma that said:         Because of Dodd-Frank, we no longer offer-purchase house       loans. We are servicing only the ones we have on the books.    Thank you Dodd-Frank and HMDA. May I have another.   I heard from a community bank in Nevada that said:         The mortgage regulations intended to help the consumer have       been particularly harmful. My bank is a very small community       bank servicing communities in rural Nevada. We used to do       quite a bit of residential mortgage lending, but hardly any       now, due to the restrictive regulations.                                time  1630    So, again, I would just ask that my friends on the other side of the  aisle open up both their hearts and their heads and see how many people  are being hurt by the cumulative impact of this regulatory tsunami  hitting those who loan the money to the least of these to make sure  that they can achieve their version of the American Dream.   And where was all the angst, Mr. Speaker? Where was all the angst? My  friends on the other side of the aisle talk about statistics. Well,  here is a statistic that comes from the Federal Reserve: When the  qualified mortgage rule of the CFPB is fully implemented, 30 percent  fewer Blacks and Hispanics, people of color, will be able to get  mortgages versus 2010. There is a statistic.   And I would say, Mr. Speaker, perhaps that is even a more valuable  statistic when it comes to looking at the increased HMDA burden placed  by the CFPB on our community financial institutions. Maybe that is a  more important statistic than even the 20-some-odd new fields of HMDA  data that CFPB is requiring on the smallest banks and credit unions in  America.   My friends on the other side of the aisle say: Oh, we care about the  plight of these community banks. Well, why are we still losing one a  day, and why do you tell us that you care about their plight and their  ability to loan money but you don't vote with us?   Fortunately, some Members on the other side of the aisle in the other  body over my shoulder, Mr. Speaker--there is actually a bipartisan bill  in the Senate that does exactly what H.R. 2954 does. I am very happy to  say that it was a bipartisan bill coming out of the Financial Services  Committee, also enjoying some Democratic support.   But, again, I just don't think my friends who are debating now have  read the bill. I encourage them to read the bill, and every Member  ought to support H.R. 2954 and support the opportunity to buy a home in  the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 693, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend and colleague  from Minnesota restating, in his motion to recommit, what is  essentially already current law; but, unfortunately, he adds on yet one  more form for community financial institutions to fill out on top of  the 18.7 gazillion forms they already have to fill out, the cost of  which ultimately is imposed upon those who are trying to find credit  and find affordable credit.   And I would remind the gentleman from Minnesota again, every single  financial institution impacted by H.R. 2954 still must submit HMDA  data. They are still subject to HMDA. For the third time, they are  still subject to HMDA. And I am sure that all will be glad to hear  Federal regulators still have statutory authority to take any formal  enforcement actions against entities for violations of the laws or  rules.   But why, when we are trying to make it easier for the least of these  to buy a home, are we trying to, instead, my friends on the other side  of the aisle, make it more difficult by adding yet more forms, forms  that also say: Do you know what? Even though this is America, you are  guilty until proven innocent.   That is a whole different argument, and I wish we had time to develop  it here today, Mr. Speaker.   But here is what we need to do. We need to make sure that struggling,  hardworking Americans have homeownership opportunities, and the  regulatory burden that came out of the previous administration is  making it more difficult. So, now, to think that we would double the  HMDA requirement data--double--for our smallest financial institutions  that are fighting for survival, that are trying to help our  constituents buy homes is unthinkable; to add yet one more Federal law,  one more Federal form on top of all the others that we have, is just  unfathomable. It is unthinkable. It will only harm those whom we are  trying to help, and I would urge all Members to reject the motion to  recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
