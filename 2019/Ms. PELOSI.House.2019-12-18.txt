 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his tremendous leadership in helping us honor the Constitution of the  United States.   I also extend my gratitude to Chairman Schiff, who will be presiding  later in the day.   Madam Speaker, this morning and every morning when we come together,  Members rise and pledge allegiance to the flag. Every day, all across  America, children in school, members of the military, officials, and  those civilly engaged, also pledge allegiance to the flag.   Let us recall what that pledge says: ``I pledge allegiance to the  flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it  stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for  all.''   ``The Republic for which it stands'' is what we are here to talk  about today: ``a republic, if we can keep it.''   We gather today, under the dome of this temple of democracy, to  exercise one of the most solemn powers that this body can take: the  impeachment of the President of the United States.   No Member, regardless of party or politics, comes to Congress to  impeach a President; but every one of us, as our first act as a Member  of Congress, stood on this historic House floor, before our beautiful  American flag, and raised our hands in this sacred oath: ``I do  solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the  United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. . . . So help  me God.''   For 230 years, Members have taken that sacred oath, which makes us  custodians of the Constitution.   When our Founders declared independence and established our new  Nation, they crafted a system of government unlike any ever seen  before: a republic, starting with the sacred words, ``We the People.''   For centuries, Americans have fought--and died--to defend democracy  for the people. But, very sadly, now, our Founders' vision of a  republic is under threat from actions from the White House. That is  why, today, as Speaker of the House, I solemnly and sadly open the  debate on the impeachment of the President of the United States.   If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic  that the President's reckless actions make impeachment necessary.   He gave us no choice.   What we are discussing today is the established fact that the  President violated the Constitution.  [[Page H12132]]    It is a matter of fact that the President is an ongoing threat to our  national security and the integrity of our elections: the basis of our  democracy.   Hundreds of historians, legal scholars, and former prosecutors-- regardless of party--have stated that the President committed  impeachable offenses.   Since today is a national civics lesson, though a sad one, I submit  these documents for the Record and commend them for students to study.        450+ Former Federal Prosecutors Statement on Mueller Report       May 6        We are former federal prosecutors. We served under both       Republican and Democratic administrations at different levels       of the federal system: as line attorneys, supervisors,       special prosecutors, United States Attorneys, and senior       officials at the Department of Justice. The offices in which       we served were small, medium, and large; urban, suburban, and       rural; and located in all parts of our country.        Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump       described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report would,       in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of       Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President,       result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.        The Mueller report describes several acts that satisfy all       of the elements for an obstruction charge: conduct that       obstructed or attempted to obstruct the truthfinding process,       as to which the evidence of corrupt intent and connection to       pending proceedings is overwhelming. These include:        The President's efforts to fire Mueller and to falsify       evidence about that effort;        The President's efforts to limit the scope of Mueller's       investigation to exclude his conduct; and        The President's efforts to prevent witnesses from       cooperating with investigators probing him and his campaign.           Attempts to fire Mueller and then create false evidence         Despite being advised by then-White House Counsel Don       McGahn that he could face legal jeopardy for doing so, Trump       directed McGahn on multiple occasions to fire Mueller or to       gin up false conflicts of interest as a pretext for getting       rid of the Special Counsel. When these acts began to come       into public view, Trump made ``repeated efforts to have       McGahn deny the story''--going so far as to tell McGahn to       write a letter ``for our files'' falsely denying that Trump       had directed Mueller's termination.        Firing Mueller would have seriously impeded the       investigation of the President and his associates--      obstruction in its most literal sense. Directing the creation       of false government records in order to prevent or discredit       truthful testimony is similarly unlawful. The Special       Counsel's report states: ``Substantial evidence indicates       that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that he was       ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President       acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn's account in       order to deflect or prevent scrutiny of the President's       conduct toward the investigation.''                 Attempts to limit the Mueller investigation         The report describes multiple efforts by the president to       curtail the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation.        First, the President repeatedly pressured then-Attorney       General Jeff Sessions to reverse his legally-mandated       decision to recuse himself from the investigation. The       President's stated reason was that he wanted an attorney       general who would ``protect'' him, including from the Special       Counsel investigation. He also directed then-White House       Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to fire Sessions and Priebus       refused.        Second, after McGahn told the President that he could not       contact Sessions himself to discuss the investigation, Trump       went outside the White House, instructing his former campaign       manager, Corey Lewandowski, to carry a demand to Sessions to       direct Mueller to confine his investigation to future       elections. Lewandowski tried and failed to contact Sessions       in private. After a second meeting with Trump, Lewandowski       passed Trump's message to senior White House official Rick       Dearborn, who Lewandowski thought would be a better messenger       because of his prior relationship with Sessions. Dearborn did       not pass along Trump's message. As the report explains,       ``[s]ubstantial evidence indicates that the President's       effort to have Sessions limit the scope of the Special       Counsel's investigation to future election interference was       intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the       President's and his campaign's conduct''--in other words, the       President employed a private citizen to try to get the       Attorney General to limit the scope of an ongoing       investigation into the President and his associates.        All of this conduct--trying to control and impede the       investigation against the President by leveraging his       authority over others--is similar to conduct we have seen       charged against other public officials and people in powerful       positions.                      Witness tampering and intimidation         The Special Counsel's report establishes that the President       tried to influence the decisions of both Michael Cohen and       Paul Manafort with regard to cooperating with investigators.       Some of this tampering and intimidation, including the       dangling of pardons, was done in plain sight via tweets and       public statements; other such behavior was done via private       messages through private attorneys, such as Trump counsel       Rudy Giuliani's message to Cohen's lawyer that Cohen should       ``[s]leep well tonight[], you have friends in high places.''        Of course, these aren't the only acts of potential       obstruction detailed by the Special Counsel. It would be well       within the purview of normal prosecutorial judgment also to       charge other acts detailed in the report.        We emphasize that these are not matters of close       professional judgment. Of course, there are potential       defenses or arguments that could be raised in response to an       indictment of the nature we describe here. In our system,       every accused person is presumed innocent and it is always       the government's burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable       doubt. But, to look at these facts and say that a prosecutor       could not probably sustain a conviction for obstruction of       justice--the standard set out in Principles of Federal       Prosecution--runs counter to logic and our experience.        As former federal prosecutors, we recognize that       prosecuting obstruction of justice cases is critical because       unchecked obstruction--which allows intentional interference       with criminal investigations to go unpunished--puts our whole       system of justice at risk. We believe strongly that, but for       the OLC memo, the overwhelming weight of professional       judgment would come down in favor of prosecution for the       conduct outlined in the Mueller Report.

We do not reach this conclusion lightly. The Founders did       not make impeachment available for disagreements over policy,       even profound ones, nor for extreme distaste for the manner       in which the President executes his office. Only ``Treason,       Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' warrant       impeachment. But there is overwhelming evidence that       President Trump betrayed his oath of office by seeking to use       presidential power to pressure a foreign government to help       him distort an American election, for his personal and       political benefit, at the direct expense of national security       interests as determined by Congress. His conduct is precisely       the type of threat to our democracy that the Founders feared       when they included the remedy of impeachment in the       Constitution.        We take no position on whether the President committed a       crime. But conduct need not be criminal to be impeachable.       The standard here is constitutional; it does not depend on       what Congress has chosen to criminalize.        Impeachment is a remedy for grave abuses of the public       trust. The two specific bases for impeachment named in the       Constitution--treason and bribery--involve such abuses       because they include conduct undertaken not in the ``faithful       execution'' of public office that the Constitution requires,       but instead for personal gain (bribery) or to benefit a       foreign enemy (treason).        Impeachment is an especially essential remedy for conduct       that corrupts elections. The primary check on presidents is       political: if a president behaves poorly, voters can punish       him or his party at the polls. A president who corrupts the       system of elections seeks to place himself beyond the reach       of this political check. At the Constitutional Convention,       George Mason described impeachable offenses as ``attempts to       subvert the constitution.'' Corrupting elections subverts the       process by which the Constitution makes the president       democratically accountable. Put simply, if a President cheats       in his effort at re-election, trusting the democratic process       to serve as a check through that election is no remedy at       all. That is what impeachment is for.        Moreover, the Founders were keenly concerned with the       possibility of corruption in the president's relationships       with foreign governments. That is why they prohibited the       president from accepting anything of value from foreign       governments without Congress's consent. The same concern       drove their thinking on impeachment. James Madison noted that       Congress must be able to remove the president between       elections lest there be no remedy if a president betrayed the       public trust in dealings with foreign powers.        In light of these considerations, overwhelming evidence       made public to date forces us to conclude that President       Trump engaged in impeachable conduct. To mention only a few       of those facts: William B. Taylor, who leads the U.S. embassy       in Ukraine, testified that President Trump directed the       withholding of hundreds of millions of dollars in military       aid for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia--aid that       Congress determined to be in the U.S. national security       interest--until Ukraine announced investigations that would       aid the President's re-election campaign. Ambassador Gordon  [[Page H12133]]       Sondland testified that the President made a White House       visit for the Ukrainian president conditional on public       announcement of those investigations. In a phone call with       the Ukrainian president, President Trump asked for a       ``favor'' in the form of a foreign government investigation       of a U.S. citizen who is his political rival. President Trump       and his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney made public statements       confirming this use of governmental power to solicit       investigations that would aid the President's personal       political interests. The President made clear that his       private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was central to efforts to       spur Ukrainian investigations, and Mr. Giuliani confirmed       that his efforts were in service of President Trump's private       interests.        Ultimately, whether to impeach the President and remove him       from office depends on judgments that the Constitution leaves       to Congress. But if the House of Representatives impeached       the President for the conduct described here and the Senate       voted to remove him, they would be acting well within their       constitutional powers. Whether President Trump's conduct is       classified as bribery, as a high crime or misdemeanor, or as       both, it is clearly impeachable under our Constitution.                                   ____       700+ Historians' Statement on the Impeachment of President Trump       Dec. 16        We are American historians devoted to studying our nation's       past who have concluded that Donald J. Trump has violated his       oath to ``faithfully execute the Office of President of the       United States'' and to ``preserve, protect and defend the       Constitution of the United States.'' His ``attempts to       subvert the Constitution,'' as George Mason described       impeachable offenses at the Constitutional Convention in       1787, urgently and justly require his impeachment.        President Trump's numerous and flagrant abuses of power are       precisely what the Framers had in mind as grounds for       impeaching and removing a president. Among those most hurtful       to the Constitution have been his attempts to coerce the       country of Ukraine, under attack from Russia, an adversary       power to the United States, by withholding essential military       assistance in exchange for the fabrication and legitimization       of false information in order to advance his own re-election.        President Trump's lawless obstruction of the House of       Representatives, which is rightly seeking documents and       witness testimony in pursuit of its constitutionally-mandated       oversight role, has demonstrated brazen contempt for       representative government. So have his attempts to justify       that obstruction on the grounds that the executive enjoys       absolute immunity, a fictitious doctrine that, if tolerated,       would turn the president into an elected monarch above the       law.        As Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist, impeachment       was designed to deal with ``the misconduct of public men''       which involves ``the abuse or violation of some public       trust.'' Collectively, the President's offenses, including       his dereliction in protecting the integrity of the 2020       election from Russian disinformation and renewed       interference, arouse once again the Framers' most profound       fears that powerful members of government would become, in       Hamilton's words, ``the mercenary instruments of foreign       corruption.''        It is our considered judgment that if President Trump's       misconduct does not rise to the level of impeachment, then       virtually nothing does.        Hamilton understood, as he wrote in 1792, that the republic       remained vulnerable to the rise of an unscrupulous demagogue,       ``unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune,       bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents . . .       despotic in his ordinary demeanour.'' That demagogue,       Hamilton said, could easily enough manage ``to mount the       hobby horse of popularity--to join in the cry of danger to       liberty--to take every opportunity of embarrassing the       General Government & bringing it under suspicion--to flatter       and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the       day.'' Such a figure, Hamilton wrote, would ``throw things       into confusion that he may `ride the storm and direct the       whirlwind.' ''        President Trump's actions committed both before and during       the House investigations fit Hamilton's description and       manifest utter and deliberate scorn for the rule of law and       ``repeated injuries'' to constitutional democracy. That       disregard continues and it constitutes a clear and present       danger to the Constitution. We therefore strongly urge the       House of Representatives to impeach the President.     Madam Speaker, what we are discussing today is the  established fact that the President, again, violated the Constitution.   It is a matter of fact that the President is, again, an ongoing  threat to our national security. And the testimony of decorated war  heroes, distinguished diplomats, and patriotic, career public  servants--some the President's own appointees--over the past weeks have  told us this.   The President used the power of his public office to obtain an  improper personal, political benefit at the expense of America's  national security. When the President weakens a democratic ally that is  advancing American security interests by fighting an American  adversary, the President weakens America.   This abuse of power also jeopardizes the integrity of our elections.  All Americans agree that American voters should choose our President,  not some foreign government.   The Founders understood that it is profoundly corrosive for our  democracy for a President to invite interference in our elections.   As George Washington, our Nation's patriarch, under whose gaze we  stand today, warned: ``History and experience prove that foreign  influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government''-- George Washington.   Sadly, the American people have witnessed further wrongs of the  President, which necessitate the second Article of Impeachment:  obstruction of Congress.   When the President's wrongdoing was revealed, he launched an  unprecedented, indiscriminate, and categorical campaign of defiance and  obstruction. Never before in the history of our Nation have we seen a  President declare--and act as if--he is above the law.   The President even goes so far as to say and act on this absurdity  when he says: ``Article II says I can do whatever I want.''   No, it doesn't.   That recklessness is a profound violation of the Constitution and our  Republic, which endure because of our system of separation of powers:  three coequal branches, each a check and balance on the others--``a  republic,'' again, ``if we can keep it.''                                time  1215    The Founders' great fear of a rogue or corrupt President is the very  reason why they enshrined impeachment in the Constitution.   As one Founder, William Davie of North Carolina, warned, unless the  Constitution contained an impeachment provision, a President might  spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected.   Another Founder, George Mason, insisted that the President who  procured his appointment in the first instance through improper and  corrupt acts might repeat his guilt and return to power.   We in Congress, Article I, the legislative branch, must stand up and  make clear to the American people and to all people who this body still  stands by the principles enshrined in the Constitution and defended by  generations of Americans.   Last week, in observance of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the  Bulge, Members traveled to that hallowed ground to express our  gratitude to the heroes who sacrificed everything to secure victory of  freedom over tyranny, not just for America but for the world. The  veterans of that battle, who are in their nineties, told us how, after  the war was won, the Europeans whom they liberated would ask: Why did  you risk--you don't know us--and give your lives to save us? We are not  Americans.   Our men would say: We came here to fight for you not because you are  Americans but because we are Americans.   As our beloved Elijah Cummings, our Oversight Committee chair, our  North Star, said when he announced his support of this action: ``When  the history books are written about this tumultuous era, I want them to  show that I was among those in the House of Representatives who stood  up to lawlessness and tyranny.''   He also said, almost prophetically:         When we are dancing with the angels, the question will be:       What did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?    Elijah has since passed on. Now, he is dancing with the angels.   I know that he and all of us here are very proud of the moral courage  of Members who want to honor the vision of our Founders for a republic,  the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform to defend it, and the  aspirations of our children to live freely within it.   Today, we are here to defend democracy for the people. May God bless  America.
