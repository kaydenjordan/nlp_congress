 I have heard, time and again, my Republican colleagues  and a number of Democrats voice their serious concern about the deficit  and our national debt. We are told that because of the deficit that at  a time when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any  major country on Earth, we cannot extend the child tax credit to help  working parents and substantially reduce childhood poverty.   At a time when over 600,000 Americans are homeless and some 18  million families are spending half of their incomes on the high cost of  housing, we are told over and over again that because of the deficit we  cannot build the low-income, affordable housing we desperately need.   At a time when millions of senior citizens in this country  desperately need help to go to a dentist because their teeth are  rotting in their mouths, they can't afford hearing aids, they can't  afford eyeglasses, we are told that we cannot afford to expand Medicare  because of the deficit.   At a time when the average family in this country is spending $15,000  a year on childcare--an unimaginable amount of money for a working  family--we are told that we cannot reform a dysfunctional childcare  system because of the deficit.   At a time when some 70 million Americans are uninsured or  underinsured, we are told that we cannot guarantee healthcare to all  Americans as a human right--like virtually every other major country  does--because of the deficit.   In other words, despite the fact that half of the people in our  country today are living paycheck to paycheck, despite the fact that  half of our seniors live on incomes of $25,000 or less, despite the  fact that we have more income and wealth inequality today than we have  had in 100 years, where three billionaires own more wealth than the  bottom half of America, despite all of that, whenever it comes to  protecting the needs of low-income or working families, I hear, over  and over again, we just cannot afford to do that because of the  deficit.   Well, guess what? All of that profound and serious concern about the  deficit fades away when it comes to providing a $76 billion blank check  to the highly profitable microchip industry with no protections at all  for the American taxpayer.   Somehow the deficit is of great concern when it comes to providing  help to working families, to low-income Americans, to children, to  seniors, but it is not a concern when you provide massive corporate  welfare for enormously profitable multinational corporations.   I guess when the semiconductor industry spends $19 million on  lobbying this year alone and when Intel spends $100 million on lobbying  and campaign contributions over the past 20 years, when that industry  says: Jump, the response from Congress is: How high?   That is what a political system dominated by Big Money looks like.  The people in this country who desperately need help can't get it. The  corporations that are making huge profits and the CEOs who are making  exorbitant compensation packages get everything they need--and more.   In other words, it appears that the deep concerns about the deficit  are rather selective.   Now, after I finish my remarks, I will give my colleagues a chance to  prove me wrong. I will be raising a budget point of order against this  bill because it increases the deficit by over $79 billion, with $76  billion of that money going to the microchip industry with no strings  attached.   Let me be very clear. There is no doubt that there is a global  shortage of microchips and semiconductors, which is making it harder  for manufacturers to produce the cars, cell phones, household  appliances, and electronic equipment that we need. And that is why I  fully support efforts to expand U.S. microchip production.   But the question we should be asking is this: Should American  taxpayers provide the microchip industry with a blank check of over $76  billion at a time when semiconductor companies are making tens of  billions of dollars in profit right now and paying the head of Intel  some $170 million a year in compensation? And I think the answer to  that question is a resounding no.    That is why, at the conclusion of my remarks, I will be asking  unanimous consent to attach an amendment to this legislation.   This amendment is simple and straightforward. It would prevent  microchip companies from receiving grants under this legislation unless  they agreed not to buy back their own stock--not complicated.   Now, this is rather amazing. This is really quite incredible and  tells you where we are as a nation politically. Over the past decade,  semiconductor companies have spent nearly $250 billion--70 percent of  their profits--not on research and development, not on building new  microchip plants in America--what this bill is presumably about--but on  buying back their own stock to enrich their wealthy shareholders.   Let me repeat: The industry that is asking for $76 billion of  corporate welfare today, over the past decade spent $250 billion--70  percent of their profits--not on research and development, not on  building new microchip plants in America but on buying back their own  stock to enrich their wealthy stockholders.   Apparently, they just couldn't find $76 billion of their own money to  invest in new plants in America. They need the taxpayers of this  country to do it for them.   Do any of my colleagues really believe we should allow microchip  companies to receive $76 billion in taxpayer assistance without a ban  on stock buybacks?   Under my amendment, microchip companies would not be allowed to  receive taxpayer assistance unless they agreed they would not repeal  existing collective bargaining agreements and would remain neutral in  any union organizing effort.   Do any of my colleagues believe that we should be handing out  corporate welfare to profitable corporations who are engaged in busting  unions?   Under my agreement, microchip companies would not be able to receive  $76 billion in taxpayer assistance unless they agreed not to outsource  jobs overseas.   Now, I heard my colleague from Indiana speak a moment ago about the  crisis in the microchip industry, how we are producing a smaller and  smaller amount, but he forgot to mention--somehow forgot to mention-- that over the last 20 years, the microchip industry has shut down over  780 manufacturing plants and other establishments in the United States  and eliminated 150,000 American jobs while moving most of its  production overseas.   In other words, what taxpayers are doing are rebuilding an industry  that was destroyed by the industry itself by going abroad in search of  more profit.   Under my amendment, microchip companies would be prevented from  receiving taxpayer assistance unless they agree to issue warrants or  equity stakes to the Federal Government.   Now, I happen to believe in industrial policy. I think it makes sense  for the government and private sector to be working together when it is  mutually beneficial. If private companies, however, are going to  benefit from generous taxpayer subsidies--$76 billion--  [[Page S3712]]  the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the  American people, not just wealthy shareholders. Does that sound really  unreasonable?   If these guys are going to make huge profits based on this  investment, don't you think maybe the taxpayers of this country who  gave them the money might be able to get some of those benefits back?   The microchip industry today is worth about $680 billion. By 2030,  that market, the market for microchips, is expected to grow to a  trillion dollars. Do any of my colleagues really believe that if  microchip companies make a profit as a direct result of these Federal  grants--which is extremely likely--the taxpayers in this country,  taxpayers do not have a right to get a reasonable return on that  investment?   And let us be clear, none of this is a radical idea. All of those  provisions that I just articulated were included in the CARES Act that  passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. In other words, every Senator  here has already voted for these provisions.   Now, I have heard recently some of my colleagues who are saying:  Don't worry. We have imposed ``strong guardrails'' to this bill.   Well, let me respectfully disagree. These so-called guardrails would  do nothing to prevent microchip companies from outsourcing a single job  abroad. In fact, these so-called guardrails would not even force Intel  to divest all of the money they have put into semiconductor companies  in China. These so-called guardrails would do nothing to protect  taxpayers or to stop microchip companies from union busting.   Yes, I understand some language has been inserted in this bill that  would prohibit microchip companies from using Federal grants to buy  back their own stock, but let's be clear, this language is totally  meaningless. Under this legislation, companies will still be able to  use the enormous profits that they are making to buy back their own  stocks.   Bottom line, let us rebuild the U.S. microchip industry. I believe  that. But let us do it in a way that benefits all of our society, not  just a handful of wealthy, profitable, and powerful corporations.   In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said:         The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the       rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.    I am afraid that what Dr. King said 54 years ago was accurate back  then. And as we can see by this legislation today--massive subsidies  for the rich and the powerful, while we continue to turn our backs on  working families--what King said then is even more accurate now.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up  amendment No. 5145, that the amendment be considered and agreed to, and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending  measure violates section 4106 of the concurrent resolution on the  budget for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71 of the 115th Congress, the  Senate pay-as-you-go point of order.    No.    Mr. President, I previously revised the allocations,  aggregates, and pay-as-you-go ledger for S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act, pursuant to section 3003 of S. Con. Res. 14, the  fiscal year 2022 congressional budget resolution.   As the legislation has now been signed into law and directs that its  budgetary effects are not to be entered on the PAYGO scorecard, I am  reversing the PAYGO adjustment I made in June.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying table, which provides  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD FOR THE SENATE-  (Revisions Pursuant to Section 3003 of S. Con.
