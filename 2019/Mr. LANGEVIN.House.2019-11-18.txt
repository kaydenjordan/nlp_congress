 Mr. Speaker, as a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus  on Foster Youth and a member of the Adoption Caucus, I rise to  recognize National Adoption Month.   Mr. Speaker, all children deserve the love and security of a family,  but for the 125,000 youth waiting to be adopted from foster care, that  most basic of human needs can seem so out of reach. Through the Foster  Youth Caucus, we try to shine a spotlight on these youth, as well as  the adoptive families that open their hearts and homes to children in  need.   Ted and Teena Sullivan are two such adoptive parents from my home  State of Rhode Island. Ted is also the senior director of Mission  Advancement for Bethany Christian Services, and I was honored to  recognize him as a 2019 Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute  Angel in Adoption last week.   Mr. Speaker, adoptive parents like Ted and Teena give children in  need the most important gift: a forever family. Let them be our example  this National Adoption Month as we recommit to serving our most  vulnerable youth.                            ____________________
