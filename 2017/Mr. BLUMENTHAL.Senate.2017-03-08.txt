 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.             Calling for the Appointment of a Special Prosecutor     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.             Calling for the Appointment of a Special Prosecutor     Mr. President, even in its early days, this  administration has embarked on a course of foreign private interest  entanglements and conflicts of interest that are truly staggering.   Just this morning, the Associated Press reported that China has  granted preliminary approval for 38 new trademarks. They are Trump  trademarks, paving the way for the President, Donald Trump, and his  family to ``potentially develop a host of branded businesses from  hotels to golf clubs to bodyguard and concierge services.''   These reports are contained in public documents. All but three are in  the President's own name. The AP report also quotes an official as  saying that ``for all these marks to sail through so quickly and  cleanly, with no similar marks . . . no issues with specification, boy,  it's weird.''   Now, the speculation is that these trademarks could not have been  issued without approval by the ruling Communist Party, that hierarchy  had to be involved, and that awareness had to involve their approval  for these intellectual property interests. The benefit is to the  President through his private interests. The fact is, the President of  the United States should be beholden only to the American people, not  to personal profit, but in fact these trademarks raise the specter that  the President possibly is beholden to the approving officials in China  even more than to the American people. That is an issue that merits  investigation. Like so many issues arising in this young  administration, the question is, Who will do that investigation?    The lawyers in China representing Donald Trump applied for these  trademarks in April of 2016, even as then-Candidate Donald Trump railed  against China at his campaign rallies, criticizing Chinese currency  manipulation, its intellectual property theft, its attraction of jobs  from this country to theirs. The question arises, What has he done  about those issues? In fact, China continues to manipulate its  currency, continues to attract jobs from this country, and continues  its aggressive policies in the area around that country.   The question is whether an inquiry is appropriate--which certainly it  seems to be--and who will supervise it. It is the same question that  arises with respect to Russian interference in our electoral system and  the potential ties between Trump team officials and the Russians who  committed those acts. Those ties have been established by evidence that  is now incontrovertible because it is admitted by the officials  themselves, now Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former National  Security Advisor Michael Flynn.   It is now a matter of factual record that Russia engaged in a series  of deliberate cyber attacks in order to carry out an unprecedented plot  to undermine the 2016 elections with the goal of assisting Donald  Trump. The growing body of evidence clearly and unmistakably indicates  that Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russia during the  election. These deeply troubling claims of coordination with a foreign  government to influence an American election certainly deserve exacting  scrutiny and investigation, and the more we learn, the more troubled we  become. In fact, we are rapidly careening toward a constitutional  crisis. These recent revelations about Vladimir Putin's government and  former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resulted in his  resignation. There have also been details about contact between  Attorney General Sessions, our former colleague, and the Russian  Ambassador that have caused his recusal from all inquiries of that  subject matter.   I believe a special prosecutor must be appointed to investigate the  Russian interference and meddling in our election, the massive cyber  attack misinformation, and propaganda campaign conducted to subvert  that election. The potential for cooperation, condoning,  [[Page S1661]]  connecting between the Trump officials and Russia certainly merits  investigation as well. Without reaching conclusions, the special  prosecutor ought to investigate and then reach a conclusion. His  conclusion should be based on fact, not surmise or speculation.   For weeks, I have called for a special prosecutor to investigate  possible ties between members of the Trump campaign, the Trump  transition, and the Trump White House to Russian officials who sought  to interfere with our election. I support the Intelligence Committee in  conducting its investigation. I would favor the appointment of a  special commission or a select committee of the Congress to do  factfinding, make reports and recommendations in a fully transparent  way, but only a special prosecutor can take action based on criminal  intent. Only a special prosecutor can pursue violations of criminal  law, to not only investigate but also bring charges and seek  appropriate punishment and remedy. Only the Deputy Attorney General of  the United States can appoint a special prosecutor because the Attorney  General has recused himself--in other words, taken himself out of all  of the areas of this subject matter. That is why I asked yesterday that  the nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, commit to  appoint a special prosecutor.   His answer to me was that he wishes to wait until he is approved by  the Senate--assuming his confirmation occurs--to decide whether to  appoint a special prosecutor. He claims he needs to familiarize himself  with the facts and circumstances of any ongoing investigation before he  can make a decision. With all due respect, the facts he needs to know  are already established. They are already a matter of public record.  They are already known to the American public. There is an  investigation ongoing by the FBI--and with good reason--into Russian  meddling in our elections, this massive campaign of misinformation and  cyber attack that they purposefully conducted to influence the outcome  of our election.   We know the Justice Department must investigate and pursue the  ongoing investigation, wherever the evidence leads. Part of that  evidence inevitably will be meetings that were conducted by his boss,  the Attorney General of United States, Jeff Sessions, which is why the  Attorney General has recused himself--because he could be involved in  that investigation as a witness, as a subject, even possibly as a  target, as could the President himself.   To close that investigation, the Deputy Attorney General, or whoever  is conducting it, needs to question the Attorney General of the United  States. To conduct that investigation, that questioning must occur. So  the Deputy Attorney General would be expected to be investigating his  boss. If he decides to conduct that investigation himself, he must  appoint a special prosecutor to establish the independence of that  inquiry, to assure that in reality and in appearance the American  public is assured that the investigation is independent, objective,  impartial, vigorous, and fair.   The facts that warrant a special prosecutor are already known and  they are already a matter of public record. That is why I believe he  must commit himself now, before his confirmation--in fact, as a  condition of his confirmation--to take that action, which preserves the  credibility and public confidence in the Department of Justice that he  observed very eloquently in his confirmation hearing as one of his  central objectives.    There is a lot of precedent for this step. The most prominent one  perhaps is Elliot Richardson, when he was the Attorney General  designee. He was requested by the Judiciary Committee, at that time, to  make the same kind of commitment--and he did. He kept his promise. He  appointed Archibald Cox to be special prosecutor, and the Watergate  scandal was appropriately investigated and pursued. That example--when  Elliot Richardson had enough facts, just as Rod Rosenstein does now-- ought to be the lodestar here. It ought to be the model for his  commitment to appointing a special prosecutor.   The simple fact is, Rod Rosenstein, like Elliot Richardson, knows  everything he needs to know to be sure a special prosecutor is  necessary, and especially because he is a career prosecutor with a  distinguished record, and because he has that intellect and integrity  that would qualify him probably to be confirmed, he should know it is  the right thing to do. Maybe he will do it if he is confirmed, but it  would serve the interests of justice, and it would help to sustain and  enhance the trust and public confidence in the Department of Justice if  he were to do it now, as Elliot Richardson did many years ago.   We live in an extraordinary time. The conflicts of interest and  foreign entanglements that threaten our Nation, beginning at the very  top of this administration, impose a unique mandate on the Department  of Justice. The recusal of the Attorney General from this investigation  indicates that leadership and integrity are necessary at every level as  never before. That is why, in this extraordinary time, I urge the  Deputy Attorney General nominee, Rod Rosenstein, to do the right thing  and make sure there is an investigation that is independent and  vigorous, as well as fair and full; that we know all of the facts  eventually and that action is taken appropriately to deal with the  Russian interference in our election, the potential ties between the  Trump administration--before and after the election--in those improper  interferences by the Russians in our election, and that the danger of  coverup, indicated by the potential false statements made by Jeff  Sessions before the Judiciary Committee and Michael Flynn elsewhere, be  stopped before it starts. Only a special prosecutor can provide the  unbiased and fair answers that are so urgently needed.   The American people deserve an explanation. They deserve an  explanation for the trademarks that have been issued to Donald Trump in  China. They deserve an explanation by a special prosecutor on Russian  meddling and Trump ties to that meddling. Whether the independent and  special prosecutor broadens the scope of that investigation to include  the entanglements or conflicts of interest involving China is a  question that will have to be addressed by that official, but this much  we know now. We are rapidly careening toward a constitutional crisis, a  crisis of credibility as well as legal challenges. The historic  opportunity and obligation this nominee owes the country cannot be  avoided.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   Apparently there is another speaker. I withdraw that suggestion.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch
