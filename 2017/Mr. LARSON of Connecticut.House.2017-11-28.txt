 Several.    Several.    Several.    Several.    Several.    Several.    Several.    Several.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Democratic leader  for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Michigan for joining us  here.   As Mr. Hoyer stated at the outset, this is a very dangerous bill and  a very dangerous precedent for this body and the other body and for  Congress in general.   It was Lincoln who said: ``A House divided cannot stand.''   And in this bill, when you pit the sick against the well, the poor  against the wealthiest 1 percent, blue State against red State, small  business against large corporation, you begin to see the inequity in  the bill.   Rich Neal, the lead Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee,  lamented that this was a lost opportunity--a lost opportunity because  there was ample time to come together both in the committee and here on  the floor to do something constructive for the country, put the Nation  back to work, and resolve issues that President Obama had put forward  that I know have been on the front burners of everyone's concern to get  lower taxes, and greater fairness in equity across the board, but that  didn't happen.   Now, much is said about process, and people pooh-pooh that, but here  are the facts:   It was Ronald Reagan who said: ``The facts are a stubborn thing.''   Back in 1986, the last time we impacted policy of this nature, the  Ways and Means Committee, in fact, had 30 hearings in the committee, 12  subcommittee hearings, 450 expert witnesses, and 26 days of markup  before it came to the floor for debate.                                time  1930    It was done bipartisanly, in fact, done between Ronald Reagan and Tip  O'Neill because they knew that this would be the best way to get  cohesive, comprehensive tax reform.   That is not what happened here. There were zero hearings in the  committee on this bill, zero subcommittee hearings, no expert  witnesses, not a single person from the State of Maryland or  Connecticut.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Commissioner  of Revenue Services from the State of Connecticut that details  factually, not based on averages, what happens to people in States who  use itemized deductions like the State and local property tax  deduction, like medical deductions, et cetera, all of which have a  direct impact on them, all of which are going to find our citizens  paying more money, in fact, not getting a tax cut, getting a tax  increase so they can pay for lowering the rate of an individual who is  already receiving $11 million from an estate tax gift.                                                   November 8, 2017.      Hon. John B. Larson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Larson: Thank you for opportunity to       comment on the federal tax changes being considered in H.R.       1. We appreciate your leadership in trying to set the record       straight as this partisan effort is rushed to judgment with       no real input and much fiscal uncertainty.        Unfortunately, what we see so far from a national and state       perspective is very troubling. Some of the proposals to       reduce taxes on corporate and pass-through business income       could provide needed economic stimulus nationally and for       states like Connecticut. Unfortunately, on balance, H R. 1 is       fundamentally flawed:        Even the low estimate of a $1.5 trillion cost is not paid       for and is really massive federal tax deficit spending. The       nation has been down this road before and surely we should       have learned something from the worst economic recession in       modern times.        Otherwise unaffordable tax cuts have long been part of a       political strategy to ``starve the beast.'' Due to its long       term unfunded cost, this Republican tax plan will compel big       cuts in federal funding, such as Medicaid, that are important       to states like Connecticut.        Contrary to all the talk of a ``middle income tax cut,''       the plan actually represents a huge windfall to the very       wealthiest federal taxpayers and is truly regressive. For our       own state of Connecticut, over 75% of the tax cut goes to the       top 1% who would pay 8.5% less on average. Everyone else       would see a trivial 1.2% reduction in federal tax liability       and many will actually owe much more in federal income taxes.        As discussed more specifically below, the proposed plan       shifts most of the tax cost and the least of any tax benefit       to states in the Northeast, Great Lakes and West Coast       regions of the country. Thus, Connecticut and similar states       will even more disproportionately pay in federal taxes far       more than is received in federal benefits--further       subsidizing regions of the country where states make far less       of a state and local tax effort.        Drilling down a bit further, several aspects of this       partisan plan will hit especially hard:        Eliminating deductibility of state income tax paid is worth       an estimated $8.7 billion to mostly 1 middle income       Connecticut taxpayers        Capping deductibility of local property tax paid at $10,000       will increase federal income taxes for a significant       proportion of Connecticut taxpayers who claim $4.9 billion.        Any benefit to lower and lower moderate income taxpayers       from higher standard deductions and child care credits will       likely be more than offset by the shell game of imposing a       higher lowest rate bracket of 12% and replacing the current       $4,050 personal exemption with a $300 deduction that is       proposed to end in 5 years.        Eliminating deductibility of medical/dental expenses will       be $1.6 billion hardship for Connecticut taxpayers at all       levels who are out of work and have catastrophic medical       costs.        Eliminating deductibility of student loan interest only       adds a further financial burden for primarily younger       taxpayers and their families already struggling with       educational indebtedness.        Sadly, these and many other significant issues of fiscal       irresponsibility and tax unfairness seem to be of no concern       in the partisan rush to pass legislation before taxpayers see       through the slogans and realize the costs. Indeed, glimpses       of what may be in the Republican Senate version suggests that       it will only get worse. Thank you for your efforts to speak       out for our Connecticut taxpayers and set the record       straight.            Sincerely,                                                 Kevin B. Sullivan,                                                      Commissioner.    Mr. Speaker, I will tell you, if that weren't the cruelest cut, what  is built into this legislation, and it is why process matters, because  of the way this bill came to the floor through budget reconciliation  primarily so the other body can get around their other arcane rule of  cloture, but so that they could pass something with the minimal amount  of votes.   So no hearings, no expert witnesses, and only a minimal amount of  votes--51 in the Senate--to pass a bill.   I say that because there is a trigger mechanism here that the  gentleman from Maryland knows better than anyone else in either Chamber  called PAYGO, PAYGO provisions that he fought for to make sure were in  the bill because of our ongoing concern about staggering deficits. It  is why most people call for this bill minimally, including most  Republican economists, to be revenue neutral. We would add that it be  distributionally neutral as well so that it doesn't impact the middle  and the lower classes.   But this bill here, the cruelest cut of all is that it triggers an  automatic response that will result in a $25 billion cut to Medicare.  Nobody at home recognized this. Many people in this Chamber didn't even  know that it existed because there were no public hearings, there were  no expert witnesses. This was jammed through so that people could  achieve a political win.   How about we focus on the American people winning for a change and  doing something that is not going to put them in jeopardy?   I wondered why so many on the other side had professed to be  concerned about the deficit but turned a blind eye as we passed what  amounts to be $2.3 trillion in new deficits. Then it dawned on me. This  provision that is in there would allow sequestration to go forward  without a vote and would cut Medicare by $25 billion. I have asked  people when we have held forums back in our district. People are  writing, people are calling, people are calling their Senators in an  effort to stop what is a blind, dangerous precedent that would take $25  billion out of a program that desperately needs this.   I know the gentleman from Maryland knows this better than most. I  know the State of Maryland, like the State of Connecticut, also  itemizes deductions, and I believe it leads the country in that  because, as they noted back in 1913, it would otherwise be double  taxation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for allowing us the opportunity to  come down here and speak to the dastardly nature of this bill and what  lies ahead, and I thank him for his continued leadership in making sure  that we wage this fight in every way to the end until we are able to  stop that.
