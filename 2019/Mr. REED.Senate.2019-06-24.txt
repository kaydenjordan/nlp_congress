 Mr. President, I just ask permission to speak after Senator  Inhofe as the ranking minority member and comanager of the legislation.    Mr. President, I commend the chairman for the bipartisan  and thoughtful way he has approached this entire process of crafting  the National Defense Authorization Act for this year. We had a very  successful markup. The result was a strong bipartisan vote of 25 to 2  on the committee. Subsequently, with our staff, we have done an  extraordinary job. We have been able to include an additional 100  amendments, on a bipartisan basis, to the substitute. So we have been  able, I think, to respond to all of the concerns of our colleagues or  very many of these concerns of our colleagues.   The chairman has indicated some of the strengths of the bill. We have  increased our operations and maintenance funding so our readiness  stature and posture is increasing. One area, too, that I think is very  important is the fundamental reform of privatized housing which was a  real problem that we discovered. Again, the chairman led two very  thorough hearings in which we had not only the operators but also the  families who live there. The legislation before us contains significant  improvements in the privatized family housing at the Department of  Defense. That is something critically important.   I, too, like the chairman, would like to see a very open amendment  process so we can bring to the floor amendments that are important and  linked to the national defense bill, have votes on these amendments,  and then move forward.   Let me just conclude my brief remarks by thanking the chairman for  his leadership.   I yield the floor.
