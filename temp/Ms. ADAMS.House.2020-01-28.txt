 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize those  four young men from North Carolina A&T State University who helped bend  the arc of history towards justice, the Greensboro Four.   On February 1, 1960, 60 years ago this upcoming Saturday, David  Richmond, Franklin McCain, Jibreel Khazan, and Joseph McNeil, took  their seats at a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina,  and changed American history forever. And after they were refused  service, they continued to sit at that lunch counter until the store  closed.   The next day, 12 more students sat at that same lunch counter; and by  the next week, thousands of demonstrators began to fight against Jim  Crow in North Carolina.   To honor the triumphs of these four young men, and to commemorate  their efforts to make this a more just society, I am proud to introduce  today, with my colleague, Representative G.K. Butterfield, a resolution  recognizing the significance of the Greensboro Four sit-in.   May we all continue to live by their example as we make this a fairer  and more equitable America for all that call it home.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for yielding,  and for his leadership, and for organizing this Special Order Hour.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in setting the  record straight when it comes to the Trump economy.   The Trump economy was on sad display in Charlotte, North Carolina, on  Monday, when 1,300 of my constituents stood in line for a chance at 185  affordable housing units in West Charlotte.   Instead of investing in shelter, affordable housing, and community  health, the Trump economic policy is about consolidating wealth. The  Trump economy is one that works for the American billionaire, but not  for the union boilermaker. It is an economy that works for executives  with golden parachutes, but not for educators teaching elementary  school students parachute games.   It doesn't have to be this way. In 2016, when Donald Trump was  elected, he inherited a robust economy, thanks to President Obama and  his administration. It was President Obama who turned our economy  around and helped pull us out of the Great Recession. Seventy-five  consecutive months of private sector job growth? Thanks, President  Obama.    However, since then, Trump's ``Billionaires First'' policies have  hurt our neighbors and our families. Some of these harmful policies:  The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement; the ongoing trade  war with China, and threats to place tariffs on goods imported from our  allies; this administration's cruel efforts to dismantle and weaken the  Affordable Care Act; Trump's heartless immigration policies that have  led to fearmongering and separation of families at the border.   Trump economic policy is not about helping others. Instead, the  cruelty is the point. In fact, the only compassionate thing about his  economic policy is that it looks out for billionaires, and not just  millionaires like himself.   But Scripture tells us that, ``Whoever loves money never has enough;  whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.'' The  dividends we seek as public servants are not from increased wealth, but  from a more perfect commonwealth.   Luckily, the American people are standing up to push back against  this economy. And whether it is a small business owner who gives the  homeless a place to park their cars at night, or the community  advocates helping their displaced neighbors find new homes, the Queen  City knows that service is the rent we pay for living on this Earth.   The American people are working for the people, and so is the  people's House. It is time for the Trump administration to do the same.
