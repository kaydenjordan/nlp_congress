 Mr. Speaker, I would rather die than see my country stumble  or fall, and, by God, I mean that. And I don't think I am the only one  in this body who feels this way. I have worried that, as a result of a  virus that was born in a disgusting market in Wuhan China that was  hidden from the world, our country may stumble.   But I can tell you that that worry has subsided quickly for me as I  looked around my own community and realized, again, that Americans are  a salty group of tough SOBs who are defeated by absolutely nothing.  This isn't going to defeat us either.   There are parts of this bill that I don't like, but I am proud that,  when Americans wake up tomorrow, they are going to continue to know  that we wake up here not as victims, but as people with a greater  opportunity than anybody across the world: 50 stars, 13 red and white  stripes. We get to decide for ourselves if today is better than  yesterday, this week is better than next week, this month is better  than last month, and next year and so on.   Nobody else gets to decide that for us. That hasn't changed, and it  will never change.
