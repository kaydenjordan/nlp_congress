 Mr. President, for over 2 years, the Biden  administration has failed to attend to some of the most basic governing  duties. Stable prices, secure borders, and safe streets are three of  the most fundamental responsibilities that any government owes its  people.   But Washington Democrats neglected the basics for their pet  priorities. They spent trillions of dollars on government goodies that  nobody asked for, triggered the worst inflation in 40 years, and turned  a blind eye to the border crisis and a crime wave, all occurring on  their watch.   They caused the damage on party-line votes, without any input from  the Republican side. In response, the American people flipped the House  and chose a closely divided Senate. The voters dialed up the checks and  the balances. The people went to the ballot box and demanded the  Democrats start negotiating and compromising.   But the President is refusing to engage. Even as his own advisers say  the debt ceiling is approaching fast, the White House is totally MIA.  His position has been no negotiation, no reforms.   It is such an absurd position that even fellow Democrats are not  buying it. The senior Senator from West Virginia, a Democrat, has  publicly called on the President to sit down with Speaker McCarthy and  negotiate.   Listen to the House Democrats: ``Get to work and get it done for the  sake of the country,'' says one. ``They've got to do it soon,'' says  another.   Just a few years ago, the Democratic leader said debt limit talks  were an ``opportunity for bipartisanship.''   And what about President Biden himself? Here is what then-Vice  President Biden said about the debt ceiling back in 2011. ``Some of  them are still unwilling to budge . . . taking an absolute position: my  way or no way. . . . That's not governing,'' said the Vice President in  2011.   My goodness, that is harsh criticism for the 2023 version of  President Biden from the 2011 version of Vice President Biden.   The Democrats' reckless policies have already dealt far too much  damage to our country. This administration's inflation has hammered  working families' budgets. Their anti-energy policies have raised gas  prices and utility bills. Their attempt to reinvent cash welfare  without work requirements hurt small businesses by worsening labor  shortages and hurt families by promoting dependence.   So the working people of this country have already paid a heavy  enough price for Democrats' failures. We should not even come within a  mile of flirting with a Democratic debt default on top of all the rest.   It is time for President Biden to stop the partisan stubbornness,  join Speaker McCarthy at the grownups' table, and get talking.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Barrasso), the Senator from Tennessee (Mrs.  Blackburn), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Hagerty), and the Senator  from Idaho (Mr. Risch).   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 72, nays 22, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 95 Ex.]                                  YEAS--72       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Boozman      Britt      Brown      Budd      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Cruz      Duckworth      Durbin      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Marshall      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--22       Braun      Cornyn      Crapo      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hawley      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      McConnell      Mullin      Paul      Ricketts      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Vance      Wicker                               NOT VOTING--6       Barrasso      Blackburn      Feinstein      Hagerty      Risch      Sanders    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.
