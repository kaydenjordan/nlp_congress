 Mr. Speaker, Scouting organizations are  pivotal in the lives of so many American youth, and this week there has  been much to celebrate. Yesterday, the Girl Scouts of the USA marked  its 107th birthday, and tonight the Boy Scouts of America will conclude  its annual report to the Nation.   Girl Scouts help girls develop into the future leaders of our  economy, our communities, our country, and the world by encouraging  them to dream big and work hard to achieve their goals. In fact, many  Congresswomen have been Girl Scouts, and we saw some Congresswomen  deliver speeches on this floor yesterday in honor of the Girl Scouts  building girls of courage, confidence, and character for 107 years.   Mr. Speaker, I know firsthand the positive impact that Scouting can  have on the life of a young person. I have been actively involved with  the Boy Scouts of America since I was 11 years old.   On May 17, 1977, I became an Eagle Scout myself, as a member of Boy  Scout Troop 52 in Walker Township, Pennsylvania. Over the years, I have  proudly held various leadership roles with Boy Scout troops in  Pennsylvania, including two separate stints as Scoutmaster for Troop  353 and president of the Juniata Valley Boy Scout Council. One of my  greatest honors was to witness 29 young men achieve the rank of Eagle  Scout during my tenure as Scoutmaster.   Many Eagle Scouts will gather tonight in the Capitol to conclude the  annual Report to the Nation delegation trip. I am proud to be a part of  the Eagles on the Hill reception, and I look forward to hearing from  the Scouts.   Members of Congress and I will speak about how Scouting positively  impacted our lives. And after the speeches, the Scouts will have a  chance to discuss their experience in Scouting as a whole, as well as  their time in the Report to the Nation delegation.   Report to the Nation is an annual event meant to connect some of  Scouting's best and brightest with government officials and elected  representatives. Each year, 6 to 10 representatives of the Boy Scouts  meet with senior government officials, including the President and key  congressional leaders, with the goal of providing an update of what  Scouts have achieved over the past year. This also allows members of  the Federal Government an opportunity to meet some of the Nation's  brightest young Scouts. The delegation spends between a week and 10  days in Washington, D.C., conducting meetings and touring the city.   The Report to the Nation delegation stems from the congressional  charter of the Boy Scouts of America, dating back to June 15, 1916, and  represents millions of Boy Scouts.   Mr. Speaker, I know that the Boy Scouts of America and the Girl  Scouts of the USA both contribute to the spirit of this Nation and play  an essential role in educating our youth. These organizations build  character; they help young people become actively engaged in their  communities; and they promote serving others in ways big and small. And  that is something we can all respect and admire.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate The American Legion on its centennial anniversary.   On Friday, March 15, The American Legion will celebrate 100 years  since it was formed in Paris, France, after World War I. More than  1,000 people gathered for The American Legion's first caucus at the  American Club in Paris on March 15, 1919.   Since then, The American Legion has grown to be the Nation's largest  wartime veterans service organization, boasting more than 2 million  members and 13,000 posts across all 50 States, the District of  Columbia, Puerto Rico, France, Mexico, and the Philippines.   Its dedication to veterans, servicemembers, and their families  extends from local community programs to State and Federal policy  initiatives, including the establishment of the Veterans Administration  in 1930 and the GI Bill in 1944. Hundreds of local American Legion  programs and activities strengthen the Nation one community at a time.   Madam Speaker, I thank The American Legion for its service and wish  its members a happy 100th birthday this Friday.                            ____________________
