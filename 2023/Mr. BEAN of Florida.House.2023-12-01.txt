 Mr. Speaker, do you know what always works when  you are in trouble with your spouse?   Flowers.   Science has shown that not only do flowers make us happier, but they  have a strong positive effect on our emotional well-being.   No stranger to the power of flowers are the dedicated members of the  Garden Club of Orange Park.   Since 1948, this club has bloomed into a staple for the  beautification of northeast Florida, and today I rise to commemorate  them on their 75th birthday. Let's all agree, they don't look a day  over 29.   Through countless projects, they have nurtured a spirit of  environmental awareness and sustainable living. The fruits of their  labor include actual fruit trees at homes built by Habitat for Humanity  and gardens at local elementary schools.   The Garden Club has not only enriched our physical surroundings, but  it has also transformed public spaces, creating havens of tranquility  and beauty for all to enjoy.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank  each member, past and present, for their commitment to environmental  preservation and exceptional community service. I trust that their  legacy will continue to bloom for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, it is a joy to wish the Garden Club of Orange Park a  happy 75th anniversary.                            ____________________
