 Mr. Speaker, I have thus far released the  interview transcripts of two individuals at the heart of the 2016 DOJ  investigations controversy. Today, I am releasing a third.   As I have said before, I believe the American people deserve  transparency and deserve to know what transpired at the highest  echelons of the FBI during this tumultuous time for the Bureau.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I request the link, dougcollins.house.gov/ strzok be placed into the Record so that the American people can review  the transcript of Peter Strzok.   Out of an abundance of caution, this transcript has a limited number  of narrowly tailored redactions relating only to confidential sources  and methods, nonpublic information about ongoing investigations and  nonmaterial personal information.   I will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible.  The American people deserve transparency and the truth.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to support this resolution, but as a matter of  time and coming through this week, I have 30 minutes, so I might as  well talk about a resolution that is a restatement of the regulation. I  want to provide some background on the special counsel's regulations.   Special Counsel Mueller is operating under a different regulatory  framework from the independent counsel statute that gave us the Starr  report.   The Clinton administration Justice Department, which was led by  Attorney General Janet Reno, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, and  Neal Katyal, drafted the special counsel regulations in effect today.  They established a regulatory framework that gives the Attorney General  flexibility.    Attorney General Barr has a few options when he receives the  information from Mr. Mueller. He can give Congress the complete report  or a summary, or he can simply tell Congress that the Mueller  investigation has concluded.   The Clinton administration regulations do not require a full report  to Congress. However, during his confirmation, Attorney General Barr  said he wants to be ``transparent'' with Congress and the public  ``consistent with the rules and the law.'' I have no reason to think  Attorney General Barr would back away from those statements he made  before the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I believe he is truthful and will be truthful to his  word to make as much public as he possibly can.   The American people should not expect another Starr report. The  Clinton Justice Department made sure another President would not have  salacious stories aired before the American people. Janet Reno herself  testified before Congress in 1999 that it was a bad idea for  independent counsels to publish final reports.   Many Members of the Democratic majority in Congress today voted  against the public release of materials related to the Starr report.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a narrative related to a roll  call vote from the 105th Congress. For the Record, I note that the  following Democratic Members voted against the release of the Starr  materials: Speaker Pelosi, Majority Whip Clyburn, Chairman Nadler,  Chairman Cummings, Chairman Engel, Chairman Waters, Ms. Jackson Lee,  Mr. Markey, Chair Lofgren, and Chairman Neal, among others.   It is amazing that we have now changed our perspective on that, in  light of a Republican in the White House.   Again, this resolution simply, basically, restates the regulations  that are currently in place that were written under the Clinton  Department of Justice. It is going to go forward. The new Attorney  General has said he wants to make as much public to the American people  as he legally can.   I believe in transparency. I believe that there are many other things  we could be working on, but I am happy to support a resolution that is  actually just a restatement of the regulatory burden already placed  upon the Attorney General.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how about engaging in  personalities against the sitting Attorney General? You are saying that  he was appointed for a reason.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry.    Is it not also directed at the House to not  also impugn the integrity and the character of a sitting Cabinet  member?    I wouldn't want to do it either, Mr. Speaker.    Offer? Can you offer it? You said you were  able to offer an advisory opinion.    Mr. Speaker, I continue my parliamentary  inquiry.    I made a parliamentary inquiry concerning a  Cabinet member, not the President. I understand your advisory opinion  against the President. I fully agree with it. I am asking about a  member of the Cabinet.    Wow.    Wow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for enlightening  us on that. It is okay, basically, if you impugn the integrity of a  sitting member of the Cabinet. I guess we just learned something new  today. That is encouraging. As far as Members of the House, I get that  it is not in the rules, but it also shouldn't be a part of this debate.   This is a simple resolution. It simply restates the regulation. Don't  make it any more or any less than what it is. That is why we are here.  We are going to approve this, we are going to vote for it, but let's  not make it any more than what it is. Let's continue on so we can get a  vote, everybody can go home, and maybe we will come back and actually  vote on legislation that actually matters.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know, maybe I need to  make the talking points to the other side clear. I agreed on Monday  that I was voting for this. We are not opposing this, because it is  simply a restatement of the regulation. I know that it is fashionable  to think that we are not. So, again, I am sorry, I could have maybe  made the talking points more clear at Rules that I was voting for this  so we could have saved extra time on some of the discussion here.    Mr. Speaker, again, we will continue to go through this, and, at this  point, I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as I said today, and it is interesting to me--I think  this is the funny part of this, because so many times we would come up  here and we retreat to our partisan sides and we say, I am going to be  a ``yes''; you are going to be a ``no.''   The sad part about it is the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), my  colleague, I said ``yes'' on Monday night. I said ``yes'' to the  resolution on Monday night. Yet it seems like somehow, through the  process: Well, we need everybody to come together.   We have talked about this. It is nothing but a restatement of the  regulation.   Attorney General Barr will follow the regulation. He has said so. He  has been in committee, and during his time of confirmation, he has said  so.   I think what we need to understand here, and maybe we also need to  throw this out here, and maybe this is something because I have heard a  lot of my colleagues across the aisle talk about what they believe  should be in this report. Well, maybe I have a problem and maybe a news  flash to give them: What happens when it comes back and says none of  this was true, the President did not do anything wrong? Then the  meltdown will occur.   I heard probably, earlier, just one of my colleagues actually on the  other side stated that the elections has thrown chaos into the system.  No, the reason the election has thrown chaos is because President Trump  won and the Democratic candidate didn't know where Wisconsin was. You  all remedied that this time, though. The Democratic candidate for  President will actually have been to Wisconsin by the election day next  time.   There are other reasons to do this. Transparency is good.   As we go forward, my hope would be, on this issue, let's let the  report be given to the Attorney General. Let's let the Attorney General  do the regulations and follow the regulations and give as much as he  has said in his confirmation hearing: that he wants to be transparent,  he wants to be a part, he wants this to come out, because he  understands the questions and the turmoil that this has caused.    So I have nothing to believe that this would not be true. There is  nothing that has been presented here today to think that it wouldn't be  true. That is what makes this resolution even more amazing to me:  Nothing has been presented that Mr. Barr would not do what the  regulations say.   Now, there may be more on it and everything else, but let's talk  about what actually the resolution says, and that is what it says.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say thank you to  the chairman. I appreciate it. Mr. Hurd was on his way over here. I did  my best song and dance. It didn't last long enough. I am from the  South. I am bad because I can't dance that well. So I appreciate the  gentleman giving him that moment.
