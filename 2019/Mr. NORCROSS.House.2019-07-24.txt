 Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Chairman  Neal and Chairman Scott for bringing this bill to the floor, and my  colleague, Debbie Dingell, and Dr. Roe who sat on the supercommittee  last time to address this.   The Butch Lewis Act is a bill that makes sure that those Americans  receive the wages that they earned. This is not a handout. These are  deferred dreams, deferred wages that they said they will put aside  during their active career so that they can live out the American  Dream; those golden years, those pension years. They are deferred  wages.   I know firsthand. Over 3 years ago, my very first speech on the House  floor was right here talking about pensions. For 37 years, I have been  a member of a multiemployer plan, as a rank-and-file worker, and as a  negotiator. I understand how they work.   But the cost of doing nothing to the taxpayers is far greater than  the loans we are giving out now. We bailed out the banks, gave them  billions of dollars, but the people who earn these, who did nothing  wrong, you are saying no to. We cannot screw the people who earned the  wages. It is important for us to pass this because they did nothing  wrong. They played by the rules. That is what we do in America.                                time  1730    This is not a grand conspiracy. This is about doing the right thing  for the right people, for America.
