 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Dr.  James Emmett ``Jimmy'' Ducey, Sr., a veteran, a veterinarian, and an  exceptional Georgian.   Jimmy was born in Savannah in 1934, the youngest of four children,  and spent his entire youth in the State of Georgia. He then went on to  graduate from Savannah High School and attended the University of  Georgia where he earned his doctorate in veterinarian medicine.   In 1959 Jimmy and his wife moved to Fort Hood, Texas, where Jimmy  served in the U.S. Army as a veterinarian. In 1960, Jimmy returned to  Savannah and took over his father's veterinarian practice where he  continued to serve his community for 60 years.   Jimmy eventually retired from the Army, achieving the rank of major.  Jimmy founded and coached the Wilmington Island Cardinals baseball,  soccer, and football teams, winning multiple city championships in  soccer.   Thankfully, Jimmy was able to see the University of Georgia win their  third national championship before his passing.   A loving father and husband, a veterinarian, a veteran, and fellow  Georgia sports fan, Jimmy is sure to be missed.                            ____________________
