 Mr. Speaker, my friends, this National Police Week,  instead of helping communities recruit and train the next generation of  principled police officers, we voted to let officers buy their  department's retired handguns, and we voted on a nonbinding resolution  opposing defunding the police.   So many of us here are willing and ready to work together to address  the problems that I hear about when I meet with our police chiefs and  police officers. In fact, my bipartisan Pathways to Policing Act has  been endorsed by law enforcement and is still awaiting action on this  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get  to work and legitimately invest in law enforcement. Let's stop creating  campaign slogans and start working on congressional solutions like my  Pathways to Policing Act to ensure safety, security, and justice for  all.                            ____________________
