 Madam Speaker, I rise on tax day. Teachers, cops,  single moms, seniors, veterans, middle-class Americans--I am here to  speak for all of them today, to be their voice in the fight against a  tax provision that punishes States like New Jersey for investing in its  residents.   In States like mine, our State taxes go toward paying for top-tier  public schools, investing in infrastructure and open spaces, and  supporting a prevailing wage for our unions. That is why people move  here. That is why families stay for generations.   But without the ability to deduct State and local taxes, calling New  Jersey home is becoming less and less viable for our middle-class  residents.   Seniors are rethinking retiring in New Jersey; married couples are  rethinking starting a family in New Jersey; young people are rethinking  moving back to New Jersey after college.   The bottom line is, you don't have to be a millionaire to be impacted  by the SALT cap, and New Jersey families are getting taxed twice.   The time is now to bring relief to everyday middle-class New Jersey  residents who are getting crushed by this cap.                            ____________________
