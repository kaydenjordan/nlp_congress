 Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a  bipartisan, commonsense amendment.   This amendment will protect America's equines from being moved across  State lines then exported to Canada and Mexico to be butchered for  human consumption.   Horses aren't bred for food, and Americans don't want them bought  under false pretenses, forced into overcrowded trailers, tormented on a  thousand-mile journey and then prodded to slaughterhouses.   However, a legal loophole still allows tens of thousands of American  equines to be exported each year to Canada and Mexico for slaughter.   This is a heinous practice, and Congress should take every step and  chance we have to end it for good.   I thank the chairman and all of my colleagues for working with me to  make this amendment possible. I thank the amazing advocates who work to  protect horses, equines, and all animals day in and day out, year in  and year out. This amendment wouldn't be on the floor today without  their support. I tip my hat to them. This is a huge amendment that is  bipartisan.                                time  1930
