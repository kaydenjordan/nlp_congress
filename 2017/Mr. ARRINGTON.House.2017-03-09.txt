 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and so excited and so  honored to be able to serve in the United States House of  Representatives and to serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I did  not serve in the military, but now I have the amazing blessing of  serving those who did serve to protect our freedom to keep us safe.   I am filing my first piece of legislation today, and it is the  Veterans, Employees and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2017. In my first  hearing as chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I heard  with great concern, and even outrage, that some employees at the VA  spend 100 percent of their time on union activity. Even physicians and  nurses and folks who are hired to provide health care to our veterans,  100 percent of their time on union activity.   The law says their activity and time on union activities should be  reasonable and in the best interest of the public. I don't believe in  west Texas, or any area around the country, that it is reasonable and  in the best interest of the public to spend 100 percent of your time on  union activity and not fulfilling the mission. And, in this case, it is  protecting and serving and caring for our vets.                            ____________________
