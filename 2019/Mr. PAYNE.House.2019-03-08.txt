 Mr. Speaker, Wednesday marked the seventh anniversary of  the death of my father, the late Congressman Donald Payne. My father  was a tireless advocate in this House, but he lost his life to  colorectal cancer too early.   That is why each year I sponsor a resolution recognizing March as  National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time to educate the  public about the disease and the need for screening. I introduced that  resolution on Wednesday, the anniversary of the loss of my father.   I also introduced the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Screening Act,  a bipartisan bill joined by Representatives Rodney Davis, Don McEachin,  and   David McKinley as co-leads. More than 100 Members have joined on  as cosponsors, and I hope the remaining Members will join as well.   Mr. Speaker, when people use Medicare to get colonoscopies, they are  hit with an unexpected bill if polyps are removed. That is a monetary  barrier to screening, and screening saves lives. My father,  unfortunately, did not get screened for colorectal cancer. It wasn't  something that people of his generation did. But we can honor his  legacy by improving education and removing barriers to screening.                            ____________________
