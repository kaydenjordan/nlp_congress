 Madam Speaker, I stand today with the chair of our  Foreign Affairs Committee who just spoke here, Mr. Engel, as he makes a  plea to this House for us to take a look at and get involved with what  is going on in Syria.   Millions of folks are dying. They are being killed with the help of  Assad and Russia. They are killing civilians, millions of civilians.  They are killing the children. And for those who are injured that find  their way to the hospital, it does no good because they turn around and  bomb the hospitals. This is an outrage.   The United States of America cannot afford to turn a blind eye to  this humanitarian crisis. We must get involved. We must pay attention.  The families, the children, the people of Syria deserve better than  this.   I want to thank Mr. Engel for the attention that he is paying to this  issue and the way that he is trying to educate us and get us involved  in saving those poor people who are being overrun, who are being killed  by Assad and, of course, with the help of Russia.                            ____________________
