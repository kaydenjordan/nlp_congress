 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 4566, the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act,  which was introduced by my colleague, Representative Poliquin.    Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans rely on registered funds to invest  and save for their future, and they rely on asset management advisers  to assist them in making major financial decisions, such as paying  college tuition, saving for retirement, or buying a home.   However, too often these advisers have their hands tied complying  with burdensome regulations that were not intended for the type of  financial institutions that they serve. Following the enactment of  Dodd-Frank, a framework was created to assess systemic risk posed by  financial institutions, and this framework looked at the risk from a  bank-centric approach.   In addition, Dodd-Frank required all financial companies with total  consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct various annual  stress tests to comply with the law. Now, unfortunately, this broad  definition sweeps in registered investment companies and requires that  these nonbank institutions be held accountable for the same stress  tests as banks.   This particular stress test does not make sense for the asset  management industry and only adds costs that will end up putting the  burden on investors who rely on these funds.   Again, the U.S. asset management industry is critical in promoting  diverse investment and savings opportunities for individuals, for  families, and for businesses. This important legislation would  eliminate unnecessary costs for nonbank financial institutions that  have not been designated as systemically important by removing Dodd- Frank's bank-centric, mandatory stress test requirement.   As we continue to explore new ways to help families save for their  future or buy a new home, we should remain focused on improving their  ability to invest. I want to thank Representative Poliquin and Chairman  Hensarling for their important work on this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bill.                                time  1500
