 Madam President, today I honor a visionary leader  whose years at the helm of Ingalls Shipbuilding have left a profound  impact on the State of Mississippi and on the national security posture  of the United States. I have had the pleasure of associating with Mr.  Brian Cuccias both personally and professionally over many years.   As president of Ingalls Shipbuilding, Mr. Cuccias led the largest  manufacturing employer in Mississippi. Located near Brian's hometown of  Biloxi, the Pascagoula shipyard sits on 800 acres of land along the  Pascagoula River. With 11,500 employees, Ingalls is the largest  supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants and has built nearly 70  percent of the current fleet of Navy warships.   Mr. Cuccias began his career at Ingalls in 1979. when he joined  Litton Data Systems, which was then a major division of Litton  Industries, then owner of what is today Ingalls Shipyard. He served as  a financial analyst for several Navy programs, including amphibious  assault ships and Spruance and Kidd-class destroyers. Since then, he  has held a number of positions of increasing responsibility, including  assistant to the group vice president of Avondale industries; sector  vice president for material for Northrop Grumman Ship Systems; program  manger and vice president for Northrop Grumman's DDG 1000 program; and  vice president for surface combatants for Northrop Grumman  Shipbuilding.   Mr. Cuccias left his mark on both the shipbuilding industry and Navy  surface combatant programs. Universally recognized for his superb  leadership, business acumen, and commitment to maritime security, his  2014 appointment as president of Ingalls Shipbuilding came as no  surprise to those of us who knew him. During his tenure, Ingalls has  continued to set the standard for shipbuilding excellence, delivering  five national security cutters to the Coast Guard, along with two  America-class amphibious assault ships and two San Antonio-class  amphibious transport docks to the Navy. Additionally, Mr. Cuccias  oversaw the reactivation of the Arleigh Burke-class production line,  delivering four guided missile destroyers to the Navy after a 5-year  hiatus. As he departs, he leaves the shipyard in perhaps its strongest  position ever, with 13 ships in various stages of production.   Mr. Cuccias has left an indelible impact on the Ingalls workforce. He  spearheaded numerous investments in the health and safety of shipyard  employees and their families. In 2015, Ingalls dedicated a Family  Health Center in Gautier, MS a full-service health care facility for  employees, dependents, and retirees covered by the shipyard's health  care plans. As part of a $600 million 4-year upgrade to build the  Shipyard of the Future, he supervised the installation of covered,  environmentally controlled facilities to protect workers from the  elements--again prioritizing the health of the Ingalls workforce.   Always active in his community, Mr. Cuccias served on the executive  committee and board of directors for the Mississippi Gulf Coast  Business Council, as well as on the boards of directors for the  Mississippi Economic Council, the Mississippi Partnership for Economic  Development, the Jackson County Economic Development Foundation, and  the Salvation Army of Mobile, AL. In 2018, he was honored as one of the  Top CEOs in Mississippi by the Mississippi Business Journal.   I want to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to Brian Cuccias  for his outstanding leadership in Mississippi and for his unwavering  support for the missions of the U.S. Navy. As he departs Ingalls for  retirement, I wish him and his family ``fair winds and following  seas.''                            ____________________
