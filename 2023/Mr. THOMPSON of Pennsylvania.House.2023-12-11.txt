 Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to  recognize the A&B Heating and Sheet Metal Company from Warren County.  Originally founded in 1953 by World War II veteran, Carl Papalia, the  family-owned small business continues to provide excellent services to  those in the Warren area for the last 70 years.   Before creating the company, Carl served his company honorably as a  flight engineer on B-24 bombers in the South Pacific.   Carl and his brothers, Ralph and Joe, were first-generation Americans  who together paved the way for the success of the business for more  than 40 years.   Following Carl and Ralph's passing, Carl's son, David, took over the  ownership of the company, leading to substantial growth.   Today, the company has 20 employees specialized to assist customers  in a 60-mile radius. Seventy years later, the company's mission  statement, ``The satisfaction of helping the community is not about  what you do, it is about who you are,'' remains the same.    I am so proud of the A&B Heating and Sheet Metal Company and all the  work that they have done for those in Warren County and across the  Northern Tier.   God bless them.                            ____________________
