 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the rule and  the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic has cost the lives of over 500,000 Americans-- more than all the casualties of World War I, World War II, and the  Vietnam war combined. Millions more have been infected and are  recovering from the virus. Our economy has lost more than 10 million  jobs. Countless businesses have failed or are at risk of failing. So  our job today in Congress is to move quickly to address the physical,  emotional, and financial health of all Americans. We can accomplish all  three of these priorities through passage of the American Rescue Plan.   I want to touch on a few of the provisions included in this package.  First, our State and local governments, firefighters, police,  transportation workers, and healthcare providers have been on the front  lines of the pandemic, supporting their communities by developing  testing capabilities, supporting vulnerable populations, and now  deploying the vaccines as quickly as possible.   I am glad this bill includes $350 billion for State and local  governments all across the country.   We also need to work quickly to extend expiring unemployment  programs, which expire on March 14. We saw what happened when Senator  McConnell paused last year, and Coloradans are still struggling to  receive the benefits they are owed.   This legislation will invest $130 billion to support K-12 schools as  they work to return to in-person learning and help students catch up.  It will also include $40 billion in rental and housing assistance. In  the last month, Colorado has seen a record amount of requests for  rental assistance.   The time for action is now. President Biden is laser focused on  delivering relief to all Americans, and I am proud of his leadership so  we can provide this needed assistance as we vaccinate more people each  day. America needs this, America wants this, and they are going to get  it.
