 Mr. Speaker, we were so close, so close. Some  Republicans were finally willing to work with Democrats on a bipartisan  way forward to give certainty to Dreamers, young people who want to be  able to work and go to school here free from fear. We needed just three  more Republicans to tell their party enough is enough, just three more  Republicans to support our bipartisan effort to hold votes on an array  of proposals and let the most popular one win the day. But sadly, when  the time came, they abandoned that effort. They abandoned the Dreamers.   They caved because the Republican leadership twisted their arms  because the most hateful elements within their party don't want to fix  these problems. They thrive off of them.    They don't want these people who deserve citizenship to get it. We  do.   They don't think families deserve asylum or protection. We do.   They don't think these people deserve a chance at the American Dream.  We do.   The bills we have before us today are a disgrace. They do nothing to  stop the Trump orphan-creating machine, taking children from their  parents and doing nothing to reunite them. And ultimately, they won't  fix any of the problems we have because they won't become law.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are wasting time-- wasting time--while people and children suffer.   The American people won't stand for this. They won't stand for  corrupting the law and twisting the Bible verses to justify splitting  up families. They won't stand for torturing, psychologically torturing,  refugee children. They won't stand for cowardice and callousness. That  is not what America is made of.
