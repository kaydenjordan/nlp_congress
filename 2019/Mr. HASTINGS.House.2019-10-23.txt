 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 650 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 650         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 4617) to amend the Federal Election Campaign       Act of 1971 to clarify the obligation to report acts of       foreign election influence and require implementation of       compliance and reporting systems by Federal campaigns to       detect and report such acts, and for other purposes. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on House       Administration. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu       of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Committee on House Administration now printed in the       bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill       for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-35 modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived. No amendment to that amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed       in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules. Each such       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill       or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in       order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 650, providing for consideration of  H.R. 4617, the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting  Democracy, better known as the SHIELD Act, under a structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by  the Chair and ranking member of the Committee on House Administration.  The rule also executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman Lofgren,  makes in order 14 amendments, and provides one motion to recommit on  the bill.   Madam Speaker, it is going to be interesting to watch my Republican  friends twist pretzel-like today to convince themselves that voting  against a bill that will protect the sanctity of our electoral process  from foreign interference is the right thing to do for the American  people.   Through today's rule, the Democrats bring to the floor a bill that  states that those campaigns that are offered assistance from foreign  actors should be required to report such attempts at assistance.   Sadly, I predict that my Republican friends will vote against such  protections.  [[Page H8399]]    We, as Democrats, say that foreign governments should not be allowed  to buy political advertisements in a clear and ongoing attempt to  spread conspiracy theories and sow discord among the American  electorate.   I predict that for reasons undecipherable, the Republicans will still  vote against today's bill.   In fact, let us pause here for a moment. The use of social media  platforms by maligned actors to undermine our democracy is not only  historical, but is happening today, as we speak. An article that  appeared in yesterday's Washington Post outlines how Russia's  intelligence apparatus through the Internet Research Agency continues  to use Facebook and Facebook's photo-sharing app, Instagram, to sow  discord among the American people.   With alarming precision, they target our vulnerabilities, our fears,  our baser instincts in hopes of tearing asunder the fabric of our  democracy.   As it turns out, past is indeed prologue, and unless we want Facebook  and others to be left to play an ongoing game of whack-a-mole against  Russian, and now apparently Iranian, and potentially other intelligence  agencies, we in Congress need to provide the needed support that any  platform can fully meet the threat posed by these nefarious actors.   Madam Speaker, on this side of the aisle, we say that we should  strengthen the ban against foreign nationals and foreign governments  spending money in our elections, and we have put pen to paper in  today's bill to ensure that we do, indeed, strengthen such a ban.   Again, I predict that many, if not all, of my colleagues across the  aisle will vote against today's bill, and, therefore, against the  notion that foreign governments ought not to be spending money in our  elections.   Today's bill is a direct rebuke of the Trump campaign's sharing of  nonpublic polling information with Russian intelligence in the hopes  that this information would make it to Moscow in order to help with  their beyond well-documented campaign to interfere with the 2016  Presidential election.   Simply put, this bill treats the behavior engaged in by the Trump  campaign as an illegal solicitation of support. Why? Because that is  what it was.   Again, I say to the American people, watch today's vote. I once again  predict that you will see Republicans vote against making such behavior  illegal, and that is sad.   Finally--and this one is personal--today's bill incorporates language  that will punish those who seek to intimidate, misinform, or  maliciously misdirect those who simply wish to exercise that great  American pastime: casting a ballot.   Attempts to dissuade voters from going to the polls, whether through  violence or other means, have been part of this country's history for  far too long.   We now know that in addition to homegrown efforts to keep voters away  from the polls on election day, the Russians also engaged in voter  suppression tactics, including the malicious dissemination of  misinformation in a brazen attempt to sow confusion in the electorate  in 2016. I might add, that three Florida counties had their elections  offices compromised by Russian hackers.   A vote for today's rule is a vote to bring forth a bill that will  work to put an end to these dastardly deeds. Unfortunately, for reasons  unfathomable, Republicans will stand brick-wall-like against such  reform.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would ask my friend Mr. Davis if he  would stand by just a minute. I have a query of him.   Last night in the Rules Committee, our colleague Ed Perlmutter  offered the gentleman an opportunity to come today to ask Mr.  Zuckerberg the questions that he put here. Is the gentleman availing  himself of that opportunity?    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    Madam Speaker, in light of the process questions that  the gentleman asked about hearings, I am proud of our Democratic  majority's record when it comes to regular order.   At the beginning of this Congress, we instituted a rule to require  hearings and markups for bills that come through the Rules Committee,  and we have followed that rule.   In fact, the House Administration Committee, the primary committee of  jurisdiction for this bill, held three hearings to develop the SHIELD  Act. Those three hearings took place on February 14, May 8, and May 21,  and they are clearly listed in the House Administration Committee's  report.   Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, I include in the Record the House  Administration Committee's report.                                  Hearings         For the purposes of section 103(i) of H. Res. 6 of the       116th Congress the following hearings were used to develop or       consider H.R. 2722:        (1) On Wednesday, May 8, 2019 the Committee held a hearing       titled ``Election Security.'' The following witnesses       testified: Mr. Larry Norden, Brennan Center for Justice; Ms.       Marian Schneider, Verified Voting; Mr. Joseph Lorenzo Hall,       Center for Democracy and Technology; The Honorable Jocelyn       Benson, Secretary of State, State of Michigan; and The       Honorable John Merrill, Secretary of State, State of Alabama.        (2) On Tuesday, May 21, 2019, the Committee held a hearing       titled ``Oversight of the Election Assistance Commission.''       The following witnesses testified: The Honorable Christy       McCormick, Commissioner and Chairwoman, Election Assistance       Commission, accompanied by The Honorable Benjamin Hovland,       Commissioner and Vice Chair, Election Assistance Commission;       The Honorable Don Palmer, Commissioner, Election Assistance       Commission; and The Honorable Thomas Hicks, Commissioner,       Election Assistance Commission.        (3) On Thursday, February 14, 2019, the Committee held a       hearing titled ``For the People: Our American Democracy.''       The following witnesses testified: Mr. Chiraag Bains,       Director of Legal Strategies, Demos; Ms. Wendy Weiser,       Director, Democracy Program, Brennan Center for Justice at       NYU School of Law; Mr. Fred Wertheimer, President, Democracy       21; The Honorable Kim  [[Page H8401]]       Wyman, Secretary of State, State of Washington; Mr. Alejandro       Rangel-Lopez, Senior at Dodge City High School, Dodge City       Kansas, and plaintiff in LULAC & Rangel-Lopez v. Cox; Mr.       Peter Earle, Wisconsin Civil Rights Trial Lawyer; Mr. Brandon       A. Jessup, Data Science and Information Systems Professional;       Executive Director, Michigan Forward; and David Keating,       President, Institute for Free Speech.                          Committee Consideration         On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, the Committee met in open       session and ordered the bill H.R. 4617 favorably reported       with an amendment to the House, by a roll call vote of 6 to       1, a quorum being present. During consideration of the bill       an amendment (Amendment No. 5) was offered by Mr. Davis of       Illinois and was agreed to by voice vote:        An amendment (No. 5) offered by Mr. Davis of Illinois to       amend section 201(b) of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute to insert ``labor organization'' after ``a       corporation'' and after ``the corporation'' each place that       it appears.     In addition to those three hearings, the House  Administration Committee held eight other election-related hearings  this year.   I also want to point out that while it isn't the primary committee of  jurisdiction for this bill, the Judiciary Committee held two hearings  on election security.   The House Administration Committee also held a markup on H.R. 4617.  Several amendments were offered, including an amendment by the  gentleman who just spoke, my friend, Ranking Member Davis, that was  adopted by the committee.   This is how the process is supposed to work, Mr. Speaker, and I am  hopeful that that will help clarify some aspects of what was brought up  about process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, through you, I would advise my friend  that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close if he is.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H8403]]    Madam Speaker, very briefly, the last three speakers, including my  good friend from Oklahoma, have mentioned the ongoing impeachment  inquiry here in the House of Representatives, and they speak of it as  being a lack of transparency. It is almost as if the Republicans are  not in the hearings that are going on in this inquiry.   In my understanding, although I am not a member of either of the  committees of jurisdiction, I have spoken with and have heard publicly  the person who is the responsible person for ongoing matters at this  time say that the other side is there. Their lawyers are asking  questions. Members, if they choose, are asking questions.   So I don't understand what they are talking about about a lack of  transparency, particularly when the previous impeachments that were  done were done by special prosecutors. This is a solemn process.   And while I agree with my colleagues about the National Defense  Authorization measure, the simple fact of the matter is that we also  have a constitutional responsibility to ensure that the executive  branch of this government functions in an appropriate manner and does  not do as they are doing: failing to respond to the oversight  responsibilities of the Article I House of Representatives.   I rather suspect that that is just talk when they say that there is  no transparency. I suggest to them to stick around. They are going to  see some transparency real soon.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I do agree with my good friend from Oklahoma that our  exchanges are civil; and although we have respectable disagreement, the  simple fact of the matter is that each of us discharges our  responsibilities in a responsible way.   Madam Speaker, after exiting the Constitutional Convention in 1787,  Benjamin Franklin, when approached, was asked what form of government  had been agreed upon; his response: ``A Republic, if you can keep it.''   We come here today to keep it, to not only keep it, but make more  perfect that Union which we have all taken an oath to protect, not just  for us and our children, but for generations unborn, so that they may  know and benefit from the greatest experiment ever known to humankind,  the democratic Republic we call the United States of America.   To do this, to protect our democracy from enemies foreign and  domestic, we must put country over party. Indeed, there have been more  than a few times in our history when it was imperative that the  partisan give way to the patriotic. This is undoubtedly one of those  times and one of those paramount issues.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote  on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 650         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution, the Committees on       the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Financial Services, Oversight       and Reform, and Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence shall suspend pursuing matters       referred to by the Speaker in her announcement of September       24, 2019, until such time as the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 and the Department of       Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2020 are signed       into law.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
