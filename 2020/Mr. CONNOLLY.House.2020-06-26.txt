 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Eleanor Holmes  Norton, who is managing today's bill to right a wrong, but  unfortunately, because D.C. does not have a vote here in the Congress,  she won't be able to cast a vote on final passage of her own bill.  [[Page H2534]]    Today, we are being asked to right a wrong. And you hear the  contortions on the other side of the aisle to continue to justify a  fundamental right being denied 700,000 fellow Americans who pay taxes,  who fight in our wars and serve in government, who have families, who  are Americans, but have no votes in the United States Congress. They  are bigger than five States.   They hide behind the Constitution. The Constitution was written  before they even knew where the capital of the United States would be,  before a blade of grass was touched to construct Washington, D.C. No  one at that time could have envisioned the metropolis of 700,000  Americans, let alone that they would be denied their fundamental  American right.   Let's cede it to Maryland. Two problems: Maryland doesn't want D.C.  and D.C. doesn't want to be in Maryland. The consent of the governed is  a fundamental part of the American architecture, which you conveniently  overlook.   And then there is the right to be represented, another fundamental  right denied D.C.   Mr. Speaker, it is partisan politics, yes. It is theirs. They want to  deny 700,000 people their right to representation in this body and in  the other body because of their politics, or likely politics.   When have we ever done that as America? We haven't looked at how  people would vote before we decide to incorporate them into the Union  as a State. We understood the right of people to petition to become a  State, and Congress has that power.   Let's right a wrong, especially in the post-George Floyd world, and  give people their rightful representation in the people's body and in  the Senate.
