 Madam Chair, I am honored today to recognize the 40th  anniversary of the National Intelligence Council. This is an amazing  organization that has provided invaluable contributions to the security  of the United States.   On December 3, 1979, the NIC was created to serve as a source of  extensive expertise on intelligence issues, facilitate collaboration,  conduct outreach to other experts beyond government, and to connect  intelligence and policy communities through a wide variety of  intelligence products.   The work the NIC does is important. It really does matter. These  products include the National Intelligence Estimate, the annual threat  assessment in the form of Statements for the Record, the unclassified  Global Trends report, and including oral remarks that the Director of  National Intelligence gives to us as Members of Congress.   The NIC's 18 intelligence officers serve as the primary advisers to  the intelligence leader, and their expertise and advice is greatly  appreciated and greatly respected.   As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am grateful for  them and for their 40 years of dedicated service and protecting the  American people.                            ____________________
