 Madam Speaker, I represent a working-class  district in Chicago, and my community has been especially hard-hit by  the pandemic.   I have one of the largest percentages of school-age children in my  district, and my neighbors are worried about putting food on the table.  I have seen the lines at food banks grow and grow.   But the expanded child tax credit in the American Rescue Plan changes  that. Nearly 90 percent of the children in my district will benefit.  And more than 40,000 households will get an average of $3,300, parents  like Jaime in Logan Square, who will finally be able to send his son to  college this year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  thanks to this tax credit.   This program is about helping their children thrive, and in my  community, it is already working.                            ____________________
