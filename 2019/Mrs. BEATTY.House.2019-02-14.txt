 Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honor for me to rise today  during Black History Month to pay tribute to Mr. Clarence Lumpkin, or  as many people called him, the Mayor of Linden, in my Congressional  District. He passed away on January 28.   For almost 30 years, I had the opportunity and honor to work with  him. He was a dedicated community leader who fought relentlessly for  affordable housing and healthcare as well as meaningful employment, not  to mention a mentor to those countless individuals and leaders in our  community.   He leaves a legacy of true service, and his funeral procession told  the story. The procession traveled past places he had a hand in  creating or saving, like the library on Cleveland Avenue, the Columbus  Fire Station 18, St. Stephen's Community House, and Linden-McKinley  STEM Academy.   So although we mourn his passing, we can find comfort in the fact  that his life, his legacy, and his work will live on for generations to  come. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife of 72 years, Willa, his  three children, six grandchildren, friends, and the entire Linden  neighborhood.                            ____________________
