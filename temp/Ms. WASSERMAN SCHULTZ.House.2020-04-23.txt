 Madam Speaker, healthcare workers and small  businesses are struggling to stay alive. That is why Democrats fought  to ensure hospitals and Main Street get this jolt of relief.   We walled off billions in new Paycheck Protection Program funds for  smaller community banks and credit unions so Wall Street doesn't vacuum  it all up.   Let's face it: If healthcare workers cannot safely protect us,  America's economy stops. So Democrats secured $75 billion for  healthcare providers and $25 billion more for testing. Without mass  testing, we can not fully reopen, and we end up voting for endless  relief packages.   Without Democrats' push for truly small businesses, big business  would have continued to cut the line.    We will rescue schools and local governments in CARES Act 2. Right  now, this is the adrenaline shot that the healthcare system needs.
