 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the final  version of the Honoring our PACT Act, which will uphold our obligation  to ensure that veterans receive the world-class healthcare they  deserve.    As a Member of Congress and a member of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, we have a responsibility to support all veterans when they  return home from protecting our freedoms and defending our democracy.   As I walked the parade routes of the Fourth of July and visited the  veterans service organizations, it is not enough to simply say ``thank  you for your service'' to our veterans. It is through our actions that  we provide proof we have our veterans' backs and value their service.   Ultimately, veterans living with toxic exposures must not be denied  the care and benefits they have earned.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this  measure. Again, I thank Chairman Takano, all the Members, and all of my  colleagues on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for their  leadership to finalize this critical legislation to have our veterans'  backs.
