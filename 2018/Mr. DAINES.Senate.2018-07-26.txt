 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Sherry Fugere of Daniels County for her contribution to the  Scobey community through her work at the Daniels County Fair.   Raised in Scobey, Sherry graduated from Scobey High School. After  graduation, she attended Miles Community College and finished her  degree at Northern Montana College in Havre. Following college, Sherry  moved back home to Scobey where she has dedicated her time to the  community serving as the Secretary of the Daniels County Fair  Association, where her contributions have made the event a huge  success.   Over the past 15 years, Sherry has gone above and beyond to ensure  the success of the Daniels County Fair which has brought families and  community together, and will be cherished for generations to come.   I congratulate Sherry on her significant role to Daniels County and  the Daniels County Fair. I look forward to seeing that success continue  to grow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
