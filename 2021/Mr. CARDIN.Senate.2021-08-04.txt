 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of amendment  No. 2478, which would make permanent and expand the Minority Business  Development Agency, or the MBDA, which is the only Federal Agency to  focus exclusively on the needs of minority businesses.   This amendment is based on the Minority Business Resiliency Act,  which I introduced in April, and the language is identical to what was  passed out of the Commerce Committee earlier today by a voice vote.   I want to thank Senator Wicker and Senator Cantwell of the committee  for their help in getting this to the floor. I also want to thank  Senator Tim Scott, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Baldwin, who were also  cosponsors of this amendment, for helping us reach this moment.   This amendment will give the Agency the resources and leadership  necessary to help underserved entrepreneurs overcome historical  barriers to small business ownership, innovate and start and grow  successful businesses, and create jobs.   This Agency will also partner with Historically Black Colleges and  Universities and other minority-serving institutions to reach rural  minority business enterprises and create a regional network supporting  entrepreneurial education and help to coordinate Federal resources in  service of minority business enterprises.   Last year, the MBDA programs and services helped minority businesses  secure nearly $8 billion in contracts and capital, and created nearly  12,000 jobs.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a letter from 17 stakeholders in support of this amendment,  which includes the Small Business Majority, U.S. Black Chamber, and  U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     August 4, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       We write you in strong support of Amendment #2478, which       would codify the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA)       at the Department of Commerce. As the leaders in the small       business and minority business communities, we hope our       unified support represented by the signatures below will urge       your fellow Senators to include this language in the       Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. We urge you to       support this Amendment.        The link between infrastructure, revitalized manufacturing,       and technical assistance to the minority entrepreneur       community cannot be overstated, and we strongly encourage       building a strong national support system through MBDA to       ensure minority participation in infrastructure investment.        This amendment, which is based on the bipartisan Minority       Business Development Act of 2021, will support the expansion       of Minority-owned Business Enterprises (MBEs) and bolster the       country's economy. Moreover, it will ensure that the       infrastructure investments made in the legislation can       utilize and support America's minority-owned businesses.        Prior to the Coronavirus pandemic, MBEs consisted of 30       percent of the country's 28.6 million small businesses,       contributed nearly $1.5 trillion in annual gross receipts and       employed over 7.2 million Americans. Despite these       significant figures, MBEs stand disproportionately       disadvantaged as evidenced by challenges with access to       capital and collateral, lower credit scores, and less access       to technical assistance services.        Created under President Nixon by executive order, the MBDA       has been a significant resource in reducing market and       capital access challenges while growing the number of MBEs.       In 2020 alone, the MBDA assisted MBES in attaining over $7.8       billion in contracts and capital, with 10% of contracts made       in the manufacturing sector and another 15% made in the       utility and construction sector. Overall, the MBDA assisted       MBEs at the height of the pandemic to retain or create over       27,000 jobs.        Despite MBDA's progress, the pandemic's economic downturn       has amplified the need to invest in services for underserved       and minority small business owners--particularly those within       Women, People of Color, and Tribal markets. MBEs       overwhelmingly are concentrated in industries that remain       susceptible to economic disruption, such as personal and       laundry services, and retail. As the nation experiences a       resurgence of Coronavirus cases, these fragile markets face       near-fatal consequences.        We urge lawmakers to support this amendment as it will       strengthen and establish the MBDA into federal statute. This       critical bipartisan proposal, introduced by Senators  [[Page S5814]]       Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tim Scott, (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS),       and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) would increase MBDA's fiscal year       2021 budget to further safeguard MBEs from the devastating       inequities brought on by the health crisis and promote a       diverse entrepreneurial pipeline by establishing a process       for the Minority Business Development Center Program to       expand its regional coverage to reach MBEs in rural areas.        During this time of economic emergency, we believe now is       the time for Congress to pass equitable and targeted       legislation that will benefit underserved and rural markets       and encourage underserved and rural markets enterprise       formation. This amendment achieves that while strengthening       the infrastructure package more broadly.        We commend your work on ensuring that all small businesses       receive the resources necessary to withstand the current       economic downturn, as well as grow now and into the future.       We urge you to reach out directly to John Stanford       ([emailÂ protected]) with any questions or comments.        Thank you for your consideration.

Madam President, I understand that we may be able to do  this by a voice vote, so I would ask unanimous consent that after my  colleagues have had a chance to speak, we can vitiate the 60-vote  requirement.   With that, I yield to my colleague from Mississippi.    We have cleared this with both the Democrats and the  Republicans for managing the bill, and I would ask unanimous consent to  vitiate the 60-vote requirement on the Cardin-Wicker amendment No.  2478.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  extraordinary career of Susan Erlichman, Esquire, the executive  director of the Maryland Legal Services Corporation, on the eve of her  retirement after 32 years of remarkable public service. Susan is a  devoted public servant and tireless advocate for civil legal services  for those who need them most in the State of Maryland.   The Maryland Legal Services Corporation--MLSC--is the state's largest  funder of civil legal aid. Its mission, as established by the Maryland  General Assembly, is ensuring that low-income Marylanders have access  to reliable, productive, and worthwhile civil legal assistance by  distributing and overseeing grants to nonprofits statewide. Since its  creation in 1982, MLSC has distributed grants totaling over $312  million. In turn, grantees have assisted Marylanders in more than 3.5  million legal matters, ranging from family to housing to employment to  healthcare cases, in which they would otherwise have been hard-pressed  to access legal aid.   Susan Erlichman's career with the MLSC spanned an incredible 32  years, including 17 as the organization's executive director. During  her tenure in that position, Susan oversaw the tripling of MLSC's  annual budget, from $6 million to $20 million. She also helped to found  a robust working relationship between the Administrative Office of the  Courts and MLSC that significantly expanded Maryland's Judicare Family  Law program and the number of residents it serves. Perhaps one of her  greatest accomplishments, however, was pioneering an innovative program  to remove barriers to employment in Maryland by placing civil legal aid  lawyers in projects aimed at the fostering of more productive and  prosperous workforces.   From the 2008 recession to our current-day COVID-19 pandemic, Susan's  drive, tenacity, and compassion has been an invaluable asset to our  state. Through the projects I have mentioned and the countless others  that she has led, Susan has utilized her institutional insight and  diplomatic skills to bring together a wide coalition of allies to  support and strengthen civil legal services. Susan has been an  incredible leader to MLSC staff, even during the hardest of times.   Access to justice is a significant, growing challenge in Maryland and  nationwide that has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In  most cases, low-income Americans receive inadequate or no legal help  due to lack of available resources, even though they are eligible and  entitled to this legal assistance. During the pandemic, the Legal  Services Corporation--LSC--reported that 94 percent of grantees  surveyed said they were providing services to clients who were newly  eligible for legal aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. I credit Susan and  the excellent work of MLSC with making it as easy as possible for me to  advocate for Federal funding. Her work and that of her peers nationwide  has generated bipartisan support in Congress that was significant  enough to turn back an effort to disband the agency entirely in the  last administration. There is no doubt that Susan's leadership has  allowed MLSC to endure as a beacon of hope in the face of the surge in  demand since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The MLSC is an organization near and dear to my heart. From August  1988 through June 1995, I was privileged to serve as its chair.  Previously, I chaired a task force that produced an Action Plan for  Legal Services to Maryland's Poor in January of 1988. Many  recommendations from the action plan, such as conversion of the  Interest on Lawyer Trust Account--IOLTA--program from voluntary to  mandatory, were ultimately adopted. I enjoyed working with Susan, who  coincidentally joined the organization in 1988, to implement the action  plan and make other improvements. Although I moved on from MLSC a few  years later, I was happy to know the organization was in such good  hands. I am also confident that Susan's successor, Deb Seltzer, will  continue Susan's legacy and make great progress towards achieving the  mission of the MLSC.   In announcing Susan's retirement, MLSC board chair Natalie McSherry  had this to say: ``Susan Erlichman is a giant among all leaders of  IOLTA and other funding entities for civil legal services. We have been  incredibly blessed to have had the benefit of her leadership for so  many years.'' It is clear that Susan's impact on the Maryland Legal  Services Corporation, and the State of Maryland for that matter, will  be felt for years to come. For that, I sincerely thank her for her  service to our State's citizens and wish her a happy and well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
