 Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Restoring  Community Oversight of Sober Living Homes Act of 2018. This bill  addresses Federal policies that have resulted in the proliferation of  sober living homes in residential neighborhoods.   These so-called homes, which are really businesses in all but name,  house drug and alcohol addicts in single-family residences. This  infusion of drug addicts and alcoholics into residential communities  has had a deleterious impact on the quality of life of local families  who now suffer increases in police activity, transient residences next  door, and a decline of property values.   Federal law has shielded unscrupulous owners, operators, and  inhabitants of these so-called sober living homes from meaningful  oversight. The well-being of the neighbors that surround them has been  ignored. This is a travesty.   My bill will empower the communities and the States to prohibit such  facilities in residential areas if that is the will of the local  people. I now submit this legislation and ask my colleagues to  cosponsor the bill, which is based on the principle of federalism,  protecting local residential communities across our land.                            ____________________
