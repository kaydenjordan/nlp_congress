 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  for her work on this small business bill. I also thank Chairmen Smith  and Chabot and Ranking Members Johnson and Velazquez for including my  amendment to benefit minority-serving institutions in H.R. 2763. This  is essential to retaining American leadership in innovation and small  business development.   The SBIR and STTR programs were both created to expand small business  participation in the Federal research mission. One of the four  objectives Congress had in mind in establishing the SBIR was to  facilitate and increase the participation of minority and disadvantaged  persons in technological innovation.   My amendment requires that the participating Federal agencies in the  SBIR and STTR programs conduct outreach to minority-serving  institutions--MSIs--and Hispanic-serving institutions and faculty  conducting research at these institutions so that participation rates  in Federal research and development opportunities will increase.   There are many great MSIs and researchers who work at these  institutions across the country. For example, California State  University Stanislaus, which has a campus in my district, is a  Hispanic-serving institution and an MSI, and has been ranked one of the  best colleges in our Nation. Our country depends on innovation of MSIs  and the intellectual capital of its graduates.   In the 21st century, American economic growth is going to be  determined by the innovation and growth of technology and STEM-focused  businesses. It is critical to the growth of our economy that minority- serving institutions and minority-owned businesses are connected to  this technological ecosystem.
