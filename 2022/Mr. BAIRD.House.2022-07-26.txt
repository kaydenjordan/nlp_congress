 Madam Speaker, today I rise to address an issue plaguing  my constituents, my fellow Hoosiers, and Americans across the country:  catalytic converter thefts.  [[Page H7080]]    From the outside looking in, catalytic converter theft may seem like  a small problem, but law enforcement, auto dealers, and the growing  number of victims of these crimes will tell you otherwise. In  communities across the country, thieves are targeting families,  schools, and businesses, disrupting transportation plans and leading  drivers to shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars in repair  costs.   For those of you who are unfamiliar with catalytic converters, this  auto part is required to reduce the potency of toxic emissions from  internal combustion engines and is usually made up of precious metals  like platinum, rhodium, and palladium, which can be sold to scrap  dealers for hundreds of dollars on the black market. The value of these  materials, combined with a thief's ability to remove them from a car in  a matter of seconds, makes them a prime target for criminals looking to  earn cash with little risk.   My bill takes a multipronged approach to tackling this epidemic and  by including traceable identifying features on catalytic converters,  addressing how parts are purchased, and strengthening enforceability of  catalytic converter thefts. By creating a system where law enforcement  can link stolen catalytic converters from their vehicles of origin,  prohibit the purchase of disassembled catalytic converters, and codify  catalytic converter thefts as criminal offenses with criminal  penalties, it is my great hope that we can curb these costly thefts.   I am deeply concerned about the costly impacts that these thefts have  on Americans, especially at a time when American workers are taking  home less and families are paying more for everything thanks to soaring  inflation rates. I recognize the strain this has put on so many victims  of this crime, and I want to do all I can to empower law enforcement so  we can address this problem.   Americans have enough to worry about. Spending their hard-earned  paycheck to replace stolen car parts shouldn't be one of them.                                time  1245    I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have joined me  in this effort to empower law enforcement and deter future theft by  joining the PART Act. I believe that this widely bipartisan issue can  be an easy win for Congress by offering a straightforward and impactful  solution for law enforcement struggling to address these rampant crimes  across the country. I hope you will join me in putting an end to this  issue by supporting H.R. 6394, the PART Act.               Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about H.R. 3588. This  is an important piece of legislation that I was proud to introduce with  my friend from Pennsylvania, Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan.   The Mathematical and Statistical Modeling Education Act provides a  much-needed solution to improving the quality of STEM education in  America. This legislation advances mathematical instruction by  incorporating modern tools and context, including data, statistics, and  computation.   Mathematical modeling is currently taught on a limited basis yet is  the foundation for the important work our Nation is addressing within  research, development, and technological innovation.   In addition to being both a bipartisan and a bicameral piece of  legislation, this bill has the support of several organizations,  including the American Mathematical Society, and the Society for  Industrial and Applied Mathematics; and I am proud to lead this effort  in providing for the security of America's global competitive edge.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.                            ____________________
