 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the crisis at our  southern border and to call for this body to immediately take up the  Border Security Act of America that will restore order; that will  enhance technology; and that will give our Customs and Border  Protection agents the tools that they are begging for.   A year ago last March, I actually went where the President and our  Vice President refuse to go: to the southern border, Rio Grande. And if  you talk to the CBP agents there, they will tell you exactly what is  going on.   We are seeing our southern border overrun by the drug cartels. We are  seeing human trafficking take place. We are seeing and hearing from  children who are being abused along the journey, and the amount of  fentanyl and other drugs that are streaming over our border and killing  Americans is at record levels. It could be stopped today, but this  administration and this Congress refuse to do it.   The issue of public safety and national security is one we just  discussed last week, September 11; we said we will never forget. But  yet, here we have policies in place that make us less safe and could  potentially cause something catastrophic to happen.   We need to be wise. We need to be reasonable. We are a nation of  immigrants. We are a compassionate nation. My mother is a Cuban  refugee. My father is a Greek immigrant.   It is not about that. It is about having order. It is about having  laws. It is about having policies in place and making sure that they  are being followed.   We know that 66 suspected terrorists were apprehended attempting to  cross  [[Page H7975]]  our border. We also know that, at a time like this, we face threats  from Russia and from China, and Iran straight out said that they plan  attacks on United States soil.   And yet, with 3.2 million people crossing into our country illegally  and 500,000 gotaways from over 60 different countries, we run a risk of  being in danger. Think about that, that is almost four times the  population of the President's home State of Delaware.   Now it is also having a financial impact on our constituents. It is  now costing American taxpayers $20 billion a year, something completely  unsustainable as U.S. debt approaches $31 trillion.   Americans are struggling right now to get by. They are trying to keep  roofs over their own heads. They are trying to pay their utility bills.  They are trying to put food on the table for their children, and now  the majority wants them to pick up this additional cost for this  unsustainable policy.   My own mayor is saying that it is having an impact on New York City  and that it is at a breaking point. He is complaining about the  Governors who are busing individuals to New York City, but he hasn't  said a peep about the President who was flying them in over the last 2  years.   The bottom line is, if my mayor or anyone else has an issue with what  is happening in their cities, they need to hold the President  accountable and this Congress accountable to make sure that we pass the  laws that make sense.   We need to bring up the Border Security for America Act before we  leave next week. If not, we are doing a great disservice to the people  of this country. We are continuing to increase our debt. We are  continuing to make our cities less safe, and we are continuing to put  our Nation at risk in the future.                            ____________________
