 Mr. Chairman, we have a serious case of legislative  amnesia here. Apparently, the sponsors of this bill and those who are  speaking in support of it have totally forgotten what we did last year.  The WIIN Act last year addressed every single problem that has been  presented here this afternoon: new reservoirs, four were authorized in  the WIIN Act, which became law less than a year ago--7 months, to be  exact; all of the issues of the outflows of water to the delta were  addressed so that additional export of water from the delta could  occur.   I am wondering: What are we doing here with this piece of  legislation, aside from totally eviscerating the protections for the  largest estuary on the West Coast, of the Western Hemisphere? The  environmental protections are eviscerated.   What are we doing with this legislation besides--oh, you wanted to  talk about private water rights? Those private water rights are set in  place by the laws of the State of California, which are overridden by  this piece of legislation.   Yes, that is true. This legislation removes the water rights that the  State of California has given to individuals as well as irrigation  districts, but they are stripped away.   What is this all about?   Last year, a 2-year effort was completed and the WIIN Act was passed  by this Congress, signed into law. It is in existence. Reservoirs can  be built. Water conservation will take place. All of the things that we  need to do are in place today.   So why are we fighting this fight? Because we don't know how to stop  fighting? Because we don't know how to actually implement a law that we  passed last year?   And, by the way, where is the funding for all you want to do here?  There is no money in this. You want to do these things. You want water;  you want reservoirs--put up the money. Don't just sit here and  regurgitate what we have done for the last 5 years and totally ignore  the progress that was made with the WIIN legislation.   We ought not do this. I am opposed to this, and, hopefully, we will  find some sensible action.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following       new section:       SEC. 1673. IMPROVEMENT TO ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PLAN FOR THE                     NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE, NUCLEAR WEAPONS                     COMPLEX, NUCLEAR WEAPONS DELIVERY SYSTEMS, AND                     NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM.         Subsection (a)(2) of section 1043 of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81;       125 Stat. 1576), as most recently amended by section 1643 of       the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291;       128 Stat. 3650), is further amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (F) and (G) as       subparagraphs (G) and (H), respectively;        (2) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following new       subparagraph (F):        ``(F) A detailed description of the plan, as applicable, to       sustain, life-extend, modernize, or replace the nuclear       weapons and bombs in the nuclear weapons stockpile.''; and        (3) in subparagraph (G), as redesignated by paragraph (1)--        (A) by striking ``subparagraphs (A) through (E)'' and       inserting ``subparagraphs (A) through (F)'';        (B) by striking ``10-year'' and inserting ``25-year'';        (C) by striking ``military construction,'' and inserting       ``construction''; and        (D) by inserting ``and the Department of Energy'' before       the period at the end.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, every year Congress receives a very  important and very helpful report regarding our nuclear weapons  enterprise. It is sometimes referred to as the 1043 Report because it  is mandated by section 1043 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012.   It requires the Department of Defense, in cooperation with the  Department of Energy, to submit a detailed 10-year plan and budget  estimate for our nuclear weapons enterprise, that is, the bombs, the  weapons themselves, the command and control, the national lab  infrastructure, the delivery systems, et cetera, et cetera. That report  is then reviewed by the Government Accountability Office for  completeness and accuracy. Finally, the Congressional Budget Office  then reviews it and submits an independent report.   Terrific, all good, we all agree that it is a good thing. I know that  the chairman of the subcommittee wanted that to happen, and indeed we  do have it.   This amendment simply deals with the reality that this is not a 10- year program. This is a program that will go on for at least the next  25, probably the next 30 years, with extraordinary costs that actually  occur beyond the 10-year time horizon. Therefore, it is important that  the United States, as we get into this long-term effort to recapitalize  our entire nuclear arsenal, that we encounter today and take into  account today the most expensive years that will occur beyond the 10- year horizon.   This amendment that I am proposing simply requires that the  Department of Defense and the Department of Energy consider a 25-year  time horizon for the 1043 Report. We really do need to know, and, in  fact, we have some of that information today.   The Department of Energy, that is in the National Nuclear Security  Administration, does do a 25-year report, and they apparently think it  is accurate enough to present to the committees here. The Department of  Defense provides the equipment, the means for delivering the bombs,  that is the submarines, the various ballistic and intercontinental  ballistic missiles, the ground-based ballistic missiles, the new  bombers, and, quite possibly, new long-range strike LRSO.   So let's find out. Let's consider that. The reason we need to  consider it is that it is a pile of money, well over $1 trillion that  we will be spending in the next 25 years. This is not just my words but  if one were to consider the people who deal with this on a regular  basis; for example, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics, Mr. Kendall, on April 14, 2015, said that we  have a problem with recapitalizing the strategic deterrent. We do have  a huge affordability problem with that basket of systems. So it is a  problem that we are going to have to face up to.   Well, who is we? We is us. We are going to have to figure out how to  pay for all this, and we are going to have to make some tough choices.  So this is simply a matter of trying to figure out how we can get  detailed information.   I know that our esteemed chairman for whom I have tremendous regard  has a little different view, and when he picks up his amendment, I will  speak to that.   In the meantime, I would ask everybody to support this wise amendment  so that we actually have good information upon which to make some  decisions today that will then be paid for in the next 15 to 25 years.  That is what this amendment is.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have  remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have  remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment. I have  great esteem for the chairman, but I really don't think we ought to be  mushrooms. I don't think we ought to be kept in the dark. We really are  in the process here of making decisions today to spend a vast amount of  money not just in the next 10 years--and we do have estimates of what  that would cost--but in the out-years.   Those out-years, we know from information that has been delivered to  us, that it will be a bow wave--to use the military term--of  extraordinary dollars, well into the hundreds of billions of dollars  that would be spent in the out-years beyond the 10 years.   We need to know today because that will bite into the money that we  have available for all of the other things that we must do for our  national defense.   Mr. Chairman, I would ask for an ``aye'' vote on this commonsense  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5734]]         Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                  Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Blumenauer    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13  printed in part B of House Report 115-212.
