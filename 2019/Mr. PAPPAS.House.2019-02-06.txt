 Madam Speaker, yesterday, I welcomed a transgender  veteran from New Hampshire named Tavion as my guest to the State of the  Union. I am proud to say that he was warmly received here in the  people's House.   Tavion didn't give a big speech last night but he still delivered a  powerful message. His story and exemplary service stand as a direct  rebuttal to the false claims and flimsy logic used to justify the Trump  administration's ban on transgender military service.   By politicizing our military and marginalizing patriot  servicemembers, this unjust policy is weakening America's Armed Forces.  Any American who is prepared to risk life and limb in defense of our  Nation deserves our undying respect.   In spite of our political differences, my sincere hope is that  members of both parties can come together to support our men and women  in uniform, regardless of gender identity.   Madam Speaker, the American people sent us to Washington to stand up  for our constituents and our values. We can live up to that  responsibility by reversing the transgender military service ban and  honoring brave trans vets like Tavion.                            ____________________
