 Mr. Chairman, North Carolina's Seventh Congressional  District is fortunate to have some of the most beautiful beaches and  waterways in the United States, which are major contributors to our  State's vibrant tourism industry, attracting more than 50 million  visitors a year and generating more than $22.9 billion in revenue. This  Water Resources and Development Act is critical to strengthening our  country's infrastructure projects, all of which are so critical to the  Nation's economy.   In the district I represent, Carolina Beach's Coastal Storm Damage  Reduction project reached the end of its 50-year authorization in 2014.  While the Army Corps of Engineers works to complete their study to  determine future authorization of this project, this bill provides for  continued authorization in the interim and long-term certainty of  nourishment should the Corps study be favorable and funding available.   Our ports, beaches, inlets, and waterways are the lifeline of  economic activity and job growth for our coastal communities, and they  are incredibly important for the Nation as a whole.   I thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio and the rest of my  colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for  putting forth a strong bill that addresses the unique coastal needs of  North Carolina's Seventh District and makes great improvements to  current law enabling critical projects to move forward while saving  taxpayer dollars in multiple ways. A job well done.   I urge everyone's support.
