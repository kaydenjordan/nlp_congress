 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, obviously, the news that is dominating  Washington, DC, and indeed the Nation is the shutdown.   Yesterday, I joined in a colloquy with other colleagues, both  Democrats and Republicans, asking that we find some middle way. The  President clearly has moved. He has offered to reopen the government, I  am told, if only a downpayment will be made to construct the wall, and  has come forward with a good-faith effort. Ms. Pelosi--I would ask that  she, as the Speaker, who seems to be the chief negotiating partner, do  the same.   I myself have two pieces of legislation that I will be offering today  or Monday that will ease the burden on those Federal workers who are  still working and not getting paid--and we thank them so much for doing  so--as well as come up with an alternative way to perhaps fund the  wall.                         NFC Championship Controversy    Mr. President, with the seriousness of that, I also want to address  one other issue that is particularly serious to folks in Louisiana. I  hope it doesn't seem out of place with the shutdown, but I can state  that to the folks back home, it is something that continues to disturb  them.   I would like to bring up the NFC championship game. The State of  Louisiana is outraged because of what happened in the Superdome last  Sunday. Televisions were broken, Super Bowl boycott concerts scheduled,  billboards were put up in Atlanta, and fans filed lawsuits. My  colleague in the House of Representatives is calling for the NFL  commissioner, Roger Goodell, to testify in front of Congress on the  travesty that occurred 5 days ago.   What happened, in my belief and the belief of many, was the most  blatant and consequential blown call in NFL history. For those who  missed it, on Sunday night during an NFC championship game, the score  was tied with less than 2 minutes to go. It is third and long, and the  Saints are in position to score. Drew Brees throws a pass, which is  right there. There is the ball, there is the receiver, and there is the  defender.   For those not familiar with football--and I know the Presiding  Officer played at the University of Arkansas; not a bad school, even  though it is not a Louisiana school--the defender is not looking back  at the quarterback. He is not looking to intercept. He is only looking  to plow through the receiver.   Every drunk sitting on a stool in every bar throughout the Nation  looked up at that TV and said: There is interference.   What you don't see from this picture I am showing, though, is there  is also helmet-to-helmet contact, which is also a penalty.   It was a twofer. On one play, the Los Angeles Rams defender committed  two egregious penalties, and everybody in the Superdome and everybody  watching knew it happened--except for him, the referee.   I don't mean to pick on this referee. I am sure he is a nice man, a  good family man, et cetera. But he missed a call with less than 2  minutes that everyone agrees would have changed the course of the game.  The Saints would have had a first down automatically, they would have  drained the clock, they would have then kicked a field goal, and the  game would have been over.   LeBron James, Dez Bryant, Melvin Gordon, Richard Sherman, J.J. Watt,  and even Hulk Hogan took to Twitter to call out this absurd call.   The defender said: I interfered with him.   He admitted it.   I thought I was going to get called, but I didn't.   The pass interference was not called, and now the Rams will play in  the Super Bowl against the Patriots instead of the Saints, which is  kind of a shame. It really is a taint upon the Super Bowl. It won't be  the two best teams; it will be the two teams that got there, at least  in one case, because someone did not see an obvious call.   Now, I don't just mean to kvetch--and obviously all Saints fans  continue to be upset--but it is actually, if you will, about the  integrity of the game. If you speak of the NFL, it almost becomes a  metaphor for that which is the most competitive, the highest quality,  where coaches and athletes dedicate themselves, honing their skills to  the absolute highest level. As folks say, if you can win in the NFL,  you can win anywhere. It is a metaphor. The Saints--every football team  invests heavily in this. Football fans really come to town on this.   So the question is to the NFL. We have a few questions for you.   How are the officials selected for this game? For example, they grade  officials after every game. Were the best officials sent to this game,  or was it just a rotation? If it is just a rotation, how did the  referees who officiated this game grade?   I don't want this to be too personal, but if somebody commits a  penalty during a football game, the referee will say: No. 74 was  offsides, and the NFL has accountability in the performance of  everybody in the game. So I think Saints fans would like to have an  accountability for the referees.   Did people look into conflicts of interest? It has been pointed out  that the referee who missed the call lives in Los Angeles. Is he a  diehard Rams fan?   Again, how did these referees get scored in this game? After every  game, the referee is kind of given a grade. Was it an A-plus or a C- minus? And if it is a lower score, what was the comment on this  particular play?   Saints coach Sean Payton said the senior vice president of  officiating admitted to him in a private phone call that the official  messed up, but there is still no official statement from the NFL.  Perhaps they can answer these questions in an official statement.   Football is not only a game; it is part of our culture. I would state  that the NFL has a responsibility to the millions of fans across the  country to ensure the integrity of the game and to answer these  questions and perhaps a few others.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
