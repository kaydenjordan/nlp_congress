 Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare is big on Trump, but it is weak  on care. After falsely promising that there would be coverage for  everyone for less and better, TrumpCare only cares about huge tax  breaks for the superrich and special interests, like  [[Page H2428]]  the totally unjustified $28 billion windfall for the pharmaceutical  industry that they grab right out of the Medicare trust fund so that  premiums will go up. Those earning $1 million within a single year get  79 percent of a $230 billion tax break, but there is no genuine relief  for middle class taxpayers.   Removing the essential health benefits provisions will only enable  insurers to exclude the very healthcare protections that folks thought  they were getting when they paid their premiums. Insurance plans will  not just be skinny, they will be a sham; a provision that at the very  time you need the care, it won't be there. Many certificates of  insurance will become as worthless almost as a diploma from Trump  University.   This Republican bill targets our veterans by denying them tax  credits. For millions of people who are just a few years too young to  qualify for Medicare, their premiums will go through the roof. It will  cost thousands of dollars more in order to get insurance. Yes, the  Republicans have been divided and factionalized. They are divided  between those who want nothing care and those who want little care.  But, mostly, they don't seem to care how many millions of people lose  their health insurance.   Mr. President, this is not the art of the deal. It is the art of the  steal, of taking away insurance coverage from families that really need  it to provide tax breaks for those at the very top. Those who  understand health care, the professionals, say reject this bill, and it  should be rejected.
