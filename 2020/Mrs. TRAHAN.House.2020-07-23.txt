 Mr. Speaker, walking the halls of the United States  Capitol this week has felt different, like a piece of what makes this  institution great is missing, because he is. It has been a somber  reminder that this body and our country will never be the same without  our guiding light, our moral compass, Congressman John Lewis.   I have never known someone to be more devoted to our Nation than John  Lewis. He demonstrated that devotion by setting standards high and  requiring her continuous improvement; calling out when our policies or  practices didn't live up to the words written in our Constitution; and  never giving up on the pursuit of freedom and equality for everyone in  our country.   He committed his life to the fight for civil rights and, along the  way, he persuaded a Nation, through steadfast, peaceful protests.   Yes, John Lewis is a hero. He is also the closest example I will  likely ever know of a saint. But more than that, he was a friend.   To those of us who are new to Congress, John Lewis welcomed us. He  made time for each of us; got to know us and, somehow, made you feel  like the only person in his presence. He wanted you to know that he  truly heard your words and that they mattered.   Part of what makes this job the honor of a lifetime is serving  alongside giants like Congressman Lewis. Like so many in this Chamber,  I stood in absolute awe of him. He embodied decency, perseverance,  justice, courage, and compassion, traits that he used to great effect  in changing hearts and minds by meeting hate with love, and cruelty  with kindness.   I will forever remember and cherish the opportunity to join John  Lewis in Selma, Alabama, this past March with my husband, my mom, and  two daughters. The time he spent with Grace and Caroline, describing to  them what ``good trouble'' was; walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge  one last time, and reminding us what happened there 55 years ago.   He said: ``On this bridge, some of us gave a little blood to redeem  the soul of America. Our country is a better country; we are a better  people. But we have still a distance to travel to go before we get  there.''   Thank you, John, for never giving up, for never giving in, for  keeping the faith, and for always keeping your eyes on the prize.   We know the work we have left to do, and you gave us the tools and  the courage to continue your legacy.   Rest in peace, Congressman Lewis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, we can disagree on issues that we face as a Nation,  and we can disagree on the policies and the prescriptions that we  develop to fix them. In fact, this very body was built on the belief  that productive tension and spirited debate would force legislators to  do the hard work of creating laws that will benefit all Americans.   For centuries, the House of Representatives has rejected personal  attacks like those hurled at Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez on the steps  of the U.S. Capitol earlier this week. This institution has maintained  rules that hold us, as Members of Congress, to a higher standard  because that is what the hardworking people we represent expect from  us, and that is what we owe to them.   Madam Speaker, when we learn of the kind of personal attack levied  against Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, we cannot sit idly by. We cannot  [[Page H3707]]  let it go unaddressed, as many of us women have long been expected to  do. We must call it out. We must demand accountability, like we are  here today. That is what we owe to all women, especially to our  daughters.   We have to send the message loud and clear because, apparently,  people still aren't getting it. The days of bullying women you disagree  with, whether it is in a boardroom, in a newsroom, or a military base,  or in these hallowed Halls of Congress, are over.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't believe me,  watch as we continue winning in districts across America. Watch as  women band together to say enough to being publicly humiliated simply  because they disagree. And watch as we make up for lost time by course- correcting the behaviors that women like us have had to endure so that  our daughters, and yours, will never have to.   I want to thank my fearless colleague for the grace, the courage, and  the intellect that she brings to this Chamber every day.
