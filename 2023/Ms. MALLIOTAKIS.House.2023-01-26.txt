 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight one of the  crises that we are facing in our country, and it is obvious to so  many--except, unfortunately, so many in this House--that we have a  crisis at our southern border.   We have not only seen over 4.7 million people cross illegally, many  of whom are claiming asylum despite not qualifying for asylum, but we  are also seeing record levels of fentanyl killing so many Americans  each and every single day. We must take a stand to secure our border to  stop this flow of illegal drugs, to stop this mass illegal migration.   When you talk about the number of 4.7 million, when you think about  the number of people who have actually evaded our government, who have  evaded any interaction with our law enforcement and CBP agents, you are  talking about 1.2 million people. That is more than twice the size of  Staten Island, the borough in New York City I represent.   It is outrageous to think that we would have individuals entering our  country illegally, and we don't know what their intentions are, where  they are coming from, why they are here. That is what scares me the  most as an individual who represents the city of New York.    We know that 98 suspected terrorists on our terrorist watch list  crossed the border last fiscal year, and we know, so far this year,  there have been another 38. That should be alarming to every single  person in this country.   We must know who is entering our country and what their intentions  are. To allow this amount of people to evade law enforcement, to evade  any interaction with our government, is a very dangerous action on  behalf of this administration.   House Republicans believe that Secretary Mayorkas has completely  abdicated his responsibility to keep our country secure, and we will be  moving forward with hearings to expose what he is doing. I do believe  at the end of the day it warrants him being impeached and removed from  his position.   Also, I highlight how the Federal Government's lack of action at the  border, coupled with my State legislature's and Governor's horrible  actions in New York, have led to what we are seeing now in terms of a  rise in crime.   First of all, New York is dealing with major actions in terms of  crime, car thefts, people being released. In fact, I just read  yesterday that, in my district, a 20-year-old guy who has been stealing  cars is being released right back onto the streets. It has been about  three times. The first time he was arrested, it was for 20 counts of  car theft.   Let's now look at what we are doing here. When I went down to Federal  Plaza and met with our ICE officials, they are saying that New York  City is not cooperating with any detainer requests for people who are  criminals. That means they either were convicted of a crime in their  home country or were convicted of a crime here.   It is the worst of the worst in society that ICE is trying to remove  from our country, and our local officials won't cooperate. I think it  is outrageous that the city of New York continues to harbor people who  are not only in this country illegally but are committing crimes on top  of it.   Just the other day, New York City residents found out that they are  paying to house, paying to feed, paying to provide services to  individuals who were shoplifting in our State. Think about that. Not  only are they crossing into our country illegally, but after committing  crimes, they were released back onto the street thanks to our State's  ridiculous bail law, and on top of it, the taxpayers of the city of New  York are paying to house and feed them. How does that make any sense,  and how is that in the best interests of our citizens?   I am the daughter of immigrants. I understand and appreciate the  aspirations of the American Dream. We need to work together to address  what is happening at our border. We need to work together to ensure  that those legitimate asylum seekers are not getting stuck in the  bureaucracy and the red tape because of those individuals who are here  claiming asylum when they don't qualify.   We have to work on our visa system to ensure that we address the  labor shortage. We should have more visas, employee-sponsored visas,  and family-sponsored immigration, as well.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure our border.  Let's impose some common sense.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, President Biden's dangerous anti- energy policies have hindered our energy independence. His curbing  production, sitting on leases and permits, canceling Keystone pipeline,  they have all led to high gas prices, heating costs, food costs, and  has the left Northeast heating fuel supply at its lowest point since  1951.   Then, to cover up for his failed policies, he raided 266 million  barrels, or 40 percent of our SPR, meant for real emergencies like  natural disasters. This was not meant to sell to China.   It is now at its lowest point in 40 years. We are vulnerable as a  result of it; and this bill stops the President from depleting our  resources and pushes him to refill it, not with Russian oil, not with  Saudi oil, not with Venezuelan oil, and certainly not with Iranian oil,  but with American oil to protect our national security and the economy.
