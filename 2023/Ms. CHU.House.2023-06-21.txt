 Madam Speaker, it has been a year since the Supreme Court  ripped away the rights of millions of Americans in an instant by  overturning the constitutional right to abortion care. It has been  nearly 1 year since American women were forced to live in a country  where they possessed fewer rights than their grandmothers.   House Republicans are out of step with the American people when it  comes to abortion access, but instead of working to restore these  fundamental freedoms, they have worked to further restrict abortion  access in this country. That is why we are here today, to take action.   I am proud to present this discharge petition to force accountability  for Republican inaction.
