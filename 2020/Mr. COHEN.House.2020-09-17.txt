 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act. This meaningful legislation will protect pregnant  workers who have suffered because of insufficient workplace  protections, a story far too familiar to many workers who call Memphis  home.   Two years ago, I was shocked to read of the disturbing workplace  abuses in an XPO warehouse in Memphis. Warehouse workers were denied  minor and reasonable accommodations like less taxing workloads and  shortened work shifts. As a result, several women suffered  miscarriages, some of which happened while they were still on the  warehouse floor.   I, along with Congresswoman DeLauro and ninety-five of my colleagues,  wrote to the Education and Labor Committee to urge the 115th Congress  to take decisive action and consider the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   The 116th Congress has rightly given this bill the attention it  deserves, and this bill will give pregnant workers the protections that  are past-due. No employee should be forced to choose between their job  and their health. I appreciated the opportunity to participate in the  Education and Labor Committee's Subcommittee hearing on this bill, and  I am pleased to support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act's  consideration today.
