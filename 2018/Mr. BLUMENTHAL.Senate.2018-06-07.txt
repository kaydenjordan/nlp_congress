 Mr. President, I was unable to appear in the Chamber  today to vote on the nomination of Kenneth L. Marcus, of Virginia, to  be Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Education  due to official business away from the Senate. I would like the record  to show that I oppose his nomination and would have voted against his  confirmation.   Throughout his confirmation process and career, Mr. Marcus has  demonstrated consistent disregard for the rights of the very students  he would be expected to protect in this role: women, LGBTQ individuals  immigrants, and students of color. It is clear that Mr. Marcus is in  lockstep with the Department of Education in this regard. He has  supported the Department's decision to dismantle critical title IX  protections for survivors of sexual assault, stood in the way of LGBTQ  students seeking an educational atmosphere free from discrimination,  and refused to commit to protecting a child's constitutional right to  an education regardless of immigration status.   Mr. Marcus has made abundantly clear that he is unfit to serve as the  Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department or Education. I  would like the record to show that I oppose his nomination and would  have voted nay during today's confirmation vote.   (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
