 Mr. President, I want to proudly applaud the  work of YWCA USA as they celebrate an incredible milestone. For 160  years, they have been at the forefront of the Nation's most critical  movements. They have led the charge in women's empowerment, the fight  against racism and discrimination, and efforts to strengthen families  and communities. From voting rights to civil rights, from affordable  housing to pay equity, from violence prevention to healthcare reform,  YWCA has been a force for progress for 160 years.   With the help of 210 local associations, across 46 States and the  District of Columbia, this organization continues to serve over 2  million women, girls, and their families each year. Being one of the  largest networks for domestic violence and sexual assault services in  the country, the YWCA reaches over half a million women and girls  annually. Furthermore, community YWCA associations reach over 260,000  women with economic empowerment programs and over 160,000 people  through their racial justice education and training programs.   In my home State of North Dakota, the YWCA Cass Clay and the YWCA  Minot have been a trusted place for women and children to turn as they  escape violence, homelessness, and crisis. Through these services, they  are fulfilling their mission to provide safety, security, and hope to  those who need it most.   When I came to the Senate, the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA,  was the first bill that I cosponsored, and I am proud that it worked to  give victims of abuse the resources they need to seek justice and  recover for the trauma they experienced. I am still working to prevent  those programs from expiring, and I am proud that the North Dakota  chapters of YWCA have helped protect women and children, especially in  the continuing crisis of violence against women in tribal communities.   I am grateful for my partnership with YWCA in advocating for children  who have experienced trauma. Traumatic experiences, like abuse or a  parent's substance use disorder, can lead to health and behavior  complications later in life. Children and youth who have experienced  four or more traumatic events are three times more at risk of heart  disease or lung cancer, while those who have experienced six or more  traumatic events are 30 times more likely to attempt suicide. The YWCA  has promoted my Trauma Informed Care for Children and Families Act,  which is a critical step to address childhood trauma in the United  States.   I will continue to stand in solidarity with the YWCA in North Dakota  and the rest of the country in strong support of their mission to  eliminate racism, empower women, stand up for social justice, help  families, and strengthen communities.   Congratulations to the YWCA on 160 years of improving the lives of  women and girls all over the country.                            ____________________
