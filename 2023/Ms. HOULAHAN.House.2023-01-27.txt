 Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of the Holocaust and  the day that we mark to remember it.   This is a 1-minute speech--60 seconds.   Lucy Jampoler, Hanka Awin, Christine Winecki, and Andrew Christopher  Alexander Jampoler. These are the names of the four people in my family  who survived the Holocaust.   It took me 10 seconds to name them. If I stood here and named every  Jew who died in the Holocaust, it would take me 140 days. I wish I had  that time.   Sylvia Yoma Tarquine, Monica Yoma, Jason Karol Alexander Jampoler,  and Christina Jampoler Houlahan--me. James Yoma, Molly Elise Houlahan,  Carolyn Deane Houlahan, Lukasz Jampoler, Lilka Jampoler, and Harper  James Yoma. These are the lives that now flourish here because my four  family members served.   It would take me nearly 1 yearlong to name all of us if I could name  everyone who has been produced as a result of the people who survived  the Holocaust.   Mr. Speaker, let us take the time. Let us never forget. We must never  forget.                            ____________________
