 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                           Tribute to Rich Heffron     Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to a  friend, a leader, and one-of-a-kind, Rich Heffron.   My colleagues in the Delaware congressional delegation--Senator  Carper and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester--join me in congratulating  Rich Heffron on his long record of service to Delaware. Rich will soon  be retiring as the president of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce,  and I wanted to take the time today to honor his many contributions not  just to Delaware's business community but to our legal, educational,  and governmental communities, to all of Delaware.   Rich moved from Philadelphia to Wilmington back in 1971, attending  Delaware Law School and serving as an intern for then-Senator Joe  Biden. Rich later functioned as finance director for Joe Biden's 1978  senatorial campaign. Rich's career took off in 1985 when he started as  a special assistant and top aide to then-Wilmington mayor Dan Frawley.  Mayor Frawley wisely recognized Rich's business acumen and promoted him  to director of the Department of Real Estate and Housing in 1987.  There, Rich helped establish the Wilmington Housing Partnership and  became one of Mayor Frawley's most trusted advisers, a key part of his  ``kitchen cabinet.''   Rich later departed Wilmington city government in 1992 to embark on  his journey with the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, where he would  serve for more than a quarter of a century. Mayor Frawley was sad to  lose Rich but recognized his great value to our entire State through  the chamber. ``If I were the president of the state chamber, I would  want to be able to communicate across political lines, across community  and business lines,'' then-Mayor Frawley said. ``Rich has demonstrated  that reach that goes beyond partisan.''   At the State chamber, Rich managed the government affairs department  and was the organization's chief advocate for Federal, State, and local  issues, and it was in this role that I first met him. Under Rich's  great and lasting leadership, the State chamber has been a strong  organization, representing the business community on a very wide range  of issues. He expanded the chamber's advocacy role across the State and  recently helped guide the modernization of the Coastal Zone Act and  advocated for the creation of the Delaware Prosperity Partnership to  help Delaware's economic development for the future.   His insight was and still is frequently sought after in many policy  areas, including government fiscal and tax policy, healthcare issues,  land use management, and workers' compensation. Rich's depth of  knowledge has been a resource for everyone who has spoken with him. His  weekly emails, webcasts, and television and radio appearances are  insightful, informative, and engaging. In short, he has long had his  finger on the pulse of Delaware.   Throughout his tenure at the chamber, Rich has served on many boards  and commissions, and I will mention just a few: the Governor's Workers  Compensation Advisory Commission, the Workers Compensation Health Care  Advisory Panel, and the Delaware Health Care Commission.   Rich also made educating the next generation of Delawareans of all  backgrounds a priority as an adjunct faculty member teaching business  and political science at Delaware Technical and Community College and  at Wilmington University.   Rich's opinions, his style, and his voice have been sought out for  nearly 30 years by business leaders, elected officials, and Delawareans  alike up and down our State, and all those who got to know Rich Heffron  got to know him as a friend.   Our Governor, John Carney, had this to say about Rich just the other  day:         Rich exemplifies the Delaware Way. He has great       relationships with legislators and elected officials on both       sides of the aisle. He takes a long-term approach to issues       rather than an ideological or short-term approach because he       realizes we are here to work together and get something done       that will benefit our state. We owe Rich an incredible debt       of gratitude for what he has done for the Delaware State       Chamber of Commerce, for what he's done to support job       creation for Delawareans, and for what he has done to improve       the Great State of Delaware.    Former Delaware State representative Bobby Byrd, a longtime friend  and former coworker of Rich's, also spoke of his long career of service  to our community. Bobby Byrd said:         Not only has Rich been a lifelong Democratic Party       activist, he has also been a very competent advocate for       Delaware's business community. He is truly an example of the       Delaware Way.    Although Rich is now retiring, his voice and his counsel will never  be far away, and, in retirement, his Temple Owls sports teams will be  just a bit closer.   I personally wanted to say to Rich my great thanks for the many ways  in which you have encouraged and advised and supported me in the 8  years I worked in the private sector in manufacturing and the 10 years  I served in county government and now in my 7 years here in the Senate.   Many in this body find it hard to understand when Senator Carper and  I talk about this Delaware Way, where we all work together and find  ways to solve problems, but the idea that a Democratic Party activist  is the long-serving and well-regarded head of our State chamber of  commerce is just one small example of that Delaware Way.   Rich, no one has been a better, more trusted source of advice to  business leaders, community leaders, and political leaders alike than  you.   It is appropriate that this is the eve of Delaware Day, when almost  230 years to the day tomorrow, the brave Delaware delegates, risking  their lives and everything they had, met at the Golden Fleece Tavern in  Dover, DE, and unanimously voted to make Delaware the first State to  ratify our Constitution. Tonight, we will celebrate again our annual  Taste of Delaware event in honor of Delaware Day.   Tonight, Rich, we will toast you at our seventh annual Taste of  Delaware event, an event that wouldn't be possible without you and the  State chamber's unyielding support. The Taste of  [[Page S7862]]  Delaware event is a great example of what it means to bring people  together from across our State, from our three counties, from north and  south, and to travel to Washington and share with all of our colleagues  here in the Senate some of what makes Delaware special.   Rich, you and your team have created a wonderful Washington  tradition, attracting literally thousands of guests and dozens of  Delaware's culinary staples to celebrate the First State here in the  Nation's Capital. And, Rich, you yourself have been the best example I  could provide to my colleagues of what it is that makes Delaware so  special.   You will be missed, Rich, in your role at the State chamber, and I  wish you and Colleen and your family all the best in your well-deserved  years of retirement.   Thank you.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
