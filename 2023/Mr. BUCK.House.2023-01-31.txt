 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the threats facing conservative speech  in this country. When members of government take it upon themselves to  declare certain speech illegal or undesirable, they effectively silence  opposition. This isn't the American way.   We have seen this kind of censorship in Saudi Arabia, Communist  China, and Soviet Russia. We never want to see it in America.   Tonight, we are gathered to call attention to a  shocking,  coordinated attempt by progressives in business and government to  suppress dissent, stifle debate, and threaten free speech.    Last week, one of the largest satellite TV providers, DIRECTV, chose  to deplatform Newsmax from their lineup.   Newsmax is the fourth highest-rated cable news channel and is watched  by more than 25 million Americans. This decision means that more than  13 million homes will lose access to Newsmax programming.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, Democratic members of the Energy and  Commerce Committee wrote to AT&T and DIRECTV encouraging the censorship  of One America News, FOX News, and Newsmax. Two years later, two out of  three of those networks are now deplatformed.   One year ago, after pressure from Democrats, AT&T and DIRECTV removed  the One America News Network from its programming, and now DIRECTV has  removed Newsmax.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has immediate jurisdiction over the  business interests of DIRECTV. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to  understand why AT&T and DIRECTV felt pressured to comply with committee  demands.   Simply put, Democrats in that committee disagreed with the content  coming out of One America News Network and Newsmax and decided they  wanted them canceled.   This is a clear case of free speech infringement and viewpoint  discrimination. Government colluding with telecommunications giants  should chill us all.   We are facing a concerted, unabashed effort to shrink the limits of  debate by corporations in an unholy alliance with political activists  and their government avatars. These companies have become willing  prosecutors of dissent.   Woke corporations are actively interposing themselves between  Americans and the conversations they need to have. Why? Because they  are afraid, afraid that the lessons they learned in progressive  universities won't stand up to objective scrutiny; afraid that vigorous  debate breeds societies of citizens, not sheep; above all, afraid that  if they cannot anoint themselves enlightened arbiters, their ideas will  just have to stand on their own merits like the rest of us.   I urge my colleagues across the aisle to rethink their desire to  silence opposition. The people who want to silence opponents are people  who can't win debates.   I urge American businesses to stiffen their spines and stand up in  favor of free speech and open speech.   We acknowledge that we may never know the exact mindset of the  decisionmakers who decided to join hand in glove with progressives'  drive to silence their opposition, but what we know is more than  enough.   Democrats asked, and DIRECTV delivered. Progressives spoke up, and  One America News was silenced. Newsmax is now on the chopping block.   Where does that leave us? Under the lengthening shadow of censorship  or at the beginning of a new era when freedom fights back.   I know what side I will be on. Which one will you join?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Bishop), my colleague from the Tar Heel State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona, the  Grand Canyon State (Mr. Biggs), America's favorite Arizona podcaster.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield to the gentleman  from South Carolina, the Palmetto State, one of Biden's many vacation  spots (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), the best dentist in Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia, the  Old Dominion State, the State for Lovers (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Van Drew).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman who has been described  as New Jersey's best dentist.   Now, we are going to Arizona's best dentist.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney), a marine mom.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Meuser), whose district borders the sweetest place on Earth,  Hershey Park.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Owens), my good friend and a Super Bowl champion.    Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  [[Page H564]]  Hageman), my neighbor to the north from the Yellowstone State.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. I  yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), the best Florida  podcaster from the Sunshine State.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida. I yield to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Grothman. Mr. Speaker, I am honored that Congressman Buck has  asked me to be a speaker this evening as we defend the U.S.  Constitution.   Our U.S. Constitution is under attack like never before. I am not  talking about the Second Amendment, which, of course, is disliked by so  many people on the other side of the aisle. I am not talking about the  right to a speedy trial, as we see in Washington, D.C., itself, people  spending months and months in jail without ending their ordeal there.   I am talking about the First Amendment. Throughout my life, the First  Amendment is almost the amendment that would have been most unanimously  agreed to. Nevertheless, in part, I assume, because of the popular  culture and in part because of our educational system, we are in a  situation in which the Pew Research Center found 76 percent of  Democrats support tech companies censoring online.   Even more amazing, 65 percent of the Democrats support censorship by  the government. How in the world did such a large, important party in  this country it become apparently the accepted view of the First  Amendment to be that it is obsolete?   Just last year, the then-chairman of the Intelligence Committee wrote  to Meta, the parent company of Facebook, threatening congressional  action if Facebook did not continue to censor conservative views and  maintain bans on conservative figures, such as the former President.  Can you imagine people in this body saying the way we are going to deal  with political disagreements in the future is we are just going to  censor one side?   That is what is going on here.   Their message is loud and clear: Get in line, or we are going to use  the levers of government to silence you. It is a chilling message,  reminiscent of the practice of communists in China or Russia or Cuba.   It surprises me what open criticisms of the government you can find  in Russia. In China, the Communist Party exercises complete control  over the internet, restricting what its citizens can search for. It is  hard to believe people in this country want this country to become more  like China.   It is not unfounded. You can even bleed into freedom of religion.   In Canada, recent court rulings have held LGBTQ rights trump an  individual's right to freedom of religion. Freedom of speech should be  a given. Liberal college students when I was in college used to pride  themselves on defending free speech.   Look at Canada, censoring views that come from the Bible. In other  words, censoring religion in Canada. That is what it is coming down to  in our country.   I thank my friend from Colorado for giving me an opportunity to  defend the Constitution, and I hope anybody back home listening to this  educates their children and grandchildren. We do not have the  government censoring free speech.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's passion. I yield  to the  [[Page H565]]  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), the gentleman from the  Butternut State. That is a new one for me.    Mr. Speaker, if the stenographer needs help with dadgummit,  we will try to get a spelling for her on that.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert). She is from  my home State, and she is a young person who has set this place on fire  since she has been here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and wish her safe  travels back to our great State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Burlison),  who is a hunter, a fisherman, and a great American.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks, and I  thank all 18 of our speakers. All 18 felt so strongly that they came  here during their evening and dedicated themselves to making sure that  a message was heard in America, a message that we will not tolerate  censorship in this country and that we will not tolerate the left.  Whether it owns a corporation or whether it is colluding with the  government, we will not tolerate the unacceptable behavior of taking  news shows off just because they reflect a conservative viewpoint.   Mr. Speaker, I must say that many of the speakers today, many of the  Members of Congress who spoke, made it absolutely clear that they are  going to dedicate time, energy, and staff resources to make sure that  we look into this further.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your patience and the patience of the staff  here. I very much appreciate being able to speak directly to the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
