 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot  be entertained, I urge the Speaker and the Majority Leader to  immediately schedule the Born-Alive bill.
