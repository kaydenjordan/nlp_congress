 Mr. Speaker, this is the first time in my 15 years in  Congress that I have voted to increase the debt limit. I do so today  because this measure places real constraints on future spending, more  than $2 trillion. That makes this bill the most important victory for  fiscal conservatism in more than a decade.   The debt is but a symptom of the central problem--reckless spending.  Once we have spent a dollar, there are only three ways to pay for it:  Taxes, inflation, or debt. It is the spending, stupid.   We have got a long way to go, but until the American people have had  enough and replace the President and the Senate majority, this is a  remarkable step forward. The many progrowth provisions in the bill  provide the most potent antidote to debt--economic expansion.   Mr. Speaker, defeating this bill would create a financial and  political panic that will quickly forfeit the many hard-won reforms  that are in this bill. We cannot let that happen.
