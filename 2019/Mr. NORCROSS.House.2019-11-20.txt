 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the importance of  the Protecting the Right to Organize, or as we know it, the PRO Act.                                time  1930    We heard several of my colleagues talk about the pros of what  literally is taking place and how difficult it is. As many people know,  and as we have heard here, there are 218 lawyers in Congress, but there  is only one electrician and one electrician who spent his career not  only doing the electrical work but representing workers.   I have spent 37 years in the IBEW, literally having to retire from  that as I came here and took my oath of office to represent the people  of the First District.   When we look at what is happening today in this country, it is the  end of a long line of abuses, those things that have happened over the  course of the last three decades in particular, the decline of union  membership. Many of those on the other side of the aisle like to say  that it is because people don't want it. This couldn't be any further  than the truth.   Today, close to 80 percent of employees would vote for a union if  they could--80 percent. This is quite a different figure than the 6  percent that you heard representing private employers, Mr. Speaker.  That is because it has been rigged. I can say that because I am one of  the few Members who speak on this floor who have been to the National  Labor Relations Board and who has conducted elections. I have done it  repeatedly. I see the cheating that takes place. That is why we have  the PRO Act.   Earlier this year, we voted on something that I thought would have  been unanimous, the Raise the Wage Act. The minimum wage in this  country hasn't been raised in over 11 years--11 years--$7.25 an hour.   Tell me out there, can you live on $7.25 an hour?   We change that.   Predictably, over the next 7\1/2\ years, that would raise to $15 an  hour. But our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: They don't  need a raise.   That is how unbelievable some of this is. Tell me, can you live on  that?   The PRO Act is simply listening to the people whom we work with who  want a voice and who want to be able to grow the business that they are  working for so that they can share in those wages. That is where the  PRO Act comes in.   I mentioned I was an electrician, and I still am. I am not doing much  work the way I used to, but as I told my kids, I am an electrician with  a tie now. But I saw firsthand people who would say: I want the chance  to do better. I want the chance for us collectively to bargain.   They would come to see us and say: Can you help me?   We said: Sure we can.   We gathered together, and we speak with one voice, go to the NLRB,  which is the labor relations board that makes the rules, and say: Here  is a bargaining group of 8 to 10 men and women who want to become part  of the IBEW, or speak collectively as we call it. Then the fight  begins.   Occasionally, Mr. Speaker, you would have a contractor who says: Do  you know what? After talking to them, I think this is a good way of  working together to try to grow my business and to take care of my  employees.   Unfortunately, for those who want to cheat the system, they start to  say: Well, he is an independent contractor. He just started here. He is  an apprentice.   They try to break up the groups. When they talk about bargaining  groups as my colleague, Mr. Levin, talked about, it is about breaking  that apart.   All this does is level the playing field and make it fair so those  workers who want to vote to collectively bargain can do it in a fair  and open way so the elections aren't rigged. Fair and open, we hear  that so much today.   The PRO Act protects workers because the other thing that the  employer will do is fire the one who spoke up: We will take care of the  one who is causing the trouble.   I am trying to do better for my family, and I talked to my employer  about a raise, and he doesn't want to do it, so I call up the union and  say: Can you help me? And I get fired for that.   There is no recourse for bad actors. The PRO Act would change that  and level the playing field so there are penalties when you break the  law. It is like having speed limits with no police on the road. That is  what it is like now. They are free to do whatever they want.   The PRO Act restores the fairness of the economy against those  workers who are rigged. Workers win, but just as important, business  wins. They grow together. It is just not a one size fits all. We  understand working together is what this does.   We see so often the tragedies of what happened from the same crew who  won't vote to raise the minimum wage in 11 years and who are the same  ones fighting this.   Together, we can do better. Raise the level of fairness so that all  employees will have a voice at their workplace.  [[Page H9115]]    Again, I thank the gentleman for bringing us together. I look at my  colleagues out here who understand this on a gut level. To the  Representatives who are listening tonight, go home and talk to the  average guy on the street and say: Do you want to make it better, to  raise your family, to have a decent wage? Then you will hear yes.   I recommend voting ``yes'' for the PRO Act.
