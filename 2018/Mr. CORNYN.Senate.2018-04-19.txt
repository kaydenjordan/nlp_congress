 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate is expected to vote this  afternoon to confirm  Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma to be the  Administrator of NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration. For more than 15 months, our national space agency has  been without permanent leadership. This is far too long, especially  considering the incredibly important work that NASA is undertaking on a  daily basis.   The agency is currently working with the commercial space industry,  for example, to resume launches of American astronauts to the  International Space Station, rather than have to rely on the Russians  to transport American astronauts into space. Additionally, teams at  NASA are developing the Space Launch System, or SLS, and the Orion  capsule. These are components of a rocket system that is the most  powerful one built since the Saturn V that sent Neil Armstrong to the  Moon. It will pave the way, hopefully, to one day landing astronauts on  Mars.   Having a permanent Administrator in place is important not just so  the agency itself can function but so NASA can have an impact on our  entire country. Having appropriate leadership means NASA can continue  to benefit Texans who work there, with jobs and opportunities to  research, collaborate, and innovate across disciplines.   The Administrator is charged with selecting the Directors of each of  the agency's space centers around the country. This, too, is important.  One reason is because at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Dr. Ellen  Ochoa, the current director, is stepping down next month, after years  of distinguished service. It is critical that we have a competent  replacement for her and ensure seamless transition after she leaves.  Part of the way we do that is by making sure that this nominee is  confirmed today.   We in Texas are, I believe, justifiably proud of the Johnson Space  Center. The JSC heads the manned spaceflight program for NASA, which  manages the U.S. presence at the International Space Station, among  other operations. JSC employs roughly 10,000 people, and virtually all  U.S. astronauts pass through it, at one time or another, to receive  training. Currently, JSC is involved in developing the Orion capsule,  which I spoke of a moment ago. One hundred sixty-nine companies are  collaborating with NASA on its launch, creating nearly 800 jobs--not  all of them in the Houston region. In fact, in multiple locations  around the country, the commercial space industry is growing rapidly.  In 2014, the Midland International Air and Space Port became the first  federally licensed facility by the FAA for both airline flights and  commercial space flights. That is just one of several examples.   Meanwhile, in Washington, we have to continue to do our part  supporting U.S. space exploration. Last year, I was proud to have my  legislation, called the MANIFEST Act, signed into law as part of the  NASA reauthorization, and I hope to collaborate on similar legislation  in the future with colleagues.   If we want to keep pushing toward the final frontier, our first step  is to  [[Page S2300]]  ensure that we have a strong Administrator at the helm, and that is why  I intend to vote to support the nomination this afternoon.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2714         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Mercy Ships was founded in 1978 and has worked in more       than 70 countries, providing services valued at more than       $1.3 billion, treating more than 2.56 million direct       beneficiaries.        (2) Mercy Ships owns and operates the world's largest       private hospital ship, the Africa Mercy that has five state-      of-the-art operating rooms and ward bed space for 82       patients.        (3) Mercy Ships vessels are staffed by professional       volunteer crew including surgeons, nurses, doctors, dentists,       cooks, engineers, agriculturalists, teachers, and others.        (4) Mercy Ships has performed more than 82,000 life-      changing or life-saving operations such as cleft lip and       palate repair, cataract removal, orthopedic procedures,       facial reconstruction, obstetric fistula repair, and tumor       removal.        (5) Mercy Ships has treated over 147,000 dental patients       including over 390,000 dental procedures.        (6) Mercy Ships has trained more than 5,900 local       professionals (including surgeons) who have in turn trained       many others.        (7) Mercy Ships has trained over 38,100 local professionals       in their area of expertise including anesthesiology,       midwifery, sterilization, orthopedic and reconstructive       surgery, and leadership, thereby increasing medical capacity       in the host nation.

At any given time, there are more than 400 crew from       40 nations onboard the Africa Mercy.        (11) The Africa Mercy alone has had over 4,900 crew from 74       countries serve onboard since its inception in 2007. In       addition, more than 950 local Day Workers from 12 different       countries have served alongside since it first docked in       Africa.        (12) Mercy Ships has served some of the world's poorest       populations and completed over 589 port visits in 55       developing nations and 18 developed nations for a total of 73       nations including: Australia, Bahamas, Benin, Belgium,       Belize, Brazil, Canada, China, Congo Brazzaville, Columbia,       Cuba, Denmark, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Estonia,       Faroe Islands, Fiji, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Germany,       Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea (West Africa),       Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Italy, Ivory Coast,       Jamaica, Korea, Latvia, Liberia, Lithuania, Madagascar,       Malta, Mexico, Montserrat, The Netherlands, New Caledonia,       New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea,       Philippines, Poland, Russia, Samoa, Senegal, Sierra Leone,       Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, St. Eustatius (NL), St.       Kitts, St. Thomas, St. Vincent, Sweden, Tahiti, Togo, Tonga,       Trinidad, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vanuatu.

(B) The 522-foot Anastasis was the flag ship, and completed       her first relief mission in 1982 to Guatemala. Her crew of       400 worked in Africa until she was decommissioned in 2007.        (C) Acquired in 1994, the 265-foot Caribbean Mercy with her       crew of 150 focused on the Caribbean basin and Central       America with its Eye Surgery Unit. The ship was sold in 2006.
