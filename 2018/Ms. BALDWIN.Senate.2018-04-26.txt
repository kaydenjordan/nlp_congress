 Madam President, today I wish to honor Vel Phillips, who  was born Velvalea Hortense Rodgers in 1923 in Milwaukee and passed away  on April 17, 2018, at the age of 95. Vel was a civil rights leader and  a pioneer in social justice and fair housing who left an indelible mark  on the State of Wisconsin.   Vel earned a national oratory scholarship from the Black Elks to  attend Howard University, where she earned her bachelor's degree in  1946. She returned to her home State of Wisconsin to attend the  University of Wisconsin--Madison Law School, becoming the first Black  woman to graduate from the school, just one in a long series of  significant firsts for Vel.   Following law school, Vel made it her life's work to advocate for  social justice and equal rights. She became actively involved in the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, working for  political, social, educational, and economic equality for people of  color.   Vel was elected to the Milwaukee Common Council in 1956, not only as  the first African American, but also as the first woman. Her election  sent shockwaves through the all-White, all-male council. Rather than  welcoming her to her new position, her colleagues refused to share an  office with her and suggested she join the aldermen's wives club  instead of the council. A firm believer in polite persistence, Vel took  her seat quietly but proudly. She quickly went on to become an advocate  not only for the people in her district, but for every African American  in the city. She later said, ``No matter where they lived, I was their  alderman and they called me.''   Vel would go on to accomplish many more firsts. In 1971, she became  the first woman judge in Milwaukee County, as well as the first  African-American judge in the State of Wisconsin. In 1978, she made  history again as the first woman and minority elected secretary of  State in Wisconsin.   In spite of all these significant firsts, Vel Phillips is perhaps  best known for initiating the long but ultimately successful fight to  outlaw housing discrimination in Milwaukee. Until the late 1960s,  landlords freely refused to sell or rent property to people of color.  Even if homeowners wanted to sell property to people of color, banks  routinely rejected their loan applications. As a result, African  Americans lived almost exclusively in one run-down neighborhood on  Milwaukee's near north side.   In 1962, Vel introduced the city's first ordinance to prohibit  discrimination in housing. The council promptly rejected it by a vote  of 18 to 1. She tried three additional times over the next 6 years with  the same result. The Milwaukee NAACP Youth Council and The Rev. James  Groppi took up her cause in 1967 and organized 200 consecutive nights  of protests in support of her ordinance. When her colleagues adopted a  watered-down version of an open housing ordinance in an attempt to make  the protests stop, Vel told them, ``Thanks for nothing. You are very  much too late and very much too little.''   The council finally passed a strong open housing ordinance in 1968,  after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  spurred Congress to pass the national Fair Housing Act.   Following her retirement from public office, Vel remained involved in  important causes, speaking up when she saw injustice, protesting when  necessary, and educating students from all over the world.   Public servant, trailblazer, activist, icon, and pioneer are all  words that only begin to describe Vel Phillips' contributions to the  fight for equality in Wisconsin. While history will forever remember  her for her string of momentous firsts, her greatest legacy will be the  many women who run for elective office or the countless African  Americans who live throughout the city thanks to the seemingly  insurmountable barriers she shattered.                            ____________________
