 Mr. Speaker, the December jobs report  came in at less than half of what was projected. People continue to  suffer at the hands of the Biden and Democrat policies. Jobs are being  destroyed.   A recent national poll found that 68 percent of respondents said the  economy was a top concern.   Inflation is a tax on all Americans, and it has gone up every month  since the Biden Presidency. Gasoline is up 58 percent; propane,  kerosene, and firewood are up 34 percent; bacon is up 21 percent; and  hamburger is up 20 percent.   Real wages have decreased under Biden in 8 of his 10 full months in  office, with a loss of $5,000 per family.   The Democrat elite think they are smarter than everyone, and Democrat  voters and Democrat media are ignorant to believe that trillions of  dollars cost zero dollars.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America. Sadly, we are in day 151 of  Americans left behind, as cited by Sean Hannity.                            ____________________
