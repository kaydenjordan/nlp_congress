 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Amendment No. 250, as Modified     Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senator from  [[Page S3508]]  Alabama is presiding over this very important debate because one of the  most important issues to both of our States, Colorado and Alabama, is  the economy and the economic well-being of our great country. The  amendment that I will be discussing today goes to the very heart of our  opportunities in space, our opportunities in innovation, our  opportunities to ensure that we have the most reliable information as  it relates to weather and to weather events.   It is a great partnership that we have had with the Senator from  Alabama, who has been absolutely critical and instrumental in ensuring  a persistent, reliable space presence. I thank the Senator from  Alabama, Mr. Strange, for his incredible leadership when it comes to  making sure that we are able to reach space, that we are able to  continue our space mission. Whether it is in the defense of this  country or in understanding where the next tornado may strike, I thank  the Senator from Alabama for the leadership that has been provided to  ensure that constant presence and persistence.   Of course, I rise to speak in support of the bipartisan Gardner- Nelson-Warner et al. amendment, amendment No. 250. Yet, truly, to the  Senate--to my colleagues here--I rise in support of America's role and  leadership in space.   I rise on behalf of the hardworking men and women across this Nation  who make our country's aerospace industry second to none, because, over  the past 70 years, the United States has led the way in space  exploration. From the Apollo missions to the space shuttle to the Orion  program, we are the leaders in exploring the great frontier of space.  That is who this country is. That is who we are--explorers, pioneers.  We were the first to the Moon, and I hope we are the first to Mars, but  we cannot give up that pioneering innovation that has led this country  to greatness.   I will share with colleagues of the Senate a CNBC story from March  that China is building a manned spacecraft that is capable of sending  astronauts to the Moon as well as to near-Earth orbit flight.   Can you imagine the day when the stars and stripes on the lunar  surface stands not alone but stands next to the stars of a flag of  another nation--perhaps China's, perhaps somebody else's?   When it comes to our access to space, this debate is absolutely  critical because without the passage of amendment No. 250, we lose a  tremendous portion of our access to space. We lose it for commercial  applications, and we lose it for civil applications.   In the past few months, this China activity has shown the importance  of U.S. leadership. That is why this bipartisan amendment comes with a  very simple point. It ensures that NASA and our commercial space  industry will continue to be the country's leader in aerospace.   The ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark  Warner, of Virginia, is coleading my amendment. The Senator has done a  phenomenal job in leadership on the Intelligence Committee in leading  this amendment.   I see that my colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, has joined this  debate. He has done a phenomenal job in leading this effort. As the  ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation  Committee, with jurisdiction over NASA, Senator Bill Nelson is the  leading cosponsor of this effort.   They understand how important it is to address this issue for NASA  and other space missions.   I stand here in support of the greater goals of the underlying bill  that we will be amending today. I believe sanctions against our  adversaries are warranted and justified and, indeed, should move  forward. This amendment is not designed to undermine the intent of the  bill, but it seeks to ensure that space exploration may continue as it  is currently planned.   Without this bipartisan amendment, multiple missions on the books  today--that are already planned today--will be delayed or even canceled  and will be subjecting the U.S. taxpayers to significant cost  increases. Without this amendment, missions like the commercial  resupply program, which delivers critical supplies to the International  Space Station, will be jeopardized by the language of the bill as it is  written. American astronauts at the International Space Station, as we  speak, are dependent on those supplies, but we are cutting off the  American lifeline without the adoption of this amendment. Future  missions, like the commercial crew program--a partnership between NASA  and private industry to bring astronauts to the International Space  Station on a U.S.-manufactured spacecraft--will be put at risk without  the adoption of this amendment.   Without this bipartisan amendment, we will continue to rely on  Russian spacecraft to take U.S. astronauts to the International Space  Station. Let me just make that more clear. Without the adoption of this  amendment, NASA and our astronauts will be dependent on Russia for  access to space for even longer. Rejection of this bipartisan amendment  results in further Russian dependence.   I do not believe this was the intent of the language when the bill  was first written. The Gardner-Nelson-Warner-Shelby et al. amendment  creates the certainty that NASA needs and supports to ensure currently  planned NASA and commercial launch missions can continue without  interruption.   NASA contacted my office yesterday and said of amendment No. 250:  ``We believe this provides us the flexibility to maintain our  commitments to our national space program.''   It is not just the commercial crew and cargo missions that are going  to be impacted. Several other missions will be subjected to delays-- missions like the Joint Polar Satellite System. This constellation of  satellites will give us the ability to constantly monitor the globe for  significant weather events, such as floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.  As I stand here today, the three Senators on the floor who are  listening to this important debate--with more on C-SPAN--have been  impacted dramatically by floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.   In 2013, we had dramatic flooding in Colorado that damaged thousands  and thousands of homes and cost lives. I know the Presiding Officer has  faced the same challenge when it has come to tornadoes and incredibly  tragic weather events. The Senator from Florida has faced hurricanes,  floods, and tornadoes. That is the importance of this amendment--to  understand our weather systems and predictions.   I am proud to say that JPSS is being developed in my home State of  Colorado. The JPSS and other essential programs in which we have  already invested hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of  dollars already, are now put at risk of significant delays or cost  increases to the taxpayer without the adoption of this amendment.   I am also on the floor to talk about a longer term mission that I  truly believe in and hope to see our Nation achieve, one that goes to  the very heart of our pioneering spirit of who we are as a people. It  is our future manned mission to Mars.   As I have spoken on the floor before, as I child I wanted to be an  astronaut. I was inspired as I watched NASA astronauts explore that  next frontier. I believe that the next destination for human beings to  explore is, indeed, Mars, but without this bipartisan amendment, the  Mars 2020 rover, which will continue to prepare us for that future  manned mission, will be put in doubt. It will be a significant setback  and will make the future goal of getting to Mars seem that much further  away.   This amendment, amendment No. 250, allows these missions to move  forward with certainty and as scheduled. It is a bipartisan effort to  affirm America's leadership in space.   Let's be clear. Last summer we had a debate on this very same issue-- that by 2022 we were going to have an ``America first'' opportunity.  That is the spirit of this amendment--to make sure that we have access  to these vital and critical space missions, access to space, and to  continue to grow economic opportunities for the American people. That  is what this debate is all about.   I yield the floor to my colleague Senator Nelson and then, of course,  will continue with debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona as well  for allowing this vote to move forward, but in his statements, he said  NASA needs to do the same. He repeated it several times.   I would just say that this amendment could actually be titled ``NASA  Needs to Do the Same'' because what we had agreed to last year, when it  comes to defense, is a way forward on the Atlas V rocket, the RD-180.  We agreed to that. I believe it was a unanimous consent agreement. If  there was an objection at that time, then it should have been expressed  when we made this agreement.   Our colleagues across the aisle, for a unanimous consent, it takes  all of us 100 people to agree to a unanimous consent agreement. That  agreement was made on the National Defense Authorization Act. NASA  needs to do the same.   Our colleague, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Mark  Warner, made the point of parity between civil, commercial, and  defense. That is what this amendment does.   There are a lot of issues that we come to the floor and we talk about  this issue not being rocket science: It is not that difficult. It is  not rocket science. Well, we actually have an issue that is rocket  science. The mission set before American astronauts is jeopardized if  this amendment doesn't pass. The taxpayers of this country face  billions of dollars in costs if this amendment doesn't pass. Reliance  on Russian technology to get to the space station or resupplying  American astronauts will increase if this amendment doesn't pass.   If we want to talk about protecting the people of this country, let's  talk about the victims of floods in Colorado, let's talk about people  who have died in tornadoes because we didn't have the most accurate  ability to forecast where they were coming from, when they were going  to strike, and who would be hit. This amendment will allow these  weather satellites to go into space to protect the men and women of  this country from natural disasters. Again, it brings parity to an  agreement that was decided upon through unanimous consent last year.   I support the underlying legislation, and I support this amendment  and urge my colleagues to support it as well. I thank the chairman of  the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member of the Foreign  Relations Committee for their leadership on this committee.   I yield the floor.
