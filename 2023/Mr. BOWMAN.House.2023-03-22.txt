 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my love and  appreciation for the Pakistani-American community. I am proud to be  introducing a resolution supporting a designation of March 23 as  Pakistan Day.   The holiday of Pakistan Day, coming up tomorrow, marks the creation  of the world's first Islamic Republic. Of course, Ramadan begins at  sundown today, so I extend my best wishes for a happy Ramadan to  Muslims around the world.   Pakistan Day is an opportunity for people of Pakistani heritage,  wherever they live, to join with their neighbors in joy and celebration  of their culture, their achievements, and their aspirations for the  future. We are all enriched by this spirit.   I am deeply inspired by the contributions of Pakistani Americans who  have given their brilliance to my district and our country as  educators, innovators, public servants, organizers, and so much more.   Thank you to the American Pakistani Advocacy Group for your work  which makes our democracy stronger.   I look forward to joining all those who will be observing Pakistan  Day tomorrow, from Islamabad to Yonkers.                            ____________________
