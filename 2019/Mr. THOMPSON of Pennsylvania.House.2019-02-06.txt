 Mr. Speaker, last night we heard a  tremendous State of the Union Address from President Trump that  expressed confidence and hope for the future of this great Nation.   Our economy is growing. Thanks in part to historic tax reform, there  are currently more than 7 million job openings. This truly is the land  of opportunity. We must continue to support smart policies that will  expand opportunities for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with President Trump: Together, we can break  decades of political stalemate and choose greatness over gridlock. We  can work together for the common good to improve our outdated  infrastructure; to protect American workers; to provide a check against  the high cost of healthcare, prescription drugs; to secure our borders;  and, yes, to fix our broken immigration system.   As a nation, we have a right to secure our borders. As President  Trump stated, tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate;  it is cruel. Smugglers use migrant women and children to exploit our  laws and to gain access to our country.   Congress must act to address these issues that have plagued our  country for far too long because it is clear that America is stronger  when we work together.   We saw incredible moments of unity last night. One that stands out  for me is when Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber sang ``Happy  Birthday'' to Holocaust survivor, Judah Samet. Mr. Samet narrowly  avoided the mass killing at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.  Last night, he turned 81 years old. Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed many  State of the Union Addresses, but that is a moment I will truly never  forget.   The President and First Lady had many distinguished guests in  addition to Mr. Samet, including another Pennsylvania resident,  Pittsburgh Police Officer Timothy Matson.  [[Page H1366]]    Officer Matson raced into the Tree of Life synagogue and was shot  seven times as he chased down the shooter. Officer Matson has undergone  12 surgeries. I understand he has more in the future, but he made the  trip to Washington to be in the gallery last night.   We are proud of the bravery and heroism of both Officer Matson and  Mr. Samet. It was an honor to have them in the Chamber last night.    The President and First Lady also welcomed a World War II and D-day  veteran; the first man to step on the Moon; a childhood cancer  survivor; former prisoners who, thanks to criminal justice reform, have  their lives back; and many other special guests.   The State of the Union is both a time to reflect and look to the  future, and this administration has achieved record-setting  accomplishments. The policies being put forth truly are lifting up all  Americans and setting a foundation to build a safe, strong, and proud  America:   We have worked to combat the opioid crisis; we have provided relief  from burdensome regulations; we have given our military the resources  it needs to be successful; and we can continue to work towards solving  the very serious problems facing this Nation.   Now, I thank President Trump for outlining his vision for the path  forward, and I look forward to working together to overcome some of our  greatest challenges. I know we can do it because it is the American  way.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for more than 50 years,  we have observed February as American Heart Month.   Heart disease is the Nation's number-one killer, and during this  month we reaffirm our commitment to combating heart disease and  educating all people about the benefits of a healthy, active lifestyle.   Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I worked for nearly 30  years as a rehabilitation therapist and a licensed nursing home  administrator. I understand the unique challenges facing individuals  who have suffered a  [[Page H1380]]  stroke or other life-changing injuries. Often, it is a long road to  recovery.   An active lifestyle can help lower blood pressure, boost levels of  good cholesterol, improve blood flow, and more. Cardiovascular disease,  including heart disease and stroke, remain the leading cause of death  globally; but, by making healthy choices, including a balanced diet and  regular exercise, individuals can lower their risk for cardiovascular  disease by as much as 80 percent.   I hope that Heart Month 2019 inspires more Americans to take control  of their cardiovascular health and to begin a healthy lifestyle  journey.                            ____________________
