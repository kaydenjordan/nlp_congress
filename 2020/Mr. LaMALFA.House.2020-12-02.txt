 Madam Speaker, on Thanksgiving Day this year, Betty and  Ellington Peek were also celebrating something else, their 70th wedding  anniversary.   After meeting at a dance in 1950, Betty and Ellington got married and  moved to Oakdale, California, which is a well-known ranching and rodeo  town south of Sacramento.   Shortly after that, Ellington was drafted for the Korean war and he  served in our military for 1 year. He came home to Betty and their  first son, Andy, who was born while he was overseas. They lived in both  Susanville and then later the Cottonwood/Anderson area, running auction  yards for cattle until Ellington was finally able to live the dream and  buy the Shasta Auction Yard that he had worked at for so many years.   For over 30 years, Ellington and Betty have been staples, not just in  their Shasta County livestock community, but all northern California  with their innovative way of doing business, helping ranchers from  across the country sell their cattle via satellite and on the internet.   Through hard work and a strong bond, the Peeks have found great  success in livestock, but even greater success in marriage and family  and their long list of friends, of which I count myself, and am proud  to do so.   So Betty and Ellington, happy 70th anniversary. I wish you continued  happiness for many years to come. You are pillars of our community. We  are proud of you.                            ____________________
