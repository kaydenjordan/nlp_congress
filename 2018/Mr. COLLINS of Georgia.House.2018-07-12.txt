 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 989 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 989         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 6237) to authorize appropriations for fiscal       years 2018 and 2019 for intelligence and intelligence-related       activities of the United States Government, the Community       Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency       Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select Committee       on Intelligence.

In lieu       of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence now printed in       the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original       bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule       an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-80. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived.

[[Page H6123]]      Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on House Resolution 989, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 6237, the Matthew Young  Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscals Years 2018 and 2019.  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence.   The rule also provides for a motion to recommit. Additionally, the  rule makes in order 12 amendments from Members on both sides of the  aisle.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee heard testimony from numerous Members,  including Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member  Schiff, as well as Mr. LoBiondo from New Jersey and Ms. Jackson Lee  from Texas.   In addition to the vigorous debate on this legislation before the  Rules Committee, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a  markup of this legislation on June 27, 2018, where the committee voted  unanimously to report the bill to the House floor for consideration.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff for  their important work on this legislation, and I commend them for the  strong demonstration of bipartisanship in moving it forward.   The Intelligence Reauthorization Act is among the most important  pieces of legislation we consider in this Chamber. It provides the  intelligence community, a community that spans 17 different agencies,  with the resources it needs to protect our great country.   Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff approached the task of  writing this bill constructively and with a clear understanding of its  importance, and their work is evident in the support for this bill we  have already seen displayed at the Intelligence Committee markup.   As a result of Mr. Nunes' and Mr. Schiff's work, and of the  Intelligence Committee, the legislation provided for by this rule will  not only reauthorize programs crucial to the intelligence community,  but it will also make a number of critical improvements to the law in  support of that community and our national security.   The underlying bill represents an opportunity to pass an important  piece of legislation that will enhance our national security in an age  of increasingly sophisticated adversaries.   Its provisions include critical functions like deterring nation-state  adversaries like Russia and China, countering and defeating ISIS and  other terrorist groups, and defending America against cyberattacks, to  name a few.   In addition to the critical missions I have listed above, the bill  will improve our ability to recruit and retain top cybersecurity  professionals, and will provide better benefits to CIA employees  injured by acts of terrorism overseas.   Further, the underlying bill will strengthen both internal and  congressional oversight over the various components of the intelligence  community.   Our government's most fundamental responsibilities are to defend the  American people from harm and to protect their liberty. To grasp the  weight of these duties, one need only review the preamble of the  Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, the reality is that Americans continue to face  increasingly sophisticated cyber threats from foreign states and  nonstate actors alike. This legislation recognizes the need to ensure  that the United States maintains a tactical advantage in the cyber  dimension by giving the intelligence community the ability to recruit  the very best talent in the field.   This legislation gives the intelligence community the ability to  provide increased pay for certain employees who have unique skills to  lend to critical cyber missions.   Cyber criminals and other foreign intelligence agencies have  increasingly focused on two critical areas of U.S. national security:  our energy infrastructure and our election systems. Thanks to the work  of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, this legislation  will bolster our defense of both areas.   Specifically, this legislation will require the Director of National  Intelligence to electronically publish an unclassified advisory report  on foreign counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to election  campaigns for Federal office. It will also create an Infrastructure  Security Center within the Department of Energy to coordinate  intelligence on significant threats.   We must have the tools to combat these threats, and that includes  skilled personnel who know how to navigate these challenges. Whether  bad actors hone in on our energy resources, election systems, or other  strengths, this legislation takes steps to ensure we have the people we  need fighting the forces menacing our Nation.   With these improvements in place, those responsible for our Nation's  critical infrastructure will have better intelligence with which to  protect it.   To provide for our common defense, the dedicated men and women of the  intelligence community work tirelessly to thwart the efforts of our  foreign adversaries, which range from terrorists to foreign states to  nuclear proliferators.   Many in the intelligence community have seen their work in  furtherance of the global war on terror and other missions around the  world land them in harm's way. This bill recognizes the commitment of  these brave men and women, many whose names we will never know.    Finally, the importance of the intelligence community's work and the  inherently secretive nature of its mission necessitate vigilant  oversight of these activities. This bill will increase the intelligence  community's accountability to Congress by requiring reports on numerous  issues, including investigations of leaks of classified information and  security clearance processing timelines.   Importantly, it will further bolster intelligence oversight by  requiring the intelligence community and the Department of Defense to  develop a framework for assessing the numerous roles, missions, and  functions of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It will also require the  FBI to provide quarterly counterintelligence briefings to the  congressional intelligence committees.   This legislation will ensure that America remains safe, and it will  ensure that American liberties are protected in the process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there are several issues here. And to clarify, in being  one of the members there yesterday and one spoken of, I think there is  an issue of when there is a concern by a member. This has been beyond  Mrs. Torres coming to the committee, and has been before and when Mr.  Hastings and I have been there, many times, when we have issues with  the question, the procedure is to stop and to ask the chairman to  suspend the question.   This is what was happening yesterday, because there was a concern  that the question was impugning the integrity of the chairman. There  needed to be clarification. That was a simple--no matter what member  may have asked it. That was the discussion that then continued from  there.   Also, though, in the past 4 months, there have been 16 times that the  chairman has sent a designee from their committee to testify before the  Rules Committee and 14 times that the ranking member has sent a  designee. Sending a designee from the committee of jurisdiction is  common practice, and the chairman stated at the top of the meeting that  that was what was going to be taking place.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, the understanding was not--and  my intention at that point in discussing this was not to stop the  questioning, but it is in the concern for the integrity of the  question.   You and I have talked before in our committee, and when we have  said--and you have asked the chairman for clarification, that was my  intention in that and that was my entire intention in that, and from  there, the chairman took action from there.   I think the interesting thing in here is the chairman did, at the  start of the meeting, say that Mr. Nunes would be leaving. That was  stated up front and there was no objection at that point for him doing  so.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a time when we come to the floor and debate  great things. Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, you actually find out things that  you did not know, and I now found out that my friend from Florida's  middle name is Lamar as we go forward.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for legislation that does what we  came here to do, and that is to protect our Nation and preserve our  civil liberties. The underlying legislation goes a step further than  simply reauthorizing critical programs. It takes a hard look, and a  smart look, at how we can strengthen programs, better respond to new  and existing threats, and conduct vigorous, effective oversight of the  intelligence community, while ensuring it has the resources it needs to  serve American citizens well.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to supporting this rule and the  underlying bill to strengthen public safety, protect our Nation and the  American people, and to guard our civil liberties.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
