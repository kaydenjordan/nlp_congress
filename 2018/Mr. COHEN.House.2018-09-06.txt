 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill for scheduling this Special  Order. It is most appropriate that we meet here and we talk about John  McCain, whose elected political career started in this House with two  terms in the House of Representatives.   I spent most of my life as an elected legislator, 39 years, and I  value my service. I think highly of people who take the oath of office  and support it and make people think that government is an honorable  profession and encourage younger generations to get involved because  they set good examples.   John McCain was one of those people who set a good example for  American citizens to think well of their government, to think well of  their leaders, and to desire to serve in public office.   John McCain was a person I only had a few opportunities to interact  with, and each of those opportunities are ones I will never forget. He  was as nice and kind as he could be.   But I knew him from his career. We didn't always agree. He was a  conservative and a Republican. But when he was wrong, he learned and he  changed, and that is a great sign of a human being, to be able to  continually evolve and become a better human being.   When he was running for President, he wasn't able, in South Carolina,  in 2000, to come out against the Confederate flag, but he later knew it  was wrong, came out against it and admitted his mistake.   He learned about campaign finance and worked with Russ Feingold on  campaign finance reform, and on that, he was a maverick.   And he was a maverick on climate change. He recognized science and  the need to preserve our planet.   He recognized the need to have reasonable and good immigration laws  to not only protect our borders, but to give others an opportunity to  come to this country and continue to make our country greater, because  what we are is a country of immigrants that has benefited from the  brainpower and hard work of immigrants who have sought a better home  for themselves and their families.   John McCain was courageous as a military leader in Vietnam when he  [[Page H7916]]  was in prison, but he was courageous as a politician. When he stood up  to the lady that condemned Barack Obama and was trying to throw  scurrilous remarks about Barack Obama--in her mind they were  scurrilous--John McCain, the candidate, could have just gone on and let  it pass and moved to the next subject, but he didn't because he had  character and he had a soul. And he stopped and he told the lady: ``No.  You are wrong. Barack Obama is a good man. He is a good family man.''  And he spoke well of his opponent, something that we have not seen in  recent Presidential elections, a Presidential candidate who rose above  the fight and realized that Barack Obama and he were both Americans and  on the same team even though he wanted to be President rather than  Barack Obama.   There is so much that John McCain did. And when he came and did that  famous thumbs-down on the ACA--yes, I was for the ACA, so I liked that  a lot. I don't know if he did that because of the fact that the Senate  wasn't following their rules and regular order, which was a good reason  not to be for it, or if it was because he had recently found out that  he had brain cancer and was undergoing a horrific health experience  that he did face with great courage, but he saw that he had had the  best medical treatment available, and I suspect he had to think about  Americans who needed health insurance if they came into the same  situation that he had experienced.   That showed he had empathy and he could grow and vote in a way as a  human being and not just as a party person, because of others who  suffer from health afflictions.   I watched every minute of the services in Phoenix, here in  Washington, and was inspired--inspired--by Meghan McCain and her  remarks and the two Presidents who were his opponents who spoke so well  of him, and others.                                time  1845    I am sorry I couldn't attend those services on Saturday. I will be in  Annapolis, Maryland, and I will visit his grave and pay my respects in  person. He was a great American, and he was courageous. We are lucky he  came our way.   Fair winds and following seas, John McCain.
