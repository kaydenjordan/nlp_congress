 Mr. Speaker, the young lady behind me is Cathy Goodman.  Cathy is the first school nurse at Settlers Way Elementary, and she is  still that nurse 25 years later.   Why stay for 25 years? To quote Cathy: ``My ministry began when SWE  opened its doors and I stepped through them. I knew that I'd come  home.''   Cathy's ministry involved my daughter, Kate. That 10-year-old little  girl  [[Page H3466]]  left the only life she ever knew when we moved back home in August of  2007. Every day during Kate's first month of school, we got a call. She  had an upset stomach and was sent to see the school nurse, Cathy.   Cathy turned on her ministry and became Kate's best friend--problem  solved.   Thank you, Cathy Goodman, for your unending love and faith. May God  always bless you like you always blessed us.                            ____________________
