 Mr. Speaker, I apologize for missing the votes on  February 2, 2021, regarding the passage of the previous question and  rule providing for consideration of H. Con. Res. 11 and H.R. 447. I  missed these votes because I was with my son as he signed his offer to  play collegiate football. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 19, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 20.       members recorded pursuant to house resolution 8, 117th congress       Axne (Stevens)      Barragan (Beyer)      Bowman (Clark (MA))      Buchanan (Arrington)      Cardenas (Gomez)      Carson (Butterfield)      Cartwright (Doyle, Michael F.)
