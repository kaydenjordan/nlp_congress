 ROSE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of a payroll tax holiday.   As we consider providing additional direct assistance to Americans, a  payroll tax holiday would be a logical way to encourage folks to get  back to work and help stimulate the economy.   Suspending the payroll tax would ease the impact of the government- imposed economic shutdown. By allowing small businesses to keep more of  their hard-earned money, we enable them to reinvest in operations and  avoid employee layoffs.   Direct assistance through a payroll tax holiday would reduce  potential fraud, as individuals must be verified employees to receive  the benefit. I believe this commonsense solution would boost the great  American comeback that is already underway.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider a payroll tax holiday  in any future relief bill.                            ____________________
