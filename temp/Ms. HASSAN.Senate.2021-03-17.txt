 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize  Bisson's Sugar House, a New Hampshire institution that is celebrating  its 100th anniversary. March is Maple Month in New Hampshire, where  maple producers across our State produce more than 90,000 gallons of  maple syrup, and the Bisson family represents three generations of this  great and tasty tradition.   Lazzare Bisson and his nephew Armand found Bisson's Sugar House in  Berlin in 1921, and ran the business together successfully for 15  years. Lazzare then passed the business on to Armand and his wife,  Juliette. In 1953, they constructed a new sugar house to support their  growing business, and since then, they have welcomed families from New  Hampshire and beyond to see their work each spring.   The Bisson family has prioritized preserving the traditional sugaring  experience, while also modernizing their operations in order to provide  high-quality, delicious maple products to their customers. Each year,  the Bisson family taps more than 3,000 trees, and they still boil their  sap on a wood-fired evaporator built by Armand and Juliette more than  50 years ago. During the height of the sugaring season in March and  April, they make candy with the same evaporator they have used since  the 1940s.   Since 1988, Bisson's Sugar House has been run by Armand and Juliette  Bisson's niece Muriel and her husband Lucien Blais. For many families,  an annual trip to Bisson's Sugar House marks the beginning of spring.  As the sugar business has passed from generation to generation, the  Bisson family's work has encouraged Granite Staters to treasure our  past and embrace the future.   I hope you will join me in celebrating the 100th anniversary of  Bisson's Sugar House and sending them best wishes for a successful  harvest and many more years of sharing their traditions with the people  of New Hampshire.                            ____________________
