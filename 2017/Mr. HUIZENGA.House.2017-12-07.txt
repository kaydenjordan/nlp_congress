 Mr. Speaker, I come down here again finding myself in a  position, not planning on speaking. I am down here to speak on a bill  that I have on the floor--a bipartisan bill, I might add. I can't help  but address what I am hearing from the other side.   First you are hearing: This is getting rushed through. We need to  slow this down. We need to be thoughtful.   I ran in 2010 talking about tax reform. Many of my colleagues ran in  2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 talking about tax reform and the need for  it. Even President Obama talked about this, when he was saying we  needed to lower the corporate rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent.  Why? Because we are uncompetitive. We are uncompetitive as a country.   Now you are hearing the other side saying: Wait a minute. Wait a  minute. We have to slow this down, slow the whole train down.   What they want to do is protect the status quo. They want to protect  the status quo, which I believe is unacceptable.   We know that there is great agreement between the House version and  the Senate version, delivering $24,000 on a standard deduction, which  is going to bring real tax relief to working families; making sure that  pass-throughs, those small businesses, those S-corporations and LLCs  and sole proprietorships, actually get treated better and, at the  least, the same way that a C-corporation would.   Here we are on the cusp of making sure that we advance the ball.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and classmate from  Georgia, Mr. Woodall, for the opportunity to be here.  [[Page H9725]]    Mr. Speaker, more and more baby boomers retire every day, and it has  been estimated that approximately $10 trillion of privately owned,  small, and family-run businesses will either be closed or, if possible,  sold to a new generation of entrepreneurs in the coming years.   Mergers and acquisitions--or M&A as it is oftentimes referred to-- brokers play a critical role in facilitating the transfer of ownership  of these smaller, privately held companies. However, today's one-size- fits-all system of broker-dealer regulation unnecessarily burdens  business sellers and buyers with the pass-through of heavy regulatory  compliance costs that do not provide significant incremental benefits  in privately negotiated M&A transactions.   Today, Federal securities regulations technically require local  mergers and acquisitions brokers to be registered and regulated by the  Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA, just like Wall Street  investment bankers. Those bankers are trying to sell or buy publicly  traded companies. That is right; anyone brokering the sale of a  hometown small business in your district or in mine, like in Holland,  Michigan, must be federally registered and regulated as a securities  broker-dealer, in addition to State law requirements, regardless of the  size of the business or the sale transaction.   Federal securities regulation was primarily designed to protect  passive investors and public securities markets. Privately negotiated  mergers and acquisitions transactions facilitated by these small  business brokers are vastly different and do not typically relate to  the transactions meant to be protected by the SEC and FINRA regulation  and registration.   That is why I have continued to introduce bipartisan legislation  known as the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage  Simplification Act. This bipartisan bill would create a simplified  system for brokers performing services in connection with the transfer  of ownership of smaller, privately held companies.   I would like to thank Representatives Sherman and Maloney, along with  the work of Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for what they  have done. And as my friend from Georgia had pointed out, not every day  do we have to just keep kicking each other in the shins. We actually  can work together, and this is an example of doing that.   So the impact of this legislation would significantly reduce  transaction costs, promote competition among these small business  brokers, and facilitate private businesses and acquisitions of these  small businesses.   This initiative promotes economic growth and development through  these sales, and there is really substantial relief of regulatory  burdens on small business professionals who serve these smaller  business owners.   Business brokerage services are critically important to entrepreneurs  who start, build, and eventually want to sell their private companies.  Similarly, these services help new entrepreneurs acquire these  businesses, while helping existing companies grow, thus preserving and  creating jobs in the communities that we all serve.   We have worked very closely with our colleagues across the aisle, and  this has been a multi--not just multiyear--a multi-Congress effort over  the last few different Congresses, and I am just pleased today that we  can show the American people positive, effective, bipartisan work that  is coming together.   It is legislation like H.R. 477 that demonstrates, frankly, that  Congress can act in a bipartisan manner to positively impact the lives  of Americans, and I urge swift consideration and passage of this  important bill.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's hard work on  this.   The mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect  investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and  facilitate capital formation. As part of that mission, the SEC was  mandated by law to conduct an annual forum focusing on small business  capital formation.   For nearly a decade, the SEC Government-Business Forum on Small  Business Capital Formation has highlighted the merger and acquisition  broker proposal as one of its top recommendations to help small  businesses.   The MAB proposal would address securities regulation of business  brokers  [[Page H9741]]  and merger and acquisition advisers who are in the business of  facilitating the purchase and sale of privately held small companies.  This proposal would significantly reduce their Federal regulation  compliance costs, which can initially exceed $150,000 per broker and,  after that, cost $75,000 per additional year. However, the SEC has  never acted on this, despite their recommendation.   As we see more and more baby boomers retire, it has been estimated  that $10 trillion--with a T--of equity is locked up into these small,  family-owned typically privately held businesses.   Today the Federal securities regulations require an M&A broker to be  registered and regulated by the SEC and FINRA just like a Wall Street  investment banker buying or selling publicly traded companies.   Anyone who is trying to sell a hometown business, like a family  hardware store, a jewelry store, or even a pizza parlor, suddenly has  to be treated like they are being sold or bought by a Wall Street  investment bank regardless of their size. We don't think that is right.   But the impact of this legislation is meaningful because it reduces  transaction costs, promoting competition among those small business  brokers and facilitating private business merger, acquisitions, and  sales of these small businesses. This small business initiative  promotes economic growth and development.   So we have worked very closely across the aisle with our colleagues,  and I thank them. Even in today's politically charged environment that  we have, it is nice to show the American people that we can actually do  some positive, efficient, and effective initiatives with bipartisan  support.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives Posey, Higgins,  Sherman, and Maloney, as well as Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member  Waters for their efforts to reach a bipartisan consensus and to get the  important legislation across the finish line.   I have been working on this now for three Congresses, and we believe  that we have a very positive spot here where we can all support this. I  want to encourage my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 477 and  demonstrate that Congress can actually work in a bipartisan manner and  get some things done for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address  the amendment and the work of Mr. Sherman, Mrs. Maloney, the ranking  member, and, obviously, our chairman as well. So I do agree and accept  this amendment as a friendly amendment.   It does confirm what the no-action letter has put in place. I believe  it properly makes sure that the SEC's role is preserved but that  Congress has its imprimatur on this as well. It aligns the bill with  the principles outlined in the SEC's no-action letter.   I think this is a good, reasonable amendment. I am pleased to work  with the gentleman from California as well. I am glad that we can get  this settled in a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
