 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, talk continues to swirl about eliminating  the legislative filibuster here in the U.S. Senate. The Democratic  leader has threatened that if Republicans don't vote the way he wants  them to vote on legislation, eliminating the filibuster will be on the  table.   In an interview where he issued his threat, the Democratic leader  made it very clear that he is not inviting Republicans to work with  Democrats on legislation. This isn't an invitation for both parties to  sit down at the table and arrive at an agreement that both parties can  support. No. This is an invitation for Republicans to support exactly  what Democrats want or face the consequences.   It is ironic that the Democratic leader would be taking that position  today because this is what he was saying back in 2017 about the  legislative filibuster. This is the Democratic leader saying the  ``legislative filibuster'' is ``the most important distinction between  the Senate and the House. Let's find a way to further protect the 60- vote rule for legislation.''   So the Democratic leader was very supportive of this back in 2017,  when they were using it extensively to try and stop or slow Republican  legislation.   The assistant Democratic leader, the Democratic whip, Senator Durbin  from Illinois, said this in January 2018:         I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it       was originally devised and created going back to our Founding       Fathers.    ``[G]oing back to our Founding Fathers,'' referencing the legislative  filibuster and how important it was historically here in the U.S.  Senate.   Well, about that same time, 2017, 61 Senators out of 100 here in the  U.S. Senate--61 out of 100 Senators--signed a letter in which they  supported retention of the legislative filibuster. In fact, it goes on  to say:         We are writing to urge you--    And this is to the Senate leaders at the time, Senators McConnell and  Schumer--       to support our efforts to preserve existing rules, practices,       and traditions as they pertain to the right of Members to       engage in extended debate on legislation before the United       States Senate. Senators have expressed a variety of opinions       about the appropriateness of limiting debate when we are  [[Page S1684]]       considering judicial and executive branch nominations.       Regardless of our past disagreements on that issue, we are       united in our determination to preserve the ability of       Members to engage in extended debate when bills are on the       Senate floor.    Sixty-one Senators, including over 30 Democrats, on record as  recently as 2017 in support of the legislative filibuster--over 30  Democratic Senators, including the Democratic leader and the Democratic  whip.   Well, what has changed? Because now they have done an abrupt  reversal, a complete 180. I mean, they are spinning around so fast, it  makes your eyes glaze over. What an incredible versatility of  conviction they have demonstrated on this issue.   And you think about the reason for it. What are they arguing? Well,  they are saying the Republicans have been misusing the filibuster. That  is a little bit ironic, given the fact that Republicans have been in  the majority for the past 6 years. Republicans took the majority in  January of 2015 and held it until January of 2021.   So the past 6 years it has been the Democrats who were in the  minority. They would be the ones exercising the legislative filibuster,  and they used it extensively. They used it extensively last year to  block legislation, repeatedly, over and over and over again.   And Republicans, at the time, were under a lot of pressure to get rid  of the legislative filibuster, including by the President of the United  States, over and over and over, saying Republicans need to get rid of  the legislative filibuster.   Republicans, being consistent in thei position--the 61 Senators,  Republicans who signed this letter, including me, have been consistent  in our position, even when we were in the majority, even when the  Democrats were using the filibuster to block legislation that we were  trying to advance, that we needed to maintain the filibuster because it  was important to the institution of the Senate, and it required  bipartisan cooperation. It required a level of comity to get  legislation passed, and it made sure that the minority was represented  in legislative solutions that were produced by the U.S. Senate. We have  been consistent in that position, even when it meant taking on our  administration, our President--over, over, and over again.    So the Democrats' argument now is that we have to get rid of the  legislative filibuster because Republicans have been misusing it. How  was that even possible? We were in the majority. The legislative  filibuster is a tool used by the minority. It was used by the Democrats  over and over and over again the past 6 years, but their argument now  is that the Senate is not functioning, the Senate is not producing  legislation? Really?   Last year, Republicans were in the majority. We passed out of the  Senate five coronavirus relief bills with huge bipartisan majorities-- huge bipartisan majorities--responding to the greatest crisis facing  this country, both health crisis and economic crisis.   We responded to it in a bipartisan way, honoring the rules and the  traditions of the Senate, which were created by the Founders to make  the Senate a place unique in all the world, where the rights of the  minority are honored, which required cooperation and working together  to get results.   And we produced results, in spite of the fact that Democrats  consistently filibustered legislation. Now, there were certain pieces  of legislation we didn't get passed. We didn't pass policing reform.  Senator Tim Scott offered a piece of legislation that included all  kinds of provisions that would have addressed that important issue for  our country, and the Democrats filibustered it, over and over and over  again. So we didn't get the 60 votes to get policing reform across the  finish line.   But it is incredibly ironic. I mean, hypocrisy is not something that  is unknown in politics, but hypocrisy on this level is unprecedented.  The Democratic leader, the Democratic whip, and over 30 Democratic  Senators have said as recently as 2 years ago, 3 years ago, that we  need to preserve the legislative filibuster because it is true to the  tradition of the Senate and what the Founders intended in terms of the  role that the Senate was supposed to play in our democracy.   And here we are, 2 or 3 years later, not because the Republicans had  been misusing the filibuster, because the Republicans have been in the  majority. We have been fending off the use of the filibuster by  Democrats. They had no problems with the filibuster when they were  using it as a tool at their disposal to block Republican initiatives.   The first CARES bill they filibustered multiple times, and it forced  us to sit down with them and forge a compromise that, in the end, got  96 out of 100 votes in the U.S. Senate. But now the shoe is on the  other foot. They are in the majority, and they have got all these  things they want to get done, all this pent-up agenda.   I would argue that what is happening here is all the outside groups,  all the leftwing groups that have all these things they want to get  done, all of a sudden have concluded that notwithstanding their use of  the filibuster to block Republicans from accomplishing their agenda for  the past 6 years, now that the shoe is on the other foot, we are in the  majority and we have got power, we are going to do away with over 200  years of history--200 years of history that was put in place by the  Founders to require the U.S. Senate to be different than the House of  Representatives.   The House of Representatives does everything by simple majority. They  have a Rules Committee. I served for three terms there. They have a  Rules Committee that prescribes, basically, what legislation can come  to the floor, what amendments are made in order, how much time is  allowed for debate on each amendment. Everything is very structured. It  is very organized. It is all done by democratic rule--majority rule,  simple majority rule.   The Senate was created to operate differently by the Founders. And  here we are having a debate about whether we are going to honor that  tradition, that heritage, that legacy, that vision the Founders had  when it came to how the U.S. Senate should operate.   Earlier this month, one Democratic Senator suggested that we should  get rid of the filibuster because it is ``undemocratic.'' Undemocratic.  In other words, it prevents the majority from doing everything it wants  to do. But, as I said on the floor last week, letting the majority do  everything it wants to is not what the Founders had in mind. The  Founders recognized it wasn't just Kings who could be tyrants; they  knew majorities could be tyrants, too, and that a majority, if  unchecked, could trample the rights of the minority. So the Founders  combined majority rule with both representation and constitutional  protection for the minority. They established safeguards--checks and  balances--throughout our government to keep the government in check and  ensure that the rights of the minority were protected, and one of those  safeguards was the Senate.   In the House of Representatives, as I said, majority rule is  emphasized, and the Founders could have left it at that. They could  have stuck with a single legislative body, but they didn't. Why?  Because they were worried about the possibility of tyrannical  majorities in the House endangering the rights of the minority.   The author of Federalist No. 62 notes:         A senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly,       distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must be       in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles       the security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of       two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . .       . Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated       by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to       yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to       be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and       pernicious resolutions.    That is from Federalist No. 62.   So the Founders created the Senate as a check on the House of  Representatives. They made the Senate smaller and Senators' terms of  office longer, with the intention of creating a more stable, more  thoughtful, and more deliberative legislative body to check ill- considered or intemperate legislation and attempts to curtail minority  rights.   As time has gone on, the legislative filibuster has become perhaps  the key way the Senate protects minority rights. The filibuster ensures  that the minority party has a voice in the Senate. It forces  compromise. It forces bipartisanship.   Even in the now rare case when a majority party has a filibuster- proof majority in the Senate, the filibuster still  [[Page S1685]]  forces the majority party to take into account the views of its more  moderate or middle-of-the-road Members, thus ensuring that more  Americans are represented in legislation.   People tend to focus on the fact that the filibuster protects the  country from any one party's most extreme legislation, but the truth  is--the truth is--the filibuster is probably the biggest reason that  any bill in the Senate is ever bipartisan. Routine spending bills, farm  bills, Defense authorization bills--the main reason many of these bills  are ever bipartisan, outside of divided government, is because the  filibuster forces the parties to compromise. Don't believe me? Just  look at how the House has handled these bills in recent years.   Democrats were eager to take advantage of the filibuster's protection  for minority rights when they were in the minority, but now that they  are in the majority, they don't want anything standing in their way.  They don't want to have compromise. They don't want to have to consider  the Americans who didn't vote for a Democratic agenda. They want to do  whatever they want, whenever they want it.   Democrats' disregard for minority rights would be troubling even if  they had a substantial majority in the Senate. The voice of the  minority deserves to be heard even when the minority is substantially  outnumbered. But it is particularly outrageous that Democrats are so  determined to sweep away protections from minority rights when they  barely--barely--have a majority in the Senate and certainly don't have  a mandate. In fact, Democrats don't have a real majority at all; only a  technical one. The Senate is divided 50 to 50. The only reason  Democrats have a deciding vote in the Senate is because the Vice  President is a Democrat. In the House, Democrats' majority narrowed  substantially in the November election.   Now, as for the Presidency, while certainly a Democrat won the  election, it is worth noting that the only candidate who could win the  Democratic primary was a man historically regarded as a moderate. Even  among Democrats, Democrats' far-left liberal candidates did not fare so  well.   If there was any mandate in the election, it was a mandate for  moderation. It was a mandate for compromise, for pulling the country  together. But Democrats are running away from unity and bipartisanship  as fast as they can. They are determined to leverage their weak victory  into the implementation of a partisan, far-left agenda.   There are two bills that have driven the conversation around  eliminating the filibuster in recent weeks. They are H.R. 1, an  election bill, and H.R. 5, the so-called Equality Act.   The first bill is a truly outrageous power grab, an attempt to  federalize election law and eliminate protections for election  integrity. Democrats have discarded years of important bipartisan work  on election security and integrity in order to permanently boost  Democrats' chances of winning majorities. The second, the so-called  Equality Act, is an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment that  would substantially restrict the rights of Americans to live by their  faith. These are the bills that Democrats think should be shoved  through by the narrowest of majorities.   There have been suggestions that eliminating the filibuster is the  cure for partisanship and gridlock in the Senate. Well, it might be the  cure for gridlock in the sense that the majority could steamroll  through whatever it wanted, whenever it wanted, but you don't cure  partisanship by making it easier for the majority to be partisan.   Eliminating the filibuster isn't going to eliminate partisanship; it  is going to heighten it. Take away the filibuster, and the majority  party has zero reason--zero--to take into account the views of the  minority. What eliminating the filibuster will do is ensure that one  party has no voice at all in the U.S. Senate, no matter how many  Americans that party represents.   A couple of weeks ago, we got a preview of what life would look like  in a filibuster-less Senate when Democrats passed their so-called COVID  bill under the simple-majority rules of reconciliation There wasn't a  lot of gridlock since reconciliation allowed Senate Democrats to force  their bill through, but there was plenty of partisanship. Democrats  made it very clear that while Republicans were welcome to vote for  their bill, Republican ideas were not welcome at the table.    Democrats knew that they didn't need Republicans to pass their  legislation, which empowered them to completely reject Republican input  in drafting the bill and to load the bill with Democratic priorities,  from a bailout for union pensions, to a State slush fund heavily  weighted in favor of blue States, to the omission of longstanding  Federal restrictions on using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. It  was quite a contrast to the five bipartisan COVID bills passed under  the filibuster rule in a Republican-led Senate, which were focused on  fighting the virus rather than shoving through partisan priorities.   While their recent narrow majority has seemingly erased all memory of  their minority status over the last few years, I encourage my  Democratic colleagues to remember just how much they valued the  legislative filibuster during their time in the minority and how  bitterly they regretted eliminating the judicial filibuster once  President Trump became the beneficiary.   While Democrats might like to think that their time in power will  last forever, it is a truth of American politics that sooner or later,  no matter how powerful your majority, you end up in the minority again.  I encourage my colleagues to think about that time when they will be in  the minority again and to ask themselves whether they really want to  eliminate their voices and the voices of their constituents in future  policy battles.   I yield the floor.
