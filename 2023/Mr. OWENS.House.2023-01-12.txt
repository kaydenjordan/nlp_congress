 Madam Speaker, I thank my teammate for pulling this  together.   Damar Hamlin's fighting spirit and his faith inspired all Americans.   His miraculous recovery has reminded us of the power of prayer. He  has been in the prayers of millions over the last 2 weeks, his  teammates, his opponents, and Americans throughout our country  regardless of race, creed, or color.   As we stand on the House floor today, we see the vision of our  Founders, a promise to become a more perfect Union. It is a celebration  of meritocracy, of a young man whose strength comes from God and his  family.   We have seen our Nation's heart of empathy, one that blesses us with  the opportunity to dream, to struggle, to overcome, and, the ultimate  prize, to inspire and bless others.   God bless Damar, the Hamlin family, his teammates, and the entire  football community.                            ____________________
