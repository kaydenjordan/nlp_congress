 Mr. Speaker, all over the country, millions of Americans  are celebrating Pride Month and our LGBTQIA communities across the  country. In fact, this week I will join tens of thousands of  Washingtonians at our annual Seattle pride events.  [[Page H5098]]    We will come together to support our family, friends, neighbors, and  colleagues; we will come together to celebrate the advancement of LGBTQ  rights in our country; and we will come together to celebrate the  second anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision that  reaffirmed our commitment to the principle of marriage equality in this  country.   But this year, we also come together to acknowledge that we have seen  a spike in hate crimes, an increasing coarseness of public discourse,  and greater fear-mongering for political gain. We have a lot of work to  do.   We intend to protect every advancement that has been made and  continue demanding progress toward full protections in employment and  housing, safety for our transgender brothers and sisters, and equitable  access to healthcare and other services.   There is a lot to celebrate, but much more to do to ensure the  promise of equality for all in our Nation. That is what this month has  been about, and we celebrate it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland,  Representative Raskin.   Mr. Speaker, it is great to have you presiding over the Chamber as  well. It is all of our new Members here, and Representative Khanna from  California, who is going to be taking over as co-chair of this Special  Order hour for the Progressive Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, we have to make sure that the American people understand  exactly what is going on. This is a bill that the Senate has been  negotiating in private. It has been 13 men discussing healthcare for  all Americans across this country in a secret room. That is really what  has been happening.   Today we saw a draft of this bill, and the prevailing wisdom, when  the bill passed the House, was that the Senate would completely revamp  the bill. But according to The New York Times, it said: The Senate bill  ``once promised as a top-to-bottom revamp of the health bill passed by  the House . . . instead maintains its structure, with modest  adjustments.''   It is the same bill. It is the same bill. And in fact, in some ways,  it is a little bit worse because the cuts to Medicaid, while they don't  take effect as quickly and they are more gradual, they are actually  deeper than the House cuts to Medicaid.   There are other things in the bill that have been done, really, in  part, to affect how the American people see the bill but don't change  the basic provisions of this bill.   Part of the reason they delayed the cuts to Medicaid is so that they  hope that they can get a better CBO score, Congressional Budget Office  score, which the American people should know the last time around, the  second time around after the first time the bill was about to come to  the floor and then it got pulled from the floor because there weren't  enough votes in the House, the second time when it did pass, it passed  without a CBO score. It was not scored.   The reason it was not scored was because there was a belief that that  very narrow passage in the House would not happen if Republicans and  Democrats found out that the bill, as ``revised,'' was actually just as  bad.   So the bill that passed the House still took away health insurance  from 23 million Americans. This is where we are today: a bill that has  been crafted in secret but is essentially the same bill.   I have received more than 9,000 calls and letters from constituents  who have been very clear that Congress needs to do all it can to  protect our seniors, to expand Medicaid, and to defend the gains that  have been made over the last 7 years.   And you know what is really ironic about this whole situation is  that, if you think about some of the things that Republicans said about  the Affordable Care Act when it was being passed--here is a quote.   In 2010, Speaker Paul Ryan said: ``After months of twisting arms,  Democratic leaders convinced enough members of their own party to defy  the will of the American people and support the Senate health bill  which was crafted in secret, behind closed doors.''   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: ``When it comes to  solving problems, Americans want us to listen first, and then, if  necessary, offer targeted, step-by-step solutions. Above all, they're  tired of a process that shuts them out. They're tired of giant bills  negotiated in secret, then jammed through on a party-line vote in the  middle of the night.''    That is what Speaker Ryan said and Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell said when the Affordable Care Act was being debated.   But here is the thing: When the Affordable Care Act was being  debated, Democrats actually threw open the doors in Congress. They held  over 100 Senate hearings. I wasn't here. This is based on actual  reports and documents and files from Congress. There were over 100  Senate hearings, 25 consecutive days of consideration, and 161  amendments from Republicans. Many of those amendments were accepted  into the bill.   This is a completely different process. We didn't have a single  hearing on this bill. The bill came to the House floor, and there was  some debate, but it certainly wasn't 100 hearings. It wasn't 25 days of  consideration. There weren't 161 amendments. There weren't any  amendments that were accepted from Democrats because there was no  amendment process.   And now, in the Senate, we are going through the same process where a  bill that is about the healthcare of hundreds of millions of Americans  across this country is about to come to the floor, and they are not  going to accept any amendments, certainly not from the Democratic side.  Maybe they will take a few amendments from the Republicans before it  comes to the floor. I don't know. We will have to see. But there is no  debate on this.   How can we talk about the process of democracy and even of civility  and the ability to work together if we didn't offer the other side a  chance to weigh in?   This bill will take away health insurance from millions of people,  and it will make it less affordable for those who still have insurance  because it is not very different from the House bill, and we already  know that that is what the House bill does.   It would raise out-of-pocket costs for middle class families with  higher  [[Page H5103]]  deductibles and cost sharing. It would essentially defund Planned  Parenthood by blocking people with Medicaid coverage from accessing  preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers for birth control,  cancer screenings, and STD treatment and testing. And it would cut the  essential health benefits protections.   Now, what are the essential health benefits protections? We talk  about that phrase, but a lot of Americans don't know exactly what that  means. So here is what it means.   It means that if you buy insurance, then you can be assured that that  insurance is going to cover certain things. It will cover, for example,  hospitalization. It will cover if you get cancer. It will cover some of  your treatments that you need for cancer, certain things that are  included in that. Mental healthcare is part of that essential health  benefits coverage.   That is what it means. Otherwise, an insurance company can sell you  something, and it can even say we cover, you know, X, Y, and Z, but  when you get to the hospital because you are sick, you will find out  that it doesn't actually cover hospitalization.   So this was an attempt to say, there is sort of an essential  understanding, an essential set of things that would be covered. We  will guarantee you that they will be covered if you buy insurance.   Now, I want to talk about Medicaid for a second, because this is one  of the biggest travesties of the bill that is being proposed by the  Republicans in the Senate.   This bill would literally decimate Medicaid. And between the Medicaid  cut of over $800 billion in the healthcare bill in the Senate and the  budget cut that is proposed of over $600 billion, let me be clear that  we are talking about almost a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid through  these two mechanisms.   I want to talk about what Medicaid is because a lot of people might  think that Medicaid just covers poor folks, which, frankly, I think we  should cover poor folks. Let's be clear about that. But I want to tell  you what Medicaid actually covers.   It covers half of all the births in the United States. It covers  insurance for one in five Americans. It covers treatment for 220,000  recovering people with drug disorders, including those who suffer from  opioid abuse. It covers 1.6 million patients, mostly women, who get  cancer screenings, and STD testing. It covers 64 percent of all nursing  home residents. It covers 30 percent of all adults with disabilities.  It covers 39 percent of all kids in this country and 60 percent of kids  with disabilities.   So if you cut half of Medicaid, which is what a $1.5 trillion cut to  Medicaid would include--it would be half of what we spend on Medicaid  today--a program that covers 74 million Americans across this country,  38 million Americans would lose their coverage.   No wonder, as Mr. Raskin said, this healthcare bill has had such low  approval ratings in the House, and now it is the same bill in the  Senate.   Americans understand that whether you live in blue America or red  America, whether you live in rural America or urban America, whether  you are a man or a woman or a child, whether you are young or old, one  of the great things about this country is that we are a country that  believes in trying to provide for people when they get sick.    Now, we have been trying to do that for a long time, and until the  Obama administration and the Congress passed the Affordable Care Act,  we weren't doing that. But in Washington State, my home State, when we  passed the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion allowed us to cover  an additional 600,000 people across our State. We cut the uninsured  rate in half, and we created over 22,000 jobs across the State,  including in rural areas.   So what we need to do now is to stop this bill from moving forward  because it would be bad for the American people. It is that simple. It  is going to kick Grandma out of her nursing home. It is going to stop a  kid with asthma from getting an inhaler. It is going to put a premium  on being an elder American. If you are an older American, you are going  to pay four to five times as much as anybody else. Why? You just have  to ask why.   So who benefits from this bill? This bill is a transfer of wealth  from middle class Americans to the wealthiest Americans, corporations  in this country. So this is about tax cuts for the richest. Sheldon  Adelson, who is a Republican donor, casino magnate, he will get, if the  Senate bill passes, he will get a $44 million tax cut in 2017 alone.   How are they paying for that? By cutting Medicaid, taking away  protections for preexisting conditions, for seniors, for average  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, that is just not right. It is not right if you are a  Democrat. It is not right if you are a Republican. It is not right if  you are an Independent. It is just not right.   And, yes, the President is correct on this point: It is a mean bill.  It is mean; it is cruel; it is unjust. And I hope we defeat it.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.                                time  1745
