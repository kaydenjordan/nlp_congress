 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and my  friend, the chairman of the committee.   We often agree on things in the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, but there are times when our disagreements are huge, and  this is one of those times.   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 1430. We have seen this  bill in the last Congress, when it was called the Secret Science Reform  Act. It was a lousy bill then, and it is still a lousy bill today.   Let's start with the name of this bill, Mr. Speaker, the HONEST Act,  but it really should be called the dishonest act. That is because this  bill improperly describes what is going on at the EPA, which is  looking to protect our environment from extreme weather events that we  have in Colorado, throughout the country, and around the world.    The EPA is working to protect our clean air and our clean water, and  has demonstrably improved our communities and the health of America  since 1970.   I wish I could say these attacks today and tomorrow on the EPA and  scientific research are isolated, but unfortunately they are not.  Earlier today, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a  hearing on climate science. I was astonished at what I heard from the  majority Republican Party calling into question whether climate change  is happening, and whether it is caused by humans. All this serves is to  attack scientific research and jeopardize the progress we have made to  combat climate change and protect our communities.   Just yesterday, President Trump issued an executive order to further  roll back progress that we have made over the last 8 years. The  executive order tries to dismantle the Clean Power Plan and many other  important protections from the Obama administration which were worked  on based on the best available science and through an open and  deliberate process, gathering millions of comments along the way. The  fact is, investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is good for  our national security, good for our environment, and good for jobs.   I believe we can do both--improve our energy independence and create  good-paying jobs--at the same time. Colorado has been a leader in  reducing harmful emissions, improving energy efficiency, and investing  in clean energy, and we have realized substantial economic benefits for  Colorado through innovation, research and development, and the creation  of good-paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, we need to do better. This House and the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee need to take their heads out of the sand and  stop ignoring what is going on across the country and across the world.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated March 8, 2017,  from the American Geophysical Union.                                     American Geophysical Union,                                                      March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: On behalf       of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and its more than       60,000 members, I am writing to express concerns about the       Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (HONEST       Act) and the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.       We encourage you and your colleagues to take additional time       to evaluate the unintended consequences of these bills before       the bills move forward.        Although we appreciate the HONEST Act's protections for       confidential information, we remain concerned about several       provisions in the bill. For example, requirements in the bill       for the use of ``best available science,'' ``data,'' and       ``reproducible'' do not have uniform applications across all       disciplines.        With respect to reproducibility of research, some       scientific research involves longitudinal studies that are so       large and of great duration that they could not realistically       be reproduced. The same may be true for scientific data from       a one-time event (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill)       where the data is gathered in real time. We're concerned that       in these situations the EPA could be constrained from using       important or relevant research in making decisions.        The legislation could also impose costs on recipients of       federal research grants where the research results are       expected to be ``relied on to support a covered action.'' The       bill is not clear on whether it is the EPA's or the research       institution's responsibility to cover the costs associated       with sharing and archiving this information.        We are also troubled by the implications of the EPA Science       Advisory Board Reform Act. As an organization that represents       scientists from broad backgrounds and expertise, we       appreciate the attempt to ensure a diverse panel of       scientific knowledge and perspectives, and support the bill's       goal of increasing accountability and transparency for       scientific advisors. However, because the bill would exclude       some scientists with substantial expertise in their fields       from the Science Advisory Board (SAB), the SAB would suffer       from the exclusion of valuable insight. The purpose of the       SAB is to review the quality and robustness of scientific       data that informs EPA's regulatory process. It is imperative       that the SAB comprise the most expert, independent scientists       and technical advisors to best fulfill that mission.        AGU looks forward to working with you on these critical       issues in the future.            With best wishes,                                                    Lexi Shultz,                                         Director of Public Affairs,                                        American Geophysical Union.
