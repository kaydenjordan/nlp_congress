 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to  speak.   Mr. Speaker, I am actually a little bit confused. I thought this was  supposed to be a debate on a rule dealing with overturning onerous EPA  regulations. Instead, our colleagues on the left want to talk about  something totally nongermane and change the subject. And then we wonder  why the American people get so frustrated that this institution can't  seem to address its big issues.                                time  1300    I also heard a little bit ago an impassioned claim by my colleague on  the left over here that the legislation that we are talking about today  somehow flies in the face of the courts. That is not true because the  courts have already overturned this regulation one time and set it  aside, and it has cost the industries millions and millions of dollars  that they shouldn't have had to spend.   I also heard it claimed that it flies in the face of commonsense,  science-based evidence. That is not true because, if it were, then the  courts wouldn't have made the decision to set it aside in the first  place.   H.R. 1917, the BRICK Act, is about regulatory common sense, Mr.  Speaker, but it is also about preserving good-paying jobs in rural  communities across America. Brickmakers and tile manufacturers are  primarily small businesses, and their product is critical for our  infrastructure. They have built some of the most iconic towns and  buildings across America, and this bill will help ensure that these  small businesses are able to continue to do exactly that.   The EPA's current Brick MACT rule, finalized in 2015, would impose  millions of dollars in costs on these small businesses, all before  judicial review of the rule is complete. And while the EPA, under the  former administration, estimates that the annual costs to comply with  the rule will be about $25 million, other estimates have projected the  annual costs to be up to $100 million or greater.   For a facility with two kilns, which is the industry average, the  costs are estimated to be $4.4 million. Securing capital for these  projects will be very difficult, and some worry that it will simply not  be available considering that these compliance costs will not improve  plant productivity nor help its bottom line. What is worse is that  these costs are over and above the tens of millions of dollars spent by  the industry to comply with an earlier version of the rule vacated by  the D.C. Circuit Court in 2007.   H.R. 1917 simply allows for the consideration and completion of any  judicial review regarding the 2015 regulation before requiring  compliance. For an industry that has faced so much regulatory  uncertainty, through rules, vacated rules, and now new regulation, H.R.  1917 will help inject a bit of much-needed regulatory certainty back  into this industry.   Additionally, this bill provides regulatory relief for our wood  heater manufacturers, which helps provide an affordable source of heat  for many low-income and rural households. EPA regulations set to take  effect in 2020 are causing some manufacturers to already lay off  workers. This industry needs more time to comply, and a provision  within H.R. 1917 will simply extend that compliance deadline from 2020  to 2023. If left unchanged, product choice will diminish, prices will  rise, and more jobs will be lost.   Mr. Speaker, we must ensure our Federal agencies are not needlessly  regulating companies out of business. Brick manufacturers have suffered  heavy losses since the recession, losing about 45 percent of jobs  between 2005 and 2012. Increased compliance costs from these EPA  regulations will only lead to more job losses and consolidations within  this primarily family-owned business industry.   We owe this industry regulatory certainty. I urge my colleagues to  support this rule and to support H.R. 1917 because, if we don't, if the  brick industry gets shut down because of these onerous rules, we are  going to start building buildings, Mr. Speaker, out of straw and sticks  instead of bricks.    Mr. Speaker, the majority of U.S. brick and  ceramic plants are small, family-owned operations, often located in  rural communities that depend on the plant for their very livelihood,  for the good-paying jobs. They have built some of the most recognizable  buildings, cities, and towns in existence across America, including  many within my district in eastern and southeastern Ohio.   Unfortunately, these industries have borne the brunt of an  unpredictable regulatory process that is nearly two decades in the  making. In 2003, the EPA required brickmakers to install expensive new  equipment to comply with the Agency's Maximum Achievable Control  Technology, or their MACT rule.   In 2007, after companies spent millions to implement these controls,  the U.S. Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit vacated the rule. Our  brickmakers now find themselves in a very similar situation today. In  2015, the EPA again finalized a rule requiring the industry to once  again invest in similar control equipment technologies.   Additionally, this new regulation uses the emission reductions  achieved under the vacated regulation as a baseline for further  emission reductions. In other words, the EPA, under the former  administration, chose not to recognize the great strides this industry  achieved under the previously vacated rule. The Agency neglected to  take this past regulatory and compliance history into consideration.   Mr. Speaker, that is simply not right. The bill before us today, H.R.  1917, the BRICK Act, ensures history does not repeat itself. This  legislation simply allows for the consideration and completion of any  judicial review regarding the 2015 regulation before requiring  compliance.   Now, some of my colleagues across the aisle say they are worried that  this legislation sets a dangerous precedent. Many of these same  colleagues are also quick to recognize the very unique regulatory  situation this industry finds itself in. They even go so far as to say  they are sympathetic to the unique situation.                                time  1415    However, they are unwilling to support this bill that simply extends  the compliance deadlines, which would give the brick and tile  industries a bit of regulatory certainty while the courts complete  their work.   Mr. Speaker, that logic baffles me. We need a bit of pragmatism when  we approach this situation. Because if you really want to talk about a  dangerous precedent, consider this: this new regulation also caps the  economic productivity of the clay ceramics industry. While the former  administration admitted that this regulation will not reduce emissions  emitted by the industry, it decided to set new emission standards  through regulations anyway.   Regulating an industry for no immediate reason or environmental  benefit? Now that is a dangerous precedent. Brick manufacturers have  suffered heavy losses since the recession, shedding 45 percent of jobs  between 2005 and 2012, and these increased compliance costs from EPA  regulations are driving more job losses and consolidations within this  primarily family-owned industry.   Brick plant owners already struggle to obtain financing for plant  modernization projects, and brick companies estimate that this rule  will cost as much as $100 million a year to comply. Many are worried  that the financing needed to comply with this most recent reiteration  of this rule will not be available, considering that the required  control equipment will not improve plant productivity, nor help the  bottom line.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation  today, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to  quickly address this issue. I know some recent bipartisan progress has  been made in the Senate between Senator Wicker and Senator Donnelly,  and I am very encouraged by that progress.   I am hopeful that this vote today will help push the Senate to act  and act sooner than later. The compliance deadlines are quickly  approaching, and we need a solution now to this important issue.  Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, we are in danger of having to build buildings  in America out of sticks and straw, or, worse yet, out of bricks  imported from foreign countries.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
