 Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), the ranking member on the Subcommittee of the  Constitution and Civil Justice.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I will read from the bill, page 25 of  their legislation.   The previous speaker, Madam Speaker, is just flat-out wrong. Here is  what it says: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act shall not--shall  not--provide a claim or a defense to a claim under the legislation or  provide a basis for challenging the application of this bill.   They put it in the bill. You can't use the standards set forth in  RFRA that was passed. You can't even use that as a defense. It is  spelled out in the legislation.   As my colleague from Louisiana said, the very first right mentioned  in the very first amendment to the Constitution, in the very first  amendment of the Bill of Rights, is your right to practice your faith  the way you see fit. And they put in their legislation: No, you can't.  No, you can't.   That is what is in the bill. That is why they didn't want a hearing,  as previous speakers said, because they didn't want us to be able to  talk about this in a hearing where you have testimony, witnesses. They  didn't want that.   They come to the floor, and as my colleague from Texas said, give  this a fancy name while they are taking away American citizens' most  fundamental liberty, the liberty the Founders chose to mention the very  first right in the Bill of Rights.   That is why we oppose this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens).    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that a few speakers  ago, the gentleman from Maryland used the term ``religious garb.''   A physician's conscience, a physician's faith, which compels him or  her not to take the life of an unborn child is not religious garb. That  is a deeply held position of conscience and position of faith.   Mr. Speaker, to have a Member from the other side raise that argument  when we have specifically pointed to the First Amendment, pointed to  page 25 of the bill, which says ``the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  will not apply,'' is ridiculous.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, could I inquire about the amount of time  remaining on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from the  Log Cabin Republicans opposing the legislation on the floor today.        LCR's official statement:        As part of the Democrats' hard shift to the left, they       continue to trample on the rights and freedoms of all       Americans in the name of equality and `equity.'        Today, House Democrats are ramming through their latest       version of the so-called ``Equality Act.'' We opposed this       legislation in the past, and we oppose it as it stands today.       This is a partisan piece of legislation--it has no Republican       cosponsors in the House. And the insidious nature of the       extreme changes it will make would irreparably harm America       and all of the accomplishments we've worked so hard for over       the last few decades.        Below, please find a complete review of this legislation       from our editorial and research teams at OUTSpoken.        Let me be clear--Log Cabin Republicans is not now, nor will       it ever retreat on our commitment for equality for the LGBT       community--the transgender community included. We stand for       protections in employment, access to quality healthcare, and       equal protection under the law for our trans brothers and       sisters.        But the so-called Equality Act goes to an extreme level to       eliminate the concept of gender, which is absurd, dangerous,       and way out of the mainstream.        We're going to work through this together as a community       and a nation, but the Equality Act is not the solution.        Thank you for your consideration we will keep you informed       of developments as they occur.   [[Page H654]]          Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Steube).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't think anyone uses God. We have just  cited what is in the legislation, which specifically says the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act shall not provide a defense against what this  bill is doing. That is all we have done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, can I inquire about the amount of time left  for each side?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the last statement was ridiculous, and I  continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber).    I yield an additional 10 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, at the start of the debate, the sponsor of the bill  said discrimination is wrong. It sure is. We shouldn't tolerate it.   But this bill makes how a person identifies more important than  equality; makes it more important than  [[Page H659]]  fairness; makes it more important than fundamental liberties like your  right to practice your faith the way you think the good Lord wants you  to.   And you would think a change of this magnitude would get a little  more than 90 minutes debate on the House floor. That is why we should  oppose this legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
