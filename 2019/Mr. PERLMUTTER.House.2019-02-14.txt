 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 131 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 131         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider the conference report to accompany the       joint resolution (H.J. Res. 31) making further continuing       appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for       fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes. All points of order       against the conference report and against its consideration       are waived. The conference report shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the conference report to its adoption without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate; and (2) one motion to       recommit if applicable.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       February 15, 2019, through February 22, 2019--        (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.                                time  1830     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 131, providing for the consideration of the  conference report to accompany H.J. Res. 31, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2019.   The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a  conference report rule and provides for 1 hour of debate. The rule also  provides for standard recess procedures through Friday, February 22.   Madam Speaker, this legislation has been a long time coming. In  December, the Senate passed a clean continuing resolution for the seven  appropriation bills which hadn't been completed. The President said at  the time he would sign that bill, but then the President changed course  and demanded $5.7 billion for his campaign promise of a border wall.   As we now know, this led to the longest government shutdown in United  States history: 35 days. This put our country in jeopardy by  withholding paychecks for 800,000 Federal employees who are patriots  and provide critical services to our country and to all Americans.   Put simply, this was not an issue worth shutting down the Federal  Government. That is why I am pleased we are here today to avoid another  shutdown and begin to get the agencies affected by the shutdown back on  track.   This bill provides appropriations for the seven remaining  appropriations bills through the end of the fiscal year, including  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration; Commerce,  Justice, Science; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland  Security; Interior and Environment; State and Foreign Operations; and  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.   Over the past 6 weeks, we heard testimony from the chairs and ranking  members of the Appropriations Committee numerous times as we tried to  reopen the government last month.   A constant theme from those hearings, from both Democrats and  Republicans, was respect for the appropriators and their ability to  negotiate a deal. Today's result is confirmation of that trust we  placed in our appropriators.   I want to congratulate all the committee Members and staff for their  work over the last few weeks.   The conference report in front of us today is by no means perfect,  but it represents a compromise between Democrats and Republicans and  between the House and the Senate.   There are many programs well funded by this bill. For instance, the  Census Bureau will see an increase of more than $1 billion as they  prepare for the 2020 Census, to ensure an accurate count.   NASA, which invests heavily in Colorado and across all of the  country, will see a $763 million increase over last year to fully fund  NASA's science mission directorates and support human  [[Page H2009]]  exploration, from the international space station, to the Moon, and on  to Mars by 2033.   This legislation provides $17 billion in funding for new  infrastructure investments in roads, bridges, transit, and housing, and  the bill blocks attempts by the White House to hamstring the EPA and  other agencies from protecting our environment.   Importantly, the bill overrides the President's decision to freeze  Federal employee pay this year. Instead, it provides a 1.9 percent pay  raise for all Federal employees.   This conference agreement also makes smart investments in border  security by investing $755 million in infrastructure and technology at  ports of entry, additional funds to hire customs agents, $563 million  for immigration judges to reduce the backlog, and humanitarian aid for  Central American countries and along our border to those who need the  help.   The bill also provides $1.375 billion for border fencing, with  restrictions protecting sensitive areas and local involvement, and  takes steps to reduce the immigration detention bed levels, for which I  am confident the House will provide rigorous oversight.   Madam Speaker, there are a few things missing from this agreement to  help us repair the damage from the longest partial government shutdown  in United States history.   First, the bill does not provide Federal contractors backpay from the  shutdown. Federal contractors often work side by side with other  Federal employees and perform jobs important to the country and all  Americans. These contractors did nothing wrong and deserve to be made  whole, just like the 800,000 Federal employees who missed paychecks.  Congress needs to work together and make this right.   Additionally, during this shutdown, my State of Colorado, along with  California, Louisiana, Vermont, and Washington, took steps to ensure  fairness for excepted Federal employees to make them eligible for  unemployment insurance because they were forced to continue working  without knowing when they would be paid.   Unemployment benefits are a lifeline for situations just like this  where there is nowhere else to go, but, unfortunately, the United  States Department of Labor choose to make it more difficult for States  to provide these benefits. The Department has said it will not  reimburse States for these legitimate costs and has threatened  additional penalties, putting earned benefits for other unemployed  workers at risk.    I am a cosponsor of legislation produced by Representative Katie Hill  from California which would clarify current law and ensure our States  are reimbursed as intended by Congress. For reasons I don't quite  understand, my friends on the other side of the aisle would not accept  this provision. I plan to continue working with Representative Katie  Hill and Chairman Richie Neal from the Ways and Means Committee to help  States like Colorado.   Additionally, I worked to introduce two pieces of legislation during  the shutdown to help Federal employees deal with the effects of the  shutdown. First was H.R. 545, the Financial Relief for Feds Act, which  was introduced by Representative Pete Olson from Texas and  Representative   Don Beyer from Virginia and me, and this was to ensure  Federal employees who made withdrawals during a shutdown from their  Thrift Savings Plan or other retirement accounts weren't penalized for  their early withdrawals.   TSP saw a 35 percent increase in hardship withdrawals during the  shutdown as Federal employees did anything they could to help pay their  bills. I hope our legislation is considered by the House quickly to  make these Federal employees whole again.   I also introduced H.R. 781, The Student Loan Relief for Feds Act,  with Representative Will Hurd from Texas to allow Federal employees to  defer their student loans without penalty during a government shutdown.  A typical student loan payment is between $200 and $300 a month, and  that is money you don't have if you are not getting a paycheck.   These are examples of legislation we need to pass to fix problems  created during the shutdown.   There is one more bill I will be introducing today--I just put it in  the hopper--to prevent these shutdowns from ever happening again.   If Congress and the White House have a political disagreement, our  Federal employees and the American people shouldn't be the pawns who  suffer the consequences of the disagreement. My bill, the No More  Shutdowns Act, provides automatic continuing appropriations for any  fiscal year when appropriations haven't been enacted.   This means whenever there would be a lapse in the appropriations,  funding would continue at previously enacted levels, along with an  increase to the account for inflation until Congress passes an  appropriation bill. This is common sense and would allow our Federal  agencies to continue their work without the start and stop of shutdowns  and short-term CRs.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in  making sure shutdowns do not happen again.   Overall, Madam Speaker, this is a good compromise to fully fund these  agencies so we can finish last year's work and allow Congress to move  on to other important issues that we were sent here to do, like  reducing healthcare costs and repairing infrastructure across the  country.   I urge all my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  conference agreement, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Cole. We had a lot of  hearings in the Rules Committee where we heard a lot of appropriations  bills and, quite frankly, we knew that if we had some time and the  appropriators were able to act, that they would come to an agreement,  an agreement that didn't give everybody all that they wanted, but gave  them something that they wanted.   I think our trust was appropriate at that time.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Torres).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mrs. Lesko's and Mr. Cole's comments. In  the bill, there is $400-plus million for VAWA. It isn't as if it has  been forgotten. But I hear this, and over the last few years, the  Republicans have done nothing but try to defund VAWA.   So I am expecting a bill that was signed by Bill Clinton and was  authored by the former chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Louise  Slaughter, will be something that Democrats will certainly push  forward. After listening to Mr. Cole and Mrs. Lesko, I am sure all of  the Republicans will be on board with extending VAWA.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining me here today to  speak on the rule and the conference report. Providing funding for the  Federal Government is one of our most basic responsibilities here in  the Congress. Unfortunately, the Congress in the last session failed to  get it done and pass an appropriations package or even a short-term  continuing resolution, and that resulted in a 35-day shutdown, the  longest in U.S. history, something I hope we all can avoid from this  point forward.   Starting on day one of the new Congress, House Democrats began by  working to reopen the government, so we could negotiate the remaining  issues on border security and finish last year's work once and for all.  Today, we are accomplishing that goal.   I want to close with a thank you to the Appropriations Committee,  which worked very hard to get this done. I thank the Rules Committee,  where we heard every one of these appropriations bills.   I especially thank the 800,000 Federal employees affected by the  shutdown, as well as the other 1.2 million Federal employees across the  country. They are patriots. The employees are patriots for the work  they do each and every day on behalf of our country and our citizens.   I met with dozens of Federal employees during the shutdown. I heard  about the uncertainty of how to pay bills and the mental anguish from  being sidelined from work because they were not excepted or essential.  Despite all that, I still heard that they were proud of their work of  10, 20, even 25 years in public service and how they just wanted to get  back to their jobs.   Madam Speaker, I say to Mr. Cole that I am hopeful, too, that we can  come together on these important responsibilities. There are going to  be basic disagreements, and hopefully, we can work together to iron out  most of those. But shutting down the government is something we have to  avoid from this point forward. So I hope the lessons we in Congress  learned from the shutdown are not forgotten, and we continue working  together to prevent this from happening again.   Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the  previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 1239) to reauthorize Department of Justice       programs that combat violence against women, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1239.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
