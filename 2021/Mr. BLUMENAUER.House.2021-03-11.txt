 Madam Speaker, this month is the end of an era, as  Joe Novotny concludes a 30-year career in the House, the last 10 as our  Reading Clerk.   He assumed that role naturally with quiet competence. He was  unflappable in the midst of often frantic activity. He is the face of a  critically important and complex set of activities that keeps the House  legislative process moving forward. Even when it seems like we are not  doing much, it takes a lot of people to make it look that way.   He was born for this important role, having literally grown up in the  House as a House page to see firsthand the legislative process. His  rise through the ranks culminated with his decade as the House Reading  Clerk. He has steadily and thoughtfully performed his duties in an  exemplary fashion, being helpful, a perfect representation for the many  men and women behind the scenes who hold this place together.   I, along with thousands of C-SPAN junkies will miss you, Joe, and we  all wish you well, the very best in the next chapter of your career and  life.                            ____________________
