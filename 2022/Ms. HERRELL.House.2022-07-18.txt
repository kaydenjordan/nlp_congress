 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 144 would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, acting through the Director of the Indian Health Service, to  purchase land from willing sellers at fair market value to facilitate  access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, California.   In March 2017, IHS opened California's first youth regional treatment  center in Hemet, California. The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center was  designed as a coed inpatient facility to serve Native youth aged 12 to  17 with substance abuse and co-occurring disorders.   The facility is located approximately a half mile from a paved county  road. According to the IHS, a half-mile access road was granted under  an easement from two landowners at the time construction began on the  facility. Unfortunately, the IHS was unable to come to a purchase  agreement with the landowners by the time the construction was  completed.   To secure access to the facility, the IHS is requesting purchasing  authority since authorities previously granted have since expired for  this facility.   It is my understanding that this road has historically been dirt and  gravel, and it can be washed out in heavy rains, thus affecting access  to the facility.   Once the title to the access road is acquired, the IHS can make  improvements, specifically to pave the road, which will provide better  and safer access to the Desert Sage facility for staff, Native youth  seeking care, and visitors.   After the necessary improvements are made, S. 144 provides that the  IHS can continue to own and maintain the road, or it can enter into an  agreement with Riverside County, California, for the county to own,  maintain, and manage the road.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1286, a bipartisan bill  sponsored by Congressman   James Clyburn of South Carolina, which would  establish the Southern Campaign of the Revolution national heritage  corridor.   The corridor established by this legislation would connect the  greatest concentration of the Carolinas' Revolutionary War sites,  including battlefields, historic communities, farmsteads, and  landscapes.   A study was conducted regarding the suitability and feasibility of  designating the Southern Campaign of the Revolution national heritage  corridor, and the National Park Service determined that the study area  met each of the criteria for designation as a heritage corridor.   The Southern Campaign of the Revolution national heritage corridor  will serve to educate the public about our national identity and the  ideals of liberty, natural and civil rights, equality, and responsible  citizenship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2024, sponsored by Majority  Leader Steny Hoyer, which would establish the Southern Maryland  National Heritage Area.   Southern Maryland is notable for being the home of the first English  colony to pass a law granting freedom of religion, which later led to  the protection of religious freedom in the First Amendment.   The area also serves as home to several national historic and scenic  trails, sites related to several American wars, and Project Mercury,  the first human spaceflight program.   I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3222, a bipartisan bill  sponsored by Representative Sewell of Alabama.   This bill establishes the Alabama Black Belt National Heritage Area,  comprised of land in 19 Alabama counties, and designates the Center for  the Study of the Black Belt at the University of West Alabama as the  management entity.   The Black Belt region of Alabama stretches across the lower central  portion of Alabama, from the eastern border of Mississippi to the  western border of southern Georgia. The region is recognized by many as  the center of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.   Several pivotal events in the civil rights movement took place in the  region, including the Montgomery bus boycott and the march from Selma  to Montgomery, which helped lead to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and  the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   The Black Belt region is a special area of our country that deserves  national recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4404, a bipartisan bill  sponsored by Representative Darren Soto of Florida.   The Kissimmee River stretches more than 100 miles in Central Florida  and serves as both the headwaters for the Everglades and the main  drainage route for the expansive Kissimmee River Basin.   H.R. 4404, as amended, would authorize a Wild and Scenic River study  to be completed by the Secretary of the Interior. The study will  confirm whether the river meets the high standards set forth in the  Wild and Scenic River Act.   I appreciate the majority supporting an amendment at markup to  protect private property rights by clarifying that this study cannot be  used as a justification for new restrictive management practices prior  to Congress acting to officially designate the river as wild and  scenic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6337, a bipartisan bill  sponsored by Representative   Joe Neguse.   The Biking on Long-Distance Trails, or BOLT Act, is intended to meet  the needs of biking enthusiasts by increasing the number of long- distance biking trails on Federal lands.   The BOLT Act would require the Secretaries of the Interior and  Agriculture to identify at least 10 existing long-distance bike trails  and identify at least 10 areas where there is opportunity to develop or  complete such trails.   Mountain biking is one of the fastest growing sectors in the outdoor  recreation economy, and I support identifying new opportunities for the  public to recreate on Federal lands. The BOLT Act will make long- distance bike trails safer and more accessible to riders throughout the  country.   I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill and yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7002, sponsored by my Republican colleague, Ann  Wagner of Missouri, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  illuminate the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, in blue and yellow,  the colors of the Ukrainian flag.   Throughout the world, international landmarks have been illuminated  in blue and yellow as a sign of solidarity with the people of Ukraine.   These landmarks include the Kennedy Center, Niagara Falls, the Sydney  Opera House, the Empire State Building, the Seattle Space Needle, and  the Eiffel Tower.  [[Page H6696]]    In 2004, Congress enacted legislation requiring the Secretary of  Interior to illuminate the Gateway Arch with pink lights in honor of  Breast Cancer Awareness Month each October.   In 2015, the Gateway Arch was illuminated gold to commemorate its  50th anniversary. Most recently, in 2020, the Gateway Arch was  illuminated purple and gold to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the  19th Amendment.   The Gateway Solidarity Act, as amended, would require the Secretary  of the Interior to illuminate the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri,  in blue and yellow lights for 5 days following enactment, and annually  on August 24th, in recognition of Ukrainian Independence Day, until the  President reports to Congress that Russia has ceased its hostilities  against Ukraine.   I thank Representative Wagner for sponsoring this bill. The bill's  sponsor regrets that she was unable to be here today due to weather  delays.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill and yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7025, the Advancing Human  Rights-Centered International Conservation Act of 2022.   This bill is the result of a bipartisan investigation on how the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service's international grant program helped fund  human rights atrocities committed by eco-paramilitary forces in Africa  and elsewhere.   The bipartisan investigation led to an oversight hearing at the  Committee on Natural Resources last year, where we heard from expert  witnesses about the need for reform in this program. The hearing and  the findings of our investigation ultimately led to this bill.   The fundamental concepts of this bill are agency accountability and  transparency. This bill would specifically require the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service to vet the human rights record of conservation groups  and their subgrantees prior to awarding the grant.   The inclusion of subgrantees is critical. Unfortunately, we have seen  some conservation groups avoid taking responsibility for the actions of  their subgrantees.   Experts, such as Wake Forest University International Law Professor  John Knox, who has extensive knowledge on this issue, recommended this  reform. Mr. Knox and other witnesses and experts have been instrumental  in helping the committee throughout the legislative process.   The experts and bipartisan members of the committee agree that the  Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that American  taxpayer dollars are not being spent to perpetuate human rights abuses.  This bill requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to live up to  that responsibility.   This legislation is a much-needed and significant change from the  status quo. This is a matter where both sides of the aisle have come  together to ensure our conservation efforts do not occur at the cost of  human lives.   I thank Ranking Member Westerman and Chairman Grijalva and their  staffs for their hard work and cooperation on this bill. I urge  adoption of this bill and reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7693, the National Park  Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill has the  support of 51 cosponsors. This bill will leverage private investment  and innovative public-private partnerships to reduce the $21.8 billion  deferred maintenance backlog at our national parks, and address  pressing issues like park overcrowding.   Very importantly, the foundation is required to provide a dollar-for- dollar match with private funds for their Federal appropriations, and  Federal funds cannot be used by the National Park Foundation for  overhead, administrative expenses, or land acquisition.   In 2016, Congress passed the National Park Service Centennial Act,  which authorized the National Park Foundation, the official charitable  partner of the National Park Service, to receive up to $5 million in  discretionary appropriations annually through fiscal year 2023.   The foundation utilizes its Federal appropriations to work with local  partners and leverage private investment to achieve the greatest impact  possible.   The foundation works together with the National Park Service to  identify projects, including rehabilitating trails, visitor centers and  other facilities, expanding youth access, and conserving park habitat.                                time  1515    To date, the Foundation has routinely exceeded the minimum 1-to-1  required match and has more than $20 million worth of projects awaiting  funding in the pipeline.   Since first receiving an appropriation in fiscal year 2018, the  Foundation has funded more than 100 projects in 32 States and two  territories. By the end of next year, the Foundation plans to have  funded projects in all 50 States and multiple territories.   This bill builds on the National Park Foundation's success by  creating additional opportunities to encourage even more private  funding for the parks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 7693, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
