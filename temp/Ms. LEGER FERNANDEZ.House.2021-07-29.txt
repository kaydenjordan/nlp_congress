 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, we are here today to call on the  President, to call on the House, to call on the Senate to pass  immigration reform. We hope to see immigration reform in  reconciliation.   We are here to tell the stories of why we must do this, of why we  must do this not just for the immigrant community, and not just because  it is the right thing to do, and not just because of the stories of  each of those families who put their lives on the line, who study, our  DACA, our Dreamers, our essential workers, not just for each of them.  We are calling for immigration reform because it is good for America.   And we must move beyond the rhetoric of division. We must move beyond  the rhetoric of hate. And we must move to the facts. And when we move  to those facts, we know and we learn that immigration reform is good  for this country.   I often talk about the fact that we need to ignore those who would  divide us. Those who would seek to demonize another for political gain.  Because we know in New Mexico, especially, we know that there is no  other, there is only an us. No hay un otro, solamente nosotros.   And when we look at some of these numbers, we recognize that. When we  notice that immigration reform will bring a $1.7 trillion benefit to  our economy, that it will raise annual wages for everybody by $700,  that it would create 438,000 jobs for Americans, there is an economic  reason for doing this beyond the sense of who we are, our humanity, and  who we are as a Nation of immigrants.   This issue affects every community in our Nation. And it is so  important in my own community that the first meeting I had after I was  elected was with Somos Un Pueblo Unido. We Are a United Community.  Somos Un Pueblo Unido.   And it was wonderful to have that meeting, because I heard directly  the voices of my sisters who were undocumented. I heard their voices  tell the story of what it was like to work, tell the story of what it  was like to be exposed to COVID, but they knew they had to go back to  work because they did not have a choice. Because they did not have any  other way of providing for their children.   They put themselves in harm's way to care for us. They put themselves  in harm's way to make sure that our grocery stores were stocked. They  put themselves in harm's way to make sure that our elderly were cared  for. They asked me a favor, they said, Senora Congresista, we ask that  you will take our stories to Washington, D.C., that you will take our  stories and use your voice there to repeat them. And so my voice right  now is not mine, it is theirs.   Today, we stand in the people's House and use our voices to share the  community stories, to highlight the benefits of immigration reform, and  hopefully, hopefully, to get closer to making it a reality.   There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the  United States, they are the Dreamers who we have talked about. They are  undocumented students, children, adults, who have only known this  country as their home, they have U.S. citizen family members. As noted,  they are caregivers, healthcare workers, education, and small business  owners.   The immigrants in the United States are a reflection of us. They do  the  [[Page H4280]]  things we do, they are doctors, they are lawyers, they are students,  they are children. They are American. Just as American as any of us,  and they each deserve an opportunity to reach their fullest potential.   And year after year after year immigration reform becomes a political  football. Year after year after year 11 million people are held hostage  by political games.   You know, the Congressional Progressive Caucus has advocated and  fought for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants for  years. It is one of our priorities that we get it passed. It is one of  our priorities that we address immigration reform in the American  Families Plan, in the American Jobs Plan.   The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been fighting this battle for  decades--since they were formed. They have not given up. And the  Congressional Progressive Caucus has not given up because we know that  we must carry those voices and those voices must be all of our voices.    Let's talk a little bit about what happened during the pandemic.  Immigrants carried us through the pandemic. While we stayed home,  immigrant farm workers continued to go to work in the fields, risking  their lives to keep our country fed. Undocumented essential workers in  our grocery stores kept the shelves stocked with that food that was  picked by the immigrant farm worker. Dreamers taught our youngest, they  kept them engaged over that Zoom screen.   We saw how the pandemic, though, fueled the rise of anti-Asian hate  crimes. But what else fueled that rise of hate? Anti-immigrant, racist,  xenophobic rhetoric from the Trump administration. Asian Americans,  despite those attacks that were leveled at them, they continued serving  their communities, even in the face of those racist violent attacks.   And, yet, during the first round of stimulus checks, these  immigrants, who we just described, who kept us going through the  pandemic, they were left behind. They were made to feel like they were  not part of our country, that they were not part of our recovery, and  like they were an other.   I want to talk a bit more about the other immigrants.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman),  to engage in this conversation about the role that immigrants play.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for going  to the border because it is only when we go to the border, but go to  the border not with the intent to create a wedge issue but with an  intent to listen and with intent to open our arms that we really see  what is going on, the seeking of refuge. I went to the border with  actually a bipartisan delegation surprisingly. It was wonderful. It was  a bipartisan delegation.    It struck me. Meeting with those young children who are alone it  struck me that the seeking of refuge and sending your child alone to a  place that you believe is safe, Madam Speaker, is as old as the Bible  itself. Remember, Madam Speaker, Moses' mother put her child in a  basket and sent him down the Nile because that was the way to save his  life. When we think of that, let's remember the tears and the pain in  the heart of every parent who sets out on that journey to seek asylum;  and let's remember that it is the law of this land; it is the law of  the United States and of the world to allow asylum and to grant asylum  when you fear for your lives.   What we have now is a broken system. Trump took a sledge hammer to  it. But we must demand that it be put back together.   So, Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing his thoughts  with the Nation today.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal). I thank the gentlewoman for serving as the chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus that allows us to have this  conversation here today.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal,  and I really do appreciate the Congressional Progressive Caucus'  support for making sure that we include immigration reform in the  reconciliation.   We can do that because it has a direct economic benefit to this  country, and it has a direct economic benefit that will be reflected in  the budget. And we support it.   But I think the other thing to remember is the country supports it.  The support for doing immigration reform is huge. Sixty-seven percent  of voters support the DREAM Act. Eighty-three percent of Americans  support a pathway to citizenship for immigrant youth. Sixty-five  percent of voters support citizenship for undocumented farmworkers.   It is something that the country supports because they understand  that immigrants, they are us. They live with us and care for us and are  us. Americans know that, and they support that.   So, then, we must ask, why are we not doing this? We will work on  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib)  to tell us the stories and to raise her voice about the immigrant  experience.    Madam Speaker, I think it is important to  remember that they are not here just because we offer something more.  Immigrants are here because we need them. We don't exist as a country  without immigrants. They are here because they bring music and because  they bring food and poetry and art and laughter. They bring community.   But they also bring incredible economic benefits. I talked earlier  about the $1.7 trillion over 10 years, the 438,000 new jobs, the $700  in increased wages for everyone, the 6 years of additional life that we  give Social Security. All of those are economic benefits.   Do we know that three-fourths of undocumented immigrants in the labor  force are actually essential? That means they are the essential  workers. Not just that. They are healthcare workers: 38 percent of the  home healthcare aides caring for our loved ones at home, 29 percent of  physicians, 23 percent of pharmacists. They are taking care of us. They  are keeping us healthy.   Not only that. They are our entrepreneurs. They are the ones who are  starting our businesses. Right now, 25 percent of new firms in America  are opened by first-generation immigrants. The New American Economy  reports that over 3 million immigrant entrepreneurs employ almost 8  million American workers across the Nation.   It is immigrants and the children of immigrants, who we have just  heard, who come and serve in Congress, but they also start over half of  all Fortune 500 companies. Yet, they are subject to the hatred that  brought tears to my colleague's eyes. It is not right.   They are subject to that hatred in order to detract us from talking  about what we need to talk about. What we need to talk about is, what  we have been doing in this Congress when we passed the American Rescue  Plan.   Instead of going back and being able to tell your communities that we  passed the American Rescue Plan, help is on the way, we are going to be  putting shots in arms, and we are going to get people back to work and  kids back in schools--they don't want to talk about that. They want to  talk about that border. That border is not threatening any of us, but  that is what they want to talk about because they don't want to get to  the work at hand.   But we are going to get to the work at hand, and we are going to push  to include immigration in the reconciliation.   We heard earlier discussions about the manner in which families have  been torn apart and separated at the border by the Trump  administration. I have a bill that will not only reunify those  families, but, as a mea culpa, as a way of saying we are sorry, we will  make sure that they actually receive a visa and that they receive the  kind of care that we must do whenever you traumatize a young child.  They need that help.   We are also going to push to make sure that everyone who pays taxes  receives the child tax credit. Those immigrant families are working,  they are paying their taxes, and they were not getting the benefit of  the child tax credit. We are going to make sure that we push for that  and argue for that. We are going to make sure that we highlight who our  immigrant brothers and sisters are, because they are us.   I want to remind us here today that back when this country was  founded, even with all of its faults and flaws and original sins in how  we started, that even back then, when our Founders talked about what  this House should look like, they said that it should be a mirror, a  portrait of America. They said that we should make sure that Congress  has the right to pass the laws regarding how we vote us into office,  because they did not trust those States. This was back at the founding.  They did not trust those States because they knew that they would fight  against having our House look like a miniature of the American people,  a portrait.   That is the other thing that we are going to fight to do, to make  sure that we get the voting rights in H.R. 1 passed and H.R. 4 passed,  because that is how we also continue to push for immigration reform. We  know America wants it. We talked about those polls, 83 percent, 67  percent. There is great, great support for that. It is only because we  are not able to truly exercise our democratic values of self-governance  that we have not yet passed it.   But we have this moment in reconciliation. We have this moment. It is  a priority of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It is a priority of  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. It is a priority of so many of our  colleagues. So I am incredibly hopeful.   I am looking forward to listening to the President's words, after a  recent meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to tell us that  he will also be supporting this.   We call upon the Senate to support immigration reform in the  reconciliation act.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
