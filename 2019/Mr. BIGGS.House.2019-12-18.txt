Messrs. WEBSTER of Florida and ARMSTRONG changed their vote from  ``nay'' to ``yea.''   So the motion to adjourn was rejected.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   Stated for:    Madam Speaker, some of my colleagues across the aisle have  said, ``Hey, where are the facts?'' as if we have the burden of proof.   Madam Speaker, it is their burden of proof. It is the Democrats'  burden of proof.   But the facts are unchanged. Ukraine received aid that they were  promised and appropriated for. The aid was lawfully disbursed. In fact,  it was disbursed within the time limits set by  [[Page H12172]]  this Congress. If you wanted it sent to them before September 30, 2019,  you should have put that in the legislation. You did not.   The Ukrainians gave nothing in return. The Ukrainian President said  he felt no pressure, no coercion, no duress, no conditionality.   What changed? On the day that the aid was released, two  anticorruption measures were signed into law by the Ukrainian  President, President Zelensky.    Democrats have manufactured this sham and then argue that refusing to  cooperate is impeachable. The Supreme Court is currently considering  the extent of executive privilege when fighting dubious subpoenas. But  instead of taking their process to court or waiting for the Court to  rule on the pending case, the Democrats chose to press forward because,  simply, they said: ``We don't want to wait.''   ``We don't have time,'' they say. But failing to do so is an abuse of  power of this institution that will have grave consequences for our  Republic.   When the other side claims they proceed with soberness, I am bemused  by media reports that indicate they have been admonished not to do a  jig today when they win the vote, which we know they will. I am struck  that solemnity of process shouldn't need to have an admonition against  levity.   This process has been partisan, vindictive, dishonest. In this  impeachment, Democrats have lied about the content of the July 25 call;  met secretly with the whistleblower; held Soviet-style hearings behind  closed doors where the Committee on the Judiciary, the committee of  jurisdiction, could not attend; and blocked the President's counsel  from participating in the factfinding portion of the inquisition.   Madam Speaker, it has been a sham from start to finish.
