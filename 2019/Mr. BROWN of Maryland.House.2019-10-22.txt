 Mr. Speaker, as we mourn our dear colleague,  Elijah Cummings, I rise today to say farewell to a good man, a faithful  servant, and a true friend.   During the past 2 days, much has been said about Elijah. His life was  well documented, although his humility prevented him from seeking the  attention or the limelight, either in life or in death.   I admired and respected Elijah. I looked up to him.   When I was first elected in 1998 to the Maryland House of Delegates,  Elijah was one of the first calls I got. He didn't call to say  congratulations, although his kind words meant a great deal to me.  Rather, he called to tell me about my responsibility to the people whom  I serve. Elijah told me, if you are going to be your best, you can only  be so if you focus your work on empowering the people we serve.   Years later, when I struggled with the decision to run for Lieutenant  Governor, I called Elijah for his advice. During our conversation, he  didn't tell me what to do. Rather, Elijah challenged me to do that  which best positioned me to empower the people.    For Elijah, everything we did was about empowering the people we  serve.   In Elijah's first floor speech delivered 23\1/2\ years ago, after  winning a special election, he told us that he was on ``a mission and a  vision to empower people, to make people realize that the power is  within them.''   Elijah, you did your job. You fulfilled your mission.   Elijah was not an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life. No,  Elijah was an extraordinary man who did extraordinary things during his  life, things to empower people.   Raised out of poverty and through adversity, he achieved many  successes despite the odds and the obstacles. The son of sharecroppers,  he earned not only a law degree but received 12 honorary doctoral  degrees, all of which represent his dedication to empowering people.  [[Page H8302]]    I, like so many in this Chamber, was the recipient of Elijah's  generosity. His greatest gift to us was the ability to challenge all of  us to do better and not just to accept things as they are.   Elijah would always say, ``We are better than this.'' He led by  example, taught us by doing and showing, not just talking--although his  talk, his speech, his quiet advice, and most memorably, his powerful  oratory were truly inspiring and matchless.   When I ran for Governor, Elijah supported me. What I will always  remember is not that he stood by my side on the stage on the evening of  my primary election victory, but, rather, that months later, he was  standing by my side late into the night as I experienced a difficult  general election defeat.   That was Elijah. His support was unwavering, his friendship  unconditional, and his encouragement uplifting.   When I successfully ran for Congress, Elijah and Maya were there for  me and Karmen, ready and eager to help us prepare for the rigors of  Congress. I thank both Elijah and Maya from the bottom of my heart for  always picking up the phone, answering my texts, lending an ear, and  offering a word of encouragement, advice, and support.   Mr. Speaker, Elijah was distinguished. He not only mastered the  science and statecraft of governing, but he was also conspicuous in the  art of understanding and representing his constituents, the people of  the city of Baltimore--their dreams and aspirations, their challenges  and frustrations.   Elijah possessed a keen intellect and understanding of government as  a vehicle to empower the people. He possessed a radiant, remarkable  passion that was both commanding and, when necessary, calming, as only  Elijah could accomplish.   Whether Elijah was wielding the gavel from his elevated positions as  chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee or when Elijah was  wielding a bullhorn on the streets of Baltimore city, the community  that he cherished and that adored him, Elijah was always leading at the  intersection of intellect and compassion, bringing just the right mix,  at the right moment, to address the right issues, and moved us and his  people in the right direction. And that direction was always toward  righteousness.   History will be kind to Elijah, even when others were not, because  Elijah did his work with kindness and compassion, and with moral  clarity.   Mr. Speaker, Elijah closed his floor speech in April 1996 with a  poem. He said:       I only have a minute, 60 seconds in it.      Forced upon me, I did not choose it.      But I know that I must use it, give account if I abuse it,             suffer if I lose it.      Only a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it.    Elijah, what you did with the minute that God gave you will last an  eternity.   Rest, my dear friend. Rest well.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to thank my colleague from California, the chairwoman of the  committee, Chairwoman Waters, for her leadership on the Financial  Services Committee. And I want to recognize the hard work of my  colleague and friend from New York, Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney, on  the underlying bill. I also want to thank you, Representative Maloney,  for inviting me last Congress to visit several European countries to  explore and better understand how those countries address the problems  that this bill seeks to address.   Currently, no state requires companies to provide the identities of  their true beneficial owners. This lack of oversight and transparency  makes it easy for criminals, dictators, and kleptocrats to launder  money, hide their illicit activities, and invade law enforcement  through anonymous shell companies.   These anonymous shell companies can be used for everything from  funding terrorist organizations, supporting human traffickers, and  helping corrupt foreign leaders evade sanctions and threaten our  national security. These so-called companies have no employees, no  physical offices but are established simply to access our banking  system.   The 2016 Panama Papers leak exposed just how powerful and corrupt  these anonymous shell companies are. And the United States is the only  advanced economy in the world that doesn't already require this  disclosure. To combat this, this bill requires corporations to disclose  their beneficial owners at the time the company is formed. This is a  commonsense requirement, considering you often need more documentation  to get a library card than to start a company or an LLC.   This bill provides much needed transparency without being burdensome  on legitimate businesses. The bill also protects the privacy of  Americans by ensuring law enforcement officials at the State and  Federal level with access  [[Page H8337]]  to this new information are properly trained, have an existing  investigatory basis before searching, and maintain an audit log.   Mr. Chair, my amendment strengthens and builds upon these  protections. It requires law enforcement officials tasked with handling  a beneficial owner's personal information to go through retraining at a  minimum of every 2 years. This will ensure they are keeping up with the  latest rules, systems, and processes and will lower the risk of misuse  or improper disclosure.   The retraining is critical to ensuring that our law enforcement  officials, at all levels of government, are undertaking best practices  when handling sensitive information during their investigations.  Together we can finally tackle the issues surrounding shell companies  and their opaque beneficial ownership structure and give law  enforcement the tools they need to track the money that threatens our  national security.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the underlying bill and  my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time
