 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7606,  the higher food and increased fuel costs act.   I just cannot believe that at a time when we Americans all are paying  more for everything, from gas, groceries, energy, and beyond, my  colleagues on the left want more regulation and more government  intervention. They want to blame Putin and the war in Ukraine, but they  don't want to accept responsibility for the very policies that are  helping drive these increased costs.   If the last year has taught us anything, Mr. Speaker, it is that Big  Government with a one-size-fits-all approach of spending into oblivion  does not work. It turns out, shockingly, that taking cues from the  Easter Bunny doesn't work.   Look at the facts: fuel, 106 percent up; eggs, 32 percent increase;  fresh and frozen chicken, up 19.3 percent; milk, up 15.9 percent;  bacon, up 15.6 percent; baby food, up almost 13 percent. Oh, by the  way, we can't find it. Let's talk about that.   Right now, our farmers--and I know this for a fact because I come  from a rural producing district--have their backs up against a wall.  With skyrocketing prices for inputs like fertilizer, fuel, and feed,  many of our producers are now reaching a breaking point.   This administration, however, seems hellbent on pushing them over the  edge. The regulatory regime at the EPA--and I use that word  deliberately--threatens the very livelihood of our producers and the  long-term food security of our Nation. Everyone in this room can agree  that food security is national security, and it is dangerous policy  what the left is doing in taking out our producers.   Now, it seems as if they are more focused on Green New Deal policies,  and our districts will never be the same if we continue down this path.  Any sort of tax or additional regulation is increasing the costs to  produce fuel and produce our food.   This is a time when Americans, keep in mind, are making decisions  between gas or groceries, and we are seriously up here talking about  increasing costs for fuel and food? Give me a break.   We need to slam the brakes on any policy that empowers more  government bureaucrats and impoverishes the people.   We need to ensure that the EPA does not threaten the future of our  producers with such ridiculous, out-of-touch policies. I know that many  of my colleagues, particularly in leadership, have not filled up a gas  tank in probably 40 years, but I have. Two days ago, I paid over $5 per  gallon of gas. That is what Americans are facing. We need to stop  empowering these bureaucrats.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, if we adopt my motion to recommit, I will  instruct the Committee on Agriculture to add my amendment that would  prohibit the EPA from regulating or taxing emission from livestock.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support the motion to  recommit.  [[Page H5627]]         Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
