 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for his  leadership on this bill with scores of amendments through committee.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5895, the Energy  and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.   This bill makes key investments in water resources infrastructure and  coastal flood protection, increases funding for veterans healthcare and  benefits, bolsters our military assets, and increases funding for the  Capitol Police by $29 million.   Of great importance to my district, Mr. Chair, in northeast Florida  is the MILCON appropriation, which includes $111 million for two much- needed facilities for the training and support of the littoral combat  ship crews at Naval Station Mayport. These facilities will ensure that  the LCS crews are efficiently and adequately trained as we continue to  rebuild our fleet and deploy these ships in the future.   Mr. Chair, I am grateful to former Chairman Dent, Chairman Carter,  the committee staff, and my colleagues for their hard work on this  package, and I urge its passage.                                time  1615
