 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 2, which would  force deep cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid under a so- called balanced budget amendment. Like the Republican tax bill, this  amendment is another scam that will hurt American families and the  American economy.   Of course I support balancing our budget and fiscal responsibility,  but it is impossible to take this proposal seriously after the  Republicans just gave away trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the most  profitable corporations and the wealthiest Americans without paying for  them.   I have been listening to speaker after speaker lecture us about the  importance of fiscal responsibility, about the future of their  children. What a joke. This is the same party that added $2 trillion to  the deficit, the largest contribution to the deficit by a single act of  Congress in our history. And they have the audacity to talk about  fiscal responsibility?   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker, about what is really happening here,  what this is really about. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are using this amendment to lay the groundwork and to cover up their  plans to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. They plan to  balance the budget on the backs of middle class families and seniors,  and then they will say: We have no choice. It is the balanced budget  law that requires us to do this.    The American people can see right through this.   Mr. Speaker, the American people look to Congress to protect the  interests of all Americans and not the privileged few and the well- connected. But once again, we see our Republican friends are saying one  thing and doing another. They are trying to lecture us about fiscal  responsibility just a few weeks after they blow up the deficit to pass  tax cuts for the top 1 percent.   This is the kind of political double-talk that drives people crazy.  It is the kind of stuff people hate about Washington.   They don't expect their Representatives to give huge tax cuts to the  wealthiest 1 percent and then pay for them by underfunding crucial  programs that millions of middle class families rely on. But this is  exactly what will happen if H.J. Res. 2 becomes law.   Republicans are hoping to fool their constituents into thinking they  are serious about fiscal responsibility, but all this amendment does is  expose their shameless hypocrisy. They are hoping that we all have  short memories and we have forgotten that just a short time ago they  ran through the GOP tax scam, which resulted in a huge deficit spike.   Remember, these are the same folks who told us: Oh, tax cuts for rich  people? They pay for themselves.   Of course we know that is not true. We said it then, we say it now,  and we certainly know the Congressional Budget Office has proved that  in their recent report that concludes that this tax bill will add  nearly $2 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years and that the  deficit will jump to $1 trillion by 2020. It is hard to take today's  proposed legislation seriously in light of this fiscal recklessness.   We already know that the Republican tax scam will cut trillions of  dollars from Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure investments,  and healthcare for our veterans in order to fund a massive giveaway to  billionaires and corporations.   It turns out that the Republican tax scam was part one. Part two is  to gut the social safety net and crucial programs for working families  and the earned benefits for seniors.   Given the Federal deficits that are projected in the coming years,  the mandate under this amendment would result in an unthinkable  reduction in spending on critical government programs. No program would  be safe. It would require cuts to national security, the military,  healthcare, environmental protection, and medical research.                                time  1615    It would require stealing money from bedrock social safety programs  like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, foods stamps, disability  insurance, and veterans' pensions.   The Center for American Progress estimates that if this amendment  were ratified this year, it would require cutting the government budget  by nearly one-quarter in fiscal year 2023.    Mr. Speaker, it would slash Social Security by $308  billion, Medicare by $239 billion, and Medicaid by $114 billion in 1  year alone.   Mr. Speaker, if Republicans are truly concerned about reducing the  deficit, they should start with repealing their tax bill that added  trillions of dollars to the deficit. Congress cannot under any  circumstances pass this legislation, which is a direct threat to the  health and safety of all Americans, and will decimate social safety net  programs for veterans, retirees, and children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
