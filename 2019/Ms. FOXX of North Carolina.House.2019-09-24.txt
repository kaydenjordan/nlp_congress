 Madam Speaker, it is very fitting that  John Wood receive a lifetime achievement award from the Career Colleges  & Schools of Texas.   He and his wife, Victoria, have worked tirelessly to make the Ocean  Corporation a place where students gain the skills they need to lead  successful and productive lives in a variety of occupations that  benefit not only the student but also the State of Texas and, indeed,  the country and the world.   Their focus is always on ensuring that the programs are of the  highest quality and that students are career-ready when they leave  their various programs.   Having visited the Ocean Corporation myself, I can testify to the  dedication of the faculty and staff that John and Victoria have  assembled. In addition to their dedication to high-quality programs,  they have maintained their enthusiasm for the value of career education  and the choices that it presents.   John is deserving of the award, and I commend all who are responsible  for recognizing him and his true lifetime achievement.                            ____________________
