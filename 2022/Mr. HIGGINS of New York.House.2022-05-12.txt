 Mr. Speaker, the National Transportation  Safety Board found that pilot error was a major factor in the 2009  fatal crash of Flight 3407.   In the months following the tragedy, the families of Flight 3407  fought for safety standards and improvements, which were signed into  law and have saved lives.   Now an application is before the Federal Aviation Administration to  cut the minimum standard for pilot training in half.   We are calling on the Federal Aviation Administration to  categorically reject this request and any attempt to circumvent pilot  training requirements.   Families in my western New York community will never have their loved  ones back, but we can ensure that every family moving forward is  stepping onto an airplane with a fully trained pilot.                            ____________________
