 Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend, the  Senator from Rhode Island, for two things--one, for being a constant  voice on the need for us to diversify our energy sources and supplies  and for recognizing the enormous challenge around climate change.   I come from a State that is not too dissimilar from his in terms of  its having a great deal of shoreline. We see the effects of the  changing climate each and every day. At high tide, we have parts of the  city of Norfolk that have never before flooded that flood on a regular  basis.    On a sunny day.   We have a church that has to regularly change its schedule of  worship, not because the Lord has asked them to change the schedule of  worship but because it floods on a regular basis.   Let me also thank him for his comments about the tax legislation. I  share his concern as somebody who feels very strongly that there is a  right way and a wrong way to do tax reform. Unfortunately, the product  I believe we will be voting on next week, not only the provisions the  Senator from Rhode Island talked about, will also add close to $2  trillion to our debt.   In many ways, it does not even take care of the problems we are  supposed to solve, in terms of the ability of companies to bring back  profits from overseas in a way to reinvest in this country. Frankly, it  exacerbates the problem where companies can further hide their profits  abroad.   I share his doubt about whether our colleagues will join us in  starting anew, but if they would, I would join with them and others in  trying to make sure we do tax reform in a fair, balanced way that is  fiscally responsible. I thank Senator Whitehouse for his comments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I stand today to talk about a different  subject; that is, to stand in solidarity with over 12,000 of my  Virginia constituents who are students, entrepreneurs, members of our  military, and individuals who have the distinction of being Dreamers,  like the nearly 800,000 Dreamers across our country.   These people, many of them young folks, are worried about facing  deportation--not for anything they have done wrong but because the vast  majority of these young people were brought to this country as children  many years ago. Today, unfortunately, due to no actions of their own,  they are caught up in some of the worst of our Nation's politics.   Up until this past September, these young people were living in the  United States legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Program or what has been called DACA. As part of this program, these  young people came out of the shadows, paid a fee, went through an  extensive background check, and complied with all the other  requirements of the DACA Program. Unfortunately, Dreamers and their  families are now in a perilous situation because, unfortunately,  President Trump ended the DACA Program, literally putting hundreds of  thousands of these young people in a state of legal limbo.   Unfortunately, while a number of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle want to work through this problem, we hear the Republican  leadership has done nothing to provide that permanent solution for  these hard-working young Americans. That is who they are, folks who  have lived here oftentimes for decades. This is not how the greatest  country on Earth should treat anyone, especially these young people  who, in most cases, have only one nation they have called home, and  that is our country, the United States.   I am not the only one who thinks this. As I mentioned, there are  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been coming to the floor  for weeks making this point. The fact is, more than three-quarters of  Americans of all political stripes support a pathway to permanent legal  status for Dreamers. Here in the Senate, my friends, Senator Lindsey  Graham and Senator Dick Durbin, have introduced the bipartisan Dream  Act and have been actively working toward its passage.   In the Senate and the House, there are enough votes to pass this  bipartisan legislation if leadership would only bring it to the floor,  and that is just not the case in the Senate. Last week, my friend  Congressman Scott Taylor, a fellow Virginian and a Republican, led a  bipartisan group of 30 Members in the House again asking the House  leadership to find a legislative solution--not next year, not next  month but now.   Unfortunately, it seems like folks on the other side of the aisle  would rather  [[Page S8041]]  treat this as a political issue and a political pawn to be negotiated,  probably not even this year but at some future date. By doing so, they  leave these young people in a state of limbo and really subject to a  great deal of legal uncertainty. For many of these young people, as  they cycle out of the program--close to 1,000 a week--even if we come  up with a legal solution, their ability to rejoin the program and  reclaim their legal status may be extinguished. The truth is, this is  not just another political leverage point.   Let me take a moment or two and talk about some of the folks who are  affected in my State--folks in my State, folks whom I call real  Virginians.   I think about one young student from Northern Virginia, whom I chose  as my guest to the President's State of the Union Address a few years  ago. I was so impressed with her work ethic and her passion for  improving the lives of others that I asked her to serve after that as  an intern in my office, where she did great work serving fellow  Virginians.   I think about a law student I met recently in Williamsburg who was  born in England and brought here when she was just 1 year old. Right  now, it is getting close to the holidays. She is probably tucked away  in some corner of the library studying for her law school exams. She  told me she wanted to get that law degree to help fellow Virginians  when she graduates. I say we shouldn't stand in her way.   I think again about a young man I met from Newport News whose mother  brought him to the United States when he was just 6 years old. Sadly,  his mother passed away before he graduated from high school, but I know  when he walked across the stage of that graduation as valedictorian of  his class, his mom would have been proud. Hopefully, if this program is  renewed when he graduates from Virginia Tech next year with a degree in  engineering, he will put those skills to work.   These are just a few examples about the smart, successful, young  Virginians who also carry the categorization of being called Dreamers.  The truth is, in Virginia, we have a vibrant and growing immigrant  community that contributes to all facets of life in the Commonwealth.   While I talk today about Dreamers, I also want to make mention of  another program that is caught up in some of these last-minute  negotiations, the so-called TPS individuals--oftentimes individuals  from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and certain folks who have lived  in this country for decades whose legal status is also in jeopardy.   The truth is, whether they are a Dreamer or someone who has been a  beneficiary of the TPS Program, the truth is, immigrants in Virginia  are all across our community. They are doctors, caretakers, small  business owners, high-tech entrepreneurs. Quite honestly, they are also  our next-door neighbors. They are motivated, talented individuals who  want to help and continue contributing to the Commonwealth of Virginia  and to our country.   What we tell them every day that we fail to act, every day that more  and more of these young people fall out of eligibility, we tell them,  in pretty direct ways, that actually even though they have served,  studied, and worked here, that at least some in this Chamber don't  really want them here. They would rather urge them to take their  talents elsewhere.   As somebody who has been in business longer than I have been in  politics, I can state that these young people are an enormous asset,  and urging them to leave the Commonwealth or our country is a bad  business decision.   As I said, unfortunately, with every day that passes, more and more  Dreamers face the very real and terrifying prospect of being oftentimes  sent to a country they barely know or may not know at all for an  offense they were too young to even know they committed. That is just  not right.   It is not right that their lives should hang in the balance as they  wait and wait and wait for Congress to solve this problem--a problem  that I know, if it were brought to the floor, would receive  overwhelming bipartisan support. These young people can't wait any  longer and shouldn't wait any longer. It is time to pass the Dream Act  right now.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________
