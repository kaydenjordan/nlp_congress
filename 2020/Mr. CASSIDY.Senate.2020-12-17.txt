 Mr. President, Mr. Emile Oestriecher, known in  the Scouting community as ``Mr. O,'' has served the community of  Alexandria as Boy Scout scoutmaster for almost 50 years.  [[Page S7588]]  Troop 6, sponsored by St. Frances Cabrini Church, has been in existence  since 1967. When Mr. O became. scoutmaster, it had about 12 Scouts;  today that number is between 60 and 70. Mr. O, the founding partner in  the Alexandria CPA firm Oestriecher & Company, CPAs, has received the  Distinguished Public Service Award by the Louisiana CPA Society and the  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He has been honored  with many awards from the Scouting community as well as other local  organizations. Mr. O has led trips to destinations like Philmont Scout  Ranch and Canada Canoe trips, as well as taught other adult leaders  across the Nation and represented the area at four national Scout  jamborees. Now, his oldest scouts are in their 60s, but he is still  there as scoutmaster. He has several ``grandscouts,'' whose fathers  were members of troop 6 under him, and one ``great-grandscout,'' who  shared the same scoutmaster as his grandfather. Troop 6 has had over  160 Eagle Scouts during his tenure scoutmaster and six of his Scouts  have been ordained as Catholic priests. He certainly lives the Scout  Law every day and epitomizes the troop 6 motto ``Optimus Optimorum''-- Best of the Best. We thank Mr. O for his dedication to being  scoutmaster and being a good influence on so many young men in his  community.                            ____________________
