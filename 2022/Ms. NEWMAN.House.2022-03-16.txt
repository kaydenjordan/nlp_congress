 Madam Speaker, I rise today for Matt Haller. Matt Haller  was an Illinois resident who passed away in 2019 from stomach cancer  that is believed to have been linked to the local EtO sterilization  plant near his home.   These same EtO cancerous chemicals are used today to sterilize an  assortment of foods in the United States. While the chemical is clearly  banned for food sterilization in other countries around the globe, it  continues to be used in America for everyday food products like spices,  dried herbs, dried vegetables, and much more. Food sterilized with EtO  does not even require food labeling in the U.S.   I am introducing the Matt Haller EtO Awareness Act to finally change  that. This commonsense legislation would provide Americans the right to  know if food has been treated by known carcinogenic substances through  accurate labeling.   Let's increase transparency around EtO, let's bring awareness to  cases like Matt Haller's, and let's pass this bill.                            ____________________
