During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. This rule provides for debate on the final  negotiated bill between the House and the Senate. This process began  last Congress and resulted in the House passing H.R. 1259 in March of  this year.   The Senate introduced and passed the version of the bill we have  before us today by voice vote. It mirrors the reforms contained in  Chairman Roe's bill that the House has already passed by a bipartisan  vote.   Mr. Speaker, we often talk about veterans in this country: We thank  them for their sacrifice; we applaud them at sporting events; we tell  ourselves that we must take care of them, must repay them for the  service to our Nation. But in the past few years, we have discovered  that America's care for our veterans has been wholly inadequate. The  Department of Veterans Affairs has failed them.   Shameful misconduct at the VA has been rampant, and it has hurt our  veterans:   In 2014, we learned that the Phoenix VA concealed extremely long wait  lines for patients and that up to 40 vets may have died while waiting  for care at the facility;   Just last year, we discovered that a VA Hospital in Colorado Springs  also falsified wait time records. The majority of patients at that  hospital faced wait times over 30 days, and 28 patients had an average  wait time of 76 days. One veteran is even thought to have committed  suicide because he wasn't referred for mental healthcare, even though  he had been deemed at risk for suicide.   That is why Congress needs to act. S. 1094, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of  2017, allows the Secretary of the VA to hold all employees at the  agency accountable for their conduct.   We desperately need this legislation, not because all the employees  at the VA have problems. Quite the opposite. Most VA employees show up  to work every day because they are passionate about serving our  Nation's veterans. But there are bad apples, people who put our  veterans in danger. These people must be held accountable, and,  frankly, many of them must be fired.   This bill empowers the Secretary to reprimand, suspend, or remove VA  employees who have engaged in misconduct. It also permits the Secretary  to recoup bonuses if an employee performed poorly or conducted  themselves inappropriately and to recoup relocation expenses for fraud,  waste, or malfeasance.   The bill also bolsters protection for whistleblowers, creating an  office within the VA devoted to protecting those who expose wrongdoing.  Supervisors will be taught how to protect whistleblowers and will be  held accountable for how well they do.   And the bill requires reporting to Congress on the performance of  senior executives at the VA and on the outcomes of disciplinary actions  at the agency.   You may be wondering why Congress has taken such an in-depth interest  in an executive branch agency, and I will tell you why. It is our job.   The legislative branch was designed to oversee the executive branch.  We appropriate the funds used to pay the salaries of everyone working  at the VA. These funds come from the taxpayer. For the sake of the  taxpayer, we must ensure that the VA is serving its purpose.   But this bill also empowers the Secretary of the VA, allowing him or  her to take immediate action to protect veterans. We can't wait for  long appeals processes when a bad employee on the front lines of a VA  hospital is harming our veterans.   This legislation should not be controversial. Both Democrats and  Republicans want the best for our veterans. This legislation, the  legislation we are discussing today, gives the VA Secretary and  Congress more tools to hold employees accountable because if we are  holding employees accountable, then we are protecting our veterans from  abuse.   This bill is one small way to say thank you to those men and women  who have served our country. We can never adequately repay them, but we  can do our best to provide them with sufficient medical care.   I urge you to support this important legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado  as well.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2581, the Verify First Act. I  helped introduce this legislation with my good friend and colleague,  Mr. Barletta from Pennsylvania, to ensure illegal immigrants are not  able to use healthcare tax credits to purchase health insurance.   Under ObamaCare, the Federal Government paid these tax credits up  front on a temporary basis to people before verifying their immigration  status. This created a pay-and-chase system where the Federal  Government would seek repayment only after it found it had paid out  benefits to an illegal immigrant.  [[Page H4871]]    This bill puts an end to this taxpayer abuse by requiring the Social  Security Administration, or the Department of Homeland Security, to  verify the immigration status of every tax credit applicant before the  Treasury Department issues a credit.   Texans and hardworking taxpayers around the country already struggle  to pay for their healthcare. Their hard-earned dollars should not be  used to foot the bill for those who broke the law to come here. My  constituents in Texas and American taxpayers deserve better.   I want to thank Congressman Barletta for his dedication and continued  leadership on this issue, and, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In response to my friend from Florida's statement about the second  piece of legislation that we are dealing with in this rule, I believe  it is our responsibility to the American taxpayer, and we are  fulfilling that responsibility. We are expected to be good stewards of  taxpayer dollars. This bill ensures that the government only disburses  premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, or under the  American Health Care Act, to those individuals who are eligible for  those tax credits.   Under the ACA, an individual who is not lawfully present in the  United States is ineligible from receiving a premium credit.  Unfortunately, the ACA also allows the government to hand out the tax  credit first and verify later.   This pay-and-chase scheme means taxpayer money is flowing out the  door to people who don't meet the requirements for premium tax credits,  and much of these funds may not be recouped. In fact, under the ACA,  over half a million people who were ineligible for coverage and tax  credits received credits.   H.R. 2581, the Verify First Act, requires the Secretary of the  Treasury to ensure that any department disbursing payments have first  verified the recipient's legal presence with information like Social  Security numbers. By requiring this verification, we can confirm that,  under both the ACA and AHCA, those who receive credits deserve credits.   With that confirmation, we will ensure that these laws are used as  they were intended; that the wishes of the American taxpayer are  followed. I urge Members to support this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here discussing two important bills. One of them  fulfills the congressional duty to steward taxpayer dollars well. We  shouldn't be handing out tax credits to people without first checking  their eligibility for their tax credits. This is common sense.   H.R. 2581, the Verify First Act, will require verification of legal  presence in this country before someone can receive a tax credit. It is  only fair to the American people that we pass this legislation.   The other bill in this rule, S. 1094, protects our veterans from  harm. We all have a commitment to repaying the men and women who have  served this Nation in the military. These brave individuals have put  much on the line and sacrificed so much time and opportunity. They  deserve the best healthcare.   This legislation holds the VA accountable. We need to empower the VA  Secretary to quickly fire employees who put our veterans in danger. We  also need the VA to report to Congress so that the legislative branch  can fulfill its oversight duties.   I thank the sponsors of these important bills--Senator Rubio for S.  1094 and Representative Barletta for H.R. 2581.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 378 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       696) to prohibit any hiring freeze from affecting the       Department of Veterans Affairs. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 696.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). The question is on ordering the  previous question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
