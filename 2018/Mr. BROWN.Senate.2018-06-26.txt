 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we know Americans work harder and longer  than ever before and have less and less to show for it. Hard work  doesn't pay off the way it used to. Workers in Ohio have known that for  a long time--that their paychecks don't stretch far enough. This month,  the State's second largest newspaper, the Columbus Dispatch, reported  on just how bad things are for far too many Ohioans.   The Dispatch reported on a new study by the National Low Income  Housing Coalition and the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio  that found--get this--that only 2 out of the 10 most common jobs in  Ohio pay enough for one to be able to afford a modest two-bedroom  apartment.   Think about the number of people who work in fast-food restaurants.  Think of the number of people who clean hotel rooms. Think of the  number of people who are orderlies in big hospitals. Think of the  number of people who do clerical work or who are bank tellers who  simply don't make enough to live any kind of a lifestyle which, when  they were kids, they expected to live.   Look at it this way. Average renters in Ohio earn just over $13 an  hour--$2 less than the $15.25 an hour they need to rent a basic two- bedroom. Now, that is statewide, but in Columbus, which is the State's  largest city, it is worse. You need to earn $17.50 per hour to rent a  basic two-bedroom apartment.   Policy Matters Ohio has also done great work in shining a light on  working Ohioans. Its report this spring found that last year, 6 of the  10 most common jobs in our State paid so little that workers would need  food stamps to feed a family of 3. Six of the ten most common jobs in  Ohio paid so little that workers would need food stamps if there were  three in the household.   Think of what this means. These are Ohioans who are doing everything  we have asked. They hold down jobs. They get up every day. They go to  work. They serve their communities. They are holding up their end of  the bargain--the bargain we are supposed to have in this country. Yet  the corporations they work for don't pay them what they are worth. It  is not just the workers in these jobs who get hurt by this, it is  obviously their families, and, interestingly, it is the taxpayers.   Here is why: When corporations refuse to pay workers living wages,  when they refuse them opportunities to save for retirement, when they  refuse to provide decent healthcare, they create a drag on the economy.  Do you know why? It is because taxpayers pick it up. Someone has to  pick up the tab when corporations pay $9 and $10 and $11.   I was at my high school reunion a couple of years ago. At dinner, I  sat across the table--my wife and I did--from a woman who has worked  for a bank, for a very well-known, huge national bank. She had worked  there for 30 years as a teller, and she made $30,000 a year, after 30  years, working as a teller.   So what happens to people like her? The taxpayers end up helping to  finance their, generally, barely adequate standards of living. I will  get to that in a second.   No one who works 40 hours should be forced onto food stamps or  housing vouchers or Medicaid or other government aid just to stay  afloat. American citizens--American taxpayers--shouldn't be forced to  subsidize wages for megacorporations. Yet that is what is happening in  Ohio, what is happening in Wisconsin, and what is happening around the  country.   If people are making $10 an hour, they are probably getting their  insurance from Medicaid, which is paid for by taxpayers. They are  probably getting the earned-income tax credit, which is a refundable  tax credit that is provided by taxpayers. They are probably getting  food stamps, which are provided by taxpayers--the SNAP benefit. They  are probably getting housing vouchers. What this means is, because a  company only pays $10 an hour, taxpayers have to provide the rest, so  taxpayers are fundamentally subsidizing them.   Think of these huge retail operations in this country. Think of these  huge fast-food restaurants. Think of the executives for those  corporations who are making $2 million, $5 million, $10 million a year.  They are not paying their line workers anything close to their economic  value. Do you know what happens then? It means taxpayers are  subsidizing these huge companies with their exorbitant executive  salaries.   This month, the Dispatch talked with a home health aide who lives on  the east side of Columbus. Her name is Karon Taylor. Ms. Taylor works  hard to support her daughter and grandchildren. She only makes $11 an  hour, which is well below the $17 I mentioned that you need in Columbus  to be able to afford a family apartment. She relies on federally  subsidized housing.   She told the Dispatch:         I know how to budget, and I can stretch $20 really far.       Wages--that's the problem.    She works hard, and she does her part, but she needs help to make  ends meet because companies refuse to pay workers like her a living  wage. It doesn't have to be that way.   Last year, as some in this body remember, I introduced a bill called  the corporate freeloader fee. It works this way: If you are a huge  corporation--I am not talking about a mom-and-pop restaurant, and I am  not talking about a lawn care service with 10 employees or about one  who is self-employed or about one with 30 employees or even 100  employees; I am talking about large corporations, if you choose to pay  your workers so little that they are disproportionately forced onto  government assistance so that they are eligible for all of these  programs--again, food stamps, Medicaid, the earned-income tax credit,  subsidized housing--you need to reimburse American taxpayers.   You are a huge corporation. Your executive vice presidents make $1  million; the senior executive vice president makes $5 million; the CFO  makes $7 million; the CEO makes $10 million. Yet you are paying your  workers $10, $11, and $12 an hour, and they go onto government  assistance. Do you know what? Instead of passing the Senate tax bill  that gave all kinds of tax benefits to the rich--the bill that was  negotiated down in the majority leader's office, where all of the  special interest lobbyists scurried in and out when you turned the  lights on--if we had passed the tax bill with my patriot employer tax  credit, which I will talk about in a moment, and with the corporate  freeloader fee, we would have seen a very different tax bill. We would  have seen a tax bill that would have said to these companies: Pay your  workers a little better, and you will get a little better of a tax  break.   If you are a huge corporation and you pay your workers so little that  they are forced to go onto government assistance, you reimburse  American taxpayers. That is the corporate freeloader fee. On the other  hand, if you are a company like a whole lot of companies in my State  and you pay good wages--if you pay $15 an hour or more--and offer good  benefits and if you keep jobs in this country and production in this  country, if you don't offshore your production to Mexico or China, then  you get a tax cut. That is the patriot employer tax credit.  [[Page S4397]]    Months and months ago, I spoke to the President of the United States  in a discussion with about 10 Senators--in the Cabinet room--about  these two ideas. The President said he liked the patriot employer tax  credit, giving tax benefits to those who do the right thing.  Apparently, he seemed to like the corporate freeloader fee also,  punishing those corporations that don't do the right thing and making  them simply pay a fee to the government for that. In the end, the  President of the United States joined the majority leader and the  Speaker of the House in writing a tax bill, whereby, 5 years from now,  80 percent of the benefits in that tax bill will go to the richest 1  percent of the people in the country.   Imagine instead if that tax bill had actually been written like  this--in a way that would have seen wages go up and the standard of  living go up. Instead, the special interests went to work. Instead of  tax reform that would have given companies real incentives to invest in  workers, we got a tax cut that will lead to billions in stock buybacks  that will benefit corporate executives.   In that meeting at the White House, the President also said: Our tax  bill is going to mean a $4,000 to $9,000 raise for the average American  worker per year.   I am like, really?   Nothing even close to that has happened. Instead, what companies have  done is they have taken their largesse that has been provided by  middle-class and working-class taxpayers--the 80 percent of benefits  going to the 1 percent wealthiest people in corporations--and they have  done stock buybacks. They have increased their own executive  compensation. Workers have gotten almost nothing. Workers have gotten  squeezed on both ends, whereby paychecks haven't grown fast enough,  corporations have paid poverty-level wages, and housing has gotten more  expensive.   Think of this. One-quarter of renters--one-quarter of the people who  rent in my State, who are not much different than those who are  anywhere else--pay half of their income in housing. There are 400,000  renters in Ohio who pay half of their income or more in housing. Do you  know what that means? It means, if the car breaks down, it means if a  kid gets sick, it means if you miss work for 2 weeks for some reason,  you are probably going to get evicted. It happens every day in every  city, in every community, in every rural area in my State.   We know we need to do more to preserve and grow our stock of  affordable housing in this country. Instead, the administration is  making it worse. It has proposed to hike rents by 20 percent for almost  all Ohio families who receive housing assistance.   In going back to Ms. Taylor in Columbus, OH, she is a home health  aide. She still isn't paid enough. Average rents for Columbus families  would go up by a projected 22 percent. Do you think her company is  going to pay her 22 percent more or even 10 percent or 5 percent more?  Her housing costs would go up because of a decision by Dr. Carson-- ratified by the White House--to cut that help, to reduce that help.  Housing, healthcare, education, gas, and transportation are all getting  more expensive. Workers wages aren't keeping up because corporations  don't value workers.   We know one solution to this problem--giving workers a voice in the  workplace. A single worker can't take on a corporation. A single worker  can't take on the CEO and can't take on the behemoth in the executive  suite. That is why you need collective bargaining.   Last September, 400 security officers in Columbus got raises--from as  low as $9 an hour to a minimum of $12.45 an hour. They signed their  first union contract with the Service Employees International Union,  Local 1. That union card bought them a minimum $2.50 raise. That is  still below what workers need, but it is progress. They joined  together, and they demanded a unified voice in the companies they  helped to build. It is not just unions. We need stronger workplace  standards to make sure workers get the pay they earn.   In Columbus, OH, 2 years ago, I stood with the Vice President of the  United States and the Secretary of Labor, and we announced an overtime  rule, wherein 130,000 Ohioans would get a pay increase or would work  fewer hours for the same amount of money.   Here is how it works: If you are the supervisor on the night shift at  a fast-food restaurant and you are making $35,000 a year and your  company--a fast-food restaurant, a big national company--decides to  call you management, it can make you work 50 hours, 60 hours, 70 hours  a week and pay you not a cent of overtime. So this updating of the  Federal overtime rule that we did--that the Secretary of Labor did,  with Vice President Biden and President Obama, 2 or 3 years ago or so-- said that 130,000 Ohioans would get paid time and a half for that 50th  or 55th hour, instead of going straight salary just because the company  classified no overtime.    Unfortunately, the folks in the White House--the folks who promised  to drain the swamp--have sided with the fast food restaurants and with  the big employers, and they are trying to strip away that overtime rule  so those workers will continue to have to work 50 or 60 hours and not  get a dime for it, meaning less time for their children, less time with  their families, less leisure time, less pay--all of that.   So, fundamentally, whose side are these people on? They are always on  the side of the wealthy. They are always on the side of the richest  corporations. They are always on the side of the privileged. They are  never on the side of people who fight, work, and struggle just to stay  above water. At the same time, we need to go after corporations that  misclassify their workers. They pretend they are independent  contractors so they can avoid paying into Medicare and Social Security  and paying their share of taxes and wages. From housing to wages to  workers' rights, we need to change how we think about these issues.   It is not multinational corporations that drive the economy. It is  workers. Since 2010, since the auto rescue, every single month from  2010 until this month at least, June 2018, we have had an increase in  the number of net jobs created in this country--every month since 2010.  Granted, the President's comments notwithstanding, the growth in jobs  in 2017 was less than the 5 years before. We have had a slowly  increasing economy where job growth isn't as big as we want and wage  growth certainly isn't as big as we want, but we have seen it because  in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, the government understood that you grow  an economy from the middle up. You don't give tax cuts to the richest  people saying it is going to trickle down. You give tax breaks and  focus on growth in the economy in the middle level, so that workers  making minimum wage get raises. As I said, it is not multinational  corporations that drive the economy, it is workers making the minimum  wage, workers paid in tips, workers on factory floors, workers behind  desks, workers in hospital wards, in restaurant kitchens, and in  classrooms, and workers on salary and workers punching the clock. It is  about fighting for the little guy, whether she punches a clock or  whether he works in an office; fighting for the little guy, whether she  works construction or whether he works in manufacturing; fighting for  the little guy, whether he sits behind a computer terminal or whether  she is midlevel management in a fast food restaurant. You grow the  economy from the middle class out.   But if you don't value work, Americans can't earn their way to a  better life for their family, no matter how hard they work. That is  what people around here don't understand. I sat at this desk watching a  very close vote last year where 49 of my colleagues--49 out of 100  colleagues--all of whom have government-paid health insurance, stood on  this floor and voted yes to taking away insurance from 900,000 people  in my State, and in Wisconsin from 400,000 or 500,000 people. People  who have government insurance paid for by taxpayers, who are U.S.  Senators who have these jobs, who have these titles, who have this  income and these benefits, were willing to take insurance away from  millions of people, and hundreds of thousands of people in my State  alone.   Again, if work isn't valued, if my colleagues in this body don't  understand the value of work--and they don't seem to, frankly, with the  way so many of my colleagues vote--Americans can't earn their way to a  better life for their families--again, no matter how hard they work.  [[Page S4398]]    That is what we have to change. Until Wall Street, corporate  boardrooms, and Members of the Senate respect a hard day's work, we  will continue to see the consequences. The gap between Wall Street and  Main Street will keep growing, it will be harder and harder for workers  to afford housing and other expenses. Our middle class will continue to  shrink, as it has, and our economic growth will continue to lag behind.  We can work together to fix that.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
