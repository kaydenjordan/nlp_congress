 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 549) reaffirming the commitment to media  diversity and pledging to work with media entities and diverse  stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to eliminate barriers  to media diversity.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 549         Whereas the principle that an informed and engaged       electorate is critical to a vibrant democracy is deeply       rooted in our laws of free speech and underpins the virtues       on which we established our Constitution, ``in Order to form       a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic       Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the       general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to       ourselves and our Posterity . . .'';        Whereas having independent, diverse, and local media that       provide exposure to a broad range of viewpoints and the       ability to contribute to the political debate is central to       sustaining that informed engagement;        Whereas it is in the public interest to encourage source,       content, and audience diversity on our Nation's shared       telecommunications and media platforms;        Whereas the survival of small, independent, and diverse       media outlets that serve diverse audiences and local media       markets is essential to preserving local culture and building       understanding on important community issues that impact the       daily lives of residents;        Whereas research by the American Society of News Editors,       the Radio Television Digital News Association, the Pew       Research Center, and others has documented the continued       challenges of increasing diversity among all types of media       entities;        Whereas with increasing media experience and       sophistication, it is even more important to have minority       participation in local media to ensure a diverse range of       information sources are available and different ideas and       viewpoints are expressed to strengthen social cohesion among       different communities; and        Whereas the constriction in small, independent, and diverse       media outlets and limited participation of diverse       populations in media ownership and decisionmaking are       combining to negatively impact our goal of increasing local       civic engagement and civic knowledge through increased voter       participation, membership in civic groups, and knowledge of       local political and civil information: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity as a core tenet       of the public interest standard in media policy; and        (2) pledges to work with media entities and diverse       stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to eliminate       barriers to media diversity.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 549.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 549, reaffirming the  commitment to media diversity and pledging to work with media entities  and diverse stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to  eliminate barriers to media diversity.   This resolution promotes much-needed diversity in the communications  marketplace, and I commend Representative Demings and her staff for all  their efforts towards this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Ranking Member Walden, Communications and  Technology Subcommittee Chairman Doyle, and Subcommittee Ranking Member  Latta for their work to bring this resolution to the floor.   This past year has highlighted racial inequities that have long  existed in our society, as we saw with the protests over the murder of  George Floyd and the disparate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is  having on communities of color.   These inequities also exist in our communications marketplace. For  example, the owners of broadcast and media outlets do not reflect our  diverse population. These media outlet owners make critical decisions  about the educational, political, entertainment, and news programming  Americans watch, and those decisions can influence people's opinions  and perceptions.   Diversity in viewpoints and diverse ownership of media outlets  promotes programming that offers different perspectives and enables  viewers to access programming that is relevant to them.   A diverse media marketplace is also central to an informed and  engaged electorate, which is critical to a vibrant democracy.   Committing to a diverse media marketplace, one that reflects our  country, is a worthy goal, and this resolution reaffirms that goal.   Today's resolution is a good step forward, but there is much more  that we need to do. The numbers and statistics are clear that our media  marketplace does not resemble the people we serve.   I hope we can come together to do the additional work that is needed,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), the sponsor of this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for support on this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3361) to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to reauthorize  hydroelectric production incentives and hydroelectric efficiency  improvement incentives, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3361         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reliable Investment in Vital       Energy Reauthorization Act'' or the ``RIVER Act''.       SEC. 2. HYDROELECTRIC PRODUCTION INCENTIVES AND EFFICIENCY                     IMPROVEMENTS.         (a) Hydroelectric Production Incentives.--Section 242 of       the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15881) is amended--        (1) in subsection (c), by striking ``10'' and inserting       ``22'';  [[Page H7068]]         (2) in subsection (e)(2), by striking ``section       29(d)(2)(B)'' and inserting ``section 45K(d)(2)(B)'';        (3) in subsection (f), by striking ``20'' and inserting       ``32''; and        (4) in subsection (g), by striking ``each of the fiscal       years 2006 through 2015'' and inserting ``each of fiscal       years 2019 through 2036''.        (b) Hydroelectric Efficiency Improvement.--Section 243(c)       of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15882(c)) is       amended by striking ``each of the fiscal years 2006 through       2015'' and inserting ``each of fiscal years 2019 through       2036''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3361.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3361, the Reliable  Investment in Vital Energy Reauthorization Act, or the RIVER Act. This  bipartisan bill was introduced by Representatives McKinley, Tonko, and  Loebsack.   Hydropower is a vital part of our clean energy portfolio, and the  RIVER Act reauthorizes important hydroelectric production incentives  established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The RIVER Act extends  incentives that provide payments to owners or operators of  hydroelectric facilities that are added to existing dams or conduits.  Additionally, it reauthorizes efficiency improvement payments for  improving facility efficiency.   I support this legislation, Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleagues for  their hard work on the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers on this side, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would also urge support for this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5541) to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to reauthorize  programs to assist consenting Indian Tribes in meeting energy  education, planning, and management needs, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5541         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Power Act''.  [[Page H7069]]            SEC. 2. INDIAN ENERGY.         (a) Definition of Indian Land.--Section 2601(2) of the       Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3501(2)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by striking ``and'';        (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``land.'' and       inserting ``land;''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following subparagraphs:        ``(D) any land located in a census tract in which the       majority of residents are Natives (as defined in section 3(b)       of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C.       1602(b))); and        ``(E) any land located in a census tract in which the       majority of residents are persons who are enrolled members of       a federally recognized Tribe or village.''.

(c) Authorization.--Section 2602(b)(7) of the Energy Policy       Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3502(b)(7)) is amended by striking       ``$20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2016''       and inserting ``$30,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021       through 2025''.

Indian Tribes and Tribal       organizations shall have the opportunity to review and make       recommendations regarding the development of the assessment       and the findings of the assessment, prior to the submission       of the report under subsection (c).        (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit       to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural       Resources of the Senate a report on the results of the       assessment conducted under subsection (a), which shall       include--        (1) a description of generation, transmission, and       distribution assets available to provide electricity to       households residing in Tribal communities or on Indian land;        (2) a survey of the retail and wholesale prices of       electricity available to households residing in Tribal       communities or on Indian land;        (3) a description of participation of Tribal members in the       electric utility workforce, including the workforce for       construction and maintenance of renewable energy resources       and distributed energy resources;        (4) the percentage of households residing in Tribal       communities or on Indian land that do not have access to       electricity;        (5) the potential of distributed energy resources to       provide electricity to households residing in Tribal       communities or on Indian land;        (6) the potential for tribally-owned electric utilities or       electric utility assets to participate in or benefit from       regional electricity markets;        (7) a description of the barriers to providing access to       electric service to households residing in Tribal communities       or on Indian land; and        (8) recommendations to improve access to and reliability of       electric service for households residing in Tribal       communities or on Indian land.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5541.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5541, the Tribal Power  Act. This is a bipartisan bill that was introduced by Representative  O'Halleran from Arizona and Representative Mullin from Oklahoma, both  members of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   This important legislation addresses some of the urgent energy needs  of Tribal communities by improving access to energy sources that are  affordable and reliable.   H.R. 5541 reauthorizes the Department of Energy's Office of Indian  Energy and reauthorizes programs to assist Indian Tribes in meeting  energy education, planning, and management needs.   Mr. Speaker, we must work with Tribal Governments to ensure the  members of Tribal Nations have access to affordable, reliable energy.  We have made some strong bipartisan strides on these matters during  this Congress, including this bill before us today.   As we prepare for the upcoming Congress, I am committed to working  with the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee Chairman Rush and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do even more to help Native  American communities on these matters in the 117th Congress.   I thank the sponsors of this bill for their continued work and  leadership on Tribal issues. I also thank House Natural Resources  Committee Chairman Grijalva, a champion of Native American priorities,  for his support which was crucial to bringing this bill to the floor  today.   This is an important bipartisan bill that deserves to become law. I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Frank Pallone Jr.,      Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Pallone: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of H.R. 5541, the ``Tribal Power       Act,'' the Committee on Natural Resources agrees to waive       formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural       Resources.        The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with       the mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work with you as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                               Raul M. Grijalva,                                                              Chair,      House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, December 8, 2020.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 5541, the Tribal Power Act, from further consideration,       so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 5541 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this side,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, but I do  want to say that I never thought that Mr. Mullin had a bad attitude.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation and I  yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 1426.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1426, the Timely Review of  Infrastructure Act. This bipartisan bill was introduced by  Representatives Olson and Doyle. I would like to thank both of them for  their hard work on this bill.   H.R. 1426 ensures that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or  FERC, has the resources and personnel it needs to review and analyze  energy infrastructure projects.   H.R. 1426 addresses insufficient compensation of employees and other  personnel by amending the Department of Energy Organization Act to  grant the FERC Chairman additional authority to adjust compensation for  a category of employees and other personnel without regard to certain  civil service laws.   The Commission must be able to hire and retain sufficiently  experienced employees so that complex and highly technical  environmental reviews are conducted in as rigorous a manner as  possible. Better staffing by the best and brightest people means better  environmental outcomes, better energy outcomes, and better outcomes for  consumers.   I appreciate my colleagues' hard work on this legislation.   I particularly want to offer my best wishes to the sponsor of this  bill, Representative Olson, who is retiring at the end of this  Congress. I have always worked with him on a bipartisan basis and enjoy  spending time with him because he has a real sense of humor.   While we often disagree on policy, he has always been fair-minded and  a man of his convictions. When he is with us, it is hard to imagine a  better partner.   That is particularly true regarding the work we have been doing with  Chairman Tonko and many others from both parties on legislation to  phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons. He and his staff have been  true leaders in pushing forward that legislation, which, if we can get  it done, will be a major win for our manufacturers, our economy, and  our environment.   I thank the gentleman for his service to our committee and to our  country. I wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life,  Pete, absolutely.   I thank my colleagues for their efforts and urge passage of the bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this side,  so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5758) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to  make technical corrections to the energy conservation standard for  ceiling fans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5758         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ceiling Fan Improvement Act       of 2020''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS TO THE CEILING FAN ENERGY CONSERVATION                     STANDARD.         (a) In General.--Section 325(ff)(6) of the Energy Policy       and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(ff)(6)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(C)(i) Large-diameter ceiling fans manufactured on or       after January 21, 2020, shall--        ``(I) not be required to meet minimum ceiling fan       efficiency in terms of ratio of the total airflow to the       total power consumption as described in the final rule titled       `Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards       for Ceiling Fans' (82 Fed. Reg. 6826 (January 19, 2017)); and        ``(II) have a CFEI greater than or equal to--        ``(aa) 1.00 at high speed; and        ``(bb) 1.31 at 40 percent speed or the nearest speed that       is not less than 40 percent speed.        ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `CFEI'       means the Fan Energy Index for large-diameter ceiling fans,       calculated in accordance with ANSI/AMCA Standard 208-18       titled `Calculation of the Fan Energy Index', with the       following modifications:        ``(I) Using an Airflow Constant (Q0) of 26,500       cubic feet per minute.        ``(II) Using a Pressure Constant (P0) of 0.0027       inches water gauge.        ``(III) Using a Fan Efficiency Constant (h0) of       42 percent.''.        (b) Revision.--For purposes of section 325(m) of the Energy       Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(m)), the standard       established in section 325(ff)(6)(C) of such Act (as added by       subsection (a) of this section) shall be treated as if such       standard was issued on January 19, 2017.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5758.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5758, the Ceiling Fan  Improvement Act of 2020. This bipartisan bill was introduced by  Representative Guthrie of Kentucky and Representative Schakowsky of  Illinois, both senior members of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   H.R. 5758 amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide a  technical fix for large-diameter ceiling fan efficiency standards. The  legislation adjusts compliance requirements related to total airflow  and power consumptions for these fans. This technical fix provides the  highest-airflow fans a path to compliance, while still requiring  improvements to products that underperform. This is a commonsense  change that will improve efficiency of large-diameter ceiling fans and  ensure that all products will become efficient over time.   Mr. Speaker, energy efficiency is a critical tool in our efforts to  address climate change, while also saving consumers money on their  electric bills. Residential and commercial buildings contribute nearly  40 percent to our Nation's carbon pollution, and energy efficiency  measures can reduce U.S. energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 50  percent by 2050.   It is crucial that we support energy efficiency efforts across  different sectors. I commend my colleagues for their bipartisan work on  this important bill. Ms. Schakowsky, in particular, who chairs our  subcommittee that deals with consumer protection is always looking to  not only improve efficiency, but also consumer protections.  [[Page H7075]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who chairs our Subcommittee  on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this side,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge support for this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3797) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to make  marijuana accessible for use by qualified marijuana researchers for  medical purposes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3797         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Marijuana Research       Act''.       SEC. 2. FACILITATING MARIJUANA RESEARCH.

SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3797.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3797, the Medical  Marijuana Research Act. In recent years, including in this most recent  election cycle, many States have taken action to allow cannabis use.  While States are moving ahead with this action, there is a significant  need for more research about the use of cannabis products in these  States and the safety of products on the shelves.   According to the National Conference of State Legislators, 36 States,  as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District  of Columbia have approved medical cannabis programs, while 15 States,  the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have  approved adult-use cannabis. This is a major shift in cannabis policy,  and the United States is not the only one making these changes.   Just last week, in a vote by the United Nations Commission on  Narcotic Drugs, the body acknowledged the medicinal and therapeutic  potential of cannabis and removed it from the most restrictive  classification category. While still voicing a need for control, the  United States voted in favor of this move, stating that the legitimate  medical use of cannabis has been established through scientific  research.   Unfortunately, American researchers seeking to study the products  widely available and used by consumers in these States and territories  face restrictions and numerous hurdles created by U.S. Federal policy.  It is time we break through this catch-22. This bipartisan bill begins  to address this issue by reducing barriers to cannabis research.   In January, the Committee on Energy and Commerce heard from Federal  officials about the difficulty researchers face when it comes to  conducting research with cannabis. As an example, for years, there has  been only one source of marijuana made available by the University of  Mississippi that can be used in the U.S. for research purposes. Another  difficulty is that the current Federal registration requirements can be  time-consuming and add unique and additional responsibilities than what  is required for other types of medical research.   The Council on Governmental Relations, an association of research  universities and other entities, says that this more cumbersome process  often requires 6 to 12 months to complete.   In testimony before our committee on this bill, Dr. Nora Volkow, who  is the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, underscored  this point. She testified that barriers in the current process  ``present challenges to advancing cannabis research.'' As a result, she  said, we have a gap in our understanding of cannabis products on  health.   Mr. Speaker, now this bill, H.R. 3797, addresses some of these  barriers by streamlining the registration process for those who want to  advance cannabis research. The bill does this while still maintaining  appropriate oversight from both the Department of Health and Human  Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration.   This bill also requires HHS and DEA to act within specified time  periods to ensure timely registration for researchers, and it  encourages additional manufacturers and distributors to supply cannabis  for purposes of research. This will diversify the range of products and  make it easier for legitimate researchers to obtain products that  better reflect the changing cannabis landscape.   Mr. Speaker, finally, the bill would also promote research on  cannabis products available through State-authorized programs. This  additional research is critical if we are to better understand the  benefits and risks of cannabis products available in State markets  today and most frequently used by consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the lead sponsors of this bipartisan  legislation, Representatives Blumenauer, Harris, Lofgren, Griffith,  Bishop, and Dingell, and their staffs, for their tireless work. I also  thank the committee staff for their hard work, as well as the staff for  both HHS and DEA for their technical assistance.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope  the Senate will act on it swiftly, and I reserve the balance of my  time.

I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 3797, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon.  He has really been out front in educating me, in particular, and so  many of us, on the cannabis issue. I think without him, we would not  see many States like my own leaning towards legalization.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), the prime sponsor of the bill.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), one of our colleagues on the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for support to pass this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1570) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  waive coinsurance under Medicare for colorectal cancer screening tests,  regardless of whether therapeutic intervention is required during the  screening, as amended.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1570.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1570, the Removing Barriers to  Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 2020. This bill eliminates out-of- pocket costs for colorectal cancer screening tests under Medicare, even  in situations when a polyp is detected and removed.   Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among  men and women, combined, in the United States. The American Cancer  Society predicts that more than 53,000 Americans will die from the  disease this year. This is clearly a tragedy, especially because these  deaths are so preventable.   Approximately 90 percent of all individuals diagnosed with colorectal  cancer at an early stage are still alive 5 years later. But research  shows that out-of-pocket costs discourage individuals from seeking out  preventative screenings that could save their lives.   Under current law, Medicare waives coinsurance and deductibles for  colonoscopies. However, when a polyp is discovered and removed during  the procedure, it is then reclassified as therapeutic for Medicare  billing purposes, and patients are required to pay the coinsurance.   This simply is not right. Patients should not be saddled with  hundreds of dollars in medical bills that they justifiably thought  would be covered by Medicare as part of a preventative service.   H.R. 1570 provides a commonsense fix to this oversight. The bill  would ensure that colonoscopies, whether they are diagnostic or  therapeutic, are treated equally at the billing stage so all cost- sharing is waived under Medicare. By removing the financial burden  associated with this procedure, Medicare beneficiaries may seek  preventative care for colorectal cancer without the added deterrence of  surprise bills.   In addition, H.R. 1570 incorporates a policy that requires all part B  drug manufacturers to report average sales price data to the Medicare  program and provides the Secretary with new authority to verify this  data.   Under current law, only manufacturers with Medicare drug rebate  agreements are required to report average sales price data, and in the  absence of such data, the Medicare program ends up paying more. This  legislation ensures that the government is paying the right price for  part B drugs, saving taxpayers billions and allowing greater  transparency around drug pricing.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the bill's sponsors.   First of all, I want to thank Representative   Donald Payne from my  State. He has been working on this bill for so many years, and, of  course, it came out of the passing of his dad from colorectal cancer. I  remember his dad so fondly.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Representatives Davis, McEachin,  and McKinley for their hard work on this important piece of  legislation.   I want to thank Representative Doggett for his work on the important  drug pricing policy that is included today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1570, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 1570, Removing Barriers to       Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 2019, the Committee on       Ways and Means agrees to waive formal consideration of the       bill as to provisions that fall within the rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the resolution or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1570.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, December 8, 2020.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 1570, the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer       Screening Act of 2020, from further consideration, so that       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 1570 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Frank Pallone, Jr.                                                          Chairman.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the sponsor of this bill, who  has worked so hard on it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask that we support this legislation and  pass it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1966) to direct the Comptroller General of the United States  to complete a study on barriers to participation in federally funded  cancer clinical trials by populations that have been traditionally  underrepresented in such trials, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1966         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Henrietta Lacks Enhancing       Cancer Research Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) Only a small percent of patients participate in cancer       clinical trials, even though most express an interest in       clinical research. There are several obstacles that restrict       individuals from participating including lack of available       local trials, restrictive eligibility criteria,       transportation to trial sites, taking time off from work, and       potentially increased medical and nonmedical costs.       Ultimately, about 1 in 5 cancer clinical trials fail because       of lack of patient enrollment.        (2) Groups that are generally underrepresented in clinical       trials include racial and ethnic minorities and older, rural,       and lower-income individuals.        (3) Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman, was       diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 31, and despite       receiving painful radium treatments, passed away on October       4, 1951.        (4) Medical researchers took samples of Henrietta Lacks'       tumor during her treatment and the HeLa cell line from her       tumor proved remarkably resilient.        (5) HeLa cells were the first immortal line of human cells.       Henrietta Lacks' cells were unique, growing by the millions,       commercialized and distributed worldwide to researchers,       resulting in advances in medicine.        (6) Henrietta Lacks' prolific cells continue to grow and       contribute to remarkable advances in medicine, including the       development of the polio vaccine, as well as drugs for       treating the effects of cancer, HIV/AIDS, hemophilia,       leukemia, and Parkinson's disease. These cells have been used       in research that has contributed to our understanding of the       effects of radiation and zero gravity on human cells. These       immortal cells have informed research on chromosomal       conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and precision medicine.        (7) Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells have made a       significant contribution to global health, scientific       research, quality of life, and patient rights.        (8) For more than 20 years, the advances made possible by       Henrietta Lacks' cells were without her or her family's       consent, and the revenues they generated were not known to or       shared with her family.        (9) Henrietta Lacks and her family's experience is       fundamental to modern and future bioethics policies and       informed consent laws that benefit patients nationwide by       building patient trust; promoting ethical research that       benefits all individuals, including traditionally       underrepresented populations; and protecting research       participants.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY ON BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION IN FEDERALLY                     FUNDED CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS BY POPULATIONS                     THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED                     IN SUCH TRIALS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United       States shall--        (1) complete a study that--        (A) reviews what actions Federal agencies have taken to       help to address barriers to participation in federally funded       cancer clinical trials by populations that have been       traditionally underrepresented in such trials, and identifies       challenges, if any, in implementing such actions; and        (B) identifies additional actions that can be taken by       Federal agencies to address barriers to participation in       federally funded cancer clinical trials by populations that       have been traditionally underrepresented in such trials; and        (2) submit a report to the Congress on the results of such       study, including recommendations on potential changes in       practices and policies to improve participation in such       trials by such populations.        (b) Inclusion of Clinical Trials.--The study under       subsection (a)(1) shall include review of cancer clinical       trials that are largely funded by Federal agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1966.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7898) to amend title XXX of the Public Health Services Act  to provide for a technical correction to provide the Inspector General  of the Department of Health and Human Service certain authorities with  respect to investigations of information blocking, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7898         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. RECOGNITION OF SECURITY PRACTICES.         Part 1 of subtitle D of the Health Information Technology       for Economic and Clinical Health Act (42 U.S.C. 17931 et       seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 13412. RECOGNITION OF SECURITY PRACTICES.         ``(a) In General.--Consistent with the authority of the       Secretary under sections 1176 and 1177 of the Social Security       Act, when making determinations relating to fines under such       section 1176 (as amended by section 13410) or such section       1177, decreasing the length and extent of an audit under       section 13411, or remedies otherwise agreed to by the       Secretary, the Secretary shall consider whether the covered       entity or business associate has adequately demonstrated that       it had, for not less than the previous 12 months, recognized       security practices in place that may--  [[Page H7089]]         ``(1) mitigate fines under section 1176 of the Social       Security Act (as amended by section 13410);        ``(2) result in the early, favorable termination of an       audit under section 13411; and        ``(3) mitigate the remedies that would otherwise be agreed       to in any agreement with respect to resolving potential       violations of the HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45       Code of Federal Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164       of such title) between the covered entity or business       associate and the Department of Health and Human Services.        ``(b) Definition and Miscellaneous Provisions.--        ``(1) Recognized security practices.--The term `recognized       security practices' means the standards, guidelines, best       practices, methodologies, procedures, and processes developed       under section 2(c)(15) of the National Institute of Standards       and Technology Act, the approaches promulgated under section       405(d) of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, and other programs       and processes that address cybersecurity and that are       developed, recognized, or promulgated through regulations       under other statutory authorities.

SEC. 2. TECHNICAL CORRECTION.         (a) In General.--Section 3022(b) of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300jj-52(b)) is amended by adding at       the end the following new paragraph:        ``(4) Application of authorities under inspector general       act of 1978.--In carrying out this subsection, the Inspector       General shall have the same authorities as provided under       section 6 of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.       App.).''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the 21st       Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 7898.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 2016, the Energy and Commerce Committee led the  charge in passing the 21st Century Cures Act.   In addition to investing billions in cutting-edge research and opioid  abuse prevention and treatment, the Cures Act also included several  provisions related to improving the interoperability of health  information technology. Specifically, the act defined the practice of  information blocking. It also provided the Department of Health and  Human Services Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, with the  authority to investigate and levy penalties on entities found to be  engaging in information blocking.   Examples of information blocking could include a developer placing  unnecessary restrictions on authorized exchanges of information.  Another example would be when a developer implements their electronic  health record, EHR, technology in such a nonstandard way that it  becomes incredibly difficult to exchange a patient's health information  with a system not owned by that developer.   Practices like these simply stand in the way of patients accessing  their own data and carrying their data with them as they move between  plans and providers.   I am pleased that the Office of the National Coordinator for Health  Information Technology, ONC, and the OIG have worked since the passage  of the Cures Act to implement these important policies.   The bill before us today, H.R. 7898, provides for a technical  correction to the Cures Act to ensure that the OIG has the authority  they fully need to enforce the information blocking prohibitions.   H.R. 7898 also includes another health IT-related policy that was  part of a bipartisan, bicameral health agreement released by the Energy  and Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions last December.   This policy incentivizes healthcare entities to adopt strong  cybersecurity practices by encouraging the Secretary of HHS to consider  entities' adoption of recognized cybersecurity practices when  conducting audits or administering HIPAA fines.   Cyberattacks are increasingly a major concern for healthcare  providers. It is important that we acknowledge those providers that are  acting in good faith and doing everything in their power to safeguard  patient data.   This provision encourages providers to follow widely recognized best  practices in the field with the goal of helping all providers be better  prepared for potential cybersecurity attacks.   These both are commonsense policies, and I urge my colleagues to join  me in supporting them. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was hoping I wasn't going to have to make this  statement about Greg Walden retiring because I really didn't want him  to retire. I guess I kept hoping that he wouldn't or that he would  still be here in some fashion--and he will be in some fashion.   But I wanted to thank him for 20 years of extraordinary service on  the Energy and Commerce Committee, in particular. And I want to  particularly thank him for his leadership and friendship over the last  4 years as he served as the top Republican on the committee.   During those first 2 years, he chaired the committee, and then over  the last 2 years, he served as the ranking member. Our committee, as he  knows and I think a lot of people know, has a long and proud tradition  of bipartisanship, and Greg has really been a great partner,  particularly over the last year as we faced the unprecedented  challenges of COVID-19.   We have worked very closely over the last 11 months on all the  legislation that was signed into law to respond to the pandemic. Among  those laws was the CARES Act, which provided essential assistance to  the American people, healthcare workers, hospitals, small businesses,  and State and local government. We have taken some significant steps,  but the work continues as we hope to complete another COVID-19 relief  package in the coming days before we adjourn.   Prior to the pandemic this year, we were able to come together over  the last 4 years, thanks to Greg's leadership, to pass a lot of other  substantial bills that actually became law.   We passed comprehensive legislation to address the opioid epidemic by  expanding treatment to people fighting opioid use disorder and  supporting those affected by the opioid crisis.   We reauthorized the Safe Drinking Water Act for the first time in 20  years.   We eliminated annoying robocalls--I don't know, ``eliminating'' may  not be accurate, but we eliminated a lot of them.   We passed the RAY BAUM'S Act, named after the late Republican staff  director of the committee and Greg's longtime friend, which  reauthorized the Federal Communications Commission for the first time  in 28 years.   I know the law is very important to Greg, not only because it was  named after Ray but also because of Greg's longtime love for  broadcasting.   Of course, not everything is bipartisan. He will probably never  forget his initiation as chairman. His first full committee markup--as  was already mentioned by other colleagues--was the longest markup in  the Energy and Commerce Committee's history, 27 hours as we debated the  Republican Affordable Care Act repeal bill. That was really baptism by  fire.   At the end of the day, I am going to remember Greg most for the  commitment he made day in and day out to help everyday Americans. It is  really special.   A lot of people have a bad opinion of Congress. They think that we  come here for self-aggrandizement because somehow we want to get a  better job after we leave--not that there is one--or that we are trying  to help our families or trying to help special interests. The one thing  I will say about Greg is that none of that is true.                                time  1530    One thing I will say about Greg is that none of that is true. He has  a strong dose of humility, and humility is something that I would say  oftentimes is lacking, not just in Congress, but in general. Sometimes  I wonder if people even value it as something that they cherish. But  certainly Greg does. He is not only humble, he really cares about  everyone, and he is not just out for himself.   I also want to thank his wife, Mylene, for sharing him with us for  all these years. We are going to miss Greg, and we will miss Mylene  also.   Greg, I wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors. I  have been hearing different rumors from other Members. Earl actually  told me about some trip you took in the mountains in Oregon.   Everybody is sort of secret about these different things that he is  doing, but I suspect that they are going to be endeavors that he loves  and that, when I hear about them, will be fantastic.   I just feel bad about even making this speech about his leaving, but  that is the way it is, and I am going to miss him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for passage of the bill, and  I also yield back the balance of my time.
