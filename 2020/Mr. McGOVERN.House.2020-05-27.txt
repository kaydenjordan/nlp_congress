 Madam Speaker, today, I am proud the House and Senate  have come together in a bipartisan way to pass S. 3744, the Uyghur  Human Rights Policy Act of 2020.   This is monumental legislation that provides the administration a  clear direction for implementing U.S. policy and sends a clear message  that the United States supports the human rights of Uyghurs and other  ethnic minority groups in China.   I thank Congressmen Chris Smith, Brad Sherman, and  Tom Suozzi, and  Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for  their leadership on this bill.   We now believe that as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs and other ethnic  minority groups have been arbitrarily detained in mass internment camps  and subjected to forced labor, torture, and political indoctrination.   In recent months, we have seen leaked internal Chinese Government  documents that show the scope and implementation of the mass internment  camp system, including: evidence that the camp system is organized at  the direction of top Chinese Government officials, documentation that  punishments can be based on the behavior of their relatives outside the  camps, outlining the use of coercive force and punishment inflicted  upon inmates in a manual, guidance for how Chinese officials should use  surveillance to determine who to detain in the camps, and evidence of  the assignment of mass internment camp detainees to forced labor.                                time  1230    There can be no doubt that the Chinese Government is trying to stamp  out the Uyghur identity. The policies of the Chinese Government  contravene the letter and the spirit of the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights and violate the government's obligations under the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has  signed but not ratified, and the International Covenant on Economic,  Social, and Cultural Rights ratified by China in 2001.   It is important to always make clear that our criticism is focused on  the Chinese Government. We respect the Chinese people, many of whom  have suffered from and are victims of the authoritarian policies of the  government.   Last year, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which I  chair, published a report making the case that the persecution of  Uyghurs may fit the definition of crimes against humanity as defined in  Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.   In March, the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide at  the Holocaust Memorial Museum also determined that there is a  ``reasonable basis to believe that the Government of China is  committing crimes against humanity.''   Passage of the legislation is an important first step, but there is  much more that we need to do.   First, the administration should impose Global Magnitsky Act  sanctions on Chinese officials who are directing ongoing human rights  abuses, including Chen Quanguo, the Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary.   Second, the administration should further expand the Commerce  Department's ``Entity List,'' which imposes restrictions on businesses  and entities that provide technology, training, or equipment that has  been used in mass detentions or surveillance.   Third, I have introduced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, H.R.  6210, that would prohibit imports from Xinjiang to the United States  unless companies can prove that their goods were not produced with  forced labor.   Too many U.S. and international companies are complicit in the  exploitation of the forced labor of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities.   I am proud to stand in solidarity with the Uyghur, Chinese, Tibetan,  [[Page H2297]]  and, indeed, all the people living under the rule of the Chinese  Government in their struggle to live freely, practice their religious  beliefs freely, and speak their own languages freely.   I look forward to the passage of this legislation and continuing our  bipartisan work together to support human rights in China.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 981 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 981         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       6172) to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of       1978 to prohibit the production of certain business records,       and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto,       and to consider in the House, without intervention of any       point of order, a single motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on the Judiciary or his designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendments. The Senate amendments and       the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided among and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       the Judiciary and the chair and ranking minority member of       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question.        Sec. 2.  Any motion pursuant to clause 4 of rule XXII       relating to H.R. 6172 may be offered only by the Majority       Leader or his designee.        Sec. 3.  Notwithstanding the order of the House of May 22,       2020, if a veto message is laid before the House on House       Joint Resolution 76, then after the message is read and the       objections of the President are spread at large upon the       Journal, further consideration of the veto message and the       joint resolution shall be postponed until the legislative day       of Wednesday, July 1, 2020; and on that legislative day, the       House shall proceed to the constitutional question of       reconsideration and dispose of such question without       intervening motion.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 981, providing for consideration of Senate  amendments to H.R. 6172. The rule makes in order a motion offered by  the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary or his designee that the  House concur in the Senate amendments.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate on the motion, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary and the chair and the ranking member of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence. The rule provides that any motion  pursuant to clause 4 of rule XXII relating H.R. 6172 may be offered  only by the majority leader or his designee. Finally, the rule allows  for consideration of a possible veto message on H.J. Res. 76 on July 1,  2020.   Madam Speaker, the protection of civil liberties has always been a  uniquely American value. I opposed the original PATRIOT Act and  subsequent reauthorizations because I believe they crossed the line and  compromised Americans' fundamental right to privacy.   We can prevent crime and terrorism without our government collecting  data on law-abiding citizens. I have said that whether there has been a  Republican President or a Democratic President in the White House.   This has not been a partisan notion, either. There are Members on  both sides of the aisle who have consistently said the same. When I  worked with my colleagues Mark Pocan and  Tom Massie to introduce what  was called the strongest antisurveillance bill to date, it was done  with bipartisan support.   It is no surprise, then, that I don't support the underlying bill  either. Every day, we ask Americans to choose between their right to  privacy and a false sense of security. That is not a choice we should  have to make.   Having said that, other Members in this Chamber--Democrats and  Republicans--feel differently, and it is the Rules Committee's job to  advance legislation to the floor.   A FISA reauthorization recently passed this Chamber with the support  of over two-thirds of our Members. I did not support it. The Senate  strengthened the bill, but quite frankly, it is not strong enough for  me, though I do appreciate some of its reforms.   Now, each Member will have to decide where they stand. I know the  President hasn't made this process easy. He has thrown a last-minute  wrench into the process with his tweeting. If this bill passes, it will  go directly to his desk. I am not sure if he will sign it or not. I am  not sure he knows, quite frankly.   But we are giving every Member the chance to cast a straight up-or- down vote. Ultimately, the House will have worked its will.   I have said many times that I oppose this bill. The Government of the  United States should not be able to go on fishing expeditions against  citizens who haven't even broken the law. That is not a radical idea.  To me, that is a fundamentally American idea. I don't want seemingly  unlimited and, in my view, unconstitutional powers in the hands of  President Trump and Attorney General Barr or any administration.   This Attorney General, quite frankly, has no respect for the rule of  law. That is my view. I don't trust him.   I don't care whether it is a Republican or a Democrat in the White  House. We can, and we must, fight terrorism and deter wrongdoing in a  way that better respects Americans' civil liberties.   Madam Speaker, this is a serious matter. It deserves to be handled  more responsibly than by a late-night tweet.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2301]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the underlying bill. It has nothing do with  the Mueller investigation into the collusion between Trump operatives  and the Russians.   Quite frankly, I look back at that episode in our history with great  concern. A foreign power intervened in our election, and people close  to the President lied about their interaction with the Russians,  including General Michael Flynn, whom my colleague just referred to. He  lied to the FBI, but he doesn't need to worry because the President is  going to pardon him, or at least alluded to pardoning him because he is  his friend.   It is that kind of lack of respect for the law that has me concerned  about giving more power to this administration to be able to surveil  American citizens.   By the way, the Attorney General is recommending a veto on this  because he thinks it is too restrictive. He wants more power. This  Attorney General wants more power. Give me a break.   Madam Speaker, people have differences of opinion on the underlying  bill. There are Democrats who strongly support it, and there are  Democrats who oppose it. There are Republicans who strongly support it,  at least they did until the President did his tweet last night, and  Republicans who oppose it. So, people can vote however they want to  vote.   But my opposition to the underlying bill is longstanding, and I am  not going to sit here and listen to somebody try to rewrite history as  to what happened between the Russians and Trump operatives. What  happened should disturb every American, Democrat or Republican.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to thank the gentleman for reading from Webster's Dictionary  to all of us, but I want to read from the Constitution. And let me  quote: ``Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Erwin  Chemerinsky, the renowned constitutional expert and dean of Berkeley  School of Law, discussing the view that  [[Page H2303]]  the remote voting process we are considering today would, in fact, be  constitutional.   In the letter, the dean says: ``The Constitution bestows in each  House of Congress broad discretion to determine the rules for its own  proceedings. . . . This authority is expansive and would include the  ability to adopt a rule to permit proxy voting. Nothing in the  Constitution specifies otherwise.   ``Moreover, if this were challenged in court, it is very likely that  the case would be dismissed as a political question. The Supreme Court  has ruled that challenges to the internal operation of the Congress are  not justiciable in the Federal courts. . . . Indeed, I have written,  the Court often `has held that congressional judgments pertaining to  its internal governance should not be reviewed by the Federal  judiciary.' ''                                                   Berkeley Law,                                                       May 13, 2020.      Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole,      House Rules Committee, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: I have been       asked for my view as to whether the House of Representatives       could constitutionally adopt a rule to permit remote voting       by proxy. As explained below, I believe that this would be       constitutional and it is very unlikely that any court would       invalidate such a rule, especially in light of the current       public health emergency.        My understanding is that the system of remote voting by       proxy that is being considered would have some key features:        Low-tech remote voting process through proxy voting;        Some number of Members would be present on the Floor for       debate and in-Chamber voting;        Proxy would be used to establish a quorum and to register       the yeas/nays;        The proxy holder would be another Member of the House;        The proxy holder would have NO discretion on the vote.       Instead, the proxy holder would be required (through the rule       and accompanying regulations) to cast the vote in accordance       with the specific and exact instruction from the Member.        The Constitution bestows on each House of Congress broad       discretion to determine the rules for its own proceedings.       Article I, section 5 of the Constitution says: ``Each House       may determine the Rules of its proceedings.'' This authority       is expansive and would include the ability to adopt a rule to       permit proxy voting. Nothing in the Constitution specifies       otherwise.        Moreover, if this were challenged in court, it is very       likely that the case would be dismissed as a political       question. The Supreme Court has ruled that challenges to the       internal operation of Congress are not justiciable in the       federal courts. See Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892).       Indeed, I have written, the Court often ``has held that       congressional judgments pertaining to its internal governance       should not be reviewed by the federal judiciary.'' Erwin       Chernerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies       Sec. 2.8.5 (6th ed. 2019).        Especially in the context of the current public health       emergency, it is highly unlikely that any court would review       and invalidate the procedures adopted by the House of       Representatives that would allow it to conduct its business       without endangering the health of its members and its staff.       Every branch of government is devising new procedures to       accomplish this. The Supreme Court, for example, will conduct       oral arguments by telephone for the first time in its       history. I am sure that the rules will ensure that the votes       cast by proxy are accurate and carefully recorded.        I hope that this is helpful. Please do not hesitate to let       me know if I can be of further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                 Erwin Chemerinsky.     I include in the Record a letter from Deborah  Pearlstein, constitutional law professor from Cardozo School of Law.   In her letter, which I strongly recommend all of my colleagues read  in full, Professor Pearlstein writes: `` . . . I believe adopting  procedures to allow for remote voting under these extraordinary  circumstances is not only lawful, but essential to the maintenance of  our constitutional democracy.''   ``The Constitution . . . contains no specific requirement of physical  presence for Members to vote. What the Constitution does instead--as  the courts have repeatedly recognized--is leave it up to each House of  Congress to `determine the Rules of its Proceedings.' ''   ``Indeed, it is just such constitutional flexibility that has enabled  Congress to embrace the various informal solutions it has adopted over  the years to `do business,' including relying on Members to give  `unanimous consent' to a vote even if something less than an actual  majority of Members is physically present on the floor.''   ``Finally, the temporary remote voting procedures . . . bear an  entirely `reasonable relation' to the goal you aim to achieve, namely,  ensuring that Congress preserves the ability to vote in a way that  maintains the institution's representative character, protects the  transparency of its operation, and fairly and accurately reflects the  will of the American people.''                                                    Cardozo Law,                                                     April 16, 2020.        Dear Chairman McGovern: Thank you for your statement today       recommending the implementation of temporary remote voting       procedures in Congress during this tragic pandemic. As a       professor of constitutional law, and a scholar who has       written extensively on separation of powers issues in U.S.       Government, I believe adopting procedures to allow for remote       voting under these extraordinary circumstances is not only       lawful, but essential to the maintenance of our       constitutional democracy. Recognizing that specific       procedures for remote voting may still be in development, the       analysis offered here focuses foremost on the broad scope of       Congress' constitutional authority to regulate its voting       procedures.        As with much else in the Constitution, the description the       text provides of how Congress is to fulfill its legislative       ``duties'' once members have been elected is relatively       brief. Article I, Section 5 provides that there must be ``a       Quorum to do business,'' which the Constitution defines as       constituting simply ``a Majority'' of each House. The same       Section likewise specifies that each House must keep a       ``Journal of its Proceedings,'' which must be published       ``from time to time,'' and which may, if a sufficient number       of members desire, reflect how every member voted ``on any       question.'' The Constitution adds that neither House can       adjourn for more than three days, or move the session to some       other place, without the consent of the other House--a       provision designed to prevent a single House from thwarting       all congressional action by simply absenting themselves       indefinitely.        There can be little question that the Framers imagined the       legislature would do its work while assembled in some       physical location. In 1787 when the Constitution was drafted,       they could scarcely have imagined any other functional way of       proceeding. Various other constitutional provisions thus       refer to Congress as ``meeting'' (Art. I, Sec. 4) or       ``assembling'' (Art. I, Sec. 3), and one even provides a       mechanism by which members can compel ``the Attendance of       absent Members,'' (Art. I, Sec. 5) meaning presumably those       members not otherwise present where Congress is meeting. Of       course, none of the clauses in which those terms appear       address how Congress casts or counts its votes. Indeed,       neither the document itself nor any Supreme Court decision       defines what counts as ``attendance'' or ``assembling,'' much       less how such ``attendance'' may be taken, or such       ``assemblage'' may be accomplished. The Constitution equally       contains no specific requirement of physical presence for       Members to vote. What the Constitution does instead--as the       courts have repeatedly recognized--is leave it up to each       House of Congress to ``determine the Rules of its       Proceedings.'' (Art. I, Sec. 5) As the Supreme Court       explained in United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1 (1892), so       long as there is a ``reasonable relation between the mode or       method of proceeding established by the rule and the result       which is sought to be attained,'' the content of those rules       are ``beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal.''        Indeed, it is just such constitutional flexibility that has       enabled Congress to embrace the various informal solutions it       has adopted over the years to ``do business,'' including       relying on members to give ``unanimous consent'' to a vote       even if something less than an actual majority of members is       physically present on the House floor. But while such well       settled procedures are surely constitutional, they may not       always function to advance the system of majority rule the       Constitution so plainly contemplates. As we recently saw when       Congress enacted a substantial stimulus bill just last month,       it is possible for one House member, acting alone, to single-      handedly defeat the manifest preference of the bipartisan       majority by insisting upon an actual demonstration that a       majority of members were ``present'' (a term contained in       House Rules, not in the Constitution itself). This forced       House leaders to make a choice the Constitution cannot be       understood to compel--between surrendering the will of the       majority to the demands of a single man, or insisting, as       they did, that Members jeopardize their safety (and thus       their ability to effectively represent their constituents       going forward) by defying lawful public health restrictions       to travel and meet in Washington, D.C.        It is precisely in order to avoid such absurd results that       Congress has embraced a variety of measures throughout its       history to adjust to developing technologies and changing       demands. Thus, for example, current House Rules provide that       in the event the existing electronic voting system is       ``inoperable,'' the Speaker may direct the vote to be       conducted through alternative methods, including through the       use of ``tellers'' designated by the Speaker to ``record the       names of the Members voting on each side of the question.''       The teller system was an innovation put in place before the       current electronic system was available, one among key       reforms designed to strengthen Congress' ability to maintain       a public record of Members'  [[Page H2304]]       votes. The particular challenge of ensuring that Congress       could continue to operate during the outbreak of infectious       disease was indeed the subject of one of Congress's first       efforts to provide for alternative rules of operation.       Following Congress' return after the yellow fever epidemic       that devastated the then-capital of Philadelphia in the       summer of 1793, Congress adopted a law providing that in       circumstances when ``the prevalence of contagious sickness''       made it ``be hazardous to the lives or health of the members       to meet at the seat of Government,'' the President could       ``convene Congress at such other place as he may judge       proper.'' If Congress can delegate to the President the power       to move congressional operations entirely, surely it can       reserve for itself the lesser power to make whatever far more       modest amendment to process is required to ensure Congress is       able to vote in the same, extraordinary circumstances.        Finally, the temporary remote voting procedures as you have       sketched them thus far appear to bear an entirely       ``reasonable relation'' to the goal you aim to achieve,       namely, ensuring that Congress preserves the ability to vote       in a way that maintains the institution's representative       character, protects the transparency of its operations, and       fairly and accurately reflects the will of the American       people. By keeping remote voting procedures tied as closely       as possible to the existing system, the proposed approach       protects Members' ability to participate in votes regardless       of geographic location, technical knowledge or means;       minimizes the risk of foreign or other unlawful interference       in the vote; and maximizes Congress's ability to fairly       reflect the will of the majority of the people even during       the present crisis. The proposed approach contains essential       safeguards to ensure that Members' preferences are fully and       accurately recorded; as you emphasized in your recent       statement, Members designated to submit voting cards on       behalf of other elected Representatives may only act pursuant       to the direct, express instruction of the elected       Representative, retaining no discretion in carrying out the       ministerial function they play in the modified voting       process. As ever, Members remain subject to all the       disciplinary powers the House possesses to ensure the       appropriate exercise of their duties.        In short, with limited reforms that maximize Members'       ability to represent the wishes of their constituents, while       minimizing disruption and confusion in House operations,       Congress can succeed in preserving the essential       constitutional function of the legislative branch even amidst       an unprecedented pandemic. It is a critically important       initiative in these extraordinary times.        As ever, I thank you for your efforts, and for the       opportunity to share my views.        Sincerely,                                             Deborah N. Pearlstein,                                                  Professor of Law.     Madam Speaker, about the process, let me just say, I  hear from my friends. They like to talk about the 230 years of  tradition as though the House has never made any changes to the way it  operates in these last 230 years. That is just simply not true. So many  of our most basic functions have changed drastically since the first  Congress, from the way we vote to the way we count a quorum.   If a legislative body does not have the ability to respond to the  challenges it faces, then how can it survive and how can it be  functional?   The challenge we are facing today is not permanent. I could argue  that the House has made several more sweeping and permanent changes  than this before. For one, the way we vote today looks nothing like how  our predecessors voted in 1789. Now we cast our votes in the Chamber by  electronic device.   Our predecessors recognized that the House needed to advance with  technology. For decades, they called on the House to implement a more  efficient and advanced voting system. They were afraid we would seem  archaic compared to foreign and State governments. Does that sound  familiar?   Right now, we are watching as legislatures in our States take  responsible action to respond to this pandemic by implementing remote  voting procedures and as parliaments around the world advance to meet  this challenge head-on. What are we doing? We are struggling to even  come up with an agreement that we need to do something--something.  Anything.   But voting electronically is not the only change we have made in  response to technological advancements. Now, our floor proceedings are  broadcast on C-SPAN. Members grappled with questions of how  broadcasting the House would fundamentally change this body, but the  desire for accountability and transparency won the day.   Change is not always bad. And, of course, there were safeguards  attached to this that preserved the integrity of the House: Proceedings  cannot be tampered with and cannot be used for political reasons and so  on.   Other changes we made over the years include the provisional quorum  after 9/11. And that is not the only time we made changes to our quorum  requirements.   Other changes were deciding when a quorum is required. For decades,  Members raised points of order that a quorum is not present during  debates. The House has even expanded the Speaker's ability to adjust  the numbers of the whole House to account for those living,  incapacitated, or resigned.   How we count a quorum today is not the same as how we counted a  quorum in the first Congress. We have made changes to our quorum rules  as recent as 15 years ago.   Here is the deal: What we are facing today doesn't have to prevent us  from legislating. We should not be afraid to adapt and respond to these  challenges and to do so in a safe manner. If anything, we have 230  years of precedent of us adapting to the changing world around us.  There is nothing wrong with that.   But we don't have decades to make these changes. We need to make them  now, because we are in the midst of a pandemic. Hopefully, we are  seeing the end of it, but according to this administration's own CDC,  we may see a surge in COVID-19 cases in the fall. We may be in a more  difficult situation. We need to be prepared.   So no one is suggesting any permanent rules changes here. Everything  that we are putting forth is temporary and will be tied to the duration  of this pandemic. Full stop.   Let me just say this, finally. Proxy voting is constitutional. The  experts have said so. We aren't going to stop the work of the people's  House so that another branch of government can weigh in on our internal  proceedings.   I get it. My Republican friends have another agenda. They would  prefer that we do not get work done during this difficult time. It is  in, I think, their political interests, I guess they have decided, to  slow the work down of Congress.   Well, do you know what? The American people want us to work in times  that are normal and in times like this when we are in the middle of a  pandemic. And so I would urge my colleagues to reject the motion of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and instead vote to get our  work done.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, let me put it this way: I think there  are certain Members of your conference who are interested in slowing  the work of this democratic majority down. And I think that the  constitutional arguments are certainly on our side on this, and I think  that there is another agenda, quite frankly, that is being pursued by  some. I am not going to attribute that to you or anybody else.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I don't even know what the heck the gentleman from Virginia is  talking about. We debated this. Nobody is ceding their power to anybody  here. We had this debate. Read the resolution.   Members who cannot be here are very much engaged and are directing  their wishes very directly, like they would by casting the vote here.  So I don't even know what the heck we are talking about here, but I  guess it is a good talking point on their side, but it just doesn't  reflect reality.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Nobody is turning over their solemn duty to another Member of  Congress, and if my friend would read the proposal which passed the  House, if he had paid attention to the debate that we had, he wouldn't  be mischaracterizing what, in fact, we are doing here.   Nobody is turning over their solemn power to anybody. Members have to  participate directly just like they would on the House floor. They have  to pay attention to the proceedings. They cannot give their votes in  advance. On a previous question, people have to respond just like they  would in real time as if they were here on the floor.   So, this is just not true. It is not accurate.   Again, we have had this debate. The House has spoken, and we are  moving forward with remote voting by proxy today.   By the way, we didn't get through the pandemic of 1918 in the way the  gentleman just kind of characterized. In fact, that was an example of  why we need to do something because, during that time, we weren't  meeting. During that time, a bill actually to try to get more doctors  to rural areas to help people get through it couldn't get passed in the  House, and a lot of people died as a result of it.   So, I don't look at the Spanish flu of 1918 as somehow a model that  we ought to employ now. That is an example of how this institution  failed, and people died as a result of it.   We are now in another pandemic. Hopefully, this is short-lived.  Hopefully, the President is right that, tomorrow, everything will be  perfect. But we are also being told that, actually, things could get  worse in the fall. That is what happened during the Spanish flu, by the  way. The fall was worse.   We need to be prepared, and that is what we are going to do. We are  going to do the people's business, and the people who can get here,  they can get here. If they can't, for whatever reason, because flights  have been canceled because they are living in areas where there has  been a terrible surge in COVID-19, we will adjust accordingly.   Again, this is temporary, and it is not meant to displace the way we  do business here on a regular basis, and it is totally constitutional.  Constitutional scholar after constitutional scholar has validated that,  so I would say to the gentleman that I reject the way he has  characterized what we have done here because it is just not accurate.  It is not accurate.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the majority leader of this House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I have been here for a while now, and I have never quite heard  anything like that; I mean, blatant mischaracterization of what the  facts are.   The gentleman suggested, not once, but several times, that the rules  allow staff members to vote for other Members in this Chamber. That is  just not true. I mean, no matter how you want to look at it, it is just  not true. But the gentleman repeated that falsehood over and over and  over and over again.   I asked him to yield so I could read the end of the sentence that he  didn't want to finish, which is: ``And that Member must confirm the  instruction by telephone to the Member serving as proxy before the vote  may be cast on their behalf.''   The gentleman knows that that is not true but, yet, here he comes to  the floor and he repeats over and over again something that, in the  written instructions, in the guidelines that he was referring to, says  the opposite.   I mean, are things that broken here that we cannot even agree on the  basic facts?   I get it. You don't like what we are doing here, that's fine. But  let's not  [[Page H2310]]  misinterpret and twist and distort what we are trying to do here.   Yeah, the gentleman had a plan. We actually delayed moving forward on  trying to change the rules to operate remotely because the gentleman  said that he was willing to work with us to try to figure out whether  we could come to some sort of accommodation.   And you know what his plan was? His plan was we all come back, and  all the Members in this Chamber get prioritized, over all of our  constituents, and we get tested every time we come back, so that we can  operate here safely.   So my doctors, and my nurses, and my first responders, and those who  work in our grocery stores, and those who work in homeless shelters and  in food pantries, who can't get tested, we are all so special,  according to the minority leader, that we should be prioritized and go  to the top of the list. And that was part of his plan.   Forget about it. I don't know about your constituents, but my  constituents would find that totally unacceptable, and it represents a  tone-deafness that I haven't heard in a long time here.   When he talks about no accountability in this process, I don't even  know what the hell he is talking about, I really don't.   And again, the idea that somehow staff could vote for Members? That  is absolutely not true. Absolutely not true.   I don't even know how to respond to what the gentleman just said. It  makes you understand why so many people are cynical when they look at  this Chamber and they see the exchanges that go on here.   I get it; we have disagreements on issues. We have disagreements on  whether we should move forward on with FISA or not. I have  disagreements with my own leadership on that. Those are honest  disagreements, but they are based on conviction. They are based on  fact.   You can disagree with whether or not we should be able to operate  remotely during extraordinary times like pandemics. I get it. We can  argue about the constitutionality. I think we are on strong  constitutional grounds. You can argue the opposite point of view.    But to makes things up, to come down here just to twist what we have  done here, it is just unacceptable. It is unacceptable. We all ought to  be better than that.   We are trying to figure out a way to operate during a very difficult  time in our country where, probably today, over 100,000 people will  have lost their lives.   And notwithstanding the President of the United States trying to  downplay that and say, no big deal, you know, it is not much of  anything.   It is a big deal. I have lost valued members of my community to this  disease, and I know you have as well.   So we are trying to get through this and, hopefully, this is short- lived and, hopefully, we can get back to business as normal as quickly  as possible. But if this comes back in the fall, we need to be  prepared.   So, under this proposal, if you want to be here you can come here and  we can operate in person. But as we are all finding out, that is  difficult, even in committee hearings.   The Rules Committee is the smallest committee in the House, and we  can't even meet in the Rules Committee room. We are meeting in the Ways  and Means Committee room or the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee room, which are among the biggest committee rooms in the  House because we are all trying to follow the advice of the Attending  Physician.   So we can debate whether this is the best way to move forward or not.  That is fine. But let's not make things up.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Woodall). This is his  last  [[Page H2311]]  term and, believe it or not, I am going to miss him. He is a spirited  debater.   But I want to say, and I say this sincerely, I appreciate his  advocacy for his point of view. I usually disagree with it, but I know  it is based on principle and conviction, and he sticks to the facts. He  doesn't come to the floor and make things up. He actually sticks to the  facts. We have disagreements on those facts, and that is the way debate  should be. It should be based on what is real, what are the facts.   Madam Speaker, as you heard today, this is a difficult issue, the  underlying legislation that we are dealing with with regard to FISA. It  is one that cuts across party lines, and many Members have strong  opinions.   As I said earlier, I opposed the original PATRIOT Act and subsequent  reauthorizations. I appreciate the work of many of my colleagues in  getting reforms included in the underlying bill that are badly needed.  I think we need to do much more to truly respect all Americans'  fundamental right to privacy.                                time  1630    I think it is a false choice to suggest that either we can fight  terrorism and wrongdoing or uphold the right to privacy.   There has been a lot of debate on both sides of the Capitol, and the  President has weighed in recently. The Attorney General has suggested  that the President should veto this bill not because the Attorney  General wants more reforms like the ones that the Senate put in or the  ones that have been suggested. It is quite the opposite. The Attorney  General doesn't want any more checks and balances put in place.   As I said earlier, that scares me because I don't trust him. I just  don't.   Now, the House will have a chance to work its will. My vote on the  underlying bill will be ``no.'' But I respect many of my colleagues who  feel strongly that we ought to move forward and approve the bill that  originated in this House then went to the Senate where additions were  made in the Senate, and now it is back to the House. So, this has been  a process that has not been short-circuited in any way, shape, or form.   But I think that given the fact that the Senate passed this with 80  percent of the Senate voting in favor of it--again, I would have voted  ``no'' if I were in the Senate. But 80 percent of them voted in favor  of it. Madam Speaker, you can't get 80 percent of the Senate to agree  on lunch, yet they voted affirmatively on this.   We voted in the House. Two-thirds of this Chamber, Democrats and  Republicans, voted ``yes.'' I voted ``no.'' But the idea that somehow  there isn't strong support to move forward I think is not justified by  the facts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule so we  can move forward.   I would again differ with my friends on the previous question. I  think what we did to try to accommodate the reality that we are faced  with during this COVID-19 crisis was responsible and deliberative. We  attempted to work in a bipartisan way.   In fact, many of the parts of this proposal reflect Republican  suggestions. I regret that we did not come to a conclusion that we all  could agree on, but as I said before, the minority leader's insistence  that somehow we all be prioritized in terms of testing was a  nonstarter. His insistence that he had veto power over everything and  that he would use that veto power so we couldn't operate remotely was  also a nonstarter.   We need to do our work, and we need to do it in a way where all  Members during this pandemic can participate.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 981         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. H. Res. 965 shall have no force or effect until       such time as the ongoing litigation into the       constitutionality of proxy voting is complete.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
