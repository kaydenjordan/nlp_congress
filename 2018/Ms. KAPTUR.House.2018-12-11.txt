 Mr. Speaker, following the gruesome murder of journalist  Jamal Khashoggi ordered by the Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin  Salman, the world raised its voice in condemnation. Noticeably quiet  was the leader of the free world, our own President. A closer look at  President Trump's deeply troubling financial connections and conflicts  of interest likely explain why.   In August 2015, the President himself said on the campaign trail:  ``Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from  me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. . . . I like them very much.''   That same month, The Trump Organization registered eight separate  companies to do business in Saudi Arabia.   Indeed, The Hill newspaper reported that a 5-day stay from the Saudi  crown prince at the Trump Hotel caused a 13 percent surge in revenue in  the first quarter of this year. How about that?   Mr. President, the American people wonder, is it America first, or is  America for sale to foreign interests?   Given the President's clear conflicting interests, Congress must  assert its power to limit the ability of corrupt regimes to influence  our politics. Our colleagues on both sides of the aisle must reaffirm  America's values of liberty, justice, and equality, and restore  America's faith in our politics.
