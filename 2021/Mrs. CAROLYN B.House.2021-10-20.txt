 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we have a choice.  We can work to save our planet and become a global leader in green  technology, or we can allow our planet to become uninhabitable. We must  choose to protect our planet, the only home we have.   Transitioning to electric vehicles will dramatically reduce carbon  emissions and will create a cleaner world for our children. That is why  my committee approved billions of dollars to transition the Postal  Service and GSA fleets to electric vehicles and provide the necessary  charging infrastructure across the country in the postal offices.   This will fund more than 300,000 electric vehicles. That is more  electric vehicles than were sold across the entire country last year.   I urge my colleagues to support the Build Back Better plan, which  includes funding for electric vehicles that will greatly help our  environment.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1508) to require a guidance clarity  statement  [[Page H5690]]  on certain agency guidance, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1508         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Guidance Clarity Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. GUIDANCE CLARITY STATEMENT REQUIRED.         (a) Requirement.--Each agency, as defined in section 551 of       title 5, United States Code, shall include a guidance clarity       statement as described in subsection (b) on any guidance       issued by that agency under section 553(b)(3)(A) of title 5,       United States Code, on and after the date that is 30 days       after the date on which the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget issues the guidance required under       subsection (c).        (b) Guidance Clarity Statement.--A guidance clarity       statement required under subsection (b) shall--        (1) be displayed prominently on the first page of the       document; and        (2) include the following: ``The contents of this document       do not have the force and effect of law and do not, of       themselves, bind the public or the agency. This document is       intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding       existing requirements under the law or agency policies.''.        (c) OMB Guidance.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget shall issue guidance to implement this       Act.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   H.R. 1508 would require Federal agencies to include a guidance  clarity statement on the first page of guidance documents.   I thank Representative Luetkemeyer and Ranking Member Comer for  working with us to perfect this bill.   Federal rules, regulations, and guidance are complex, even at the  best of times.   For most Americans who do not spend hours per day reading through the  Federal Register, guidance documents can be very confusing.   This simple, good government bill will help clarify for the public  that agency guidance is intended to help guide the implementation of  Federal regulations, not to act as additional legally binding rules.   This is a bipartisan bill in both the House and the Senate, which  passed a Senate companion out of committee by voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 1508.   I thank Blaine Luetkemeyer for his leadership on this bill and the  cooperation of Ranking Member Comer and all the teams on both sides  working in support of it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1170) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 1 League in Irvine,  California, as the ``Tuskegee Airman Lieutenant Colonel Robert J.  Friend Memorial Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1170         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TUSKEGEE AIRMAN LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROBERT J.                     FRIEND MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1 League in Irvine, California, shall be       known and designated as the ``Tuskegee Airman Lieutenant       Colonel Robert J. Friend Memorial Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Tuskegee Airman Lieutenant Colonel       Robert J. Friend Memorial Post Office Building''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of H.R. 1170 to  designate the facility of the United States Postal Service at 1 League  in Irvine, California, as the ``Tuskegee Airman Lieutenant Colonel  Robert J. Friend Memorial Post Office Building''.   Before passing away in June of 2019, Lieutenant Colonel Friend was  one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen who took to the skies during  World War II as the first African American military aviators.   The roughly 1,000 Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,000 combat sorties,  destroyed 260 enemy aircrafts, and received 150 decorations of the  Flying Cross and Legion of Merit, fighting the Nazi Luftwaffe while  simultaneously striking a blow against racism back home.   Lieutenant Colonel Friend flew fighter aircrafts for nearly 2 years  during the war. During Lieutenant Colonel Friend's 142 combat missions,  he destroyed critical Nazi and Axis power military assets, helping move  the U.S. and ally forces towards victory during the war.   In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Friend served in strategic roles as  an operations officer for the 301st Squadron and was the final  operations officer of the 332nd Fighter Group. Lieutenant Colonel  Friend also served honorably in Korea and Vietnam.   Lieutenant Colonel Friend was the recipient of multiple military  awards for service, including the: Distinguished Flying Cross,  Presidential Unit Citation, Bronze Star with Flying Cross, three  Distinguished Service Medals, and an Air Medal. In addition, Lieutenant  Colonel Friend and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.   Following the war, Lieutenant Colonel Friend studied astrophysics at  the Air Force Institute of Technology and business at the University of  California in Los Angeles. After retiring from the Air Force in 1971,  he worked as a consultant on the development of missile systems and  space-station components near his home in Irvine, California.   Naming a post office for Tuskegee Airman Lieutenant Colonel Friend is  entirely appropriate given his distinguished, extraordinary  contributions to his State and country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much  time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Porter), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations of the Committee on Natural Resources.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 1170. I thank Representative Porter for her strong support in  helping to pass this important bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3210) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 1905 15th Street in  Boulder, Colorado, as the ``Officer Eric H. Talley Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3210         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. OFFICER ERIC H. TALLEY POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1905 15th Street in Boulder, Colorado,       shall be known and designated as the ``Officer Eric H. Talley       Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Officer Eric H. Talley Post Office       Building''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include materials on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3210 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1905 15th  Street in Boulder, Colorado, as the ``Officer Eric H. Talley Post  Office Building''.   Officer Talley joined the Boulder Police Department in 2010 and  served the community for 11 years before being tragically shot and  killed at a Boulder King Soopers grocery store on March 22, 2021, at  the age of 51.   Officer Talley was the first officer to arrive at the scene and was  one of ten individuals who were killed that day. He gave his life  protecting others and his sacrifice and intervention undoubtedly saved  lives during that horrible tragedy.   Officer Talley was recently posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor  by the Boulder Police Department, the department's highest honor, for  his heroic actions and sacrifice.   He was born in Houston, Texas, graduated high school in Albuquerque,  New Mexico, and earned a master's degree in computer science from Ball  State University in Indiana.   Before joining the Boulder Police Department, Officer Talley worked  in information technology, but at the age of 40 he felt a higher  calling to switch career paths and join law enforcement after the  tragic death of a friend.   In 2013, while serving as a police officer, he made local news when  he waded into a drainage ditch to rescue a mother duck and her  ducklings that were trapped in the ditch. Officer Talley was one of the  first officers to join the Boulder Police Department's drone team in  2017 where he worked with new technologies to find ways to improve  public safety and keep police officers safe.   His colleagues, friends, and family describe Officer Talley as a man  who worked as hard as he could to make a difference in the lives of  others every single day. He exemplified selflessness in life and in his  final act.   A beloved husband and father of seven, Officer Talley was known for  his kindness, compassion, and love for his family. He enjoyed board  games, fly fishing, golfing, and had a black belt in karate.   Naming a post office for Officer Eric Talley is an appropriate way to  honor his distinguished career and contributions to his State and  country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, because of time  constraints and scheduling problems, the gentleman from New York has a  bill coming up but he must get to a vote and other things, so he has  asked to speak now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), distinguished chair of the  Congressional LGBTQ plus Equality Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 3210, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 767) to designate the facility of the  United States Postal Service located at 40 Fulton Street in Middletown,  New York, as the ``Benjamin A. Gilman Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 767         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 40 Fulton Street in Middletown, New York,       shall be known and designated as the ``Benjamin A.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Benjamin A. Gilman Post Office       Building''.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 767, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 40 Fulton  Street in Middletown, New York, as the Benjamin A. Gilman Post Office  Building.   Benjamin Arthur Gilman was a distinguished public servant with  decades of service to both the State of New York and the United States  at large. He was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, on December 6, 2022.  He graduated from Middletown High School in Middletown, New York, in  1941. He received a B.S. from the Wharton School of Business and  Finance at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946.   From 1942 to 1945, he served in the United States Army Air Corps.  After his time in military service, he received a law degree from New  York Law School in 1950. From 1953 to 1955, he served as an assistant  attorney general to the New York State attorney general. He then served  as a member of the New York State Assembly from 1966 to 1972.   In 1972, he was elected to serve as a Member of Congress, serving for  three decades before retiring in 2003. During his time in this House,  he was chair of the Committee on International Relations. Congressman  Gilman died on December 17, 2016, in New York State.   Given his decades of service to our Nation, it is only fitting that  he be remembered by renaming this post office in his honor.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 767, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3419) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 66 Meserole Avenue in  Brooklyn, New York, as the ``Joseph R. Lentol Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3419         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOSEPH R. LENTOL POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 66 Meserole Avenue in Brooklyn, New York,       shall be known and designated as the ``Joseph R. Lentol Post       Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Joseph R.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3419, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 66 Meserole  Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, as the Joseph R. Lentol Post Office.   Assembly Member Joseph R. Lentol represented the 50th Assembly  District, comprised of the neighborhoods of Greenpoint, Williamsburg,  Fort Greene, and parts of Clinton Hill, for 48 years.   After graduating from law school and passing the New York State bar,  Joe began his government career as an assistant district attorney in  the Kings County district attorney's homicide division. In 1973, he was  elected to the New York State Assembly, representing north Brooklyn.   Joe was the third member of his family to serve in the New York State  Assembly, as his father and grandfather had also been elected to the  assembly. During decades in public service, Joe was a recognized  champion of fair labor practices, criminal justice reform, and  environmental protection.   Because of his knowledge, experience, and negotiation skills, Joe was  appointed to serve on various commissions, committees, and panels. He  chaired the Committee on Criminal and Civil Codes, the New York City  Community Action Board, the assembly Public Protection Budget  Committee, the assembly Committee on Public Employees, the assembly  Administrative Regulations Commission to create the State's open  meetings laws, and the Committee on Governmental Employees, which  oversees the State's pension and employee benefits, presiding over the  State's divestiture of its pension fund's investments in South Africa  as well as a multitude of bills strengthening organized labor.  Additionally, he chaired the assembly's Committee on Governmental  Operations, monitoring and overseeing the operations of State agencies  and departments.   For more than 20 years, as chair of the influential Codes Committee,  which has jurisdiction over criminal justice, Joe was an advocate for  and led efforts to modernize the State's criminal justice system.   Recognized for his leadership in correcting a system that unfairly  penalized youth, people of color, and the economically disadvantaged,  Joe was largely responsible for getting important legislation enacted  into law by working with six Governors, his Democratic colleagues, and,  often, members of the Republican majority in the State senate.   Joe championed the reform of the Rockefeller drug laws, which  mandated harsh sentences for possession and sale of drugs and  disproportionately targeted people of color.   In addition, Joe fought to raise the age in criminal law when a child  must be treated as an adult in the criminal justice system and for  other major criminal justice reforms that overhauled the State's  criminal discovery and bail laws and that guaranteed speedy trials.   Joe was also a member of the Governor's Commission on Sentencing  Reform, the New York State Temporary Commission on Voting Machine  Equipment, and the New York State Court of Appeals Justice Task Force,  and the New York State Comptrollers Investment Advisory Board.   Currently, Joe serves on the board of the New York State Public  Defender Association. Naming a post office for Representative Joseph R.  Lentol is entirely appropriate given his distinguished political career  and contributions to New York State and our country.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 3419, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1444) to designate the facility of  the United States Postal Service located at 132 North Loudoun Street,  Suite 1 in Winchester, Virginia, as the ``Patsy Cline Post Office''.

PATSY CLINE POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 132 North Loudoun Street, Suite 1 in       Winchester, Virginia, shall be known and designated as the       ``Patsy Cline Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Patsy Cline Post Office''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1444, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 132 North  Loudoun Street, Suite 1, in Winchester, Virginia, as the Patsy Cline  Post Office.   Patsy Cline was born in Winchester, Virginia, in 1932 during the  Great Depression. She began singing and performing at events and local  venues in the Winchester area at a young age and landed her first  recording contract in 1954. Her first hit, ``Walkin' After Midnight,''  debuted in 1957 and rose to number two on the country music charts.   In 1958, Cline moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and was the first solo  female singer to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Over the next  few years, Cline recorded several more hit songs, including ``I Fall to  Pieces'' and ``Crazy,'' and appeared on American Bandstand and The  Johnny Cash Show.   She was acclaimed for her bold, emotional, and haunting singing  voice, which drove many of her songs to the top of the country and pop  charts and influenced generations of future artists, from Reba McEntire  to Cyndi Lauper.  [[Page H5695]]    Tragically, Cline was killed in a plane crash in Tennessee in 1963 at  the age of 30. She was buried in Shenandoah Memorial Park outside of  Winchester, where a bell tower was built in her memory.   In 1973, she became the first female solo artist to be inducted into  the Country Music Hall of Fame. Cline's childhood home in Winchester  was designated as a historic place in 2011 and has drawn visitors from  around the world.   Naming a post office for Patsy Cline is a way we can honor her  substantial artistic and cultural contributions to our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3175 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 135 Main Street  in Biloxi, Mississippi, as the Robert S. McKeithen Post Office  Building.   Robert McKeithen was born on March 22, 1961, and graduated college  from the University of Mississippi. After college he served in the U.S.  Air Force with distinction, earning the Air Force Commendation Medal,  the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Achievement Medal.   After his service in the Air Force, he joined the Biloxi, Mississippi  Police Department where he served 24 years. He was one of 13 officers  to earn the Medal of Valor for rescue efforts in the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina.   Unfortunately, his life was cut short when he was shot and killed on  Sunday, May 5, 2019.   Officer McKeithen was a dedicated servant of his country and  community and a dedicated husband and father to four children.   Mr. Speaker, naming this post office in his honor is a fitting way to  remember this dedicated officer. I encourage all of my colleagues to  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from Kansas has no further speakers I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York.

Kapaun Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2044 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 17 East Main  Street in Herington, Kansas, as the Captain Emil J.

He first studied classics and philosophy at Conception College in  Missouri, and then attended Kenrick Theological Seminary in St. Louis.  In 1940 he was ordained a Catholic priest and appointed an auxiliary  chaplain in the U.S. Army in 1943.   During his time in the Army Chaplain Corps, he served American troops  in the Burma and India theaters until the end of World War II. In 1948  he reenlisted in the Army Chaplain Corps and was mobilized in support  of the Korean conflict in 1950. He was taken captive by Chinese forces  on November 2, 1950, during the Battle of Unsan, after repeatedly  coming under fire to rescue wounded soldiers.   During his captivity, he rejected multiple opportunities for escape,  instead remaining a POW providing physical and spiritual support to  other POWs. On May 23, 1951, Chaplain Kapaun died of illness and  maltreatment.   In 1993, Pope John Paul II declared Chaplain Kapaun to be a Servant  of God, the first step on the path towards canonization in the Catholic  Church.   In 2013, President Obama posthumously awarded Chaplain Kapaun the  Medal of Honor for his service to our Nation.   Naming a post office for Chaplain Kapaun is one more way we can  ensure that his deeds are not forgotten. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from Kansas has no further speakers, then I am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 2044, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 960) to designate the facility of the  United States Postal Service located at 3493 Burnet Avenue in  Cincinnati, Ohio, as the ``John H. Leahr and Herbert M. Heilbrun Post  Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 960         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOHN H. LEAHR AND HERBERT  MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 960, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3493 Burnet  Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the John H. Leahr and Herbert M.  Heilbrun Post Office.   World War II veterans John H. Leahr and Herbert M. Heilbrun served as  pilots in the Army Air Corps. Mr. Leahr served as a Mustang pilot with  the Tuskegee Airmen, and Mr. Heilbrun served as a B-17 bomber pilot.   Throughout World War II, the Tuskegee Airmen were tasked with  escorting American bomber groups flying over enemy territory. Mr.  Heilbrun's group was one of the few who sustained no losses, due to the  heroic efforts of the Tuskegee Airmen.   Fifty years after the war, Herb Heilbrun met John Leahr when he  attended an annual meeting of the Tuskegee Airmen to express his  gratitude for their protection and service to his group during the war.  At that meeting, they learned that they had flown some of the same  missions in Europe and that they shared numerous other traits as well.   Mr. Leahr and Mr. Heilbrun dedicated their later years to promoting  interracial understanding and unity. They were honored for their book,  ``Black and White Airmen: Their True History,'' by the Harvard  Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. Their work chronicles  their history, friendship, and efforts to bring others together to  overcome racial differences.   Mr. Leahr passed away on March 27, 2015, at the age of 94. And Mr.  Heilbrun passed away at age 100 on December 18, 2020.   Renaming a post office for both of these men jointly is a fitting  remembrance of their work to create unity and understanding. I  encourage all of my colleagues to support this important bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  from Kansas has no further speakers, then I am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 960, and I want to compliment my colleague and friend, Mr.  Wenstrup, on his bill. It is a very inspiring story. I intend to read  their book, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the balance of my  time.
