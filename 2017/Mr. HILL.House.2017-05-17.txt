 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police Week to  pay tribute to the Nation's law enforcement men and women.   Established in 1962 by President Kennedy, National Police Week serves  as a reminder of the incredible sacrifice our police officers make  every day to serve and protect the people in our States and  communities.   Just last week, Lieutenant Kevin Mainhart of the Yell County  Sheriff's Department was killed in the line of duty during a traffic  stop in Dardanelle, Arkansas. This tragedy reminds us of the danger  that all of our men and women who police our streets have to face.   Every American should be proud of our neighbors and fellow citizens  who get up every morning, put on their uniform and badge, leave their  families, and serve us all, keeping our cities and towns safe and  trying to build the trust and faith among our citizens.   I respect and appreciate the important work of our police and our law  enforcement men and women in Arkansas and throughout the Nation. They  deserve our gratitude.                            ____________________
