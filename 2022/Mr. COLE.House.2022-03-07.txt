 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of Betty  Wunder, who dedicated many of her 82 years providing unconditional care  and comfort to children and adults throughout Oklahoma in her  profession of diagnostic radiology, but primarily out of her unwavering  view of life guided by integrity.   Betty arrived in Oklahoma City at the University of Oklahoma  Children's Hospital in December of 1971, and immediately began to make  revolutionary changes in her department. She rewrote protocols for  pediatric x-ray to promote a safer experience for children undergoing  this procedure, which are still used in radiology departments  nationwide today.   Betty quickly rose through the ranks inside the Children's Hospital  becoming an associate professor at OU Health Sciences Center in 1977 by  a unanimous vote of the Board of Regents. As with every position she  held, she took this one very seriously and assisted in the development  of the curriculum for what is now the radiology technology degree.   Betty later became the administrative director of radiology in the  summer of 1981. She possessed the rare quality of understanding the  need for everyone involved to be successful and rarely allowed the  light of honor or esteem to be shown to her. From her point of view it  was always a group effort or no effort at all.   In the early 1980s, Betty was instrumental in working with others in  the State to guide the purchase of the first MRI machine in Oklahoma at  the Children's Hospital. She was very proud of this accomplishment and  believes it put Children's on the map in terms of expanding diagnostic  and treatment options for Oklahoma children.   Throughout her career she was a member of the American Society of  Radiologic Technologists and the Oklahoma Society of Radiologic  Technologists. She received many awards and honors during her career,  including the 1983 and 1986 Radiology Technologist of the Year.   In retirement, Betty accepted a position on the advisory board of  CommunityWorks, an Oklahoma behavioral and mental health continuum of  care. She also reveled in her ability to effect care for children and  adolescents in the Department of Human Services and the Oklahoma  Juvenile Affairs care.   She was hands-on with the kids, staff, and her beloved quality  assurance program. Betty was a teacher to all who were prepared and  willing to learn. She brought out the best in people with great respect  for their capabilities and humanity.   Mr. Speaker, she will be missed and revered.
