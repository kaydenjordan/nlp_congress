 Mr. Speaker, on August 21, a total solar eclipse will  stretch from coast to coast in the United States for the first time in  99 years, and I am proud to say that my district in southern Illinois  is the prime viewing spot.   In fact, my home county of Jackson County near Carbondale, and also  my front yard, is where the eclipse will be at its apex.   For 2 minutes and 38 seconds, it will be like total darkness in the  middle of the day. The city's population of 26,000 is expected to  multiply many times over from visitors around the world coming for  tourism and to see this astronomical Super Bowl.   So I would encourage my colleagues and the American people to visit  for some world championship southern Illinois barbecue, the beautiful  outdoors, the wonderful wineries, and welcome one and all people for  the best viewing moments of this solar eclipse.                            ____________________
