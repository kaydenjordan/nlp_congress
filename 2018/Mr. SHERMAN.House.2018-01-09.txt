 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   In this House, we were on both sides of the Iran nuclear deal, but we  were united in knowing that Iran is not an ally of the United States-- at least, the Islamic Republic of Iran is not--and this House never  agreed to ignore extreme human rights abuses simply because the  Government of Iran has agreed to limitations on its nuclear program.   This resolution puts us on the right side of history by stating that  the House of Representatives stands with the people of Iran and  condemns the Iranian regime's serious human rights abuses. It goes on  to encourage the administration to expedite the licensing of  communications technology to entities in Iran to improve the ability of  the Iranian people to speak freely and also calls on companies around  the world not to allow this regime to use any device or any technology  to cut the Iranian people from social media and from other  communications platforms.                                time  1430    We have seen in Iran a people dedicated to democracy and dedicated to  improving their own lives. Over 1,000 Iranians have been arrested, and  at least two dozen have been killed; this in a country with a great  history. The Cyrus Cylinder is perhaps the first human rights document  in world history. A model of it stands in the United Nations to  commemorate the dedication of the Iranian people to human rights.   Today, they shout ``No Gaza;'' ``No Lebanon;'' ``No Syria;'' ``My  life for Iran,'' because they know that this regime's involvement in  supporting terrorism around the world has not only devastated Syria,  where Assad clings to power and half a million people have died, not  only brings death and destruction to Lebanon and Yemen, but it has also  devastated the Iranian economy, because this regime insists upon  supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. Those are only the  terrorist regimes whose names begin with H.   Of course, this regime has killed over 5,000 members of the LGBT  community solely for who they are and whom they love.   This is a regime whose human rights record should, indeed, be  criticized by the formal adoption of a resolution by this House of  Representatives.   I also want to point out that the travel ban or Muslim ban  implemented by this administration is harming our efforts to support  the Iranian people at this time of crisis.   It says that if leaders of these demonstrations want to come to my  community, where they have tens of thousands of Iranian-American  supporters, they can't do it. And if, God forbid, they fear for their  lives and want to flee, even if they are carefully vetted, they cannot  set foot on American soil.   So I look forward to us standing with the people of Iran and  eliminating the Muslim ban. I look forward to this House saying that we  stand with the people who are putting their lives on the line to fight  for democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H55]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I commend our committee chairman for an  outstanding speech.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), and I ask unanimous consent that he be able to  control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan resolution. It will put America and  this Congress on the side of the Iranian people.   Regardless of which side you are on as to the nuclear deal, we are  all dedicated to peace and democracy in Iran and an end to its support  for terrorism around the world, support that not only causes damage  outside Iran's borders but, as the demonstrators shouting in over 50  Iranian cities have clearly indicated, devastates the economy of Iran.   To us here in Washington, we may believe that the face of this regime  is that of Foreign Minister Zarif, the dapper, debonair diplomat,  meeting with us in Geneva and Vienna. But the real face of this regime  is that of Alan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Kurdish child found washed up on  the beach in Turkey after fleeing the war in Syria, a war that has  claimed nearly 500,000 lives because, and only because, Assad has been  propped up by the Iranian regime. The other faces of this regime are  the real faces of Iranian protestors who put their lives on the line  for the freedom of their country.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that deserves the support of both sides  of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 535, the  Taiwan Travel Act. I am pleased to have joined with Congressman Chabot  in introducing this bill, the Taiwan Travel Act.   Taiwan is not just an important trading partner, our 14th largest  market. It is not just a land of 23 million people. It is a democratic  ally of the United States, a place where our values are displayed in  the Asia-Pacific region. Yet it would be surprising for most Americans  to know that leaders from Taiwan are not allowed to visit the United  States under any reasonable format. Instead, the President of Taiwan  cannot visit Washington, D.C., but can visit Los Angeles for a  refueling stop on the way to Costa Rica.   What an absurd fiction that the President of Taiwan would fly across  the Pacific again and again to visit their friends in Costa Rica or  other  [[Page H58]]  Central American countries and that the refueling stop in the United  States is just a 2-day effort to put fuel on a jet plane.   Now, my district actually benefits from this, because when the  President and several different officials of Taiwan come to America,  they refuel at Los Angeles Airport and they come to the Sheraton  Universal Hotel in the 30th Congressional District. But in spite of the  benefit both in terms of image and the economy that the current  situation provides for the 30th District, it is time for us to grow up  and it is time for us to realize that Taiwan is a vital ally and that  its most important leaders should be visiting Washington, D.C., and  talking not only to the legislative branch, but talking to the  executive branch as well.   We should no longer be in a circumstance where, when Members of  Congress from other parts of the country want to visit with the  President of Taiwan, they have to fly to Universal City and stay at the  Sheraton in my district and visit there.   We could communicate far better if the President of Taiwan was able  to land at Dulles and be in the halls of Congress.   This bill simply says that it is time to encourage travel of the  high-ranking officials of each country to the other and meetings at the  highest levels. These are important steps in ending this effort to  isolate Taiwan, because by encouraging a greater level of high-level  visits and dialogue, we would ease Taiwan's international isolation and  reaffirm that the U.S. has a political and security commitment to the  freedom of Taiwan.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Chabot for introducing this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every year, China threatens Taiwan, attempts to strangle  that democracy, bases missiles just over the Taiwan Straits, conducts  military exercises designed to simulate an invasion, hurts the economy  of Taiwan, and hurts the people of Taiwan.                                time  1530    What is the mildest possible response that the United States could  make to these provocative and hostile actions? It is the adoption of  the Taiwan Travel Act, H.R. 535, to simply have meetings with Taiwanese  officials and simply allow them to land, even at those airports in the  United States inconvenient for refueling on the way to Costa Rica.   We should welcome the leaders of Taiwan as we welcome the leaders of  other allies of the United States, and this is the mildest answer we  could make to the saber-rattling from Beijing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3320. Clearly, Taiwan should be a full  member of the World Health Organization. All nations should be full  members of the World Health Organization, especially one with an  advanced health system that can help us stop pandemics from spreading  from one country to another. That is why it makes sense for us to  advocate Taiwanese participation in all international bodies, but  particularly the U.N.'s World Health Organization.   I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation that is critical to  preparing to prevent pandemics. Look at the nonsense that is being  foisted on the world by Beijing. For political reasons, in an effort to  say that Taiwan doesn't exist except as a province, they are  endangering the health of the world because pathogens have not been  told that they are not to go to Taiwan. The epidemics have not been  told to spare humankind from the inefficiencies and glaring omissions  that occur when an important country is excluded from the World Health  Organization.   Taiwan's exclusion, even from observer status, from the World Health  Organization is a terrible symbol, an attempt to deny self- determination to 23 million people. But it is worse than a terrible  symbol. It is a practical impediment to stopping epidemics. It is a  practical impediment to world health, and it is time for the United  States to have a strategy to reach out to the world and say Taiwan  needs to be part of health planning. Taiwan needs to be part of the  lifesaving initiatives of the World Health Organization.   So I look forward to working with our colleagues to pass this  legislation and working with the State Department to implement it. I  look forward to the day when we do not put the world at risk of an  epidemic that could have been contained but for the malicious symbolism  being foisted on us by Beijing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation has support from just about everyone, bipartisan. It  is obviously necessary for Taiwan to be part of the World Health  Organization. To exclude it is to put the health of anyone who might be  affected by a pandemic, to put that interest below Beijing's interest  in strangling Taiwan diplomatically and economically.   I urge the adoption of this legislation, and I look forward to  working with the State Department until we achieve our objective, which  is, at a minimum, Taiwan's return to observer status at the World  Health Organization.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
