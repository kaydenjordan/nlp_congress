 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, has a  question for both counsel for the former President and the House  managers.   The clerk will read the question, and we will recognize first the  counsel for the former President.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House managers have argued that if the Senate cannot       convict former officers, then the Constitution creates a       January exception pursuant to which a President is free to       act with impunity because he is not subject to impeachment,       conviction, and removal and/or disqualification. But isn't a       President subject to criminal prosecution after he leaves       office for acts committed in office, even if those acts are       committed in January?    Mr. Counsel CASTOR. The Senator from Texas's question raises a very,  very important point. There is no such thing as a January exception to  impeachment. There is only the text of the Constitution, which makes  very clear that a former President is subject to criminal sanction  after his Presidency for any illegal acts he commits.   There is no January exception to impeachment. There is simply a way  we treat high crimes and misdemeanors allegedly committed by a  President when he is in office--impeachment--and how we treat criminal  behavior by a private citizen when they are not in office.  [[Page S694]]    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Senators, thank you for this  excellent question.   Wouldn't a President who decides to commit his crimes in the last few  weeks in office, like President Trump by inciting the insurrection  against the counting of electoral college votes, be subject to criminal  prosecution by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, for  example, the Department of Justice?   Well, of course he would be, but that is true of the President  regardless of when he commits his offense in office. In other words,  that is an argument for prosecuting him if he tried to stage an  insurrection against the Union in his third year in office or his  second year in office. You could say, well, he could be prosecuted  afterwards.   The reason that the Framers gave Congress--the House the power to  impeach; the Senate the power to try, convict, remove, and disqualify,  was to protect the Republic. It is not a vindictive power.   I know a lot of people are very angry with Donald Trump about these  terrible events that took place. We don't come here in anger, contrary  to what you heard today. We come here in the spirit of protecting our  Republic, and that is what it is all about. But their January exception  would essentially invite Presidents and other civil officers to run  rampant in the last few weeks in office on the theory that the House  and the Senate wouldn't be able to get it together in time--certainly  according to their demands for months and months of investigation-- wouldn't be able to get it together in time in order to vindicate the  Constitution. That can't be right. That can't be right.   We know that the peaceful transfer of power is always the most  dangerous moment for democracies around the world. Talk to the  diplomats. Talk to the historians. They will tell you that is a moment  of danger. That is when you get the coups. That is when you get the  insurrections. That is when you get the seditious plots. And you know  what, you don't even have to read history for that. You don't even have  to consult the Framers. You don't have to look around the world. It  just happened to us. The moment when we were just going to collect the  already-certified electoral college votes from the States by the  popular majorities within each State--except for Maine and Nebraska,  which do it by congressional district as well as statewide, but  otherwise, it is just the popular majorities in the States. And we were  about to certify it, and we got hit by a violent, insurrectionary mob.    Don't take our word for it. Listen to the tapes, unless they are  going to claim those are fabricated too. And the people are yelling:  ``This is our house now'' and ``Where are the `blank' votes at?'' and  ``Show us the votes,'' et cetera.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is up.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.
