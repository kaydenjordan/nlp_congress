 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  United Auto Workers powering the Big Three and all workers on the front  lines in the fight for a future with fair pay, dignity, and the right  to benefit from the profits of their hard work currently being hoarded  by corporate CEOs.   In 2022, Ford's CEO raked in $21 million, Chrysler's made $24  million, and GM's made $29 million. Right now, the maximum pay for Big  Three UAW workers is $66,000. You can't even see the line because that  is how little they are paid in comparison to their corporate bosses.   It would take a UAW employee making the maximum salary almost 440  years to make what the CEO of General Motors makes in 1 year. Yet,  these CEOs lie that their workers threaten our economy.   Let me be clear: Any company that can afford 40 percent raises for  CEOs already raking in millions can afford 40 percent raises for their  workers, who our clean energy economy depends on. These workers don't  threaten our economy, but CEOs do.   To the Big Three, pay those workers what you owe them. Don't act like  you forgot.   Solidarity forever.                            ____________________
