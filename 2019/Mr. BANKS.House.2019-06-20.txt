 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment is simple. It would reduce  spending in this division by 14 percent, the amount that is needed to  avoid busting the budget caps and preventing sequestration, which would  compromise our national security.   This division would spend $1.3 billion more than the 2019 enacted  level.   In their quest to spend every taxpayer dollar from this generation  and our future generations, my friends on the other side of the aisle  have proposed spending packages that in total will bust the budget caps  by nearly $90 billion.   While my colleagues may be willing to put national security at risk  to fulfill budget-busting policy promises, I will not.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we have got to think about the audacity of  these claims.   I am not talking in my amendment about cutting any specific program.  I am proposing an amendment to cut 14 percent across the board to  prevent the excessive spending that we are seeing being proposed from  across the aisle that would spend substantially more than what the  Federal Government spent in the year before.   Madam Chair, we simply cannot afford this reckless proposal from my  friends on the other side of the aisle.   My amendment offers Members a clear choice. If a Member votes ``no,''  that Member supports busting the budget caps and putting our national  security at risk due to entering into sequestration, which is  inevitable if we pass the spending measures being proposed from across  the aisle.   However, by supporting my amendment, Members can show that they  support fiscal sanity by honoring the budget caps and protecting our  national security.   Madam Chair, I will continue to come back to this microphone over and  over and over again and propose this same amendment to each nondefense  spending division, because I promised my constituents in northeast  Indiana that that is exactly what I would do if they elected me to  Congress, that I would fight to reduce spending to rebuild our military  and to support fiscal sanity in our Nation, once again, by fighting for  balanced budgets and fiscally conservative spending measures.                                time  1215    This amendment fulfills all those promises to my constituents and  families in northeast Indiana, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It reduces spending  in this division by 14 percent, the amount that is needed to avoid  busting the budget caps and preventing sequestration.   With these spending packages, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are making it clear that they have no interest in reducing our  national debt. If they did, they would not be proposing bills that  would bust the budget caps by nearly $90 billion, which they are fully  aware would trigger sequestration and lead to devastating and severe  cuts to our national defense.   In this division alone, they are proposing to spend $37.2 billion,  which is $1.73 billion above the previous year's enacted amount and  $7.2 billion over the President's 2020 request. This does not even  include the $2.2 billion in additional funding that is not subject to  the caps.   Again, my amendment would bring spending in this division to the  level needed to avoid sequestration through a 14 percent across-the- board cut.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, frankly, the arguments from my colleagues  who oppose this amendment simply don't add up.   By busting the budget caps, the nondefense programs that they are so  passionately defending would face $55 billion in automatic cuts.   So it seems my colleagues are willing to allow reductions in  nondefense spending if they can also force reckless defense cuts that  endanger national security.   While that may be acceptable to those on the other side of the aisle,  it is not acceptable to me.   My amendment will bring spending in this division to the level needed  to avoid sequestration and to protect our national security.   Mr. Chairman, when I ran for this position, I promised my  constituents that I would do my part to rein in Washington's spending  addiction and safeguard the strength of the American military.   Mr. Chair, I am proud that this amendment accomplishes both of those  goals. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
