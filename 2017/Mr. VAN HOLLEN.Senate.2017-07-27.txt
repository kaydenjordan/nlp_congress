 I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, I voted in support of H.R. 3364, the  Countering America's Adversaries Act, which sanctions Russia, Iran, and  North Korea. I call on President Trump to sign this package into law,  without delay.   This act imposes tough sanctions on Russia for its interference in  our elections, its attempts to undermine faith in the democratic  process across the West, its support of the brutal regime of Syrian  President Bashar al-Assad, and its intervention in Ukraine. Critically,  the legislation prevents President Trump--who has repeatedly  demonstrated his affinity for Vladimir Putin--from removing sanctions  on Russia without the approval of the Congress. It sends a clear and  unequivocal message to the Kremlin: the United States will not tolerate  attacks on our democracy.   The administration has repeatedly certified Iran's compliance with  the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This landmark, multilateral  nuclear accord is a critical part of our effort to prevent Iran from  obtaining a nuclear weapon and has made our partners and allies in the  region safer. However, Iran's ballistic missile tests, its support for  regional terrorism, and its human rights abuses merit a strong  response. This act codifies executive orders sanctioning Iran for these  dangerous, nonnuclear actions.   Our response to North Korea--which U.S. officials now believe will be  able to field a reliable, nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic  missile as early as next year--must be bold and comprehensive. While I  support the sanctions imposed on North Korea under the Countering  America's Adversaries Act, I believe they fall far short of the  aggressive sanctions needed to sever North Korea's ties to the  international financial system and create the leverage necessary for  successful nuclear negotiations. That is why I strongly urge the Senate  to pass the Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act, which I  introduced with Senator Toomey. I look forward to working expeditiously  with my colleagues to pass comprehensive sanctions on North Korea in  the fall.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I cannot support John K. Bush II's  nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.   Mr. Bush does not possess the temperament or discernment required of  a Federal judge. He is not only a deeply flawed nominee; he is  unqualified for a lifetime judicial appointment.   William Howard Taft, 27th President of the United States, 10th Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court, and a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals, once said, ``Don't write so that you can be understood, write  so that you can't be misunderstood.'' Mr. Bush's more than 400 blog  posts, written under a pseudonym, cannot be misunderstood despite his  attempts to distance himself from his writings. In his blog posts, Mr.  Bush equated a woman's right to an abortion to chattel slavery,  advanced spurious claims based on conspiracy theories propagated by  White supremacists, advocated violence and use of force against  Democratic opponents, argued that journalist's First Amendment rights  should be weakened, and advocated for unlimited amounts of money in  politics.   When asked to clarify his past written statements during his  confirmation  [[Page S4418]]  hearing, Mr. Bush said that his, ``personal views are irrelevant to the  position for which [he has] been nominated.'' I do not believe that  hundreds of crude, insensitive, and hateful posts, widely shared on the  internet, are irrelevant in analyzing a candidate's suitability for a  Federal judgeship. Mr. Bush's writings and statements make me question  if he could apply the law evenly and without bias.   Every judge takes the oath of justice and swears to ``administer  justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and  to the rich,'' and to ``faithfully and impartially discharge and  perform all the duties incumbent'' upon them. Based on Mr. Bush's own  statements, I am not confident that he will uphold that oath.                            ____________________
