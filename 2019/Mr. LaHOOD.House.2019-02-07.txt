 Mr. Speaker, as the co-chair of the Alzheimer's Working  Group on the Ways and Means Committee, I rise today to raise awareness  about this disease that has a profound impact on so many families  across Illinois and our country.   Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, causing issues with  memory and behavior. More than 3 million individuals are diagnosed with  Alzheimer's per year.   Alzheimer's transcends race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic standing,  touching families of all backgrounds. For 2019, more than $400 million  was allocated for research, but it is more than just funding that is  needed to find a cure.   As a Member of Congress, I have been proud to support legislation  aimed at finding a cure for this disease, such as the RAISE Family  Caregivers Act and the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, both of  which were signed into law.   While we have taken important strides to find a cure for this  disease, we still have much work to do. I look forward to working with  Members on both sides of the aisle to find a cure for this devastating  disease.                            ____________________
