 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Courtney) for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership.   I rise as a cosponsor of the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health  Care and Social Service Workers Act.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Scott, and  chairwoman of the subcommittee, Ms. Adams. I thank the complete  committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor.   As I have listened to testimony over the last couple of days, I began  to frame a concept that we must do the right thing.   As I have interacted with my constituents, as I understand the work  of healthcare workers and social service workers, they take care of the  broken of our society, some who may be ill, some who may have  necessities of life that have not been fulfilled.                                time  1000    These individuals are under enormous pressure, yet our workers in the  workplace caring for these people have the largest heart. They train to  be sympathetic and empathetic.   I am reminded of a situation in my local hospital where an individual  broke loose because that person was suffering from a mental challenge,  illness, health need, mixed in with a population that was there for  other reasons. That person was in the mix of healthcare workers trying  to care for others, but trying to be kind, sympathetic, and caring, but  that person was in a state of crisis that was threatening to the  patients and threatening to the workers.   This is a crucial act. We are at a crisis moment. It is important to  recognize that these incidents, as have been evidenced on the floor of  the House, happen every day, even as we speak. Those individuals with  that person were not able to bring him to a resolve, and law  enforcement had to be engaged.   Those are situations that make it difficult. We need this interim  response, and we need it quickly. 200,000 facilities will be covered,  and, as was evidenced on the floor by Mr. Courtney, at $9,000 per  facility. That is a  [[Page H9134]]  worthwhile investment to stop someone who is injured from having a  lifelong series of injuries.    Coming from the Texas Medical Center in my community  and many other hospitals and seeing the proliferation of health  clinics, federally qualified health clinics, and social service  agencies all attempting to do the right thing--and the patients who are  there deserve to have the best care possible, but they are, in many  instances, ill; they are, in many instances, broken. In order to have  the staff continue to serve them, let's protect those workers. Let's  stand alongside those workers.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically support this  legislation and let us begin to stand alongside those who work with  those who are most in need.    Madam Chair, I rise to speak in strong support of  H.R. 1309, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social  Service Workers Act.''   This bill offers workplace violence protection to our nation's  caregivers--including nurses, social workers, and many others who  dedicate their lives to caring for those in need.   Last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that health  care and social service workers were nearly five times as likely to  suffer a serious workplace violence injury than workers in other  sectors.   Public employees, such as care givers in state and local government,  health care and social service work, suffer particularly high rates of  workplace violence.   In 2017, state government health care and social service workers were  almost nine times more likely to be injured by an assault than private- sector health care workers.   Workplace violence often causes both physical and emotional harm.   Victims of these incidents often suffer career-ending post-traumatic  stress disorders that take away their livelihoods and weaken an already  stretched health care workforce.   In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 707,400 Social  Workers are employed in the United States.   Social worker employment is expected to grow 16 percent between 2016  and 2026; a much faster rate than the average career in the United  States.  [[Page H9135]]    The ratio of social workers to populations varies widely in the  United States, ranging from 80 per 100,000 people in Arkansas to 572  per 100,000 in Washington, D.C.   Northeast states tend to have high numbers of social workers per  capita, and the southern states have fewer social workers per capita.   Social workers work in a variety of settings, including mental health  clinics, schools, child welfare and human service agencies, hospitals,  settlement houses, community development corporations, and private  practices.   They generally work full time and may need to work evenings,  weekends, and holidays.   There is currently no standard from OSHA, the federal agency created  to protect workers' safety, that requires employers to implement  violence prevention plans that would help reduce workplace violence  injuries among health care and social service workers.   The lack of an enforceable standard means that OSHA has few  meaningful tools to protect health care workers from the threat of  workplace violence.   Unless Congress intervenes, it is highly unlikely there will be any  action taken to protect health care workers in the next decade.   The Government Accountability Office estimated, conservatively, that  it takes OSHA at least 7 years to issue a standard.   Two of the most significant OSHA standards issued in recent history-- crystalline silica and beryllium, which cause irreversible lung  disease--each took OSHA 20 years to finalize.   Despite OSHA promises and its obligation to defend workers' safety,  the Trump Administration is erecting new barriers that will prevent  OSHA from protecting caregivers from workplace violence.   This bill is needed more now due to a shift in the social work  industry: today's social workers are becoming less focused on solving  problems and more focused on primary prevention, providing  interventions in advance to prevent problems from ever occurring in at- risk populations.   Social work is more than a job.   Social workers help millions of Americans live fuller, more  productive and safer lives.   They often are the primary front line of assistance to 13.9 percent  of Americans living below the poverty line.   Through mentorship, social workers have contributed to a 68 percent  decline in the juvenile arrest rate between 1996 and 2015.   The incarceration rate in the United States is approximately 716 per  100,000, the highest in the world, which means that social workers are  invaluable in helping the formerly incarcerated transition into  community life.   Social workers provide substantial care and services to the mentally  ill.   Reports state that 1 in 4 people in the world will be affected by  mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.   Child Protective Services and its social workers check up on 3.2  million children each year.   Every year, more than 3.6 million referrals are made to child  protection agencies. These referrals involve more than 6.6 million  children.   Social Workers are the first line of prevention to prevent over 1.2  million students drop outs from high school each year (one every 26  seconds).   Both Child and Family Social Worker and Clinical Social Worker rank  among the top 100 best jobs of 2019.   Professional social workers are the largest group of mental health  services providers in the United States.   83 percent of all social workers are female. 86 percent of Master of  Social Work graduates in 2015 were female.   47 percent of social workers work in the child, family, and school  sector, 26 percent work in healthcare, 18 percent work in mental health  and substance abuse, and 9 percent work in other sectors.   The primary employers of social workers are governments (41 percent),  private nonprofit or charitable organizations (34 percent), and  private-for-profit businesses (22 percent).   More than 40 percent of all disaster mental health volunteers trained  by the American Red Cross are professional social workers.   The importance of social workers has been recognized by Jane Addams,  a social worker, becoming one of the first women to receive a Nobel  Peace Prize in 1931.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1309.    Madam Speaker, I have worked in the area of criminal  justice and juvenile justice for as many years as I have served in the  United States Congress.   Dealing with juveniles here in this country and giving them a pathway  of opportunity to success has been my dream and goal. I intend to  introduce the Omnibus Juvenile Justice Restoration and Uplift Act.   There are 75 million juveniles, plus, in the United States since  2013. That number has grown. That means that one in four have the  possibility of being in the juvenile delinquency system. That should  not be tolerated.   My bill will include adding more trained social workers; giving  sensitivity training and special training to our law enforcement  officers, who really want to be role models; to Ban the Box, so they do  not have a lifetime of saying, as a juvenile I was arrested; ending  solitary confinement throughout the entire United States for juveniles;  alternative sentencing, so that old-fashioned juvenile detention jails  can be closed; gang intervention, so that we can find a way for  resolution and direction and another way for gang prevention, violence  cessation, wrap-around services, closing all juvenile centers over a  10-year period, and finally, conflict resolution.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in introducing this legislation.  Our children are our priority.                            ____________________
