 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Lee for teeing that up, our good  friend Congresswoman Barbara Lee who succeeded my friend Ron Dellums.  Ron was a giant, and I truly admired him.  [[Page H7906]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in honored memory of a great American who  served with distinction in this House for 27 years, the late gentleman  from California, former Congressman Ron Dellums.   Like my father, former Congressman Bill Clay, Congressman Dellums  will forever be revered as one of the founding members of the  Congressional Black Caucus, and he was also a founding member of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus.   Ron was a legendary figure. Whatever task he took on, he excelled in  it. I first met Congressman Dellums when I was a very young man in  college and I was assigned to this Chamber as an assistant door keeper.  My door was what is known as the west door, and I had to know Ron.   I remember two instances where one time Ron Dellums portrayed the  iconic figure of Frederick Douglass in a play, and I was so impressed  with that.   He was also a member of the congressional baseball team and played  first base.   Whatever he did, he did it well.   Our families became close, and when I came back to this body as a  Member, our professional relationship continued. When I first met him,  I was immediately impressed, not just with his powerful intellect, but  with his fearless advocacy to end the war in Vietnam, protect the right  to vote, speak truth to power in defense of our most vulnerable  citizens, and his unyielding demand that America must be a beacon for  human rights around the world.   During his first run for Congress in 1970, former Vice President  Spiro Agnew branded Ron Dellums as a ``dangerous radical'' for his  vigorous opposition to the Vietnam war. In response to that, Ron  Dellums said, ``If it's radical to oppose the insanity and cruelty of  the Vietnam war; if it's radical to oppose racism and sexism and all  other forms of oppression; if it's radical to want to alleviate  poverty, hunger, disease, homelessness, and other forms of human  misery, then I'm proud to be called a radical.''                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand on the shoulders of Ronald Dellums  as we continue the unfinished struggle to make America live up to all  that we promise as a great nation, and I hope all Members will join me  as we send our deepest condolences to the family and give thanks for  his courageous leadership.
