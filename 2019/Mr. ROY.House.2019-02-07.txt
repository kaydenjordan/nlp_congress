 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for  yielding time, and I thank him for his leadership on this important  issue.   We are here because we are discussing the importance of border  security for the United States of America, a question of our  sovereignty, the basic duty of a sovereign nation to secure its  borders.   I had the great privilege of spending some time with the men and  women of the Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas  this past week--2 days--with my fellow Texas freshman Congressman   Dan  Crenshaw. What I saw was alarming.   What we learned from Border Patrol is that there will be upwards of  400,000 people crossing the border through the Rio Grande Valley sector  this year alone. And of that 400,000 people, 200,000 of them, give or  take, won't even be apprehended because the men and women of the Border  Patrol don't have the tools they need, don't have the fencing and the  barriers they need, don't have the ability to drive a vehicle  parallel--lateral--to the Rio Grande River, don't have the radio signal  to be able to communicate on the border.   We found that, of the 200,000 people who will be apprehended, 90  percent of them will be captured and released because we have  judicially mandated capture and release today. We have judges who have  told us that we have got to capture people and then release them back  out into our communities without going through the proper processes to  truly vet asylum and truly vet what we are dealing with. The result of  that brings tragic consequences.   The Gulf Cartel in Mexico will make $130 million this year--$130  million--trafficking human beings across the Rio Grande Valley sector.  They are integrated with FARC. They are integrated with terrorist  networks. They have operational control of our border along Texas, and  we are just acting like there is nothing to see.   The Speaker of the House had us in session for less than 48 hours  last week with a handful of show votes. What do we have this week? More  votes just that are kind of plodding along, suspension votes.   We are not having a robust debate. This Chamber is virtually empty.  We are not having a robust debate about our border and our national  security and about the lives of American citizens and the lives of the  migrants who seek to come here.   There are migrants today who are endangered and enslaved to the  cartels. There were 54 people found in a stash house last Friday when I  was with Border Patrol, in a house in Houston, who are now being held  hostage by cartels to pay their money back because the cartels brought  them into the United States.   How is that compassion? How is that somehow beneficial to migrants?   That is the truth. Those are the facts when we talk to our men and  women in the Border Patrol.   Let's talk about the women, the young girls, who are abused on the  path. I was on the Rio Grande River, and I spoke to a 10-year-old and  an 11-year-old girl. My son Charlie is going to turn 10 this year.  These girls were traveling with no parents. They want to have a better  life.   I want to welcome folks to the United States of America, but you have  got to have legal channels to make it work, both for our safety and the  safety of the migrants who come here.    It is extraordinary that we are even having this debate. I cannot  believe that this body, the people's House, is ignoring this great  tragedy that is going on on our southwest border, with real human  lives.   And it is not just the migrants. It is American citizens like Jared  Vargas in San Antonio, Texas, which I represent and I am proud to  represent. Jared lost his life last July at the hands of somebody here  illegally. His beautiful mom, Lori, is still brokenhearted, having lost  her wonderful son. His twin brother, who goes to college in Kerrville,  in my district, lost his twin brother; and his sister lost her brother  because an illegal immigrant who was here, who was  [[Page H1438]]  caught, released, caught, released, stopped by law enforcement, let go,  2 days later murdered Jared Vargas.   How can we allow this to happen in the greatest country and the most  powerful nation the world has ever known? How can we allow American  citizens to die at the hands of illegal immigrants who are here who  shouldn't be here, who have broken our laws previously? How can we  allow American citizens to die at the hands of the terrorists who are  moving drugs into and out of our country through cartels, die because  of dangerous fentanyl and dangerous heroin that are coming across our  borders at the ports of entry and, yes, between the ports of entry,  which the data fully backs up?   It is not just coming through the ports of entry. It is, in fact,  coming across on loads across the Rio Grande River, which is not  policed.   We have a duty to defend our border.   One last point: Fencing, walls work. In the Rio Grande Valley sector,  in the eastern section next to the Gulf of Mexico, there is 35 miles of  fencing. In the western section, in McAllen, there is far less fencing  and far fewer roads. Ninety-four percent of the traffic comes through  the McAllen portion of the Rio Grande Valley sector.   We have a duty to defend our borders. American citizens like Jared  Vargas, who lost his life, and the Vargas family, who is now without  their family member, and the United States of America deserve better.  The migrants who seek to come here deserve better.                                time  1800
