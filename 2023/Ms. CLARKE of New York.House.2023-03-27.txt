 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Illinois, Jonathan Jackson, for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise on this day to acknowledge and thank  Congresswoman Cori Bush and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley for their  unyielding, unflinching, and unapologetic leadership and for leading  the charge on the ratification of the equal rights amendment.   I rise today to reaffirm that ever-present need to have this  ratification take place, as well as to recognize the tireless efforts  and work of Black women on behalf of that mission.   It was more than half a century ago that the ERA first passed  Congress due in large part to the efforts in drafting, advancing, and  organizing by trailblazing Black women.   With that said, I am reminded of the words written by one of my  congressional predecessors, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, decades ago  in the very spot where I stand right now. She said: ``Of course, laws  will not eliminate prejudice from the hearts of human beings, but that  is no reason to allow prejudice to continue to be enshrined in our  laws, to perpetuate injustice through inaction.''   Mr. Speaker, we are tired of the inaction. We are tired of the  injustice. We are tired of being tired. So, it is my privilege to join  the first-ever Congressional Equal Rights Amendment Caucus in history  and support legislative efforts to affirm the ERA as the 28th amendment  to the Constitution.   For decades, Black women have continued to pave the path toward  ratification, and I am proud to see we are carrying on that legacy  today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank every woman who has played a significant and  substantial role and continues to play their position in this battle  and in this fight for equal rights. As the Honorable Marcus Garvey  admonished each and every woman out there: Forward ever, backwards  never.
