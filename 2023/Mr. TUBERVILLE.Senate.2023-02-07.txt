 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize U.S.  Air Force veteran Master Sergeant Dawn Smith of Notasulga. Sergeant  Smith joined the Air Force immediately after graduating high school  when a recruitment poster caught her mom's eye. Once she learned about  the opportunities available to her through military service, Sergeant  Smith felt that it was the right path for her.   Sergeant Smith was stationed at several posts during her 20-year  career. She started as a missile maintainer, but retrained as an  eyecare technician. As a tribute to her dedicated work ethic, she was  selected as a noncommissioned officer academy instructor. Even though  the military isn't a traditional, 4-year educational route, she  described it as a ``continuing education'' experience.   After she retired from the military, Sergeant Smith started a cattle  operation named Lone Oak Farm with her husband Tim, who also served in  the Air Force for 23 years. She credits the ``no-fail'' mentality  learned in the military for helping her succeed as a first-time farmer.  The Smiths have grown their operation from 2 cows to 35, and now, they  sell fresh beef to families across Alabama.   Sergeant Smith is truly a ``lifelong learner'' who is always willing  to share her knowledge and experiences with others. That is why she is  proud to be a 4-H agent assistant for the Tallapoosa County School  System, where she teaches ag-related skills to more than 1,000 fourth,  fifth, and sixth graders each month. And twice a year, she works with  high schoolers, helping them learn how to work with their hands and  grow their own produce.   Now, Sergeant Smith helps develop new curriculums for students,  including a ``Respect for the Flag'' lesson that teaches the American  flag's history, meaning, and how to properly care for it. Sergeant  Smith credits the military for giving her greater awareness and  compassion for the needs of others around the world. She went to  Guatemala for the first time on a medical mission while in the service,  which inspired her and her husband to continue mission trips to  Guatemala and Alaska after their retirement.   Alabama is grateful for Sergeant Smith's service and proud to  recognize her for the February veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
