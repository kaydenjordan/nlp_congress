 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 323 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 323         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 115) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to provide additional       aggravating factors for the imposition of the death penalty       based on the status of the victim. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-17 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   As a former Federal and State prosecutor, I often hear how Americans  value and respect our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders. We talk about their heroism, their selflessness, their  willingness to protect and serve no matter the cost.   These fearless individuals truly are the fabric that holds our  communities together. However, in recent years, a violent and  disturbing trend has developed. Law enforcement officers, firefighters,  and first responders are increasingly being targeted for violence and  cruelty based solely on the uniform they wear.   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund,  there were 64 police shooting deaths in 2016. That number is 56 percent  higher than the previous year. The National Association of Police  Organizations also notes that ambush-style killings of law enforcement  officers increased by 167 percent in 2016.   Allowing this appalling trend to continue unchecked is not only  unacceptable, it is indefensible. Congress must take concrete steps to  address this deadly problem.   Current Federal law provides 16 aggravating factors that a jury must  consider when deciding whether a death sentence is warranted. These  factors include whether the defendant acted in an especially heinous,  cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant engaged in substantial  planning and premeditation; whether the victim was  [[Page H4238]]  particularly vulnerable; whether the victim was a high public official,  which includes high-ranking public persons, from the President to a  foreign head of state, to a judge or a Federal law enforcement officer.  However, State and local police officers, firefighters, prosecutors,  and first responders are excluded from these protections.   In response, my friend, Mr. Buchanan, introduced H.R. 115, the Thin  Blue Line Act. This legislation amends Federal law to include  murdering, attempting to murder, or targeting of State and local law  enforcement officers, firefighters, prosecutors, and first responders  as an aggravating factor a jury must consider when determining whether  a death sentence is justified. Furthermore, these protections extend to  all public safety officers who are murdered or targeted while engaging  in their official duties, because of the performance of their duties,  or because of their status as a public official or employee.   This bill sends a clear message: Those who target our police  officers, firefighters, or first responders with violence will be met  with an equally harsh punishment.   We offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of our fallen  officers, but we must do more to protect these brave individuals. We  can't stand idly by as the individuals who protect our homes and  communities are targeted because of the uniform they wear. We must act  to ensure those individuals who would commit an act of violence against  our public safety officers know they will face the gravest of sentences  if they go through with their heinous plot.   We must send the message that Congress stands with those fearless  individuals who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities, no  matter the cost. We can't continue allowing them to suffer the price of  our inaction. I support this effort and thank Chairman Goodlatte and  the Committee on the Judiciary for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are here because we are making sure that  local police officers, sheriff's deputies, prosecutors, first  responders, and firefighters have the same protections that those in  the Federal system have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight) to get this debate  [[Page H4240]]  back on track and to protect local law enforcement officials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), a former special agent with the Federal  Bureau of Investigation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  include in the Record four letters which I will briefly describe:   The first is from the Major County Sheriffs of America, supporting  the Thin Blue Line Act; the second is from the National Association of  Police Organizations, Inc., again, supporting the Thin Blue Line Act;  the third is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, supporting  H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act; and then finally, from the Sergeants  Benevolent Association in strong support of H.R. 115, the Thin Blue  Line Act.                                               Major County Sheriffs                                                      of America,                                                     April 25, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Buchanan: I write to you today on a matter       of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of       America (MCSA) and all of America's law enforcement       professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs       representing the Nation's largest counties with populations       of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100       million Americans.        As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the       MCSA, I am pleased to express our association's support of       your legislation, the Thin Blue Line Act. This legislation       would make the murder of law enforcement officers,       firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor       in capital punishment determinations.        In 2016, one hundred forty-four officers died in the line       of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent.       The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable       and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted       to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers       and other first responders have the right to go home to their       families at the end of their shifts.        The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and       your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We       value your support and look forward to working with you in       the future.                                            Michael J. Bouchard,                                       Sheriff, Oakland County (MI),      Vice President--Government Affairs.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                    Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Buchanan: On behalf of the National       Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to       you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line Act.        NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent       Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more       than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair       and effective crime control and law enforcement.        The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who       harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the       murder or attempted murder of a local police officer,       firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in       death penalty determinations.        This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults,       injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years.       In 2016 alone, ambush-style killings of law enforcement       officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter       penalties for those who harm or target for harm law       enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons       contemplating harming an office must know that they will face       serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased       penalties make important differences in the attitudes of       criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure       protection for the community.        We thank you for your continued support of the law       enforcement community and we look forward to working with you       to pass this important legislation. If we can provide any       assistance, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                             William J. Johnson,       Esq., CAE, Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      Hon. Vernon G. Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the       members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our       strong support for H.R. 115, the ``Thin Blue Line Act.''        The ``Thin Blue Line Act'' increases the penalty for an       individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person       who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other       public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the       performance of his or her official duties, because of the       performance of his or her official duties, or because of his       or her status as a public official or employee.        Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on       duty but within the past few years, officers have become a       target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear.       As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the       current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement       officers for this very reason.        Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in       2016, 21 of them--that's 33%--were ambush killings. These       were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals       who set out to kill a police officer:        The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the       deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5       officers killed from gunfire;        The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police       Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire;        The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott       Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in       their respective patrol cars;        Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department       (OH) was killed by ambush.        All of these officers died because of the uniforms they       were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in       harm's way. It is our job to protect others but it should not       be ``part of the job'' to be a target of someone who is       looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our       uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to       rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow       against our civil government.        On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this       legislation and amendment. If I can be of any further help,       please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director       Jim Pasco in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____           Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City             of New York,                                    New York, NY, January 17, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the       more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent       Association of the New York City Police Department to advise       you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ``Thin Blue Line       Act.''        For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law       enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets.       There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits       impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do       so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to       protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear.       These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated       rhetoric of anti-police elements have led some to declare an       open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers       and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement       officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New       York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and       Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they       sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner.       Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National       Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21       police officers killed in ambush-style attacks. Shockingly,       20 of these officers were killed in eight multiple-shooting       death incidents--such as those that claimed the lives of 8       officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX--the highest total       of any year since 1932.        It is for these reasons and many others that the       legislation you have introduced is so important. The ``Thin       Blue Line Act'' would make the murder or attempted murder of       police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first       responders at any level of government an aggravating factor       in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to       things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is       applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because       of the performance of their duty, or because of their status       as a public official. While we know that law enforcement       officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their       uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or       retired, this legislation sends the message that any action       to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence       will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a       message that is long overdue.        On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you       for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward       to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law.       Please do not hesitate to contact me, or our Washington       Representatives Andrew Siff and Chris Granberg if we can be       of any further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                        Ed Mullins,                                                         President.   [[Page H4243]]          Mr. Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It  provides for the consideration of the Thin Blue Line Act. We often talk  of how resolute our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders are in the face of immense danger. These heroic individuals  charge into burning buildings, face down violence, and stand ready to  jump into the fray at a moment's notice.   Simply putting on a uniform should not be one of those dangers. It is  our duty to ensure that law enforcement officers, firefighters, and  first responders have every tool at their disposal to do their job  safely and effectively and to ensure they return home to their  families.   Countless spouses and children kiss their loved ones good-bye as they  head to work, praying that it will not be their last day. We must never  forget this as we work to ensure our police officers, firefighters, and  first responders have every possible protection.   There is no greater deterrent than the threat of losing one's life.  It is my hope that this legislation makes individuals who would  consider taking the life of an officer stop to consider the  consequences before going through with an attack; that we one day reach  a point where our Nation's finest can go to work without worrying about  being targeted because of the uniform on their back; that one day our  officers' families have one less reason to worry.   But until that day, we must continue standing resolutely against this  evil. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our law enforcement  community, firefighters, and first responders. Protect them from the  heinous acts of violence. Give their families some assurance that we  have their backs. Vote ``yes'' on the resolution, vote ``yes'' on the  underlying bill, vote ``yes'' to give our law enforcement officers the  protections they so desperately need.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Sessions for  bringing this bill before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
