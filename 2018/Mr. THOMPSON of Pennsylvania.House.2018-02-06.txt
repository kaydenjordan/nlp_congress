 Mr. Speaker, February is Career and  Technical Education Month. As co-chair of the Career and Technical  Education Caucus and a senior member of the Committee on the Education  and the Workforce, I have long been aware of the importance of career  and technical education programs that provide learners of all ages  career-ready skills.   From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE  programs work to develop America's most valuable resources: its people.  Together, with Representative Jim Langevin, my CTE Caucus co-chair, we  will introduce a resolution officially designating February as CTE  Month.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to sign on as  cosponsors because CTE truly benefits all Americans.   CTE is taught in a range of settings, from high schools and area  technical centers to technical and 2-year community colleges. In total,  12.5 million high school and college students are enrolled in CTE  programs across the Nation.   Just last week, President Trump expressed his commitment to CTE  during his first State of the Union Address. President Trump said:  ``Let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open  great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and  realize their full potential.''   Fortunately, the House unanimously passed the Strengthening Career  and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act last June. I authored  this bill with Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi. It aims to close the  skills gap by modernizing Federal investment in CTE programs and  connecting educators with industry stakeholders.   This is the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and  Technical Education Improvement Act since 2006. We are currently  working with our colleagues in the Senate to bring up this bipartisan  bill for consideration so we can get this important reauthorize signed  into law.   The Perkins Act is important for educational institutions as well as  businesses. Small-business owners rely upon Perkins programs to  increase the number of skilled candidates in emerging sectors. Future  workers in fields such as manufacturing, information technology,  healthcare, and agriculture also rely on career and technical education  to obtain the skills necessary for high-skill, high-wage, family- sustaining careers. Essentially, Mr. Speaker, we are providing the  education tools to equip a 21st century workforce.   CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving  students choose in pursuit of industry certifications and hands-on  skills that they can use right out of high school in skills-based  education programs or in college. By modernizing the Federal investment  in CTE programs, we will be able to connect more educators with  industry stakeholders and close the skills gap that exists in this  country. There are good jobs out there, but people need to be qualified  to get them.  [[Page H789]]    Mr. Speaker, we have all met young people who haven't been inspired  in a traditional classroom setting. We all know people who have lost  jobs or are underemployed and are looking for good-paying, family- sustaining jobs.   We all know people who are aspiring for a promotion but keep falling  short year after year. We all know people who are living in poverty.  Maybe their families have been living in poverty for generations, for  so long they can't even remember what put them there in the first  place. A career in technical education is a pathway forward for each  and every one of these people. CTE gives people from all walks of life  an opportunity to succeed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  Washington, D.C., firefighter for his more than three decades of  exceptional service.   Captain Peter Dupree has served more than 31 years with the District  of Columbia Fire Department. He started his firefighting career in 1977  as a volunteer with his hometown fire company in Avis, Pennsylvania, in  Clinton County. Pete rose through the ranks and eventually became fire  chief.   In 1986, Pete moved to Maryland and joined the Berwyn Heights  Volunteer Fire Department, Station 14, in Prince George's County. That  same month, Pete was appointed as a probationer for the District of  Columbia Fire Department. After passing required courses, he was  assigned to Truck 12 in Northwest D.C.   In December of 2000, Pete achieved the rank of sergeant. Three years  later, he would be promoted to lieutenant at Engine 18 on Capitol Hill.  Then, in 2008, Pete became a captain in Northwest D.C. at Truck 9. He  retired from the station in January after more than 31 years of  service.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to thank Captain Peter Dupree, a native  son of Clinton County, and wish him well in his retirement.                            ____________________
