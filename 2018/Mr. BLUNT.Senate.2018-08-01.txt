 I thank my friend, the Senator from Vermont.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today the Senate overwhelmingly supported  the conference report for the 2019 John S. McCain National Defense  Authorization Act. That bill is now on the way to the President's desk.   Many Americans have bravely fought to uphold the values that our  country holds dear. There are many people in the Senate who have been  stalwart supporters of the military during their time here, but the  legislation we passed today is named for one of those Senators, our  colleague from Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,  John McCain.   Senator McCain not only has given much of his life in military  service, but he has given tirelessly in service to the country in so  many ways, including service here. He has been an incredibly effective  advocate for the men and women who serve in uniform and defend us.   There is no Member of the Senate for whom my admiration and  appreciation has increased more during the time I have had the  opportunity to serve with him. As a House Member, I knew Senator  McCain, but I knew him only in the kind of passing that occurs when the  House and Senate are trying to work out an issue or deal with a  specific problem. I didn't really get to know John McCain until I came  to the Senate. That daily contact with him made a real difference in  the way I felt about him.   His courage, his sometimes seemingly short fuse, but always his  desire to do the right thing as he saw the right thing have continued  to make him an important advocate here. Even  [[Page S5550]]  in recent days, when he couldn't attend the Senate, he was the first to  let his views be known.   Certainly, Senator McCain and I didn't agree on everything. We still  don't agree on everything. We don't make any particular pretense that  we agree on everything. There has been more than one occasion when  he expressed to me his absolute dismay that I voted the way I voted on  a certain issue, but that is when I began to think that maybe we really  had a relationship I could treasure--and I do treasure it.    I am pleased that we named this bill after our friend Senator McCain.  One of the principal responsibilities we have is to defend the country.  It is the one job the Federal Government does that almost no American  will argue that somebody else could do better, either personally or at  a different level of government. It is the No. 1 priority, I think, of  the Federal Government. This bill addresses that priority.   In our State, we have Whiteman Air Force Base, Fort Leonard Wood,  Rosecrans Air National Guard Base, where people from all over the world  come to train on how to use the C-130s. We have the AVCRAD facility, a  National Guard facility in Springfield, MI, that repairs helicopters  for the armed services and saves a lot of money doing that. We are the  home of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's western  headquarters, and we are proud to be.   Missourians serve in uniform and are proud to serve. Missourians  serve in many ways, including all of those organizations I just  mentioned, and they are proud to do that.   The people who serve in the military and the people who serve in the  intelligence branch of our government are increasingly challenged. I  think the missions we have around the world, the challenges we have  around the world, the national security threats we have around the  world--as the Presiding Officer knows from his job as Foreign Affairs  chairman--are as complex and complicated and multifaceted as they have  ever been. Some have said that there are more threats from more  directions in more ways than at any other time.   I think this bill begins to recognize that--tries to recognize that-- and understands that to remain successful, America has to have a  military that creates a military advantage. It has to be able to  counter the potential that our adversaries have. We have to be able to  defend international order and protect ourselves and those who rely on  us in their defense of freedom.   To that end, Secretary Mattis and the senior leaders throughout the  Department of Justice put together the plan and the thought that really  is the backbone for how this legislation has been crafted. This  National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the necessary investments  and establishes the policies to carry out our national defense  strategy.   First and foremost, President Trump and his administration have  prioritized rebuilding the military. This bill, with a total of $716  billion in authorization, provides the resources, the equipment, and  the training necessary to do so.   For 2 years in a row, we authorized a substantial increase in defense  spending. We will have a chance, when we get back in a week or so, to  bring the defense appropriating bill to the floor, which hopefully will  be the second year in a row that our defense spending has matched the  plan that has been authorized.   The National Defense Authorization Act provides our servicemembers  with a pay raise of 2.6 percent, the biggest pay raise in 10 years. Our  troops and their families make a tremendous sacrifice to serve. They  move often on a minute's notice, but in the last year's legislation, we  gave more flexibility to families on that topic. Still, when you are in  the military, you know you are not likely to be wherever you are for  very long. That increase in pay is something we should be pleased about  as a country.   This bill authorizes critical multiyear procurement authority. Why  does that matter? That doesn't sound very exciting--multiyear  procurement authority--but it allows people in the military to plan not  only what they are getting this year but how that gives them the  ability to build on that next year.   We have been using the Super Hornets, for instance, which are made in  St. Louis, MO, at a high volume with desert warfare. The desert is  harder on our equipment than other places might be. There is a serious  shortfall of fighter aircraft in the Navy. All of those things are  taken into consideration as this bill moves forward. It is a bill that  recognizes the importance of readiness issues.   We had more people die in training accidents last year--by a  substantial number--than were killed in combat. That means we hadn't  been providing the kind of training or the kind of equipment needed  because we had budgets that didn't allow for that. These budgets that  we voted on in the last few months, hopefully, will get us back to  where we are going to close that readiness gap. We are going to be able  to say to those who serve and to their families that we are providing  the best equipment, the best training, and an adequate amount of time  to fly a helicopter or fly an airplane to try to see what you would do  in adverse conditions, which, frankly, we just have not been able to  do.   This takes into account actions to really address specific threats  from countries that have actively worked to undermine our economic  interests and our national security interests.   According to the national defense strategy, China is using what it  refers to as an ``all-of-nation long-term strategy''--all of the  resources of the nation of China, according to that blueprint, in a  long-term strategy of leveraging military modernization, influencing  operations, and predatory economic efforts in order to coerce  neighboring countries to reorder the structure of the Indo-Pacific  region to its advantage. It is not to our advantage or to the world's  advantage for China to restructure that part of the world to its  advantage. It also classifies China as a strategic competitor that  seeks to shape the world toward its authoritarian model through  destabilizing activities that threaten the security of the United  States and its allies.   To counter China and reassure our allies and partners, this bill  takes action to prohibit telecom companies with links to the Chinese  Communist Party's intelligence apparatus from doing business with the  U.S. Government. Many of us on the Intelligence Committee think we  could have gone a step further than that, but at least we are now  prohibiting those organizations from being government contractors. We  need to continue to be vigilant so as to be sure that their presence in  our other systems doesn't also jeopardize us.   This bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, contains  modernization language for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the  United States in its effort to look at what national security issue may  be at risk when a foreign company is able to buy a company or the  technology of an American company.   The national defense strategy, in addition to China, also says that  Russia seeks to ``shatter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and  change European and Middle East security and economic structures to its  favor,'' which is also not to our advantage or to the advantage of  those in the world who would be affected by it.   Russia has violated key arms control treaties. It has expanded and  modernized its nuclear arsenal--sometimes outside agreements that have  been made. It has tested counterspace weapons. It has used emerging  technologies to undermine our election process. It has infiltrated the  way that we communicate with each other on social media. It has  confronted the elections of our NATO allies and others.   I think this bill shows not only a firm commitment to NATO but a firm  commitment to article 5, which means that any NATO country, when  attacked, will have the other NATO countries come to its help and aid.   Additionally, this bill authorizes important resources and policies  to counter North Korea, Iran, ISIS, al-Qaida, Syria, and others that we  should be concerned about as they oppress the people of their countries  and try to expand their oppressive governments to other places.   This bill recognizes the critical importance of our allies and our  partners around the globe so that we can be willing to stand together  and to advance shared values and goals.  [[Page S5551]]    The men and women who serve us in uniform, the men and women who  serve us in the intelligence agencies, and the civilian employees who  come every day to be part of a defense and intelligence structure work  hard for America. This bill shows that we appreciate that work. In the  Senate today, the overwhelming vote on this bill verifies that, and the  President's signature soon to follow will set a blueprint that will  allow us to do the No. 1 job of the Federal Government--to defend the  United States of America.   I yield the floor.
