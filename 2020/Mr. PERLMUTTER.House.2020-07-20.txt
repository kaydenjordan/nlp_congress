 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, with you, to honor the  heroes from the Aurora theater shooting in Colorado on July 20, 2012,  and the everyday heroes who make sacrifices for their community,  including those we have seen emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.   Eight years ago today, 12 lives were taken, 70 were wounded, and  hundreds more suffered emotional trauma. Yet, even in this tragedy, we  saw incredible heroism that night--those who carried people to safety  and cared for the gravely wounded.   We saw those who sacrificed themselves by shielding others, such as:  Jonathan Blunk, John Larimer, Matt McQuinn, and Alex Teves. It is these  four men who inspired you, Mr. Speaker, and me to introduce H. Res.  1051, to designate July 20 as National Heroes Day.   Today, we mourn   John Lewis, another real national hero. During  these trying times, everyday heroes have been particularly visible  during the coronavirus pandemic where we have seen tremendous acts of  selflessness and bravery.   Join me in saying thank you to the hero in your life, and let us  exhibit their courage and service today and throughout the year.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1053 and ask for its immediate  consideration.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met on Friday and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1053, providing for consideration of  H.R. 6395, known as the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, under a structured rule which  makes in order 407 amendments. The rule provides for en bloc authority  with en blocs debated for 30 minutes each.   The rule also provides for consideration of this Senate amendment to  H.R. 1957, the Great American Outdoors Act.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 7027, the Child  Care is Essential Act, and H.R. 7327, the Child Care for Economic  Recovery Act, under closed rules.   Finally, the rule provides for suspension authority through September  20, 2020, and recess authority as well as same-day authority through  September 21, 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by commending Chairman Smith and Ranking  Member Thornberry for their leadership and calming influence that they  bring to the appropriately named Mac Thornberry National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This will be the 60th  consecutive year that Congress enacts this important legislation, and I  think it is a direct testament to the hard work and collegiality of  these two gentlemen.   The NDAA fulfills our constitutional obligation of protecting our  Nation by providing our military the tools they need to provide for our  national defense, confront terrorism, and defend our democratic values  overseas.   The legislation also provides essential care for the backbone of  America's fighting force, our servicemembers and their families. The  bill includes a 3 percent pay raise for our servicemembers and makes  key investments in military infrastructure.   The bill allows our military to maintain readiness, expand  capabilities, and invest in the software and technologies required to  secure our country.   Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us, including  our military. This NDAA would authorize funding to strengthen the DOD  and the country's ability to respond to this and future pandemics by  creating $1 billion pandemic preparedness and resilience national  security fund.   H.R. 6395 does all of this while abiding by the budget agreement from  last  [[Page H3101]]  year and incorporates hundreds and hundreds of bipartisan ideas.   The Armed Services Committee adopted 475 amendments during their  markup, and this rule makes in order another 407 amendments for the  House to consider and work its will. This legislation exemplifies  exactly how this institution is supposed to work.   Another bill included in this rule is H.R. 1957, the Great American  Outdoors Act. Since its creation in 1964, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund has protected millions of acres of land across the  U.S. It has funded national parks like the Rocky Mountain National Park  in Colorado as well as tens of thousands of State and local park  projects in all 50 States. LWCF ensures all of us can enjoy fishing,  hiking, and other outdoor activities and preserve our public lands for  future generations.   I have long supported the LWCF, and I was proud to see the LWCF  permanently reauthorized last year. Now, with H.R. 1957, the House can  pass the Great American Outdoors Act and make the funding for the LWCF  permanent.   As the Trump administration continues to slash protections for our  public lands and natural resources, it is now more important than ever  to permanently fund the LWCF. I am glad the Senate has finally acted  and passed this important bill so we can send this to the President's  desk for his signature.                                time  1030    The last two bills addressed in this rule focus on important gaps in  our economic recovery from COVID-19.   The Child Care is Essential Act, H.R. 7027, creates a $50 billion  stabilization fund to help childcare providers which have been  particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, with over 40 percent of  providers in danger of closing. Access to childcare is absolutely  necessary for our economic recovery. This bill will stabilize childcare  providers so we can ensure parents can get back to work as the States  reopen.   But we must also ensure this childcare is affordable for working  parents hit hard by the economic downturn. That is why our next bill,  the Child Care for Economic Recovery Act, H.R. 7327, expands and makes  refundable the childcare tax credit and includes additional resources  to improve childcare facilities. By filling the gaps to make childcare  more accessible to working families, this bill helps parents who would  otherwise reduce their hours or delay reentering the workforce due to  childcare.   I urge all my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to say first to my friend, Mr. Woodall, I would never neglect  to provide you with the 30 minutes because I honestly enjoy watching  your gestures and listening to your arguments. Often we disagree, but  the way you present things is really something that I enjoy listening  to and watching.   And I couldn't agree with you more about what you said about John  Lewis. Now, John was not very big--about my size--but his personality,  his commitment, and his intellect would fill this Chamber whenever he  spoke, whenever he came in. So our loss is big with his passing, and I  just want to thank the gentleman for the remarks he made about Mr.  Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman, from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), the chair of the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much time remains on both  sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to take a moment to speak about two amendments this rule makes  in order that I have offered which are focused on the health and  environmental safety for those willing to put their lives on the line  for our country--first, for former nuclear weapons workers, and,  second, for our firefighters.   My first amendment affirms Congress' commitment to the success of the  Department of Labor's Office of the Ombudsman for former nuclear  weapons workers.    Over 600,000 Americans worked on our Nation's nuclear weapons in the  20th century, including at the former Rocky Flats Plant in my district,  which produced the plutonium triggers for many of our nuclear weapons.  Many of these workers were exposed to toxic substances and chemicals  and, as a result, developed terrible and often terminal illnesses.   Congress created the Energy Employees Occupational Illness  Compensation Program, or EEOICPA for short, which is not very short, to  provide compensation and healthcare to these workers under the fiscal  year 2001 NDAA. Unfortunately, the illness compensation program has  been troubled for years, preventing workers from successfully  submitting their claims and assessing their hard-earned benefits.   The Office of the Ombudsman serves as an important resource for  claimants, helping them navigate the complicated claims process.  Unfortunately, this office sunsets this October.   As we work to find a path forward on long-term funding, my amendment,  which is cosponsored by Representative   Joe Wilson and you, Mr.  Speaker, reinforces the importance of the ombudsman to these nuclear  weapons workers and to the EEOICPA program.   My second amendment requires the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, NIST, to work in cooperation with the National Institute  for Occupational Safety and Health to study the effects of PFAS--we  heard Mr. Shimkus discussing that earlier--on the health and well-being  of our firefighters.   PFAS chemicals are found in the protective gear firefighters wear,  making it more water- and oil-resistant, so beneficial kinds of  effects. But we know PFAS exposure can lead to an increased risk of  cancer, which is already the leading cause of death among firefighters.   My amendment, which is cosponsored by Representatives Bill Posey,   Dan Kildee, Brian Fitzpatrick, Madeleine Dean, and Harley Rouda, would  evaluate the use of PFAS chemicals in firefighting equipment and make  recommendations on improvements to this gear to avoid unnecessary  exposure to PFAS chemicals.   We owe it to our brave firefighters who put their lives on the line  every day to minimize their exposure to these dangerous chemicals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support these amendments,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume just briefly. I am prepared to close, I would say to my friend  from Georgia.   The rule that we presented today does span a number of bills. The  reason we are putting them all together is because time is of the  essence, and there is no reason to delay any further in presenting  these particular bills to the vote of the Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to begin with responding to my  friend's, Mr. Woodall's, concerns about the numbers of amendments, what  the percentages are and all that stuff.   We have authorized and made in order 407 amendments to be debated on  the floor of this House. That is after some 475 amendments were debated  in the Committee on Armed Services. Of the ones that we have today,  let's see, 53 percent are bipartisan or Republican, and 46 percent are  Democratic amendments. So, among all of these amendments, there is  plenty of opportunity for all of us to have some say as to how the NDAA  is going to be shaped for this coming year.   The second thing that the gentleman mentioned was the Great American  Outdoors Act. That is a bipartisan bill. The ranking member, Mr. Cole,  stated his support for this thing which can and will preserve millions  and millions of acres of public land and national parks through  funding. We know the Senate has passed it. We consider it a major  matter where time is of the essence for the benefit of beautiful places  all across America, and we want to get that done.    The two other bills are the childcare bills. In this pandemic that we  face, childcare has been turned upside down like so many other things  that have been dealt a blow by the virus. Time is of the essence in  trying to correct that so America can get back to work, but without  assistance in the childcare arena, that is just not going to happen. So  we want to get these things moving.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia and my  other colleagues for joining me here today to speak on the rule, the  National Defense Authorization Act, the Great American Outdoors Act,  the Child Care Is Essential Act, and the Child Care for Economic  Recovery Act.   Passage of this rule today will allow the House to continue our  important work for the people. We will uphold our oath of office to  protect the United States through consideration of the Mac Thornberry  National Defense Authorization Act. We will complete the step we took  last year to support full funding of the Land and Water Conservation  Fund by passing the Great American Outdoors Act, and we will take  meaningful steps to help hardworking Americans who have been hit hard  by the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring that they have access to  affordable childcare so they can get back to work as soon as possible  through passage of these two acts.  [[Page H3107]]    Over the next few days and weeks, we will take action on these  important bills; we will begin our work to fund the government through  the passage of the House fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills; and we  will renew our calls for the Senate to act and pass the next pandemic  relief package, the HEROES Act, to help Americans across the country as  we respond to this miserable virus and its effects on our Nation. So I  hope all my colleagues can join us in getting started with that work by  passing the rule here today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1053         Strike section 7 and insert the following:        Sec. 7. Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1957)       to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modernize and       improve the Internal Revenue Service, and for other purposes,       with the Senate amendments thereto, and to consider in the       House, without intervention of any point of order, a single       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on Natural       Resources or his designee that the House concur in the Senate       amendment to the title and concur in the Senate amendment to       the text with the amendment printed in section 9 of this       resolution. The Senate amendments and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion or demand       for division of the question.        At the end, add the following new section:        Sec. 9. The amendment referred to in section 7 of this       resolution is as follows:        In the matter proposed to be inserted by the Senate, add at       the end the following:       SEC. 4. CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION TO EXPEDITE SALVAGE OPERATIONS                     IN RESPONSE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS.         (a) Categorical Exclusion Established.--Salvage operations       carried out by the Secretary of Agriculture on national       forest land or the Secretary of the Interior on public lands       are a category of actions hereby designated as being       categorically excluded from the preparation of an       environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement       under section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of       1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).        (b) Availability of Categorical Exclusion.--On and after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior may use the       categorical exclusion established under subsection (a) in       accordance with this section.        (c) Acreage Limitation.--A salvage operation covered by the       categorical exclusion established under subsection (a) may       not contain treatment units exceeding a total of 10,000       acres.        (d) Additional Requirements.--        (1) Stream buffers.--A salvage operation covered by the       categorical exclusion established under subsection (a) shall       comply with the standards and guidelines for stream buffers       contained in the applicable forest plan unless waived by the       Regional Forester, in the case of National Forest System       lands, or the State Director of the Bureau of Land       Management, in the case of public lands.        (2) Reforestation plan.--A reforestation plan shall be       developed under section 3 of the Act of June 9, 1930       (commonly known as the Knutson-Vandenberg Act; 16 U.S.C.       576b), as part of a salvage operation covered by the       categorical exclusion established under subsection (a).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
