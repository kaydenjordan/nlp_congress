 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Shaheen and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.    Senator Shaheen, the Portman-Sinema substitute provides  in title 1 of the division on broadband that ``[n]othing in this title  may be  [[Page S5922]]  construed to authorize the Assistant Secretary or the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration to regulate the rates  charged for broadband service.''   It is my understanding that an agreement was made among the  bipartisan group that no rate regulation of broadband services would be  authorized or permitted by NTIA or the Assistant Secretary who leads  the NTIA, as part of the State broadband grants program.   Is it the Senator's understanding that the language I just quoted  accomplishes that goal?    I thank the Senator.   I yield the floor.
