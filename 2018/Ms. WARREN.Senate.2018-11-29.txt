 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 10 minutes.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    Madam President, 10 years ago, greedy financial  institutes crashed our economy and crushed working families all across  this country. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, millions lost  their homes, and millions lost their life savings. That crisis was no  accident, and it was no act of God. It was caused because Washington  looked the other way while greedy Wall Street bankers scammed hard- working American families. It can happen again if we let it.   If we learned anything from the financial crisis that nearly drove  our economy over a cliff, it is that American families desperately need  a strong consumer watchdog. Before the crisis, financial institutions  sold consumers predatory loans that were like grenades with their pins  pulled out. When they exploded, they wiped out trillions of dollars of  wealth and caused millions of people to lose their jobs, their savings,  or their homes.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to level the  playing field for consumers and make sure that Washington never again  looks the other way while millions of families get squeezed.   On June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intent to  nominate Kathleen Kraninger as Director of the CFPB. Ms. Kraninger is a  political appointee at OMB who has spent more than a decade working on  homeland security policy in the executive branch and on Capitol Hill.  She has never--I repeat, never--worked on consumer protection issues  either in public service or in the private sector. She has zero track  record of standing up for consumers.   The White House championed Ms. Kraninger's experience as a manager  when announcing her nomination. A White House official stated that Ms.  Kraninger ``will bring . . . much-needed management experience [to the  CFPB].'' A quick search on Google shows that is bogus.   Ms. Kraninger's tenure at OMB has been marred by systemic management  failures. As an OMB official with primary responsibility over the  Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, Ms. Kraninger was one of  the officials responsible for managing and implementing President  Trump's zero-tolerance policy. The policy resulted in a humanitarian  catastrophe in which thousands of children were ripped from the arms of  their mamas and daddies and thrown into cages.   Ms. Kraninger bungled the response to the three catastrophic  hurricanes of 2017. Under Ms. Kraninger's leadership, OMB's budget  requests in the wake of Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Harvey were too  little, too late.   Ms. Kraninger oversaw a budget that, if enacted, would have  exacerbated, rather than alleviated, the Nation's affordable housing  crisis.   No, it isn't Ms. Kraninger's management experience that got her a  giant promotion; it is her enthusiasm for Mick Mulvaney's anti-consumer  agenda that earned her this reward from President Trump. How do I know  that? I asked Ms. Kraninger if she disagreed with one single action  that Mr. Mulvaney took during the year he controlled the CFPB. She  said: ``I cannot identify any actions that Acting Director Mulvaney has  taken with which I disagree.'' Not a single one. That means she agrees  with Mick Mulvaney's decision to drop a lawsuit against payday lenders  who were charging vulnerable buyers 900 percent interest. She agrees  with Mick  [[Page S7210]]  Mulvaney's decision to gut CFPB's office that fights lending  discrimination, which was designed to make sure communities of color  aren't targeted with the most abusive loans, as they were before the  financial crisis. She agrees with Mick Mulvaney's decision to stop  checks that ensure that banks don't charge our military sky-high  interest rates. She agrees with Mick Mulvaney's decision to censor  reports to Congress and give student loan companies a free pass when  they rip off students. She agrees with Mick Mulvaney's decision to load  up the CFPB with more than a dozen political appointees to muzzle the  CFPB's professional staff and keep them from doing their job. It is  hard to imagine a stronger indication that Ms. Kraninger intends to  continue Mr. Mulvaney's harmful trajectory of weakening CFPB to benefit  big financial institutions at the expense of consumers.   Ms. Kraninger has absolutely no experience in consumer finance  whatsoever, but she has been nominated to head up the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau because she is passionately committed to  keeping it from leveling the playing field for working families. No  thanks.   We have a lot of hard decisions to make in this body, but this one is  a no-brainer. Hard-working American families deserve a fighter as the  Director of the CFPB. When the CFPB fights for consumers, students can  manage their loans. When the CFPB fights for consumers, servicemembers  can serve their country without worrying that their families will be  crushed by debt. When the CFPB fights for consumers, seniors can retire  with dignity. When the CFPB fights for consumers, 29 million families  get checks for over $12 billion from financial institutions that  cheated them--and that happened in just 6 years.   Working families need a CFPB Director who is a fighter with a proven  track record of making the consumer marketplace safe and aggressively  pursuing companies that cheat their customers. Kathleen Kraninger is  not that person. Let's do our job. Let's reject this nominee.                            ____________________
