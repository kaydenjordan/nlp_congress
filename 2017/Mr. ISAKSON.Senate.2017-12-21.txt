 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleague Senator  Tester from Montana on the floor for a discussion of our Veterans'  Affairs, our accomplishments over the last 3 years and our challenges  for the future.   I want to start out my part of the conversation by saying this. Three  years ago, the Veterans' Administration was making big headlines. Those  headlines were that they weren't working well, our veterans were  waiting too long for care, there were failures in our system  throughout, and people were looking for an alternative to the VA system  because it was in such a quagmire. Thanks to the work of our committee,  which the Presiding Officer today is one of those members, we set out  to fix a lot of the problems. No. 1 was the hospital in Denver, which  is 40 percent finished. It was 3 years behind, and we closed in. That  hospital is open today and operating because the Veterans' Affairs  Committee of the Senate buckled its shoes, got to work, got the VA  fixed, and got the hospital finished.   The most challenging thing we faced were long wait times for  appointments for our veterans and veterans' services for healthcare. It  was longer than 30 days just for a routine appointment, sometimes being  as long as 6 months to wait, and sometimes they were dying before they  got called up from the waiting list, which happened in the Arizona case  in Phoenix.   We had some tragic stories that came through. Our committee came  together and said: We are going to fix this. We are going to put our  shoulders to the grindstone, we are going to work out hard, and we are  going to make it happen. Like always, fixing anything requires one  element, and that is hard work.   This Committee has worked hard--Democrats and Republicans alike. They  have been willing to get the new Secretary, Secretary Shulkin,  confirmed. To all of his aides--Tom Bowman, who has been a great aide  to our committee for a long time, and now is a direct aide to the  Secretary. The committee has asked: What is it we need to do to get it  fixed?   We started out this year with 11 bills introduced for the Veterans'  Administration improvements in terms of healthcare. Ten of those eleven  have passed. There is one left. We are going to have a perfect 11-for- 11 year, if we get the votes before the end of this year, we get the  CARE bill passed for our veterans, but even if that doesn't make it, we  have dealt with long waiting lines for determination of benefits for  the VA. Those long waiting lines are beginning to dissipate.   We don't have hospitals being shut down because they can't be  finished. We have CBOCs being opened because they are being finished.  We don't have near as many cases of horror stories in a VA health  facility because the facilities are being run better.   Do we have problems? Sure, we have problems. Anytime you have the  second largest agency of the Federal Government--which the VA health  system is--you are going to have problems, but we are meeting them  head-on. We are not running away from them. We have a Secretary who is  really willing to work to make it happen.   I cannot say enough about Secretary Shulkin. He has been fantastic.  He has been a great worker. He has given President Trump the message,  in terms of what our veterans need, the challenge that we need from the  White House to join us, and the White House has substantially done so,  to help make a lot of improvements.   Working with our ranking member, we decided we would do a number of  things: We would end the long wait times for determination of  disability, and we have done that. That is in process. We wanted to see  to it that the modern access to healthcare was available to all of our  veterans, one way or another. We wanted to make sure we came up with  creative ideas by using telemedicine and other techniques to deliver  healthcare to our veterans.   Most importantly, we knew the Choice Act we passed 3 years ago, led  by Senator McCain--who is in our prayers and thoughts every day. I  might add from the floor of the Senate today, we wish him the very best  if he is listening. Senator McCain went to work and came up with the  first aspect of Choice, which passed 3 years ago. I was on the  conference committee. We had this crazy idea that we were going to let  veterans choose where they want to go for their healthcare. We set up  the system to do that. The system worked pretty well in some cases.  Senator Tester will say in rural America it didn't work all that well,  in some cases, but it was a good effort of ours to take the private  sector in America and make it a force multiplier for the healthcare  services delivered to our veterans and expand the access of healthcare  to our vets.   Well, now we have before the Senate what we call the Care Act. It is  the finishing touches of what was originally in the Choice Act. We are  taking the things we learned and repealing what was wrong. We are  taking things we learned are right, and we are enhancing them. I hope  every Member of the Senate who can hear my voice today will join me  sometime in the next few weeks ahead to finish the job and pass the  Care Act. Our committee passed it out 14 to 1, with Democrats and  Republicans alike, shoulder to shoulder, voting for it. It is the right  thing to do for our vets. We are hopefully going to do the same thing  on the floor.    The Care Act does a lot of amazing things, but it takes what we have  learned in 3 years and applies it to the real world for our veterans.  It says a veteran has a choice for his healthcare, public or private,  VA or private sector. The veteran and his or her doctor may determine  where they want to go. The physician providing the services who is  outside the system will cooperate with the VA, so we have good medical  records for that veteran, and they will work together to choose doctors  who have the quality, the reputation, and the ability to deliver the  service, whether they are in the VA or outside the VA.   The veteran comes first in Veterans Choice. In the Caring for Our  Veterans Act, the veteran comes first, not Members of the Senate, not  employees of the VA. The veteran comes first, which is what we need to  do.   I hope everyone will join Senator Tester and me in seeing to it, when  we get this to the floor--and we are trying every day--that they join  us in helping pass the Care Act.   One last thing I want to mention about the Care Act is it also  contains the funding necessary to complete the year for the Veterans'  Administration in terms of health services. More importantly, it  consolidates the stovepipes of funding in the VA so we no longer have  this Mickey Mouse game, which we have all experienced for the last 5 or  6 years, where the VA is always running out of money.   The Congress has never cut off the VA. When we had the biggest  shutdown 5 or 6 years ago--or potential shutdown for the government  that we had, we passed bills that exempted the VA to demonstrate long  and hard that we would never leave our veterans in need of healthcare  coverage waiting because we couldn't act in the Congress, and that  would happen today if that was threatening us.   I want to underline, this is not a matter of anybody threatening  anybody. This is a matter of finishing the job for our veterans and  seeing to it that the Veterans' Administration has the resources  necessary to deliver the services to our veterans.   For those who can hear this plea--and it is a plea--understand I am  coming before us today to say three things: One is thank you. Thank you  to every Member of the Senate who voted with us to get us where we are  today. We have passed 10 of the 11 bills we brought in this year for  veterans' healthcare services. Thank you very much.  [[Page S8195]]    I say to Senator Tester, as the ranking member, thank you for your  cooperation. We have worked together to find a solution to every  impasse we confronted throughout the year.   To the Senator from Alaska, who is presiding today and is a member of  the committee, thank you for what you did for those veterans in need in  our States that have limited access to healthcare, like Alaska. We need  to make sure the Alaskan veteran has the same access and the same  benefits they signed up for as one does in Georgia or in any other  State.   Senator Tester from Montana has worked so hard to see to it that  rural America has the same type of access. There may not be as many  doctors, there may not be as many VA facilities, but we can design a  system that gives them the very best access and the very best care for  that region where they choose to live.   That is our challenge. Our challenge in the VA is not to say: Well,  you should have lived somewhere else. Our challenge is to say we should  have concentrated more in the VA to see to it that where you live is  the right place to be in terms of veterans' services, and we are going  to do that.   Lastly, I thank Secretary Shulkin. He was approved 100 to nothing by  the Senate. I believe I am right that he is the only Cabinet member who  was confirmed by the Senate 100 to nothing. As everybody knows from  watching us the last 8 or 9 months, we haven't agreed on much of  anything. We haven't had any unanimous consent votes on hardly  anything. We did with David Shulkin, and he has delivered, in response  to that 100-to-nothing vote, time and time again, working for our  veterans, helping to direct problems, helping to work with us together.   I look forward to next year, as we bring a close to the Care Act and  pass it, moving forward with those new things we need to pay attention  to.   I look forward to working with Senator Tester from Montana and the  members of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in our  committee.   Remember, we are veterans first. We are Americans first. God bless  our veterans. May God bless the United States of America.   I yield to Senator Tester.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.
