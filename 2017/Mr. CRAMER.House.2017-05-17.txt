 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis and my colleague, Mr.  Peterson, from across the Red River in Minnesota for their support for  this renaming of the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center. For  all of the reasons that Representative Peterson talked about, it is a  world-class facility in a world-class town, and I think it should be  named after a world-class guy, and I think Ed Schafer is that.   I had the opportunity to serve under Ed when he was Governor for 8  years. I served in his cabinet. His intellect and his common sense are  matched only by his boundless energy and his eternal optimism,  qualities he brings to every job he does, including his work at the  Department of Agriculture.   When he was recognized by his former Governor colleague, President  George W. Bush, and asked to join the administration in that  department, it was a remarkable thing not just for agriculture, not  just for Ed, but for our State. North Dakota is number one in the  production of many crops. Agriculture is the number one industry in our  State. It is what makes North Dakota what North Dakota is: the ability  to feed hungry people in a growing world. Ed brought that common sense  to USDA and that work ethic that works the land so effectively.   I feel like this is a fitting tribute to him. It is a celebration not  only of his accomplishments, but a celebration of agriculture in North  Dakota and the entire Red River Valley, including Congressman  Peterson's district, and really for our world.   I would note that our two Senators, while it is easy for me to get  unanimity in the House for the North Dakota House caucus since I am the  only one, North Dakota's two Senators have a companion bill in the  Senate introduced by Senator Hoeven and cosponsored by Senator  Heitkamp, and they support this effort as well.   I appreciate the work of the committee and the work of Ed Schafer,  and I look forward, hopefully, to a celebration of the renaming.
