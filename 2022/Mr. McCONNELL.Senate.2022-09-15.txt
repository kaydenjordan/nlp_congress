 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    This week's inflation report confirmed what working  people across this country know all too well: The costs of feeding a  family and keeping the lights on have skyrocketed more quickly this  past year than at any time since the wake of the Carter administration.   A year and a half of crippling runaway inflation is the most  important story to the American people every single day. The media have  grown somewhat numb to month after month of 8 and 9 percent inflation,  but working Americans have not had the luxury of growing numb. The pain  gets worse every single time they have to fill a shopping cart or pay  their credit card bill.   One mother of young sons in my hometown of Louisville put it this  way:         My grocery bill has [gone] up a lot. It's terrible right       now. I have to be really strategic on how I plan out the       whole month to make sure we have enough money.    Of course, Kentuckians aren't the only ones in this predicament. In  Nevada, an office worker recently told reporters:         I've not been buying a lot of things because I can't afford       it. I'm like, ``The kids don't need juice for school anymore.       We'll just do water.''    In Arizona, so many families are having to make tough choices at the  grocery store, many are accepting charity to keep food on the table.   According to an employee of one food bank in Phoenix:         The impact we are seeing day in and day out continues to go       up. The families are stressed.    And who can blame them? Food inflation in America is at more than a  four-decade high. Bread is 16.2 percent more expensive than it was a  year ago. Milk is up 17 percent. Flour is up 23.3 percent, and eggs are  going for nearly 40 percent more.   Week after week, feeding a family has become a stressful proposition  for millions of Americans, and every extra dollar spent on groceries is  one fewer to spare for soaring electricity bills.   In the suburbs of Las Vegas, residents have commiserated over the  astronomical cost of keeping their homes cool in the summer. One  neighborhood message board reads like this:         My bill for this month will be $574 . . . it's insane.        Yes, ours was $800 for June.    In Arizona, a restaurant worker didn't mince words about scraping  together enough to keep the lights and air-conditioning on:         If I didn't have roommates, I wouldn't be able to make it       on the salary that I have.    Overall, inflation in Phoenix and Atlanta is way, way higher than  even the sky-high national average. The country as a whole is still  grappling with inflation over 8 percent, but Phoenix has seen a  staggering 13 percent inflation in just the last year, and Atlanta has  seen nearly 12 percent.   Of course, for working Americans in some other States, the most acute  emergency is not the cost of summer cooling but, rather, the cost of  winter heating.   In places like New Hampshire and Vermont where many homes burn  heating oil, this important price is up more than 91 percent since  President Biden took office.   And in every corner of the country, one of the biggest collective  headaches facing working families with young kids is the rising cost of  back-to-school shopping lists.   According to one working mother in Pennsylvania, she had to take  items like a backpack for her preschooler out of her shopping cart in  the checkout line:         It's been at least 20 years since I have had to pull back       to this extent. This is a new and humbling experience for me       as an adult.    American families are facing math problems that just don't add up.   Meanwhile, the same Washington Democrats who got them into this mess  spent Tuesday celebrating having rammed through, on a party-line vote,  a bill that does nothing to help them solve it: hundreds of billions of  dollars in new spending, just as working families are having the  hardest time in decades making ends meet at home; hundreds of billions  of taxpayer dollars that wouldn't even accomplish Democrats' own  underlying radical climate goals, let alone the false claims of  ``inflation reduction'' on the cover.   So our economy continues to hand working families a raw deal. But the  same day this latest awful inflation report was published, Washington  Democrats went to a concert at the White House and celebrated-- celebrated--their economic policies.   How much more out of touch can you get?   The Democrats' giant inflationary spiral is costing the average  American household 460 extra dollars every single month just to buy the  same things they bought last year. President Biden and his government  have imposed a silent Democratic inflation tax of $460 every single  month.   In Kentucky, the average household has to pay $608 more a month--well  over $7,000 more a year--just to stay where they were when President  Biden was sworn in.   Americans' real wages--their purchasing power--has plummeted since  this all-Democratic government was sworn in.   And the Democrats response? Print and spend hundreds of billions  more, make Americans without bachelor's degrees pay off the graduate  school debt of doctors and lawyers, and throw themselves a party on the  White House lawn.   Our colleagues across the aisle created this human catastrophe. This  runaway inflation was a policy choice by Democrats, and they aren't  even trying to stop it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
