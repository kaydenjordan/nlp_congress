 Mr. Speaker, this July, our Nation will come together  to celebrate American Grown Flower Month and the contributions of the  cut flower industry to our country.   The cut-flower industry generates thousands of jobs across our State  and produces $1.13 billion in economic activity each year through  flower farmers, distributors, and florists.  [[Page H5511]]    Whether it is celebrating Mother's Day, an anniversary, or a  graduation, flowers have been used to mark special occasions for  thousands of years.   California, alone, produces a staggering three-quarters of all cut  flowers grown in the United States. During my visits to flower growers  and artistic florists on the central coast of California, I have seen  firsthand the value of the flower industry as an economic engine in our  region.   By designating July as American Grown Flower Month, we celebrate the  incomparable beauty of flowers and what they bring to our homes and our  celebrations year-round.                            ____________________
