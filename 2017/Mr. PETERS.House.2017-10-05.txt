 Mr. Speaker, our tax system is broken and in desperate  need of reform. We need a simpler Tax Code that is fiscally  responsible, makes American businesses more competitive, and allows  working families to prosper in a 21st century economy.   But the Ryan-McConnell tax proposal would do the opposite and fails  on the promises made by President Trump to boost the middle class.  Middle class families would see an average tax increase of $1,290 per  year. That is a 380 percent increase for an average family of four.   A new analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said that the  Ryan-McConnell proposal would add $5.6 trillion to the national debt, a  27 percent increase from the current debt which is already too high.   Under this proposal, the increased deficits will far outweigh the  benefits  [[Page H7846]]  of reductions, and economic growth and hardworking Americans will both  suffer.   Instead, we need forward-looking policies that are fiscally  responsible and create opportunities for families and businesses in  today's economy. That will only come from bipartisan negotiations where  we can work together to create the best possible tax conditions for  Americans.                            ____________________
