 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service and  legacy of my friend and colleague from North Carolina, Walter B. Jones,  Jr.   Congressman Jones served the people of North Carolina's Third  District honorably for more than two decades, being elected 13 times,  starting in 1994.   He passed away on Sunday in Greenville, on his birthday.   Congressman Jones will be remembered for his courage, conviction, and  character. He was a man led by his faith, never wavering in his support  for the unborn. He was known as a staunch pro-life advocate.   He was just as tough when it came to his support of the military. His  district covered both the Marine Corps' Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps  Air Station Cherry Point, and he worked hard to give our servicemen and  -women a better quality of life.   Our country is better off when people like Walter Jones are serving  in this body. Please join me in praying for his family and loved ones  throughout this difficult time.                            ____________________
