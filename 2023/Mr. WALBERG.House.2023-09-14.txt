 Mr. Speaker, I rise today supporting the Preserving  Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act.   Why wouldn't I? I deal in a sense of reality. I live in a State that  produces automobiles. I live in a State right now that is at risk of  having a major disruption due to a strike potential. I have autoworkers  who are concerned about their jobs because of the push on EVs that  isn't working. We even had one of the major chairmen of the auto  companies attempt to take an EV trip across the Nation. They couldn't  make it because we don't have the infrastructure available.   Beyond that, H.R. 1435 prevents a waiver for California to  effectively ban the internal combustion engine. California's political  agenda does not reflect how the rest of America operates, and I would  suggest it doesn't reflect what a lot of Californians need.   Look no further than EV sales to know the American people don't want  this forced transition. They may like the F-150 Lightning. It is a hot  rod, but it doesn't do the job.    Mr. Speaker, autoworkers in Michigan also don't want  this mandate. Let consumers and  [[Page H4325]]  innovators in the auto industry guide the future, not California's  politicians.
