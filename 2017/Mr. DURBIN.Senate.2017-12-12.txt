 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, and I  certainly thank my colleague from Nevada for giving me an opportunity  to speak for a few minutes. I also thank my friend from Oregon for  being steadfast on this subject.   It has been 16 years since we passed the DREAM Act. We have been  through a lot. We made it here on the floor of the Senate. We passed it  on the floor of the Senate. There was an effort at comprehensive  immigration reform which included the DREAM Act. It was a glorious day  when it passed with a strong bipartisan vote and then a bitter  disappointment in the months that followed when it languished on the  floor of the House of Representatives and never was called for a  hearing or a vote on the floor. So many of these thousands of young  people who would be protected under the DREAM Act didn't know what the  future would hold.   President Obama stepped in and created DACA through Executive order,  and with DACA protection, some 800,000 young people were given a chance  to be part of America--something they always dreamed of. They went to  college, got jobs, and they did important things in their lives that  they had put off and frankly reached the conclusion that they would  never be able to do.   One of the things that many of them did, which surprised people, was  to pursue their goal of being part of the U.S. military. We have an  All-Volunteer military. These young people, undocumented in America,  who have no legal status in our Nation, were prepared literally to give  their lives for our country, the only country they have ever known. Is  there any question in your mind as to their devotion to this Nation?  Not in mine.   When you hear their stories, you will understand why. I have a story  I want to tell you tonight. It is a story about Alan Torres.   Alan Torres was brought here as a child from Mexico. He grew up in  North Dallas, TX, where he was a great student and athlete. In high  school, he was placed in a program for advanced math and science. He  took advanced placement courses in a variety of subjects which I  dutifully avoided in high school, subjects such as physics, chemistry,  anatomy, and physiology. He was captain of the high school varsity  cross country team, where he won the district championship. He was the  company commander in his high school's Junior ROTC. Not only was Alan  an academic overachiever, he was also an artist on top of everything.  His work was displayed and sold at regional level competitions, and he  earned many awards.   His most vivid memory of high school, however, was none of these  things but of 9/11, the day of the terrorist attack on the United  States. He was sitting in school, wearing his JROTC uniform in Texas,  and he cried with his classmates when they heard what happened to  America. He said he thought to himself, ``I can't believe this happened  to my nation.'' My Nation. You see, as a kid, Alan always believed this  was his Nation. It wasn't until he was unable to do things many of his  friends could do that he realized he was undocumented in America, with  no legal status. He couldn't get a driver's license like his buddies  did. He couldn't apply for financial aid to go to college.   Alan still pursued his dream despite these obstacles. By the time he  graduated from high school, he was working three jobs to save up enough  money to go to school. He attended a local community college because he  didn't have any money. He needed low tuition. He received an  associate's degree from Dallas Community College. Then he transferred  to the University of Texas, Arlington. There, he got a bachelor's  degree in information systems management. After all his hard work, he  graduated from college debt-free. That is how hard he worked. He paid  for his education out of his pocket because he couldn't count on any  Federal loans or financial aid.   Today, Alan Torres--this young, undocumented man, protected by DACA-- is a software engineer for IBM. He developed software that helps  medical providers across the country to better manage the health of  over 50 million patients.  [[Page S7967]]    He wrote me a letter saying:         [DACA] is what I would pray for all those nights when I       would stay up late doing homework or lay awake full of       anxiety for the future. It has allowed me to fulfill my       potential and reach my goals without the fear of not knowing       if I am going to wake up in a strange country tomorrow. . . .       Dreamers are not perfect, but we work hard, love this       country, and would love the opportunity to show it.    Alan is one of 31 Dreamers working for IBM. People like Alan are the  reason that IBM and a lot of business leaders are calling us and  saying: Are you crazy, Senator? You would deport Alan Torres? He earned  his education in the country the hard way. He succeeded where others  failed. He has the ambition and drive that we all pray for in our  children and those we admire, and you want to tell this man to leave  the United States of America?   These business leaders are pretty hard-nosed about this. For their  part, they have an excellent employee, and they don't want to lose him.   More than 400 business leaders wrote a letter to Congress urging us  to pass the bipartisan Dream Act or DACA or whatever you want to call  it. The letter says:         Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our       economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of       why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.    That is the business viewpoint on this whole issue of the Dream Act.   In a few weeks, we want to go home for Christmas. We want to  celebrate with our families. We understand that it is a special time of  year for so many in America, this Christmas and Hanukkah season. We  know we give thanks at Thanksgiving, but we give it again on Christmas  Day as we count our blessings. One of the blessings we count on is the  blessing of opportunity.   We know that in this great Nation, people have an opportunity to make  a better life for themselves, their kids, for their future, and for our  Nation. Think about Alan Torres over this Christmas, and think about  800,000 just like him, uncertain about what the new year will bring,  uncertain because we have failed to act in Congress.   It was the President and Attorney General on September 5 who  challenged us to do something. The President said: I am going to do  away with Obama's Executive order, and now, Congress, do something. But  all I hear from many of my colleagues is, well, let's see tomorrow if  we can work this into the schedule or maybe next month or maybe the  month after. We can't do that. There has to be a sense of urgency on  our part too.   These young people--many of them have tearful speculation about their  own future. I just talked to one of my colleagues from Colorado who  came back from a meeting with half-a-dozen Dreamers, and as they told  their story, they all broke down in tears. Do you know why? They are  just about to give up hope--not on our country but on us--on the  Senate, on the House, on politics, on Congress. I think we are better  than that.   This Nation of immigrants has many people with many great stories.  The Presiding Officer told a great story about his family and what it  meant personally growing up. I have heard it and I am inspired by it,  as I am and he is by many other stories we hear. This is what America  is all about.   This issue really tests who we are and what we believe in and what  our values will be. There are 100 ways to get to the finish line, but  we need to do it by December 22. That is when we are supposed to break  for Christmas. Let's make sure that as we break for Christmas, we give  these young people, these Dreamers, these DACA people we have  protected, a bright future for a happy new year, literally.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.   Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to  really put a face to what we are talking about here when we in  Washington are making decisions that are impacting the real lives of  the people back home in our States.   I have to thank my colleague from Illinois, who has not only led the  charge on this fight but has never given up for those Dreamers and  their families, has really fought to show who they are because they are  not numbers. They are real people.   I go home to my State, and on a regular basis I meet with Dreamers  and their families, and it is no different. We sit around and we talk  and tell stories about their struggle and their fight just to have that  American dream. They are crying. Many are afraid to even tell their  stories.   The first time I had an opportunity to sit with Dreamers, they had  never told their story before because they were too afraid to tell it.  They were too afraid that if they told it and left their home that day  and went to work or went to school, that when they came back, their  parents would not be there. It was the first time they came forward. It  is no different now.   This administration and what they are doing is continuing the fear in  our communities. That is why now more than ever we have to pass the  Dream Act. Since this administration ended DACA, more than 11,000 DACA  recipients have lost their status. Each week, 851 Dreamers are losing  their protection. If we fail to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,  800,000 kids will be forced to watch their lives fall apart. They will  lose their driver's licenses, their health insurance, their  scholarships, their student loans, their work permits. They will face  the constant threat of being detained, separated from their families,  and forced out of the only home they know.   This is not just a crisis for these kids and their families, it is a  crisis for our country, and it is a crisis for businesses across  America. If Dreamers lose their jobs, employers will incur nearly $3.4  billion in costs. The Center for American Progress estimates that our  GDP will shrink by $460.3 billion over the next decade. Over 800  business leaders from companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Facebook, Google,  Lyft, and Microsoft have signed a letter to Congress, as you have  heard, urging legislators to pass the Dream Act. The value Dreamers add  to our economy is apparent to our country's most innovative businesses,  it is apparent to religious groups and advocacy organizations all  across the Nation. What is it Congress is missing? Why are some Members  of this body unable to see all the contributions these kids make?   This is also a moral crisis. We cannot turn our back on Dreamers. We  must embrace them. They are living examples of what America stands for  as a nation, built through the sweat and hard work of generations of  immigrants.   Immigrants are a fundamental part of our communities. They always  have been. They have built our railroads, our cities, our highways.  They have founded businesses, invented groundbreaking technologies, and  discovered lifesaving cures. Blue jeans, hamburgers, ketchup, YouTube,  Google, Apple, even America's best idea--our national parks--these are  iconic American inventions, and yet they were all created in whole or  in part by immigrants.   Immigrants have held public office. One of Nevada's first Senators  was an immigrant. His name was James Graham Fair, and he was born to a  family in Ireland. His father brought him to the United States when he  was a child to escape the potato famine. He grew up on a farm in  Illinois and moved to Nevada in the 1850s to get involved in silver  mining. He made a fortune when a repository of silver ore in northern  Nevada, known as the Comstock Lode, was discovered. The discovery of  this silver made him wealthy beyond belief. Overnight, he became one of  Nevada's silver kings. He invested his fortune in railroads and real  estate and eventually accumulated over $40 million, and that is more  than a billion dollars today.   In 1881, he was elected to represent Nevada in the U.S. Senate. In  1882, this Irish immigrant, a man who became a king because of the  Comstock Lode, turned his back on other immigrants, and he voted in  favor of the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese Exclusion Act was a  watershed moment in the history of American immigration policy because  it was the first time the Federal Government restricted immigration on  the basis of race. I tell you this story because, to me, the Chinese  Exclusion Act exemplifies a vicious truth--that immigrants and their  descendants are often the ones fighting to keep the next generation of  immigrants out. Sadly, this Congress--a group that includes many  descendants  [[Page S7968]]  of immigrants--is in danger of making the same mistake.   When are we going to acknowledge what basic economics, history, and  scientific research have always proven to be true; that immigrants make  our economy stronger, that immigrants come to our country and start  businesses, apply for patents, create jobs, and invent technologies  that change our world.   The 800,000 Dreamers in this country don't want special treatment.  They want the chance to live their lives and do all of those things  without the fear of deportation looming over their heads. We have a  President who is not just refusing to give them that chance but  actively spreading lies and hate about who they are. I wish I could say  this xenophobia--this hate--is something we have never seen before, but  anti-immigrant sentiment is nothing new. These attempts to shut our  doors are as old as our Nation itself.   We are a nation of immigrants. We are caught in a vicious cycle. We  look to our ancestors for inspiration. We benefit from the  contributions of immigrants, but every generation, we default to the  arrogance of power and treat immigrants as scapegoats and shut them  out.   A teacher from Sparks, NV, recently contacted my office to share the  fear and uncertainty kids and families are feeling right now. David  wrote:         I teach music at Diedrichsen Elementary School in Sparks,       and my wife is the Assistant Principal at Desert Heights       Elementary in Stead. . . . We are seeing an increase in       stress, acting-out behaviors and absences in our students       from immigrant families. Another friend of mine who teaches       at a school with a large immigrant population has told me       about days when large numbers of children are absent because       of rumors of raids by ICE.    These are the consequences of using immigrants as scapegoats.   We are facing another watershed moment in our country's history.  People will ask: Where were you when Dreamers' lives were hanging in  the balance? Did you use your voice? Did you speak out?   It is time to stop this cycle. It is time to do the right thing and  pass the Dream Act, not just because it will add billions of dollars to  our economy but because threats to immigrants are a threat to our  communities, our safety, our lives, and the future of this country.   The Dream Act is an investment in our future. Republicans in Congress  are looking for a way to reduce the Federal deficit. Well, I have a  solution for you. Passing the Dream Act would decrease the Federal  deficit by $2.2 billion over 10 years. It turns out that the refrain we  always hear that immigrants are taking away jobs is a myth. The economy  is not a zero-sum game. Research shows that immigrants drive growth.  They generate new patents at twice the rate of native-born Americans.  In 2014, they earned $1.3 trillion and contributed $105 billion in  State and local taxes and nearly $224 billion in Federal taxes.  Immigrants are 30 percent more likely to start a business in the United  States than nonimmigrants, and 18 percent of small business owners in  the United States are immigrants. In 2007, these small businesses  employed an estimated 4.7 million people and generated more than $776  billion in revenue, but this fight is not just about our economy.   At its core, this fight is about 800,000 uncertain futures. When you  meet Dreamers like I have, you will see they are not numbers, and they  are not graphs. They are hard-working young people who are putting  themselves through school and supporting their families.   They are young people like Maria, a Dreamer who was brought to the  United States when she was 4 years old. Now, 22, she is working as a  teacher and director of the Infant Toddler Program at a Montessori  school in Washoe County, NV. She already has an associate's degree, but  she plans to enroll in the University of Nevada, Reno to pursue a  bachelors in education, human development, and family studies.   Maria sent me a letter to tell me her story, and she wrote:         I, as a Dreamer, am being truly affected by not knowing       what will happen with my future. Since we moved here, I have       learned what the meaning of true work ethic is and how to be       a positive asset to our nation. Being a DACA recipient means       I can never have a criminal record, I pay taxes, I have a       great job teaching our youth, and am still working hard to       continue my education. . . . I am here thanks to the       selflessness and courage my mother showed, and I believe any       parent would do the same for their children without       hesitation. My mother followed all the rules to quickly       become a true hard working member of this nation.    In her letter, Maria told me all she wanted was a chance to follow  the rules, show her potential, and continue working as a teacher.   Maria's story is both an immigrant's story and an American story. It  is a story about what happens when we give Dreamers a chance. Maria's  story is no different from Sergey Brin's, the cofounder of Google who  came here from Russia. It is no different from Madeleine Albright's,  the first female Secretary of State, an immigrant from Czechoslovakia.  It is no different from that of John Muir's, a Scottish immigrant, or  that of Joseph Pulitzer's, a Hungarian immigrant, or that of Albert  Einstein's, a German refugee.   Dreamers' stories are no different from my own. My grandfather was  born in Chihuahua, Mexico. He crossed the Rio Grande to come to this  country. He served in our military, became a citizen, married my  grandmother, and he raised a family. His son, my father, began his  career as a parking attendant at the old Las Vegas Dunes Hotel. He  worked his way up through the ranks to become the first Latino on the  Clark County Commission and then president of the Las Vegas Convention  and Visitors Authority. My mom and dad worked all of their lives so my  sister and I could become the first in our family to earn a college  degree.   My family taught me that when someone opens a door for you, you hold  it open for the next person coming along after, and that is what I am  in the Senate to do--to make sure every American gets that same  opportunity my grandfather had, that my parents had, and that my sister  and I had.   It is time to recognize that Dreamers are Americans, that their  stories are no different from any of ours, that by taking away their  protections, by allowing them to return to the shadows, we are allowing  a vicious cycle to grind 800,000 dreams into the dust. It is time to  learn from the mistakes of our predecessors. We must pass the Dream Act  before the end of this year.   Thank you for listening.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
