 Madam Speaker, local journalism is the lifeblood of our  democracy and the backbone of our communities. I rise today to honor  the life and legacy of a constituent who dedicated his career to that  very American public service. Joseph Hart, an award-winning local  journalist who spent his career telling the stories of our community,  most recently as executive editor of the Delaware County Daily Times,  tragically passed away this week.   He leaves behind a void in the hearts of his colleagues and readers  across PA-5 who have relied on his insightful and dependable reporting  for decades.   Joe grew up with the Delco Times, starting as an intern 40 years ago  and rising to executive editor in 2020. His friends and colleagues  describe an incredible friend, mentor, and journalist, calling him  kind, witty, principled, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, professional, and  passionate.   In the words of retired Delco Times editor Phil Heron, ``The  institutional knowledge Joe had of the county, you can't replace that.  He was the walking encyclopedia of Delco politics.''   Our hearts go out to Joe's family, friends, and his team at the Delco  Times as they mourn this tremendous loss.                            ____________________
