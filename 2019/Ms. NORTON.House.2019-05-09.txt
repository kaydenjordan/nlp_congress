 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the administration's guidance permitting junk plans to  replace the Affordable Healthcare Act has fooled no one, and certainly  not the millions with preexisting conditions and those who now enjoy  essential health benefits.   The administration's true intent is clear from its support, in court  now, as I speak, of a case to repeal the ACA in its entirety, including  preexisting conditions.   Republicans, historically, have initially opposed virtually every  form of coverage for the American people, including Social Security,  but they have never succeeded in withdrawing or reducing benefits then  in use. They will not succeed this time.   In my own District of Columbia, 106,000 residents with preexisting  conditions would lose or risk losing or being denied or charged  significantly more for health coverage.   The District, on its own, has succeeded in overcoming Republican  attempts to weaken the ACA and now has reached virtually universal  coverage, in spite of a specific attempt to block the city's successful  efforts.   The administration's junk coverage is particularly untenable in  allowing Federal subsidies of junk plans.   Republicans failed to overturn the ACA when they controlled  majorities in both the House and the Senate. Plans that the  administration has put forward to dismember the Act will not succeed  either. Because of how insurance works, junk plans put all insured at  risk of paying more for insurance.   Today, we intend to expose and defeat the administration's dangerous  substitution for the Affordable Healthcare Act.
