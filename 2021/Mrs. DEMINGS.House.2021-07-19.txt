 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  this opportunity.   We all know the United States is a diverse nation with diverse  people, diverse viewpoints, and diverse perspectives. Every community  in America--no matter their age, gender, ZIP Code, or income--should be  allowed to tell their stories in their voices.   Whether in news, movies, television, music, or more, it is important  that our media represent the wonderful diversity of our great Nation.  This resolution simply states that all Americans should have the  opportunity to tell their story and hear their story told through their  own eyes and voices.   I am glad that our resolution reaffirming Congress' support of media  diversity will be voted on this afternoon. As we work together to  remove barriers, I am grateful to all of the congressional cosponsors  on both sides of the aisle and media representatives who helped move  this bill forward.   Every child in America should hear a voice that sounds like theirs  and see a face that looks like theirs. As we face some of America's  greatest challenges, I am excited about the work still yet to come.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues again on both sides of the  aisle for their support of this resolution.
