 Madam Speaker, enough is enough. Congress has  a huge list of urgent, overdue bipartisan priorities for the American  people, and we can't keep kicking the can down the road.   The short-term funding bill congressional Republicans passed  yesterday ignores the pressing issues facing our Nation: funding the  Children's Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers;  delivering needed resources to fight the deadly opioid epidemic;  protecting our DREAMers from deportation; and providing disaster relief  for Americans ravaged by hurricanes, mudslides, and wildfires.   These issues aren't going away. We must work together to address them  immediately. Yet House Republicans have passed a fourth short-term  funding measure in 4 months.   This month-by-month approach is reckless and dangerous for the entire  Nation. It hinders our military, medical research, and infrastructure  investments. It hurts seniors who depend on Social Security and  Medicare and veterans getting care at the VA.   We need to stop the gimmicks and the cycle of delay. This is no way  to run the government.   Madam Speaker, let's stop putting off for tomorrow the things we need  to do today. Let's get to work.                            ____________________
