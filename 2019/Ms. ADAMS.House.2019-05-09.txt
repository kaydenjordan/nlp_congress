 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of the  shooting in my district last week on April 30 at the University of  North Carolina at Charlotte.   The campus was terrorized by gun violence. Two promising young men,  Ellis ``Reed'' Parlier and Riley Howell, lost their lives. Four other  students were injured in this act of senseless violence.   As a mother, grandmother, and retired professor, my heart goes out to  the loved ones and the entire UNC community. Too many people fear for  their safety in their schools, on their campuses, and even in their  places of worship.   Enough is enough. We can and must do more to stop gun violence. UNCC  and the Charlotte community will never forget last week's tragedy, and  we will never forget Reed and Riley. We will honor their memories with  action and continue working to keep our communities safe.   I ask all Members and guests in the gallery to rise for a moment of  silence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today as the founder and co-chair of  the Black Maternal Health Caucus. I want to take this time to briefly  speak about the importance of Black maternal health.   Our country is in the midst of a national public crisis. Black  mothers are dying.   Across the country, Black women from all walks of life are dying from  preventable pregnancy-related complications at three to four times the  rate of non-Hispanic White women. Sixty percent of maternal deaths are  preventable. Their infants are twice as likely to die by their first  birthday as infants born to White mothers.   Black women are 50 percent more likely than non-Hispanic White women  to give birth preterm, accounting for more than half of the disparity  in infant mortality rates among Black and non-Hispanic White women.   Reducing this gap through interventions like better medical care and  increased social support can improve maternal outcomes for African  American women, while also reducing racial disparities in infant  mortality.   Research suggests that the cumulative stress of racism and sexism  undermines Black women's health, making them more vulnerable to  complications that endanger their lives and the lives of their infants.  Unfortunately, current healthcare practices are inadequate in  addressing the health consequences of living with the stress.   As a Black mother and as a grandmother, this issue is very personal  to me. That is why Representative Lauren Underwood and I founded the  Black Maternal Health Caucus, with  [[Page H3669]]  the goal of closing the racial disparities gap.   The caucus aims to raise awareness about this crisis, to educate  Members of Congress, and to find meaningful legislative solutions to  improve maternal health outcomes. We intend to amplify the voices and  needs of mothers and families all across this Nation.   I have been working closely with healthcare providers and with  stakeholders and policymakers to begin identifying a comprehensive path  forward for eliminating these disparities.   On average, African American women receive lower quality healthcare  than their non-Hispanic White peers. This disparity in care quality  starts as early as birth, with African American infants in neonatal  intensive care units receiving lower quality care than non-Hispanic  White infants.                                time  2045    This continues throughout adulthood with three out of four Black  women giving birth at low-quality hospitals where their risk of poor  maternal health outcomes is the highest.   More than a third of Black women undergo cesarean sections, C- sections, even for low-risk pregnancies. This is 4 percent higher than  the U.S. average, higher than any other racial or ethnic group.   Although a C-section can save lives when a pregnancy is high risk, it  is, nevertheless, a major surgical procedure accompanied by risks,  including surgical injury to either the mother or infant, infection,  and heavy bleeding.   Here we have a few areas that we need to focus on. We must improve  access to critical services. We must improve the quality of care  provided to pregnant women. And we must address maternal and infant  mental health.   May is Mental Health Month. Too often, however, maternal and infant  mental health problems go unrecognized or unaddressed, particularly for  women and infants of color, with devastating consequences.   We should also enhance supportive services for families before and  after birth. All families need support to thrive, but not all have the  support that they need.   Adjusting to parenthood can be especially difficult for families  experiencing economic insecurity. As a consequence of structural  racism, many families experiencing this insecurity are in lower-income  communities of color.   Programs that help families meet their basic needs--including  nutrition assistance, housing assistance, and other social supports-- are underfunded, and the application and enrollment process can be  difficult and time-consuming.   We must also improve data collection and oversight. Collecting and  sharing reliable, consistent data on maternal and infant mortality is  essential to developing solutions.   Although some progress has been made, such as H.R. 1318, which helped  to provide States with resources for maternal mortality review  committees, there is still more work we need to do.   To address these problems, Federal policymakers should help States  standardize and improve the quality of the data being collected and  ensure diversity among stakeholders who serve on mortality review  committees.   There is no easy fix for this issue. It is going to require many  steps to begin closing the gaps.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to begin implementing  some of these important strategies to save our mothers.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence), my good friend who is co-chair of the Democratic Women's  Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the congresswoman from Michigan,  not only for her work with the Women's Caucus but all of her work in  this area.   Of course, when we can improve the quality of health for women, we  are going to make our families much more sustainable.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to welcome someone who has been a  leader on the issue of health, who chairs the CBC Health Braintrust,  and who has continued to lift her voice in the area of health.   She is a member, as well, of the Energy and Commerce Committee. She  is also the founder of the Black Women and Girls Caucus.   I am pleased to have my colleague from the State of Illinois, Robin  Kelly, join us this evening to speak on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois, not  only for her comments tonight but for all the work that she has done in  this area.   It is a preventable issue and something that we can do something  about. That is why we are here tonight to shed some more light on this,  Madam Speaker, and to try to make sure that we are all educated so that  we will know.   This comes right on the heels of Mother's Day. As we think about our  mothers, our grandmothers, and all of those who have been mentors to  us, this is an issue that we want to try to make right.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to welcome the congresswoman from  California, who is a senior member on the Appropriations Committee, has  been a champion of reproductive rights, and sits on the Budget  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee),  my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee. Black lives  matter, and Black mamas' lives matter.   As you talked about your mother giving birth to you and the story  that she told, I thought--I was reminded of 13 years ago, my daughter  giving birth to her daughter who, they both almost didn't make it. She  had a very difficult pregnancy, right at the end. She had to have a  Cesarean, what we call a C-section, and she had to give blood. All  kinds of things started going wrong at the last minute.   And once she did return home--because the baby was premature, 2  months early, once she did go home, probably less than 10 days, she had  to go back, she was having complications.   So the problems that our women have don't always occur while you are  in the hospital, so they need to have that support, not only before the  baby is born, but even after.   I thought about that, and it was a very difficult time for us. But  now you wouldn't believe my granddaughter is taller than I am, and she  is a really healthy young lady, a beautiful young lady.   But you have to think about that, that it does not matter. I think I  may have heard the gentlewoman or one of our other speakers say, even  your socioeconomic status, all those things really don't matter.  Sometimes doctors don't really listen to women.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  and for all that she continues to do. I appreciate that very, very  much; and thank her for being here as we kick off this Mother's Day. I  am missing my mom. I know the gentlewoman is missing hers because they  passed away very close to each other.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being here and  for her support of what we are trying to do collectively here in  Congress.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure at this point to introduce another  warrior, a champion here in the U.S. House, a member of the Judiciary  Committee, Homeland Security Committee, who has continued to lift her  voice over and over and over again.   Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues for  being here, and I yield back.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 11 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, May 10, 2019, at 9  a.m.  [[Page H3672]]                              ____________________
