 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in both  sadness and anger.   I know how painful life can be as an openly gay person. Like so many  in our community, I have also experienced harassment because of who I  am, but these challenges pale in comparison to the onslaught of attacks  against the trans community in this country today.   House Republicans attack trans people as threats to kids, religious  liberty, and our local schools, but that just isn't true. The true  threats are the discriminatory proposals against trans Americans that  are being made in chambers and statehouses across the country.   Sports bans, bathroom bills, and healthcare restrictions demonize and  dehumanize trans people. With higher rates of depression, anxiety, and  suicide, these bills literally mean the difference between life and  death for so many in this community, but many in this Chamber don't  seem to care.   It is part of a plan to ignite culture wars at the expense of trans  lives. As an immigrant embraced by this country, I believe that being a  true patriot means advocating for all of our people across the country.  That is why I will do everything in my power to ensure and safeguard  the rights of all Americans, and that includes our transgender  community.   The trans community has been at the front lines of the struggle for  justice and equality. Please know that we will be there right beside  you, fighting against these cruel and un-American attacks.   Trans rights are human rights. We will continue to fight until we  win.            Recognizing Cal State Long Beach's 50th Annual Powwow     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Cal State Long Beach's 50th annual powwow. Specifically, I  recognize the First Nations and first stewards of the land where this  event is held every single year.   The Cal State Long Beach powwow is the longest running and largest  social celebration west of the Mississippi River honoring Native and  indigenous peoples.   I had the pleasure of attending this event just recently and was  incredibly impressed by the skill and love shared with this community  event. This year's celebration was especially important. It was the  first time it was held since the pandemic.   Established by American Indian students in 1969, the powwow includes  Native dancers from across the State, the Pacific Northwest, and even  parts of Canada.   Events like this are important to highlight our Native American  culture and presence within our country. It also serves to educate and  develop the next generation of Native American leaders while bringing  Tribes together to highlight art and unity.   In commemoration of the 50 years of the powwow, we congratulate and  thank Cal State Long Beach.                 Honoring Influential Artist Dave Van Patten     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support  art in all its mediums. From paint to dance to music to story writing,  our lives are enriched with the appreciation of the arts.   Today, I rise to recognize someone who has been an amazing and  influential artist in the city of Long Beach, and that is Dave Van  Patten.   Just last month, Dave topped his tremendous career by winning a  Grammy for his work as artistic director of the box set album of  Grateful Dead concerts titled: ``In and Out of the Garden.''  [[Page H1305]]    Dave Van Patten's work is iconic. You can see it all across the city  of Long Beach, the city of Bellflower, and across the State and beyond.  His ability to blend surrealism with comic book designs makes him a  unique artist with a distinctive style across southern California. I am  honored to know Dave. He is a constituent. He is a friend, and amazing  artist transforming people's lives.    Dave, congratulations.                            ____________________
