 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for the opportunity.   This amendment ensures adequate funding for the purposes of  instructing the FAA to continue the remote tower pilot program. Remote  towers provide air traffic control services through the use of cameras  and/or other instruments that provide information to controllers not in  the same location. This is an innovative way to provide ATC services,  significantly decreasing the upfront costs of building a control tower,  and it reduces the annual operating and maintenance costs, especially  where one remote tower provides coverage for several small airports in  the vicinity.   A 2007 FAA study found that the technology in a remote tower actually  improves surveillance capabilities at night and in inclement weather  conditions. With more than 20,000 nontowered U.S. airports missing out  on the benefits of an air traffic control tower, including streamlined  access, reduced delays, and increased safety margins, remote towers  provide a cost-effective way to enhance the safety and performance at  these airports.   It is vital that we continue to support the FAA's remote tower pilot  program allowing for innovative ways to improve safety and reduce  costs. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for her important  amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of her  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
