 Mr. Speaker, on June 11 of this month, the House  Education and Labor Committee reported out legislation, H.R. 1309, the  Workplace Violence Prevention for Healthcare and Social Service Workers  Act. Mr. Speaker, this is a culmination and a milestone of a 7-year  process that began in 2013.   Like many Members of Congress, I have been hearing about stories of  rising violence in emergency rooms, ambulances, and treatment  facilities to nurses, doctors, and nurses aides that showed a  disturbing trend.   One such case was Helene Andrews, a registered nurse from Danbury,  Connecticut, who was assaulted multiple times during her career.  Shortly before she retired, while she was dispensing medication to a  patient, she was thrown to the floor and her pelvis was shattered.   In 2013, former Congressman George Miller of California and I  requested a report from the Government Accountability Office to dig  deeper to determine how pervasive this violence is and what strategies  are at our disposal to reverse this trend. The report, which was  completed in 2016, found that workers in healthcare facilities  experienced substantially higher rates of nonfatal injuries due to  violence in the workplace compared to workers overall.   Between 2006 and 2016, there was a 70 percent increase in violent  incidents that occurred in healthcare and social service workplaces  that resulted in employees being away from work. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare and social service workers are  nearly five times more likely to suffer a serious injury from workplace  violence than workers in other settings.   Up to 30 percent of hospital workers report being assaulted at work.  For employees in psych hospitals, that number is drastically higher.  Nearly 50 percent of emergency room physicians have been physically  assaulted at work, and 80 percent report that this violence affects  patient care.   Despite these alarming statistics, we know that violence against this  workforce is, in fact, grossly underreported. Many medical  professionals are discouraged from reporting incidents, fear further  stigmatizing patients, or are just told: ``Move on. Shake it off. It is  part of the job.''   Mr. Speaker, during the course of work on this legislation, we  actually heard from the Cleveland Clinic in northeast Ohio, which is  one of the largest healthcare networks in America. The CEO of Cleveland  Clinic, Tom Mihaljevic, gave his 2019 state of the clinic address,  where he described that there is a national epidemic of violence  against healthcare workers, especially in emergency room departments.  Last year alone, nearly 30,000 weapons were confiscated from patients  and visitors in that healthcare network. At the time we did the markup,  one of the members of our committee actually expressed disbelief that,  in fact, that statistic was accurate.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter I supplied to  Congresswoman Foxx at the end of last week citing Mr. Mihaljevic's  report, which was a YouTube that is easily found, as well as an article  from Modern Healthcare, which quoted this amazing and astonishing  statistic.                                  Congress of the United States,                                    2nd District, CT, June 21, 2019.      Rep. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education           and Labor, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Foxx: During our June 11th mark up of       H.R. 1309, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care       and Social Service Workers Act you questioned the veracity of       a statement I made regarding the high number of weapons       confiscated from patients and visitors at the Cleveland       Clinic in 2018. The number I cited, 30,000, is indeed       alarming. It is also accurate, and further evidence that       health care and social service workers require enforceable       protections to limit potential violence against them at their       place of work.        During the mark up, you asked publicly that I verify this       statistic, so I would like to share with you two resources       which confirm that 30,000 weapons were confiscated from the       Cleveland Clinic's Northeast Ohio facilities in 2018.        In Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Tom Mihaljevic's 2019 ``State       of The Clinic'' address from February 27, 2019, he states:       ``there is a national epidemic of violence against health       care workers, especially in emergency departments . . . last       year alone, nearly 30,000 weapons were confiscated from       patients and visitors.'' You can view the address here:       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOr2UqlNzuY        Additionally, a March 11, 2019 Modern Healthcare article       entitled ``Healthcare workers face violence `epidemic' ''       cites Dr. Mihaljevic's address and reports that ``In 2018,       the clinic confiscated a staggering 30,000 weapons from       patients and visitors in its system in the Northeast Ohio       region.'' The article can be read here: https://tinyurl.com/  y5thhm4r        Given your understandable alarm upon hearing that the tens       of thousands of employees working at these facilities face       daily exposure to violence, I would welcome your support of       H.R. 1309. As you know, violence against this workforce is on       the rise. Both Democratic and Republican OSHA Secretaries       believe an enforceable standard is the best way to reverse       this trend, and this legislation will ensure that happens in       a timely manner.            Thank you,                                                      Joe Courtney.     Mr. Speaker, it is obviously not limited just to the  State of Ohio. We know these incidents are preventable.   Since 1996, OSHA has published voluntary guidelines that recommend  commonsense preventative measures that employers can take to reduce the  risk and severity of violent incidents, and that is what our bill does.  It basically requires, through OSHA, that there be a violence  prevention plan in healthcare settings.   It is not one size fits all. It recognizes that some facilities are  different from others. But, in fact, there has to be a way to train  staff to understand patient risk, to understand ways to deescalate  violence, and a way to design workforces to reduce the incidence of  violence.   In addition, it requires that there be a reporting mechanism to OSHA  when these incidents occur. Today, in a hospital, if there is a slip  and fall, it must be reported; if there is a chemical leak, it must be  reported; but if a nurse is punched, kicked, or spit at, that is not  required to be reported, and that is what our bill will do.   The legislation was reported out with a favorable report. We have 187  cosponsors of the legislation. It is bipartisan, and it will be brought  up this summer for final action.   We have waited far too long to protect the caregivers, the people in  the caring professions which every American relies on and depends on to  be healed, consoled, and cared for. Yet it is clear from the GAO report  that they are being subjected to incidents of violence which, again,  are totally unacceptable and which hinder their ability to do their  mission. It is time to pass H.R. 1309.   Again, I applaud the support from the emergency room physicians, the  emergency room nurses, and the American Nurses Association, as well as  a host of other groups that are affiliated with our healthcare delivery  system.   Let's protect the caregivers. Let's pass H.R. 1309.                            ____________________
