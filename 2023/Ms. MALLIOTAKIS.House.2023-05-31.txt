 Mr. Speaker, the Rolling Stones said, ``You can't  always get what you want . . . you get what you need,'' and we need to  avert a default that would stop checks to our seniors, benefits for our  veterans, hurt the U.S. dollar, and Americans' retirement savings. We  also need to change the fiscal trajectory of our Nation.   This bill does both by reducing inflationary spending for the first  time in over a decade with the largest savings in history, imposing  spending caps, and adding checks and balances on the executive branch.   We started from a place where the President and the Senate refused to  negotiate, and we ended with conservative wins that include stopping  Biden's plan to hire additional IRS agents this year, clawing back  unused COVID funds, expanding work requirements to reduce dependency on  public benefits, and cutting costly red tape that slows down critical  infrastructure projects.   While no deal is perfect, this is only the beginning, and we cannot  allow perfect to be the enemy of the good. Republicans, under the  leadership of Speaker McCarthy, have restored balance to government. We  put an end to the Democrats' massive inflationary spending sprees, and  we will continue to fight for the American taxpayers as we proceed in  this process to stop reckless policies that fuel inflation.
