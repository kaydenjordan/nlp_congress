 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Joyce Walker of  Lewisville, North Carolina. Last month, the North Carolina Association  of Municipal Clerks named Ms. Walker the 2018 Clerk of the Year.   Ms. Walker had already retired when she entered municipal service and  started a new career as Lewisville's town clerk in 2000. During her  tenure, she has received numerous designations, including North  Carolina Certified Municipal Clerk, Master Municipal Clerk, and a  certification from the National Association of Government Archives and  Records Administrators.   In addition to her duties and accomplishments, she is known by  everyone for being a genuinely sweet and pleasant person, dedicated to  serving the community through Lewisville's Student Leadership  Committee, the Civic Club's Scholarship Committee, Lewisville  Historical Society, and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.   Congratulations to Joyce Walker on her award of 2018 Clerk of the  Year. Lewisville is fortunate to have her as a pillar of institutional  knowledge and outstanding community service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Russell for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking Representative  Jimmy  Gomez for his comments tonight and for helping all through this piece  of legislation, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements  Transparency Act, or GREAT Act. Representative Gomez has been an  outstanding partner on this bipartisan bill to create more  transparency, efficiency, and accountability in the Federal grant  reporting process, and I thank him very much for his hard work.  [[Page H9076]]    The GREAT Act represents bipartisan legislation to modernize the  Federal grant reporting process. It would do so by mandating a  standardized data structure for information that recipients report to  Federal agencies.   Unless the reporting requirements for Federal grants are searchable,  the auditing process will continue to yield waste and inefficiency at  best, allowing fraud and abuse at worst.   Mr. Speaker, in 2017, the Federal Government awarded $662.7 billion  in grants funding to State agencies, local and Tribal governments,  agencies, nonprofits, universities, and other organizations. Roughly  translated, this equates to the gross domestic product of Switzerland  or more than the GDP of every country outside the G20.   Within our Federal Government, there are 26 agencies awarding Federal  grants, and all of them continue to rely on outdated, burdensome,  document-based forms to collect and track grant dollars. Society has  moved into a new age of information and technology, and it is time that  our government follow suit.   Adopting a governmentwide open data structure for all the information  grantees will report will alleviate compliance burdens; provide instant  insights for grantor agencies and Congress; and enable easy access to  data for oversight, analytics, and program evaluation.   Digitizing and, therefore, automating the reporting process would  have a twofold effect. First, it would allow greater scrutiny of how  the money is being spent. Second, it allows grantees to maximize every  dollar they receive from the government to ensure it goes back into  communities supporting local businesses, organizations, and education.   In order to fix the way Federal grants are reported, we must move  from a document-centric reporting system to a data superhighway. I urge  my colleagues in the House and the Senate to support the GREAT Act and  bring grant reporting into the 21st century.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Gomez for  his hard work on this bipartisan bill. I would also like the thank  Representative Darrell Issa for his authorship of the DATA Act of 2014.  It laid the foundation for the GREAT Act by applying data  standardization to a pilot universe of Federal grants. And I thank him  for his original cosponsorship of this bill.   I would also like to thank OMB Director Mulvaney for his office's  advice on this legislation and leadership in advancing open data in the  grant reporting process this year through the President's management  agenda.   Lastly, I would like to thank Leader McCarthy for bringing this bill  to the floor and for his broader leadership in pursuing an innovative  agenda this Congress.
