 Madam Speaker, last week during a Committee on Homeland  Security hearing, Secretary Mayorkas testified, and he stated on  numerous occasions that our border is secure.   Even as encounters of migrants reached historic levels and the amount  of narcotics being smuggled across our border soar, Secretary Mayorkas  and the Biden administration refuse to admit there is a problem.   The border crisis is fueled by the President's actions, such as his  decision to stop building the wall; his decision to cancel successful  Trump immigration policies; and his decision to signal that amnesty  will be provided to those who come here illegally.   Former Secretary of State Colin Powell had a policy known as the  Pottery Barn rule, which was, in short, ``You break it, you own it.''   The Biden administration has created this crisis, and now it is time  for the President to own the consequences of his actions.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4611, the DHS Software  Supply Chain Risk Management Act of 2021.   As we have seen over the past year, our software supply chains are  increasingly vulnerable. It is vital that the Department of Homeland  Security does its part to ensure that software in use by the Department  and its contractors is secure.   This legislation will help DHS better understand and track the  software and systems in use by its contractors so that it can better  mitigate risk within the software supply chain.   I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4611, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge  Members to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4089, the Darren Drake  Act.   In the wake of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, it is critical  that we remain vigilant to threats posed by terrorists and extremist  organizations.   Over the past two decades, terrorists have carried out multiple  vehicle-ramming attacks in North America and Western Europe.   Al-Qaida and ISIS have promoted these type of attacks for years,  including in Inspire, the online magazine of al-Qaida, and Rumiya,  ISIS's magazine.   ISIS has called upon its followers to conduct vehicle-ramming attacks  by buying, renting, stealing, or borrowing trucks and targeting large  outdoor events, crowded pedestrian streets, outdoor markets, and  rallies.   This legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to  develop and disseminate best practices for rental companies and dealers  to report suspicious behavior to law enforcement agencies at the point  of sale of a covered rental vehicle to prevent and mitigate acts of  terrorism using these motor vehicles.   This represents an important tool for addressing extremist threats-- the ability of government and the private sector to work together to  mitigate terrorism risk.   I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4089, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge  Members to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 1917, the K-12 Cybersecurity Act of  2021.   Schools around our country are increasingly the target of malicious  cyber actors and have recently been targeted with a deluge of  ransomware attacks.  [[Page H5539]]    This legislation introduced by Chairman Peters and passed by the  Senate mirrors the House version spearheaded by Representatives  Langevin, Garbarino, and Matsui.   This bill requires CISA to conduct a study to develop recommendations  and provide resources regarding specific cybersecurity risks facing K- 12 educational institutions. Importantly, it requires CISA to do so in  consultation with teachers, schools, administrators, Federal agencies,  nine Federal cybersecurity entities, and other private-sector  organizations.   In doing so, the study required by this bill would help the Federal  Government better support schools in defending against cyber threats.   I urge Members to join me in supporting S. 1917, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4426, the Homeland  Security for Children Act.   While terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other large-scale  emergencies have devastating effects on our communities that last for  years, the impacts on children whose lives are often shaped by such  emergencies can be felt throughout our country for decades. This  legislation will help ensure that DHS, especially FEMA, is considering  those long-term implications in all aspects of its mission and  planning.   I commend Representative Payne for his tireless effort over the years  to support and protect our Nation's children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4426. I  have no more speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4094, the One-Stop Pilot  Program Act of 2021. This legislation will allow TSA to conduct a pilot  program with select foreign airports that will make international air  travel both more secure and more efficient.   Streamlining international aviation security for passengers from  certified foreign airports would not only encourage airports around the  globe to reach U.S. security standards, but it will also help  revitalize a struggling international aviation industry. This  innovative pilot program shows that it is possible to have both better  security and a more seamless passenger experience.   I thank Ranking Member Katko for his tireless work with colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to bring this legislation to where it is today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4094, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to gentleman from New York  (Mr. Katko), the ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I also have no further speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4682, the Unmanned  Aerial Security Act.   It is imperative that the Department of Homeland Security be able to  protect the Nation against all threats. This defense includes ensuring  that the unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, that DHS  uses and buys, are not made in foreign countries that do not align with  our interests; countries such as China.   DHS requires the dominant, air domain capabilities that drones  provide to accomplish many of its land and maritime missions. We know  that DHS uses drones for surveilling our southwest border. Utilizing  drones is a cost-efficient way to protect large areas of the homeland.   However, many of the commercial drones used in the United States are  manufactured in China, which dominates the United States market. Of the  top 10 drone manufacturers that supply the United States market, a  single Chinese manufacturer towers over all the others with nearly 77  percent of the market share.   DHS has issued warnings in recent years about Chinese-made drones,  specifically citing concerns that they may be sending sensitive data to  their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the Chinese  Government.   Our colleagues in the Senate share our concern. In fact, Senator Rick  Scott has introduced similar legislation to ban the purchase and use of  these drones across the Federal Government, not just at DHS.   Given the role that drones have in protecting homeland security, it  is more important than ever to require DHS to assess its drone fleets.  This bill would require DHS to provide a threat assessment report to  Congress on whether the agency has analyzed the threat of its drone  from adversarial nations; the number of these drones that the  Department is currently operating; and the extent to which the  information gathered by these drones may be a threat to the homeland or  economic security of the United States.   Second, the bill would prohibit DHS from buying or using drones made  in adversarial nations going forward.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Ranking  Member Katko, for being an original cosponsor of this bipartisan  legislation. Along with Members on the other side of the aisle, this is  truly a bipartisan piece of legislation.   With China looming as a growing threat on the horizon, maintaining  our homeland security is of the utmost importance, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge all  Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4363, the DHS Contract  Reporting Act of 2021.   The Department of Homeland Security, along with its component  agencies, is appropriated billions of dollars every year to carry out  its mission. This legislation, authorized by my colleague,  Representative Harshbarger, will bring long overdue transparency to the  money DHS spends when contracting services from the private sector.   I commend Representative Harshbarger for her legislation to battle  waste, fraud, and abuse, and to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent  efficiently and transparently.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4363, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge Members to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
