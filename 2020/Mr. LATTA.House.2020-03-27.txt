 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this Statement of  Intent on Data Required for General Recognition of Safety and  Effectiveness.   The OTC drug monograph reform legislation requires that  nonprescription drugs be shown to be generally recognized as safe and  effective. This standard of general recognition is based on statutory  language that has been in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  since its enactment in 1938, and it was incorporated in the regulations  issued by the Food and Drug Administration when the OTC Drug Review was  established in 1972. In particular, 21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(i) states that:         . . . Proof of safety shall consist of adequate tests by       methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under       the prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use.       This proof shall include results of significant human       experience during marketing. General recognition of safety       shall ordinarily be based upon published studies which may be       corroborated by unpublished studies and other data.    Similarly, 21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(ii) states that:         . . . Proof of effectiveness shall consist of controlled       clinical investigations as defined in Sec. 314.126(b) of this       chapter, unless this requirement has been waived on the basis       of a showing that it is not reasonably applicable to the drug       or essential to the validity of the investigation and that an       alternative method of investigation is adequate to       substantiate effectiveness. Investigations may be       corroborated by partially controlled or uncontrolled studies,       documented clinical trials by qualified experts, and reports       of significant human experience during marketing. Isolated       case reports, random experience, and reports lacking the       details which permit scientific investigation will not be       considered. General recognition shall ordinarily be based       upon published studies which may be corroborated by       unpublished studies and other data.    These regulations clearly recognize the importance of what is now  termed ``real world evidence,'' including experience from marketing, in  determining general recognition of  [[Page H1864]]  safety and effectiveness. In addition, they recognize that results of  clinical studies supporting general recognition of safety and  effectiveness will in most instances be contained in the published  scientific literature. Such publications seldom, if ever, contain the  same level of detail as the clinical study reports and data tabulations  submitted in support of new drug applications, but it has long been  understood that they may form the basis for determinations of general  recognition of safety and effectiveness under the OTC monograph system.  Finally, the regulations clearly permit determinations of general  recognition of safety and effectiveness to be based on sources of  information other than the published scientific literature, including,  for example, unpublished data from studies carried out by federal  government agencies or other competent bodies which are made available  to the FDA in the process of administering the OTC monograph system. It  is our intent that the FDA should continue to apply these standards in  making determinations of general recognition of safety and  effectiveness under the monograph reform legislation.              Statement of Intent as to Minor Changes Provision    Under current law, dosage forms for monograph OTC drugs have largely  been limited to the technology in use in 1972, when the OTC Drug Review  began. The only mechanism for introducing truly innovative dosage forms  has been through the new drug application (NDA) process, which entails  disproportionate costs and delays. This has proved to be a significant  hurdle to use of new technologies that could offer consumers greater  convenience and choice in OTC drug products.   The legislation creates two new procedures for introducing innovative  dosage forms for monograph OTC drugs that would not otherwise be  permitted under subsection (b).   First, sponsors may initiate proceedings for the issuance of  administrative orders under subsection (c) to provide for use of novel  dosage forms.   Second, in appropriate cases, sponsors may make minor changes in  dosage forms without prior approval from FDA, using the procedure in  subsection (d). The sponsor must maintain information necessary to  demonstrate that the change will not affect the safety or effectiveness  of the drug or materially affect the extent of absorption or other  exposure to the drug in comparison to a suitable reference product. The  sponsor must also submit updated drug listing information to FDA within  30 days of introducing the new product to the market. FDA will have the  right to demand access to the relevant files, and there will be a quick  and simple procedure to resolve any disagreement between FDA and the  sponsor as to the adequacy of the data supporting the change. Before  the subsection (d) procedure takes effect, FDA must issue  administrative orders setting out the type of information required to  support minor changes in dosage forms. In issuing those orders, FDA  will take account of standard procedures and practices for evaluating  the quality of drug products, including applicable provisions of the  United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary, as well as special needs  of populations, including children.   The procedures in subsections (c) and (d) will only be required for  changes that would not otherwise be permitted under subsection (b).  Thus, changes in excipients or other inactive ingredients and similar  aspects of formulation of monograph OTC drug products will be permitted  without prior approval provided they are fully consistent with  requirements of applicable monographs or administrative orders and with  general requirements for monograph OTC drugs, including, among other  things, requirements for the use of suitable inactive ingredients which  are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the  effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays. When  such changes are made, sponsors will be required to submit updated drug  listing information to FDA within 30 days of introducing a product to  the market.      USP and International Conference on Harmonization as sources for     standards descriptions in minor changes administrative order with                    guidances by route of administration    An important objective of this legislation is to create procedures  that will promote innovation by permitting manufacturers to introduce  certain new and improved dosage forms for nonprescription monograph  drugs without the need for prior FDA approval. Manufacturers will be  required to maintain files containing data showing that such changes  will not affect the safety or effectiveness of their products and  provide those files to FDA on request. The bill directs FDA to issue  administrative orders and guidances describing the types of changes  that can be made without prior approval and the data that manufacturers  should have on file. Subsection (d)(3)(B) requires that, in issuing  such orders and guidances, FDA should take account of relevant public  standards for evaluating the quality of drug products. Examples of the  standards that FDA should take into account include the monographs and  other provisions of United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary and  guidelines issued by the International Conference on Harmonization of  Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human  Use (ICH). FDA is a major stakeholder in both organizations, and it is  appropriate that any administrative orders it adopts should take  account of relevant requirements issued by them.            Labeling considerations under minor changes provision    This bill establishes procedures under which FDA can issue binding  administrative orders setting forth the requirements under which  nonprescription drugs will be regarded as generally recognized as safe  and effective and may be lawfully marketed without an approved new drug  application. It is intended that these orders will be similar in  content to the monographs that FDA has issued under the current  procedures of the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review. That is, they  will contain provisions concerning active ingredients, dosages and  dosage forms, and instructions for safe use of the products to which  they apply and, where appropriate, other conditions required to assure  safety and effectiveness. Nonprescription drugs marketed under such  orders must also comply with general requirements of the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act and applicable FDA regulations, including  general requirements for labeling and quality. As is true under the  current regulatory system, labels and labeling for nonprescription  drugs may contain additional information, including brand names,  promotional statements, and other information, provided that any such  information is truthful and non-misleading.
