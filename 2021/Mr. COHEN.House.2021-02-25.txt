 Madam Speaker, yesterday, we had a Judiciary Committee  meeting on the rise of white nationalism and the concerns it should  pose to our country.   It was a pertinent meeting, and I was shocked to hear some of the  remarks of my colleagues on the Republican side who still have not  accepted the fact that what happened on January 6 was an attack on our  Constitution that they take an oath to and an attack on our country.  They seem to think it was just a demonstration, a small, polite  demonstration of 200 people; that it was, some said, people other than  Trump people posing as Trump people.   Those were Trump people. They wore Trump hats. They had Trump flags.  They hollered ``Trump.'' They were there to stop the steal for Trump.   America faced a great traumatic experience, as I did being in this  Chamber on January 6, and I ask my Republican colleagues to accept it,  accept the fact that it was a big lie, and Joe Biden is the properly,  lawfully elected President of the United States.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I stand in support of this legislation. I  have stood in support of this right for over 25 years.   When I was a Tennessee State Senator, I was the only member of the  State Senate to vote against a constitutional ban on gay marriage. It  was a legal pejorative; all people should have a civil right to be  treated equally and to be given due process of the law. And they should  have that today, and that is what this bill stands for.   This is a continuing battle that my friend, Julian Bond said was a  fight for fairness, justice, and equality against injustice and  bigotry.   We need to pass this bill and continue our move to a more perfect  union.
