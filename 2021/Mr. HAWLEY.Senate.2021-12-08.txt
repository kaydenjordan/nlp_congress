 Madam President, I rise to make a very simple point,  which is that Medicare is too important to be held hostage to political  games, and that is what is going on here now. We need to have a clean  bill to fully fund and protect Medicare for the millions of Americans  who rely on it, including over 1 million just in the State of Missouri.   And that is why I am supporting Senator Kennedy's bill to fully  protect and  [[Page S9026]]  secure Medicare, and I will support every amendment and bill and clean  amendment and bill to fully protect and secure Medicare, including, I  think, Senator Graham's that he's going to be offering shortly, which I  am also privileged to cosponsor.   And I would just say this: I call on the Members of both parties-- both parties--to stop using Medicare as a pawn in a political game.  Let's fund Medicare. Let's do it on its own. Let's not hold it hostage  to other agendas. Let's not hold it hostage to other programs. Let's  not hold it hostage to others' individual ambitions, whatever they may  be.   But let's take the opportunity now with this bill to fully protect  Medicare for our seniors all across this country. That should be  something that we can all get behind, and for those reasons I am proud  to support Senator Kennedy's legislation.   And now I yield to Senator Hoeven.    Madam President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmations of Executive Calendar No. 534, Clare  E. Connors, of Hawaii, to be United States Attorney for the District of  Hawaii for the term of four years; No. 535, Zachary A. Cunha, of Rhode  Island, to be United States Attorney for the District of Rhode Island  for the term of four years; No. 536, Nikolas P. Kerest, of Vermont, to  be United States Attorney for the District of Vermont for the term of  four years; No. 581, Gregory K. Harris, of Illinois, to be United  States Attorney for the Central District of Illinois for the term of  four years; and No. 582, Philip R. Sellinger, of New Jersey, to be  United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey for the term of  four years.                            ____________________
