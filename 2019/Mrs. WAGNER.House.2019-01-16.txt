 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with the hundreds of  thousands of Americans who are traveling to Washington for the 46th  annual March for Life.   Fighting for the rights of the most vulnerable Americans has been my  most precious responsibility since long before I was elected to  Congress. Most notably, I can remember marching to defend our unborn  children when I was pregnant with my son Stephen in January of 1990.  Last year, I was proud to march just days after my first granddaughter,  Isabella Marie, was born. This Friday, the day of the March, we will  celebrate Isabella's first birthday.   Again and again, I am reminded that life is beautiful, that children  are a blessing, and that we must do all we can to support our Nation's  mothers.   Though now we have a divided Congress, there is still so much we can  do to lift up women and children. This month, my colleagues and I  called on President Trump to veto any legislation that weakens Federal  policies against abortion.   We are fortunate that the administration is taking action to protect  life. The President has reinstated President Reagan's title 10 protect  life rule, so that our tax dollars don't fund abortion providers like  Planned Parenthood and others. This is widely popular policy.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, new public polling shows that millennials  prefer that their tax dollars go to federally qualified health centers  rather than abortion providers like Planned Parenthood by a 3-1 margin.  Only 7 percent of millennials share the position of the Democratic  Party platform that abortion should be available without any exceptions  and funded by your tax dollars.   The administration is heeding the concerns of the American people.  Just last month, the National Institutes of Health announced it will  fund up to $20 million to find alternatives to using human fetal tissue  in research projects. The U.S. Government should end all contracts that  use baby body parts. We must preserve the integrity in scientific  research by protecting pregnant women and their children.   This month, I am introducing two bills to defend life. The first is  the  [[Page H613]]  Born Alive Act, which will require all healthcare providers to give  babies who survive abortions the same level of care as other newborns  and to ensure that they are immediately admitted to a hospital. The  illegal fetal tissue trafficking industry profits most from abortions  that increase the likelihood of a live birth. Congress must provide  born-alive infants with lifesaving care, not exploit, kill, and sell  them to the highest bidder.   I am also introducing the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, or PRENDA,  which will prohibit sex-selection abortions or forcing a woman to  obtain a sex-selection abortion. The sad truth is that victims of sex- selected abortions are overwhelmingly female. It is estimated that 117  million girls are demographically missing from around the world due to  sex-selection abortions, infanticide, and other forms of gender-based  violence.   Girls are targeted for abortions not only in countries like China and  India, but right here in the United States. These abortions victimize  both mother and daughter and have no place in a just society.   Mr. Speaker, there is so much bipartisan work we can do to protect  America's mothers and babies, and I hope we can act together to serve  and protect all God's children.   I thank all of those who will march for life this week. I stand with  them, and I will continue to fight and pray for the day when abortion  is not only illegal but is unthinkable.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, we were sent to Congress to lead, but  this partial government shutdown is not leadership. It speaks to a  bigger problem in Washington: the reluctance to reach across the aisle  and serve in the best interests of our constituents.   Playing political games should not take precedence over securing our  border and keeping Americans safe, but it seems to me that is exactly  what is happening right now.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the  table so we can find a solution to this partial government shutdown and  make sure Federal workers get paid for the work they are doing and the  work they have done.   This inability to come together on commonsense border security  funding has gone on too long and affected too many Americans. We must  put partisanship aside, secure our border, and reopen this government.                            ____________________
