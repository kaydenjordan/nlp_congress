 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fort  Hood on their 80th anniversary marked this week.   Recognized as ``The Great Place,'' Fort Hood has a rich history and  is composed of great patriots who selflessly and honorably serve this  country.   This largest Active-Duty armored post has answered the call to serve  throughout our country's military history and has been an invaluable  installation for Army soldiers, advanced weaponry, and the local  community.   Whenever I am asked where the next generation of greatness is and  leaders will be, I say: Go with me. Go to Fort Hood. That is where they  are.   Fort Hood is a special part of Texas' 25th District, and it is my  distinct honor to represent them in Congress and fight on behalf of the  brave soldiers and their families each and every single day in  Washington.   Congratulations to Fort Hood for 80 years of exceptional service to  the United States Army and dedication to defending our freedoms at home  and abroad.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
