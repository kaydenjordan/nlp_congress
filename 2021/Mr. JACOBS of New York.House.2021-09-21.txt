 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4350,  the National Defense Authorization Act.   Our Nation faces many challenges in the coming years, from the  growing threat of terrorism brought on by our reckless withdrawal from  Afghanistan to Chinese aggression.   This bill reverses defense cuts proposed by the Biden administration  to fund our military and ensure our Nation can counter any threat.   It also addresses President Biden's disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan by prohibiting financial support to the Taliban and  allocating resources for counterterrorism operations.    In addition, it provides our troops a pay raise and supports the  procurement of essential equipment.   Finally, the bill includes a bill I introduced to improve retention  and readiness for providing opportunities for reservists, and the rule  makes in order my amendment that will get more small and innovative  companies access to DOD contracts.   Mr. Speaker, we face numerous challenges both today and in the  future. This legislation prioritizes resources for our military at a  critical time, and I urge its passage.
