 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the retirement of  John McAuliffe, a central New York native, visionary, and driving force  behind the Onondaga Lake cleanup effort.   In 2002, John McAuliffe was named program director for the Honeywell  Company's $450 million cleanup of Onondaga Lake, one of the most  polluted sites in America caused by Honeywell's predecessor.   McAuliffe tirelessly worked with Federal and State environmental  regulators and oversaw teams of engineers and technicians to clean up a  lake laden with more than 165,000 pound of mercury and other toxic  substances.   Today, Onondaga Lake is the site of the Loop-the-Lake Trail, as well  as the Lakeview Amphitheater, a popular music venue, and hosts  thousands of boaters, fishers, and nature enthusiasts each year. It has  also become a favorite place for bald eagles, especially in the winter  months. The lake has experienced an extraordinary revival due to John  McAuliffe's remarkable vision and unwavering commitment.  [[Page H2274]]    Central New York owes John a debt of gratitude for an enduring legacy  of doing something that many thought was impossible. I wish John a  happy retirement.                            ____________________
