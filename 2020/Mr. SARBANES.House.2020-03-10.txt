 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, almost to the day, this  House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a  transformative anticorruption and clean elections bill that would give  people their voice back in their own democracy.   It would fix gerrymandering; it would fix voting; it would fix  ethics; it would protect the ballot box; it would push back against  foreign interference and foreign disinformation coming into our  campaigns; and it would lift up the voices of average Americans in  competing with big money and lobbyists here in Washington.   It would change the status quo so every American would feel that  their voice counts here, that their opinion matters, and that that is  how we make policy.   Unfortunately, Mitch McConnell, the majority leader in the United  States Senate, has refused to bring H.R. 1 to the floor of the United  States Senate. One whole year of folding his arms at the gates of our  democracy and saying to the American people: You shall not pass.   Madam Speaker, we are not going to be deterred; we are not going be  to be diverted; and we are not going to be defeated. We are going to  keep pressing on to pass H.R. 1 for the people and restore the voices  of the American people.                            ____________________
