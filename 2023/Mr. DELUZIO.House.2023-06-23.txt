 Mr. Speaker, June is Pride Month, a month that  celebrates the contributions and importance of the LGBTQ+ community all  over the country and in Pennsylvania's 17th District.   My home borough of Aspinwall hosted Pride in the Park, a festival to  connect and celebrate the community with history walks, community  resources, art, music, and a vendor fair of local LGBTQ-owned small  businesses.   Pride is celebrated all across western Pennsylvania, from a Pride- themed Roller Derby bout in Cheswick, to festivals in Dormont and Mt.  Lebanon. There is also Prom in Millvale, online writing groups for  seniors, a parade and music in Swissvale, and lots more.   It is a busy month for our community and one that centers around  freedom at its core. It also remembers those who fought tirelessly for  equal rights and those hurt by discrimination or lost to senseless  hatred and violence.   America was founded under the ideals of liberty and justice, not  censorship, discrimination, or control. All people shall have the  freedom to love who they love, to be who they are, to be accepted, to  feel safe, and to be treated equally under the law.   On behalf of the good people of western Pennsylvania, I will keep  fighting for these freedoms here in Washington.                            ____________________
