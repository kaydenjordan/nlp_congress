 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Small Business be discharged from further consideration of  the bill (H.R. 8265) to extend the Paycheck Protection Program access  for small businesses, to extend the lifeline that southwest Washington  businesses--over 9,500 have taken advantage of, and have saved 92,000  jobs in southwest Washington and across this country, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues  to stand up for small businesses and workers across the country who are  struggling right now.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. sharp, I will be filing a  discharge  [[Page H4951]]  petition in the House to temporarily seize control from the House  Democratic leadership and revive the vital job-saving Paycheck  Protection Program.   Every one of us has heard from restaurants and stores on the brink of  closure. They are not crying wolf. Many will not make it through  October without more PPP funds.   I know the majority leadership is feeling tremendous pressure. How?  Because they canceled votes tomorrow morning. I guess allowing my more- seasoned Democratic colleagues to be on the floor while we file this  petition jeopardizes leadership's political posture.   Well, enough posturing, and enough treating the fate of small  business like a chess game.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to sign my discharge  petition in the morning and rescue small businesses. Be brave. Now is  the time to act.                            ____________________
