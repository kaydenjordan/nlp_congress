 Mr. President, I compliment President Trump on being bold  enough and strong enough to do something no President has contemplated  in decades, Republican or Democratic, and that is to end the war in  Afghanistan.   We have been there for 17 years. We voted on a resolution initially  that said we would go after the people who attacked us on 9/11 and  anyone who aided or abetted them. We did that. Today there is no one  living who attacked us on 9/11 or who is free. There is no one living  who aided or abetted the people who attacked us on 9/11. By any  measurement, we are victorious. We killed bin Laden. We have disrupted  the terror camps in Afghanistan. Is Afghanistan a mess? Sure, it is a  mess. It has always been a mess and always will be a mess, but now our  mission has changed to nation-building.   I compliment President Trump for being bold and brave in saying  enough is enough. Let's spend that money at home. We spend $51 billion  a year in Afghanistan. That money could be spent at home. I have three  members of my family who are in the military. I don't want them to go  to Afghanistan. Every one of our political and military leaders-- Republican, Democratic, and Independent--will tell you there is no  military mission in Afghanistan. Yet we stay. Some of the very same  people who say we have no mission, in their next breaths say we need to  send more troops there. We sent 100,000, and we completely had victory.  Then they came back as our troops came down. Are we to send 100,000 and  keep them there forever?   This resolution is an insult to the President, and I will oppose it.  This resolution has been put forward by Republicans, who say to  President Trump: You are leaving precipitously from Afghanistan. How do  you leave precipitously after 17 years? We are no longer fighting  anyone who attacked us on 9/11. The people we are fighting were not  even born when 9/11 happened. The war over there has nothing to do with  9/11. It has to do with nation-building. I will tell you what one Navy  SEAL, whom I met a year or two ago, told me. He said: We will go  everywhere. We will kill our enemy. We will do what you ask of us, but  the mistake is when you ask us to stay, plant the flag, and become  policemen. They don't want to be policemen. Our military members do not  want to be the policemen of the world.   We fight when we have to, and we should come home. That money should  be spent here at home. I completely and vigorously oppose this  condemnation of the President. They say we are leaving precipitously.  We have been there 17 years. The same people in the war caucus--and  they are on both sides of the aisle--will also tell you, if you  announce that you are leaving in 6 months, then you are telegraphing to  the enemy that you are leaving. So they don't want us to leave  precipitously, but they don't want us to leave in a planned way. They  have left us no way to leave.   People talk about bipartisanship. What is the one thing that brings  Republicans and Democrats together? War. They love it--the more the  better, forever war, perpetual war. We are spending $51 billion a year  in Afghanistan. We spend it on luxury hotels that are half completed.  The contractors have run off with the money. One of the hotels that  sits across from our Embassy serves as a place for snipers to shoot at  our soldiers. We have to now patrol this half-built hotel, and the guy  who was building it ran off with the money. The government we supported  for a decade--the Karzai government--grew more poppy than anybody in  the world. The guy's brother was a drug dealer, and his other brother  was a thief and ran off with the money. Is it any wonder that the  Afghan people turn away from the government we have given them? It is  time to declare victory and come home.   This resolution, like so many resolutions, could be misinterpreted as  being another affirmation that we stay forever. So I also support  language that should be added to this resolution that says: Nothing in  this resolution is to be construed as an authorization for war. Why?  Because we had an authorization like this about Libya that didn't give  power to the government to commit war. It passed on a Thursday evening,  when many Members were traveling back to their States, and President  Obama, at that time, used it and said: Oh, everybody is in favor of the  new war in Libya, which also turned out to be a disaster.   With regard to the troops in Syria, President Trump said: I will  defeat ISIS, and we will come home. Now the people are changing the  mission. They say: We have to stay there until the Russians leave. We  have to stay there until the Iranians leave. They have been there a  long time. They are not leaving. That means we stay there forever. We  have 2,000 troops compared to tens of thousands of other troops,  compared to a couple hundred thousand Turkish troops along the border.  Do we really want to be involved in another enormous land war in the  Middle East? To what end?    The great irony of this is, the war caucus on both sides--Republicans  and Democrats, those who will not ever let the soldiers come home-- typically vents its anger and says: The President has unlimited power,  and how dare Congress get in his way with regard to war. Here is the  irony. We now have a President who wants to use his power to come home,  and they are stepping in and saying: Oh, no. We need to make sure he is  consulting with Congress because we want to stay at war forever, and  the President wants to bring troops home. So this is a resolution to  condemn the President for trying to bring troops home for the first  time in 17 years.   What are we spending the money on--$51 billion a year? We have spent  [[Page S827]]  over $6 trillion between the Iraq war and the Afghan war--$6 trillion.  The $51 billion a year we are spending in Afghanistan is being spent on  a luxury hotel, and we have spent $45 billion on a gas station. I think  we spent about $90 million on the hotel and $45 million on the gas  station. Do you know what kind of gas they pump? Natural gas. How many  people have a car in America that runs on natural gas? Virtually  nobody. How many people in Afghanistan have a car that runs on natural  gas? Zero. So we bought them some cars. Then they didn't have any  money, so we gave them credit cards so they could use the gas pumps. I  sent my staffers to see if the gas station even existed, but they  couldn't get there because it was too dangerous. After 17 years, you  can't travel more than a few blocks in Kabul except without helicopter  warships and an escort of dozens of marines.   It is completely a disaster. More poppy was grown there last year  than in any recent year, and the people say: We shouldn't give up. All  we have to do is send more soldiers. All we have to do is fight longer.  When are they going to fight? They have 300,000 people in their army.  When are they going to fight? If they want their homeland, stand up and  fight for it. I am tired of America always doing everybody else's  fighting. I am tired of America always paying for everybody else's war.   People say: Oh, they might come and attack us. We should be prepared.  We should have robust intelligence. We should know what is going on,  and we should disrupt terrorist camps if we have to. Yet every person  out there who believes in this radical Islam, in this radical jihad is  not coming over here. Every misbegotten village in Africa is not a  threat to the United States, and that is the debate we should be  having.   They say: It is in our national security interests. Really? To go to  Niger to go to Mali? to be fighting in Somalia? to be fighting in  Yemen? to be fighting in Afghanistan and in Iraq? That is not in our  national interest.   People say: We must fight them there or they will come here. Well,  guess what. They have been coming here since 9/11. We have arrested  over 300 terrorists in our country. It was only a year ago that a dozen  people were killed in New York by a terrorist, so it is not as if they  haven't been coming. In fact, we don't condone terrorists' reasons for  coming, but if you look at their reasons for coming, they say it is  because we are over there.   So we are trapped by this platitude. This platitude is: We must fight  them over there so they will not be over here. Well, they are over  here, and when they tell you why they are over here, they say they are  over here because we are over there. I am not saying we do nothing. I  am not saying we don't have counterterrorism, but I will tell you that  when in some remote village in Yemen we swoop in at night and kill 15  people, including women and children, the surrounding neighborhood and  countryside, for 100 years, will speak to an old tradition of the night  the Americans came.   Ultimately, Islam must police Islam. They are never going to accept  Americans coming in and telling them how to live or how they should  behave or getting rid of even the bad elements among them. They need to  step up and do it.   We have taken 99 percent of the land back from ISIS. That is not  enough. People say there are still suicide bombers. Yes, there will be  suicide bombers in the Middle East until the end of time. If we are  waiting until there are no suicide bombers in the Middle East, we will  wait forever. Can the people there do nothing to take care of  themselves? Is there nobody there who can stop the 1 percent from  coming back? Will people not step up and fight their own wars?   We have given them trillions of dollars--the uniforms, the weapons.  Everything has been ours. Every time we say we have to be involved,  there are unintended consequences. In Syria, we gave arms to people who  were radical extremists. We gave arms to people who were actually  allied with al-Qaida. Some say there is no difference between al-Qaida  and the people to whom we gave arms. At one point in time, it was said  that ISIS had $1 billion worth of humvees that were from the United  States. The arms that were coming out of Libya--and Hillary Clinton  supported taking those arms into Libya--were going to the wrong people.  We were taking them to one set of bad people and giving them to another  set of bad people.   Maybe, sometimes, there isn't a lesser of two evils. Maybe,  sometimes, we have to be concerned about America. What I am saying with  this resolution is I am for replacing it completely and saying to  President Trump: We think we are doing a great job, and thank goodness  for being bold enough to say it is time to start thinking about America  first.   I ask unanimous consent that we get rid of the resolution condemning  the President and that we replace it with the resolution that simply  says that we applaud President Trump for being bold and brave enough to  consider bringing our troops home, declaring victory, and ending  America's longest war.    Mr. President, one of the things that I think are  fundamental to our country is the freedom to protest, the freedom to  dissent, and the freedom to boycott if you so choose. Our country was  actually founded with a boycott. The boycott was dumping English tea  into the ocean. In my State, Henry Clay was famous for passing  legislation boycotting British goods so that people could wear American  clothing. He actually fought a duel over that and became famous and  then became one of the most famous U.S. Senators.   The idea that you should be allowed to boycott, that it is an  extension of your speech, that it is an extension of the First  Amendment, I think goes to the very heart of who we are as a people. It  is hard for me to believe that part of this bill they are putting  forward would affirm State law that says you can't do business with the  government if you are involved with the boycott against Israel.   I am not really making a point on whether the boycott is good or bad  or with regard to Israeli policy; my point is whether it is good or bad  with regard to the First Amendment. You see, the First Amendment isn't  really about hearing from people about things that you like. If it is  speech that you like and people say you are a great guy, you are not  going to be offended by that speech. It is when people are critical of  you or critical of your thoughts or have different thoughts--that is  what the First Amendment is about.   It is an extraordinary thing in our country that people can actually  speak up and speak their minds. If people don't think the settlements  on the West Bank are a good idea, should they be allowed to speak their  mind? Should they be forbidden from doing work for the government?   The problem is that the government has gotten so big. There is a  teacher in Texas who is Muslim. I think she teaches autistic or special  needs kids. She is a contractor. She was asked to sign a statement  saying that she would never boycott goods made in Israel. Well, she  objects to some of the policies, I presume, on the West Bank. I don't  agree with her, but that is a fundamentally American thing--to be able  to object. Should we have a law that says you can't boycott your  government and that you can't boycott your government's policy? To me,  that is a real danger.   I have an amendment to this overall bill that would simply say that  we remove any kind of affirmation of anti-boycotting legislation, that  boycotting or protesting is something so fundamentally American, so  fundamentally associated with the First Amendment that even if we don't  like what you are boycotting, even if we don't like what you are  saying, that in America we allow that to happen because that is what  freedom of speech is about.   Freedom of speech is not about the easy stuff. It is not about the  language you like. It is not about saying ``Oh, if you are a Republican  and everybody is saying Republican things, that is fine, but we are not  going to hear from Democrats,'' or if you are a Democrat, it is not  about saying ``Well, the First Amendment is fine for Democrats, but we  don't want to hear from those Republicans.'' It is about speech,  whether you like it or not. Boycotting is speech.   I went to a Baptist college. I remember when I was in college that  the Baptist women of the Southwest Baptist Convention didn't like  pornography being out in front at the store where kids could view it.  Do you know what they did? They marched. They didn't hurt anybody. They  didn't commit violence. They did nonviolent protests by marching in  front of the utility stores until--guess what--because of the economic  boycott and the bad press, the people put the pornographic magazines  behind the counter, and only adults were allowed to buy them and look  at them. That is from a boycott.   We boycotted English tea to found a country.   Does anybody remember the boycotts in Montgomery? Rosa Parks didn't  like the fact that she was being separated and told to sit in the back  of the bus, so African Americans from around the country but definitely  across Alabama  [[Page S829]]  and Montgomery boycotted the bus system.   Are we here to say that we are going to forbid boycotting, that you  can't do business with the government? Here is the problem. People say:  Oh, it is a privilege to do business with the government. What if you  are a physician and half of your business is with the government? What  if you are a nurse? Half of the healthcare in our country is paid for  by the government. What if you are a teacher and you work in the public  schools? Are we going to ask all of these people to take a litmus test  that they are not going to boycott or protest against their  government's policy? What kind of country would we live in? Yet it is  groupthink around here. Everybody is so paranoid and saying: Oh, we  can't object to this lobby. Because this lobby is so powerful, we can't  object to them.   Look, it isn't about the ideas; it is about the freedom of speech.   I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be put forward, which is a  germane amendment.   Listen to what you will hear here. There is going to be an objection.  They are not going to let me vote on this. So not only are they going  to ban boycotting, they are banning the idea that, in the Senate, we  would vote on whether we would allow boycotting in our country.   My amendment is to take out the language that supports banning  boycotts and reaffirms the First Amendment. It will be denied because  nobody wants to vote on this. Nobody wants to have a debate over the  First Amendment.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending  amendment and call up my germane amendment that has everything to do  with the bill, amendment No. 102.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 20 seconds.    I think this is an important debate, and time will tell.  This will go to the Supreme Court, and I expect the Supreme Court will  rebuke this body for not carefully considering the First Amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 96
