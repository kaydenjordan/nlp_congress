 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native  Plant Species Pilot Program Act. I am pleased to be partnering with  Senator Cantwell on this initiative. Our bipartisan bill would create a  new pilot program at the National Park Service to support the use of  native plants, and would direct the Park Service to review existing  data and study the cost-effectiveness of using native plants.   Native plants are species found naturally in regions and can add  beauty and value to our National Park System. Benefits range from using  less water and pesticides, purifying the air, and recharging  groundwater in wetlands. By using native species, the Park Service can  also improve habitat for wildlife and restore important species of  birds and butterflies to their natural environment.   In Acadia National Park, native plants are an important part of the  ongoing conservation efforts undertaken by Superintendent Kevin  Schneider and all those who work to encourage the use of native plants.  Acadia National Park protects more than 900 plant species, including  some that are globally, nationally, and locally rare.   Acadia is home to the vibrant rhodoras that flower along wetland  edges in the spring and stunning wood lilies that bloom on the mountain  tops  [[Page S1028]]  in August, helping to attract the more than 3.5 million visitors a year  to the seventh most-visited national park in the United States. The  Wild Gardens of Acadia, located at Sieur de Monts, are a collection of  more than 400 native plants maintained almost exclusively by park  volunteers and represent the natural plant communities found within  Acadia National Park. This partnership project with Friends of Acadia  allows visitors to easily step through the park's myriad habitats and  learn about the splendor of Acadia's native plant species. The Wild  Gardens celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2021.   Native plants, however, face many threats, such as non-native pests,  non-native plants, diseases, and a changing climate. Today, almost one  quarter of Acadia National Park's species are non-native to the park.  The red spruce, iconic to Acadia, is projected to lose a substantial  amount of its habitat in coming decades because of climate change. In  addition, invasive pests, such as the Emerald Ash Borer and the hemlock  woolly adelgid are affecting northern forests and have expanded into  Maine. Hemlock woolly adelgid recently infested hemlock trees just  outside of the park on Mount Desert Island.   Our bipartisan bill has earned endorsements from the Garden Club of  America, Friends of Acadia, Scenic America, and the Native Plant Center  at Westchester Community College. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation to help protect the natural landscapes at our national  parks for years to come.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Rounds):   S. 569. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer  certain National Forest System land to the State of South Dakota, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
