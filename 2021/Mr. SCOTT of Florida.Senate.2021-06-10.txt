 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  the heroic actions of 7-year-old Chase Poust, of Jacksonville, FL, and  thank the brave first responders with the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue  Department, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, and Florida Fish and  Wildlife Conservation Commission whose actions saved Chase's dad,  Steven, and 4-year-old sister, Abigail.   On May 28, 2021, Steven, Chase, and Abigail were boating and swimming  on the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, FL, when the current pulled 4- year-old Abigail away, causing her to lose grip from the boat. Her  father, Steven, jumped in to try to bring her back to safety. At the  direction of his dad, Chase swam to get to the shore to find  [[Page S4042]]  help, swimming through the river for over an hour.   Within that hour, Steven and Abigail had drifted nearly 2 miles away  from the boat, according to Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department;  and other agencies, including the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office and the  Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, were called in to  expand the search. Thanks to Chase and Jacksonville's brave first  responders, Steven and Abigail were successfully rescued and a terrible  tragedy was prevented.   Chase's strength and bravery is a reminder that heroes come in all  ages and sizes. I applaud the lifesaving actions of the Jacksonville  Fire and Rescue Department, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, the  Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and most of all,  Chase, who showed remarkable grit and determination to save his dad and  sister.                            ____________________
