 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the so-called Protecting  Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act.   Mr. Chair, this is a misnomer. A misnomer is defined as a wrong or  inaccurate name or designation. That is what the title of this bill is.  It is wrong.   I join my colleagues on the Republican side in supporting protections  for people with preexisting conditions. In fact, it was one of the  first votes in Congress that we took this year, and it was defeated by  my colleagues across the aisle.   This bill, which is ironically, as I say, misnamed because it doesn't  protect preexisting conditions, would take steps to roll back State  efforts to innovate and lower premiums for Americans across the  country.   One issue I often hear about from my constituents is the cost of  healthcare coverage and the lack of options available under ObamaCare.  These waivers would allow for new strategies to address the high  premiums that so many people are facing.   In fact, of the States that created their own reinsurance programs,  they saw, on average, a nearly 20 percent drop in premiums, one State  seeing a drop as high as 43.4 percent.   As States continue to grapple with high insurance costs, they have  looked to these innovative waivers for opportunities to bring about new  ideas that help people, not remove options and opportunities.   We all know that there is an issue with affordability of insurance in  many areas. It should be known that this isn't as though it is just  more conservative States moving forward with these reinsurance  programs. States like New Jersey, where the chairman is from, and  Minnesota and Maryland have seen the benefits of this.   Mr. Chair, that is why I urge my colleagues to give States the  flexibility they need to reduce premiums and to vote ``no'' on this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Guyton United Methodist Church Men's Bible Class on the 63rd  anniversary of its Fifth Sunday Morning Breakfast. Occurring on each  fifth Sunday of the month, the morning breakfast has become an  institution in Effingham County since 1956.   The Bible class sends invitations across Effingham County and  neighboring counties, and nearly everyone there knows about the  breakfast. By inviting guest speakers from a number of different civic  organizations, the breakfast is a unique opportunity for the citizens  and religious community in Effingham County to engage directly in  government and other types of public issues.   Just recently, the Fifth Sunday Morning Breakfast hosted a guest  speaker discussing his time deployed as a member of the U.S. Army  Reserves in Bosnia and Afghanistan, as well as his service in the New  York State Police Department.   I want to thank the Guyton United Methodist Church Men's Bible Class  for engaging all the citizens of Effingham County, and I am proud to  have an organization like this in the First Congressional District of  Georgia. Congratulations on their 63rd anniversary.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject matter of  my Special Order tonight.    Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the time  tonight to talk about a very important subject. As many Members know,  currently, I am the only pharmacist serving in Congress, and that is  something I take very seriously.   Two of the things that I really wanted to concentrate on when I  became a Member of Congress, among many things, but two of the main  things were, first of all, prescription drug pricing--that is one of  the things that we want to talk about here tonight--and the other thing  that I wanted to concentrate on was the opioid epidemic. We have been  very successful here in Congress in addressing that issue.   Tonight I want to talk about prescription drug pricing because I have  witnessed it. I have witnessed what I would describe as truly a crisis.   After 30 years of practicing pharmacy, I have seen families struggle  to pay for their medications. I have seen senior citizens at the  counter across from me try to make a decision between buying medication  and buying groceries. I have seen mothers literally in tears because  they couldn't afford the medication for their children.   When I came up to Washington, that was one of the things I wanted to  concentrate on. We are very fortunate we have a President and  administration who are focused on this issue as well and have done some  outstanding things. Two of those things that are being proposed by the  administration right now I want to talk about tonight, but the main  thing I want to talk about is the prescription drug chain.   Just earlier today, we had a hearing in the Energy and Commerce  Committee, in the Health Subcommittee that I serve on, where we had  representatives from the pharmaceutical manufacturers and from the  PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers, pointing fingers at each other and  blaming each other for the problem.                                time  1900    I have to tell you, in full disclosure, I am a big fan of the  pharmaceutical manufacturers. What I have seen over my years of  pharmacy practice has been nothing short of phenomenal.   When I first started practicing pharmacy in the early 1980s, I can  remember a time when, if you needed an antibiotic, you had to take 40  tetracycline. You had to take four a day for 10 days. Now you can take  an antibiotic or get a shot in one day and be cured of some of the  things that we were treating back there in 1980 with a 10-day supply.   I have seen illnesses such as hepatitis C--and hepatitis C, when I  first started practicing pharmacy, was pretty much a death warrant. If  you were diagnosed with hepatitis C, you were probably going to die.   Through the research and development of the pharmaceutical  manufacturers, I have seen them come up with medication so that we can  now treat hepatitis C. That is phenomenal. We can cure it with a pill,  and it is because of the research and development that has been done  through our pharmaceutical manufacturers and through the National  Institutes of Health that we have reached this point.   However, the price of those medications, in many cases, makes it  inaccessible for people. If you have to pay $85,000 for a medication to  treat hepatitis C, for many people, that is just simply not accessible.  If that medication is not accessible, it does you no good whatsoever.   I have called on the pharmaceutical manufacturers to do their part as  well. They are not without responsibility here, and I think they  understand that.   Tonight, what I want to concentrate on are the PBMs, the pharmacy  benefit managers, the middlemen, if you will. If you look at their  mission statement, they will tell you their mission is to lower drug  costs.   My questions to you would be: How is that working out? If that is  working out, if they are achieving their mission, why are we here? Why  are we here tonight talking about this, the high prescription drug  costs?   I submit to you that they bring no value whatsoever to the healthcare  system.   Madam Speaker, I am very blessed tonight to have a number of speakers  here with us to share their expertise, and I want to hear from some of  them right now.   I want to begin with the gentleman from Kansas, Representative Roger  Marshall, who also is a physician, was a hospital administrator, and  knows and understands this system.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  keen insight on this subject. It is very important, and I appreciate  his expertise.   Madam Speaker, what the gentleman from Kansas was speaking about are  two proposals that are before CMS right now.   One proposal would do away with DIR fees. Now, let's make sure we  understand that DIR stands for direct and indirect remuneration. This  is when the PBMs go back months later--in some cases, years later--and  recoup, or claw back, reimbursements for what they have already sent to  the pharmacies.   You can imagine what kind of impact this would have on a business.  There is  [[Page H3659]]  no sustainable business model out there that can absorb that.   I get texts all the time from small pharmacy chains that are telling  me: I just got a bill from the PBM. Last year, my total DIR fees were  $500,000, a half million dollars.    That is money they have already paid taxes on, but they are clawing  it back. They are taking it back.   CMS has proposed that that end. I am in support of that, and I  appreciate CMS doing this.   The other proposed rule that CMS has come out with has to do with the  rebates, or discounts, if you will, that are offered to the PBMs by the  pharmaceutical manufacturers--not offered to them, but the PBMs demand  them from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. What CMS is proposing is  that all of those rebates, or discounts, if you will, be given at the  point of sale.   What we are trying to achieve here is to make sure that those  rebates, that those discounts, are going where they are supposed to be  going, and that is to the patients.   Keep in mind, everything we are talking about here is about the  patient. We are talking about patient care.   My next guest speaker is also an expert in healthcare. In fact, he is  another one of the members of our Doctors Caucus, a urologist from  Florida, Representative Neal Dunn, who, again, has practiced in the  healthcare field and who has seen this with his patients.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Dunn for his keen  insight on this very important subject and for his comments.   Madam Speaker, I have a couple other comments about PBMs.   As I mentioned earlier, if you look at their website, if you look at  what their mission statement is, it says that they are there to lower  drug costs. Well, that is not working out very well.   Let me say this: I am not opposed to anybody making money. I get it.  That is capitalism, and that is fine.   But three PBMs control 80 percent of the market--80 percent of the  market. Three companies control that, three PBMs. The largest PBM, in  2016, had gross revenues that exceeded that of Ford Motor Company,  Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, and McDonald's added together.   Again, I am not opposed to anybody making money, but tell me how a  company can make more than Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, McDonald's, and Ford  Motor Company combined.   To make matters even worse, those companies are worldwide. This PBM  is just domestic. They are just here in America.   Again, I am not opposed to anybody making money, but tell me the  value they are bringing to the system. They are not bringing any value  to the system.   That is why I am in support of what CMS is proposing: doing away with  the DIR fees; making sure that the rebates, the discounts, if you will,  are given at the point of sale; and increasing transparency.   Madam Speaker, the next speaker is a good friend, a member of the  Georgia delegation, Congressman Rick Allen from Augusta. Rick is a  businessman, a very successful businessman. He understands the  challenges in business. Certainly, healthcare costs, I am sure, were  challenges for him.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments, and I certainly appreciate his leadership here in the House.   Madam Speaker, as you heard earlier from one of our speakers, CMS  estimates that this change alone, doing away with the DIR fees--putting  the discounts, the rebates, if you will, at the point of sale--will  benefit the consumer, benefit the patient, and could save patients $7.1  to $9.2 billion.                                time  1915    Now, let me tell you, that is significant. That is significant for  those senior citizens that I was talking about earlier who are trying  to make a decision between buying medicine and buying groceries. That  is significant to that mother who is trying to buy the medication for  her child. Those savings will help. Transparency will help.   The savings are going to go much further than just this estimated  seven to $9 billion, because as we get better transparency we will get  lower drug prices. I am convinced of that.   Madam Speaker, my next speaker is a gentleman who certainly  understands this issue and has worked closely on it. He has been a  champion on this issue. Representative Austin Scott, from Georgia, has  gone to great lengths to study this issue. He has met with small  pharmacies in his district. He has discussed with them the problem, and  he understands it; and we are very, very fortunate to have him and his  input.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin  Scott).  [[Page H3660]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments, and I thank him for his work. He truly has been a champion  for his constituents.   His father is a doctor and, certainly, he understands healthcare. As  he mentioned, he was an insurance broker, he understands insurance. And  a lot of what we talk about here is insurance.   Let me try to articulate, if you will, exactly what I am talking  about here. Some of the folks back home who are watching may be  thinking, well, I don't really understand why the pharmaceutical  manufacturers have to go through the PBMs.   What happens is that insurance companies work on formularies. In  other words, they say, if you have got this disease, or if you have got  this health problem, these are the drugs that we are going to cover.   The pharmaceutical manufacturer, in order to get their drug on that  formulary, has to go to the PBM, the middleman, and has to offer them  discounts, rebates, if you will, in order to get their product on that  formulary.   That is what we are talking about. That is where they have the  pharmaceutical manufacturers by the short hairs, if you will. That is  where they really put the pressure on. So that is really what we are  talking about.   Look, again, as I have said before, I am not opposed to anybody  making money, but show me the value.   I mentioned a hearing that we had earlier today in the Health  Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I mentioned that we  had some PBMs there. We had two PBMs there. One is one of the major  PBMs that requires the pharmaceutical manufacturers to give them  rebates in order to have their products listed on the formulary.   And then another PBM was there, and they are just a flat fee. In  other words, they just charge an administrative fee. That is all they  charge. Again, PBMs, that is the way they evolved. All they were to  begin with, when they started way back when, were just simply  processors.   But enough about what we have done here in Washington. Let's talk for  just a minute about State legislators and what State legislative  actions have been taken.   Let me clarify and let me point out that I am not talking about just  red States. I am not talking about just blue States. I am not talking  about big States. I am not talking about small States. I am talking  about all States, all the States in our union;   I am talking about States like Ohio. Ohio's Department of Medicaid  published a report in January detailing exactly how PBMs have been  gaming the system; that's right; in Ohio.   Ohio found that CVS--CVS is Caremark--that they had been using their  role as the PBM for their State Medicaid program to pay CVS pharmacies  as much as 46 percent more than competing pharmacies.   Now, this is something else we need to talk about. We need to talk  about  [[Page H3661]]  what is referred to as vertical integration. That is, right now, where  the insurance company owns the PBM and owns the pharmacy.   The top three that I mentioned earlier that control 80 percent of the  market, that is the case with all of them. CVS is the pharmacy.  Caremark is the PBM. Aetna is the insurance company.   Now, when we were talking to the PBMs today in the committee, we  would ask them, what are you doing with these discounts? What are you  doing with these rebates that you get? And they would tell us, well, we  give them back to the plan sponsors, and the plan sponsors decrease  premiums.   Anybody seen their premium decreasing recently? I don't think I have.   But think about it for a moment. If the insurance company owns the  PBM, and owns the pharmacy, if the PBM is going to give it back to the  insurance company, isn't that just taking money out of one pocket and  putting it in the other pocket?   I mean, if CVS--if Caremark is going to give back the money that they  are saving in the third party with the PBMs to the insurance company,  Aetna, that they also own--and they are not the only one.   What about Express Scripts? Express Scripts just recently bought  Cigna. So you have got Cigna as the insurance company. You have got  Express Scripts as the PBM. And, oh, by the way, Express Scripts has  their own mail order pharmacy and in terms of volume, they are the  third largest in America. So, again, we have the situation there.   Same thing goes with United, UnitedHealthcare owns Optum, and they  have their own mail order pharmacy.   So, there you have the three top PBMs, controlling 80 percent of the  market; that also have their own insurance company, and they also have  their own pharmacy.   This is what happened in Ohio. Ohio discovered that Caremark, that  third party, the PBM, was paying their pharmacy, CVS, 46 percent more  than they were paying competing pharmacies. That is an example of where  they were taking money out of one pocket and putting it in another  pocket.   What about New York State? Their State Medicaid reported that PBMs  were pocketing a 32 percent markup on generic drugs; 32 percent markup  on generic drugs; the drugs patients traditionally rely on to be more  affordable than their branded alternatives. But New York caught them  red-handed.   I can go on and name State after State. The State of Arkansas called  a special session to address the situation with PBMs.    Just yesterday, my home State of Georgia, the Governor signed into  legislation two bills dealing with PBMs; one of them that would  prohibit PBMs from steering their patients to their own pharmacies and  steering them away from other pharmacies, independent pharmacies.   So this is just not the Federal Government acting on these issues. We  have had States who have acted on these issues as well.   So let's talk about a couple of other things that we have done in  Congress. One thing that I want to mention, because I thought it was  such an egregious thing that the PBMs were doing in the past--we,  thankfully, were able to address this--was called the gag clause.   Thankfully, we had legislation that I was honored to sponsor here in  the House that was passed in the House, passed in the Senate, signed  into law by the President. It addressed the gag clause.   What is a gag clause?   You want to talk about the audacity of the PBMs? Let me tell you  about the audacity of the PBMs.   As I mentioned earlier, about the pharmaceutical manufacturers being  under pressure to give the PBMs discounts, rebates, if you will, in  order to get their drugs on the formularies; well, independent  pharmacies are the same way. They are under pressure.   What the PBMs did is they told--they had a clause in their contract  with the pharmacy, and it said that if a drug is cheaper if you buy it  out of pocket, if you pay for it out of pocket, if you buy it for cash  than the copay, you cannot tell the patient that.                                time  1930    And if you do tell the patient that, then you run the risk of being  kicked out of the network. Well, the reality is you can't afford to be  kicked out of the network. If you lose thousands of bodies because that  PBM controls that network, then you are out of business.   So pharmacies had no other choice. Patients were paying more with  their copay than what they would have paid for it if they would have  simply paid out of pocket, just simply paid cash. We did away with  that.   Thank you, Mr. President, for signing that legislation.   We addressed that in Congress. We said, no, that is not going to  happen anymore. Now pharmacists can do what they were trained to do,  and that is take care of their patients and tell them, Look, if you pay  for this, you can buy it for $4 and you don't have to pay a $20 copay.   You say, Well, how often did that happen?   Well, let me give you just one example that happened in our  committee, in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We actually had one of  our Members who was the primary caregiver for her husband, who was very  ill at the time. We had been talking about the gag clause, so she knew  about it. She knew that pharmacists weren't allowed to offer that  information.   So she went into the pharmacy, and she was told that her husband's  medication, no exaggeration, was going to be $600. She knew to ask the  pharmacist. She said, What if I just pay for it out of pocket? What if  I just pay you cash? How much will it be?   $40. $40.   Now, granted, this is an extreme example, but it is an example.   Thank goodness we did away with that. I thank the Senate for passing  this. I thank the House for passing it. I especially thank the  President for signing this into law.   Madam Speaker, this is a real problem.   I want to conclude by saying that what we are trying to do here is to  bring about transparency. Just show us what is happening. That is all  we are asking for.   I want to applaud the administration. I want to thank President  Donald J. Trump for bringing this issue to light. This has been an  issue that he has worked on.   This is a nonpartisan issue. I never in my years of practicing  pharmacy asked someone, Are you a Republican or a Democrat? That  doesn't matter. This impacts everyone.   I thank the President for his leadership on this and I thank the  administration for these two proposed rules: doing away with DIR fees,  making the rebates at the point of sale, so that they will truly go to  the patient.   These two rules that are being proposed by CMS will help get us to a  point where we will have more transparency. That is what we need.   Folks, this is a serious subject, a very serious subject. I have  witnessed it firsthand, witnessed it in my practice of pharmacy for  over 30 years. It is horrible when you see someone suffering who can't  afford a medication.   I call on the pharmaceutical manufacturers to do their part. They  have got to do a better job with their pricing. They are not without  responsibility here, and I think they understand that.   But, Madam Speaker, we have got to have these two rule proposals  passed, and I encourage CMS to follow through on this, do away with DIR  fees, put the rebates at the point of sale. This will bring about  transparency.   I thank the administration for their support. I thank those who spoke  here tonight.   Madam Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity to bring to  light this extremely important subject.   Madam Speaker, I yield back.                            ____________________
