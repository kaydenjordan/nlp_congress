 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome  Alzheimer's ambassadors to Washington, D.C., for the Alzheimer's Impact  Movement Advocacy Forum.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States,  and it has reached crisis proportions. There is no effective treatment,  no means of prevention, and no method for slowing the progression of  the disease. Sadly, one in three seniors will die with the disease.   But this week, more than 1,000 advocates from across the country will  gather for the 3-day event to help advance policies to improve the  lives of all individuals affected by dementia.   Alzheimer's has a devastating impact upon those who are diagnosed  with the disease, their caregivers, and their loved ones. More than 60  million Americans provide unpaid care to family and friends living with  Alzheimer's and other dementias.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to meeting with Alzheimer's ambassadors  from my district this week. I admire their advocacy and commitment to  raising awareness about Alzheimer's disease and their determination to  never stop searching for a cure.                            ____________________
