 Mr. Speaker, due to bad weather that did not allow for  me to arrive in Washington, DC, in time, I was unavoidably detained.  Had I been in attendance, I would have voted ``yes'' on:   H.R. 423--Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017.   H.R. 582--Kari's Law Act of 2017.  [[Page H593]]                                ____________________     I thank the Congresswoman, my colleague, for her  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus, the conscience of the  Congress, stands strong to promote unity and fight against divisive  rhetoric.   Trump's inaugural speech included a lot of pledges and promises:  pledges of ``allegiance to all Americans,'' promises to the American  people, saying, ``I will never let you down.''   He even quoted the Bible, saying: ``. . . how good and pleasant it is  when God's people live together in unity.''   But pledges and promises fall flat when tweets, speeches, and now  actions are followed by reckless executive orders, thoughtless  nominations for our Nation's leaders, and attacks on the American  healthcare system.   The American people were let down when President Trump nominated  unqualified and out-of-touch candidates such as Senator Jeff Sessions,  Betsy DeVos, and Tom Price.   How can you pledge allegiance to all Americans while threatening to  leave so many without options and access to healthcare coverage? This  is not unity. It is hypocrisy. We need to focus on facts and not  ``alternative facts.''   I have a question: Do we have a replacement for the Affordable Care  Act? Is it a fact that a repeal without a replacement will leave over  30 million people uninsured? Yes, that is a fact.   Is it a fact that Betsy DeVos, if confirmed, will be the first  Secretary of Education without any prior experience in public schools,  including early childhood education and higher education?   Is it a fact that Jeff Sessions has been nominated as the Attorney  General but was denied Federal judgeship over accusations of racism?   I support efforts that will bring more jobs to the American people. I  fully support efforts to improve our country's transportation and  infrastructure. But only time will tell if President Trump will follow  through with the promises he has made to the American people on  inauguration day. Only time will tell if he will continue to act,  speak, and tweet in a manner that builds walls and not bridges.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus intends to be a voice to  create bridges and work toward real solutions to the real challenges  that face African Americans, minorities, and the unheard and  disenfranchised. We will be watching, and we will be listening. We will  continue to fight for equality, liberty, and justice for all.
