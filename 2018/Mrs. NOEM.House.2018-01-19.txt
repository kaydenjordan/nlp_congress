 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   The whole experience of being a first-time parent can be really  overwhelming. I remember feeling this incredible sense of joy. But  there are always so many questions, too. How are we going to provide  for this baby? What kind of person will they become? What if something  goes wrong?   There is no doubt a lot of things can go wrong in a pregnancy, but we  find comfort in the fact that there is a whole team of healthcare  professionals there who will do everything that they can to care for  that baby or to save that baby, if necessary.   But what if they didn't?   What if they stepped back and refused to deliver care to your child?   It would be unacceptable.   Yet when a baby is born alive after a failed abortion, that same  healthcare professional may not deliver the lifesaving care that that  baby deserves.   Melissa Ohden from Sioux City, Iowa, was born alive after an abortion  attempt. By God's grace and the work of an incredible nurse, Melissa  survived. As she tells it, there were demands made to leave her there  to die in the hospital room that day. She says that ultimately a nurse  rushed her off to the NICU because, in the nurse's words, ``Melissa  just kept gasping for breath.'' That nurse wasn't going to leave her  there to die.    Madam Speaker, every life has dignity and every life deserves  respect. We ultimately need to ban abortion and protect life from the  moment of conception. But until that is done, we must fight to protect  every single precious little life that we can. The Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act will do that and help us be successful in that  mission.   With that, I urge my colleagues to support it.
