 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, a few years ago, a police officer in  Pueblo, CO, was kind enough to let me join him in a squad car for a few  hours to get a sense of what his daily beat was like. It was in the  middle of the night. It didn't take very long to appreciate that our  country asks law enforcement to do a lot more than simply enforce the  law.   Washington has underinvested in the American people year after year  after year in areas like housing, education, and mental health. It has  left law enforcement to pick up the pieces. It has put them in a  position wherein they are not only having to serve as law enforcement  officers but also as social workers, as mental health professionals,  and as responders for issues like homelessness or drug addiction, even  though nobody has trained them for it necessarily.   That result has been really tough for officers on the ground in  Colorado and across the country. It strains their resources, adds to  the workload, and accelerates burnout. It has also been hard for  communities. It diverts law enforcement from violent crime, and it  means we are forcing officers to address mental health issues and  problems instead of dealing with the underlying issues that produce  many 9-1-1 calls in the first place.   I am sad to say that all of these underlying issues that everybody is  familiar with have gotten worse during the pandemic. It is one reason  there has been a spike in crime that started in 2020, before the  current administration, and it has continued ever since. In 2020,  murders rose nearly 30 percent. Aggravated assault was up 12 percent.  Motor vehicle theft was up 12 percent. Again, this was in 2020, before  the current administration, but, sadly, many of these trends have  continued. In a survey of small businesses, 54 percent of American  small businesses reported an increase in shoplifting last year.   To deal with this rise in crime, we need to increase funding for the  COPS Program, which I strongly support, so we can hire more officers  and strengthen community police. I think we should pass a bill that I  am introducing today, called the SMART Community Policing Act. The bill  is based on 28 highly successful programs across Colorado, in places  like Denver and Grand Junction.   As I mentioned, you know, a lot of 9-1-1 calls involve lower risk  situations that don't always require a police officer, but some  combination of an EMT, a mental health specialist, or a social worker  can get the job done, allowing law enforcement to focus on violent  crime, but in most of the country, law enforcement has to answer every  one of those 9-1-1 calls.   The SMART Community Policing Act creates resources for law  enforcement to partner with local organizations and service providers  so they send the right responder depending on what the problem actually  is. That lets law enforcement focus on violent crime and lets other  responders with the right training deal with lower risk situations,  like when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis or a severe  drug withdrawal. These trained professionals can deescalate the  situation. They can connect people with the right resources and do the  comprehensive followup to keep them from requiring emergency services  again and again and again.   Grand Junction's Co-Responder Unit has answered over 3,200 calls  since the program began in 2018. Denver's STAR Program has responded to  almost 4,600 calls since 2020.   I had a chance to hear about the STAR Program from Denver's police  chief, Paul Pazen, 2 years ago. He told me about a mom who had called  9-1-1 because she was having a lot of trouble with her child. You don't  need a police  [[Page S3273]]  officer for that, so they sent responders from STAR, who deescalated  the situation and saved law enforcement precious time.   If you add it all up, those are thousands of hours that officers in  Denver and Grand Junction and across Colorado could spend focusing on  violent crime instead of on issues that other people might have greater  expertise to deal with, people with the right training in nonviolent  situations. It allows us to reduce the strain on the system.   None of this is speculation. When Stanford University studied  Denver's program, they found that in neighborhoods patrolled by STAR,  reports of less serious crimes dropped by more than a third and that  the program saved a lot of money, a ton of money. It cost about $150  when STAR responded to an offense compared to nearly $650 when the  Denver PD responded on their own.   I can appreciate what these savings would mean for a local police  department. My colleagues may remember that before I was in the Senate,  one of my jobs was serving as chief of staff to John Hickenlooper, who  was then the mayor of Denver. I don't know what became of him, but he  was a very good mayor for the city and county of Denver. In that job, I  heard all the time from community leaders as to how they wished there  were resources beyond law enforcement for situations that were better  suited for a social worker or a mental health expert.   I would have loved to have had the STAR Program when I was working  for the city and county of Denver, and I would have loved it when I was  the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, where a lot of my job  was working with the Denver Police Department to keep our schools safe  and to reduce the ticketing of kids so they weren't cycling through the  criminal justice system prematurely.   All of this experience led me to write this bill, and I view this as  one more area wherein Colorado offers a model for the country to take  on the rise in crime in a smart and thoughtful way.   Americans have a reasonable expectation--a reasonable expectation-- that Washington cares as much about their safety as they do, and they  expect the people they send to Washington to actually come up with  useful solutions. I think this bill meets that test. It responds to the  needs of law enforcement and to the needs of communities. I don't know  how anybody here could object to it.   If you want to reduce violent crime, you should support this bill. If  you want trained experts responding to nonviolent 9-1-1 calls instead  of police officers, you should support this bill. If you want to save  taxpayers money, you should support this bill. So I hope my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle will take a look at this proposal, and I  gladly welcome their support.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal):   S. 4520. A bill to establish the Food Safety Administration to  protect the public health by ensuring the safety of food, preventing  foodborne illness, maintaining safety reviews and reassessments of food  additives, enforcing pesticide residue tolerances, improving the  surveillance of foodborne pathogens, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
