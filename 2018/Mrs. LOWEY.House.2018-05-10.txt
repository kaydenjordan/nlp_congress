 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider) for working with me on this very important amendment.   Indian Point Energy Center, in my district, is scheduled to cease  operations in 2021. When the plant closes, the village of Buchanan will  be left with a large amount of stranded nuclear waste on site.    This amendment would help Buchanan and the town of Cortlandt access  vital resources for economic redevelopment. Until the Department of  Energy takes title to nuclear waste and removes it from our  communities, the Federal Government must do all it can to support these  de facto interim storage sites.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment.
