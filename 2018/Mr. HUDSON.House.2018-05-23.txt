 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of All American Week,  the annual celebration of the 82nd Airborne Division's mission and the  paratroopers who serve to uphold it.   Based in my district at Fort Bragg--the epicenter of the universe-- the 82nd Airborne Division is our Nation's Global Response Force. These  rapid reaction forces can mobilize, load, and deploy at a moment's  notice. It is truly incredible.   There is ready, and then there is Airborne ready. As the old saying  goes: When the President dials 911, the phone rings at Fort Bragg.   Since its inception, the 82nd Airborne has, time and again, answered  the call of duty when our Nation needs it most.   As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fort Bragg, I am so proud of  the 82nd Airborne's legacy, of our paratroopers, and especially their  families.   As the Airborne spirit takes flight this week, I ask my fellow  Americans to join me in praying for our servicemembers who are  currently deployed and for their families. These heroes put country  before self, and we are so grateful. God bless you. Airborne, all the  way.                            ____________________
