 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on Friday,  June 15, 2018, due to changes in the floor vote calendar.   If I had been able to vote, I would have voted as follows:   On the Thornberry Amendment to H.R. 2851, the Importation and  Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Act, I would have voted ``nay.''   On final passage of H.R. 2851, I would have voted ``nay.''                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
