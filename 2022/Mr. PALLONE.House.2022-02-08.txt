 Madam Speaker, let me thank Chairwoman Maloney. She has  worked hard on this and has constantly been telling us for months and  years how important this was and we had to get it done. So  congratulations. The day has arrived.                                time  1445    The U.S. Postal Service, Madam Speaker, is one of the oldest and most  essential American institutions. Unfortunately, it has struggled  financially for many years. That is why this comprehensive, bipartisan  legislation is important, because it will address the financial  challenges facing the Postal Service.   A report last year by the GAO found that, since 2007, Postal Service  expenses have grown faster than revenues, in part due to the cost of  benefits, including retiree expenses.  [[Page H1043]]    The Energy and Commerce Committee has worked closely with the  Oversight and Reform Committee to craft healthcare provisions in the  Postal Service Reform Act that both protect the benefits of retirees  and put the Postal Service on a better financial footing.   Under the bill, current Postal Service retirees will be able to keep  their retirement health plans provided by the Postal Service and will  not be required to enroll in Medicare. However, the legislation creates  a one-time special enrollment period for Postal Service retirees who  are eligible for Medicare to enroll in Medicare part B if they so  choose.   Postal Service retirees who enroll in Medicare part B through this  special enrollment period would not pay late enrollment penalties on  their part B premium. Instead, the Postal Service would pay any late  enrollment penalties on behalf of the individual.   Arrangements like this exist today for certain State and local  government employees. The new special enrollment period will make it  easier and more affordable for current Postal Service retirees to  enroll in Medicare's comprehensive health coverage, and the majority of  Postal Service retirees already choose to take advantage of their  Medicare benefits.   H.R. 3076 would also require future Postal Service retirees to enroll  in Medicare when they become eligible in order to qualify for the  Postal Service's retiree health plan. This would mean that future  Postal Service retirees who are eligible for Medicare would have  Medicare as their primary insurer but also have their Postal Service  health plan filling any gaps in Medicare coverage. This is a common way  to provide retiree insurance in the private sector.   Overall, I believe this bill will improve the financial health of the  Postal Service, and it will allow the Postal Service to continue  providing critical services to the Nation and health benefits to its  employees and retirees.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank everyone, particularly Chairwoman  Maloney, for their involvement in this effort, and I urge support for  the bill.
