 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my first order of business is to thank  both Judge Carter and Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz for their  leadership and, as well, for their shepherding this bill that is based  and focused on help for our veterans.   This past month and coming into the Fourth of July and Veterans Day  in November may be just one or two or three of the times that we  acknowledge those who have fallen as well as our veterans, but it  really is a responsibility of this country and this Congress to  acknowledge and work on behalf of our veterans every single day.   I hold up a picture of and will include in the Record an article  about Army Veteran Vivian Unce, Navy veteran Victoria Lewis, and Navy  veteran Veronica Vernon. They met each other in a homeless shelter.  They have come to know each other, and I would say to Mr. Chairman  there are homeless veterans every night across this country.                           [Wed., July 20, 2011]    Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center--Houston, Texas Grant Provides        More Than $666K for Permanent Housing for Homeless Veterans         Houston.--The Department of Veterans Affairs has announced       the award of $666,765 to the Harris County Housing Authority       to increase permanent housing and case management for area       Veterans.        ``This initiative will strengthen our ongoing efforts to       eliminate Veteran homelessness and improve quality of life       for Veterans,'' said Adam C. Walmus, M.H.A., M.A.,       F.A.C.H.E., director of the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical       Center. ``Working with our partners at HUD, we continue to       make good progress to reduce Veteran homelessness, though       much work remains. VA is committed to providing Veterans and       their families with access to affordable housing and medical       services that will help them get back on their feet.''        The funding, from Housing and Urban Development's Veterans       Affairs Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH), is a       coordinated effort by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to       provide permanent housing for homeless Veterans.        Homeless Veterans are referred to the Harris County Housing       Authority for ``Housing Choice'' Section 8 vouchers to assist       with rent payment. With this latest grant, the Harris County       Housing Authority will receive 125 additional housing       vouchers.        Eligible homeless Veterans receive VA-provided case       management, and services to support stability and recovery       from physical and mental health, substance use, and       functional concerns contributing to or resulting from       homelessness.        Veterans participating in the HUD-VASH program rent       privately owned housing and generally contribute no more than       30 percent of their income toward rent. VA offers eligible       homeless Veterans clinical and supportive services through       the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center.        About one-third of the adult homeless population has served       their country in the Armed Services.        Current population estimates suggest that about 107,000       Veterans (male and female) are homeless on any given night       and perhaps twice as many experience homelessness at some       point during the course of a year.        Many other Veterans are considered near homeless or at risk       because of their poverty, lack of support from family and       friends, and dismal living conditions in cheap hotels or in       overcrowded or substandard housing.        If you know a Veteran who needs assistance, please call 1-      877-4AID VET (877-424-3838) or the Health Care for Homeless       Veterans Program at 713-794-7848. More information about VA's       homeless programs is available online at http://www.va.gov/  homeless.     Mr. Chair, my amendment is an amendment to ensure  that we will focus the VA on its obligation to provide our veterans the  assistance needed to avoid homelessness. It will help to ensure the  rate of homelessness among veterans in the United States does not  increase, because I believe in reducing and eliminating homelessness  among veterans. Those who risked their lives to protect our freedom  should also be one of the Nation's highest priorities.   I am grateful that this particular legislation, likewise, recognizes  the importance of dealing with homelessness and working with the VA and  its public housing assistance. That is where these individuals were  able to find housing, through the grant for the permanent housing for  homeless veterans.   It is important to recognize that perhaps twice as many, 200,000,  experience homelessness at some point during the course of the year.  Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans, male  and female, who are homeless on any given night, even though  communities are working very hard.   I know in my hometown of Houston, we work hard to reduce the numbers  of homeless veterans. Many of us work with homeless veterans, attend  what we call stand down, where we provide them with the maximum support  on the street. We want them to get off the street, but we want to bring  the services to them. In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in public  housing provided by the VASH program.   So I want to continue this focus, and this amendment is to suggest  that no matters in this bill, no language in this bill will be in  contravention of our programs that deal with our homeless veterans.   Let me also make the point that Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center  has been involved in changing lives in a mighty way by providing  veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and  medical services that would help to get them back on their feet.   I had the privilege of knowing Dr. Michael E. DeBakey and naming the  hospital after him. His whole value and his whole purpose as he  continued to do magical surgery was to remind us, as he created the  MASH unit in World War II, that our veterans yesterday, today, and  tomorrow should be our priority.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, it is Jackson Lee  Amendment No. 33, which simply provides that:   ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of  Veteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and  Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part  II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code.   This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among  veterans in the United States does not increase.   I thank Subcommittee Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member Wasserman  Schultz for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation  to the floor.   I offer Jackson Lee Amendment No. 33 because I believe reducing and  eliminating homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives  to protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest  priorities.   Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in  the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who  have given so much to us.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 33 will help focus the VA on its obligation  to provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness,  which includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration  Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case-management services,  adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other  areas that contribute to veteran homelessness.   VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program  for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA  [[Page H4991]]  medical Centers provide referrals and case management while Public  Housing Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers.   Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I  believe that we could be doing much more for them.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because  of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal  living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard  housing.   While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among  veterans remains a big challenge.   In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and  2017, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162.   We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on  the uniform and fought for us.   Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very  least we can do.   Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives.   In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided  by VASH.   I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and  within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this  funding has positively impacted many communities across this country.   In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate  the issue of homelessness.   For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been  involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing  Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and  medical services that will help them get back on their feet.   Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 33 and  commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran  homelessness in America.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me again express my appreciation.   As I indicated, there is a very solid and strong stand on this bill  regarding providing for our homeless veterans. It is something that we  contend with in our city of Houston, but we are grateful that the local  officials are very concerned about it.   I want to make sure as we go to conference that our focus will  continue to be on making sure that maybe in our lifetime we extinguish  this concept of homeless veterans and homelessness among veterans by  providing them with a pathway to opportunity and success.   So I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me explain the Jackson Lee  amendment, which makes a modest but important improvement to the bill  by increasing the amount of funding for the supportive services for  veterans' families account by $2 million, offset by a certain amount to  the $4 billion allocated to the VA's information technology systems.   Let me read a story that talks about Liz, who is an Army veteran and  a single mom:         After losing her job, she struggled to pay the rent and       provide for her daughter. Liz's landlord said she had always       been an excellent tenant, but his patience was wearing thin       as her recent rent arrears continued to increase.       Disheartened with a fruitless job search and unsure where       else to turn, Liz came to the Veterans Outreach Center. She       was immediately connected with a case manager, an employment       specialist, and an accredited State benefits counselor, and       the Supportive Services for Veteran Families team.    I include in the Record an article about Liz.                        ``Heroism Knows no Gender''         Liz is an Army Veteran and a single mom. After losing her       job, she struggled to pay the rent and provide for her       daughter. Liz's landlord said she had always been an       excellent tenant but his patience was wearing thin as her       rent arrears continued to increase. Disheartened with a       fruitless job search and unsure of where else to turn, Liz       came to the Veterans Outreach Center (VOC). She was       immediately connected with a Case Manager, an Employment       Specialist, an Accredited State Veterans Benefits Counselor,       and the SSVF team.        In order to avoid the immediate crisis of homelessness, the       Services To Enable Positive Solutions (S.T.E.P.S) program at       the VOC paid Liz's rent arrears, which had escalated to an       amount that was insurmountable. Within a few short days of       connecting with the team at VOC, Liz had a job interview that       resulted in full-time, meaningful employment. In less than a       week, she had a benefits review with an on-site counselor       from the New York State Division of Veterans Affairs during       which she applied for an increase in disability compensation.       The payment of Liz's back rent allowed her and her daughter       to keep a roof over their head. With a roof over their heads       and their living situation stabilized, Liz was able to focus       on her employment and securing her benefits, which are both       components of an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that will       help Liz sustain permanent housing in the future.        The VOC was able to stabilize Liz and her daughter while       concurrently providing the supportive services necessary for       her to maintain permanent housing. The temporary financial       assistance was delivered to the landlord in a timely,       efficient manner with the help of a S.T.E.P.S collaborative       partner. Through coordinated case management, the       aforementioned supportive services were provided quickly and       effectively. The longterm result of this effort is yet to be       determined, but at the 90-day benchmark, Liz has retained       both her job and her home. She has realized this goal       independently, without requesting any additional financial       assistance. Consequently, the VOC was able to better the       lives of a mom (a Veteran) and her child immeasurably through       SSVF funding.     This is a very conspicuous and daily occurrence that  happens where our veterans are able to go to a supportive team that  understands their service, appreciates their plight, and works to help  them so that they do not go into the cycle of homelessness.   I think it is particularly important when we think about veterans and  their families. They are many times single parents, many times disabled  or with family concerns, mental health needs, and these services that  are provided include healthcare, daily living, legal services,  fiduciary and payee services, personal financial planning, childcare,  transportation, and housing counseling.   Veterans like the Air Force veteran who, hoping to utilize the skills  he learned in the service, instead bounced from job to job after being  discharged, found himself sleeping at night on the cold cement under a  bridge in Chicago. But, of course, he was able to get the  [[Page H4992]]  support from our veterans support services.   This is, again, a valuable statement made by this legislation, and I  ask my colleagues to continue to support the services given by this  particular program.   Again, I hope that we will see the end of homelessness among our  veterans and the increase in support services to help them in their  pathway to success.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me close by acknowledging and  thanking the chairman and ranking member again for their leadership on  this bill and to remind my colleagues that there are a series of  stories of veterans who really needed these services.   Katie, an SSVF caseworker at the Salvation Army Bismarck, received a  call from a veteran named Cherie. Cherie was referred by the family  assistance adviser at the military service center in Bismarck.  According to Cherie, she didn't know the Salvation Army had the  veterans program until she inquired for help.   Cherie approached them. She had suffered a head injury resulting in a  3-inch blood clot, skull fracture, severe concussion. In short, she  suffered traumatic brain injury. While on unpaid medical leave via  physician's orders, she was terminated from her employer.   This is the kind of devastating news that will be heard from veterans  who will seek and receive this kind of help.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record articles explaining the plight  of a veteran in Bismarck:  How the Salvation Army Helped a Mother and Her Children Keep Their Home         On December 20, 2011, Katie, an SSVF Caseworker at the       Salvation Army Bismarck Corps, received a call from a Veteran       named Cherie. Cherie was referred by the Family Assistance       Advisor at the Military Service Center in Bismarck, ND.       According to Cherie, she ``didn't know the Salvation Army had       the Veterans program until [she] required help.'' Cherie       approached the SSVF program because on November 19th, she       suffered a head injury resulting in a 3-inch blood clot,       skull fracture and a severe concussion; in short, she       suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). While on unpaid       medical leave via physician's orders, she was terminated from       her employer. A single mother of two, her biggest concern was       maintaining her current residency.        On December 21st, when Cherie met with Katie, she was very       emotional and had difficulty processing her thoughts. She was       extremely overwhelmed with how to pay for her rent and       utilities and provide for her children while unemployed.       Katie provided emotional support as well as resources for a       food box, an application for food stamps through the county,       contact information for a Veterans employment team       representative and lastly, information about a support group       for women Veterans in the Bismarck community. In Cherie's own       words, ``The SSVF assistance provided peace of mind and       helped keep me on my feet, especially with having kids. Katie       has been such a calming influence, good about following up       and very supportive.''        Since Cherie has been involved with the Salvation Army, she       has been able to focus on recovering from her TBI, has found       temporary full-time employment for which permanent placement       is promising, and is able to provide for her children and       keep a roof over their heads. She's also spreading the word       to fellow Veterans throughout the state about the SSVF       program.     I ask my colleagues to support the program overall  and my amendment.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to briefly explain Jackson  Lee Amendment No. 34.   Before I begin, let me express my appreciation and thanks to good  friends, Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz, for  their hard and constructive work in shepherding this legislation to the  floor.   Chairman Calvert and I have worked together constructively for many  years and he has always distinguished himself as one of the more  bipartisan members of the House.   And Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz has for years been one of the  ablest Members of this body; I thank them both for their commitment to  the important work of ensuring that our veterans receive the care and  support they have earned from a grateful nation.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 34 makes a modest but important improvement  to the bill by increasing the amount of funding for the ``Supportive  Services for Veterans' Families'' account by $2 million, offset by a  reduction of $2.5 million to the $4 billion allocated to the VA's  ``Information Technology Systems'' account.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   Any perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   The VA's ``Supportive Services for Veterans' Families'' Program helps  veterans, and their families, who may have fallen on hard times or hit  a rough patch in life and need a little help from the country they  selflessly risked their life to defend.   Homeless veterans or veterans facing homelessness who have minor age  children are in need of special programs that allow housing that  welcomes children.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 34 will enable this vital program to serve  more veterans' families in need of help by provide a bit more funding  for grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer  cooperatives that provide supportive services to very low-income  veteran families living in or transitioning to permanent housing.   The SSVF Program ensures that eligible veteran families receive the  outreach, case management, and assistance in obtaining VA and other  benefits.   These services may include health care, daily living, legal services,  fiduciary and payee services, personal financial planning, child care,  transportation, housing counseling.   The SSVF Program enables VA staff and local homeless service  providers to work together to effectively address the unique challenges  that make it difficult for some veterans and their families to remain  stably housed.   Many homeless veterans, including in my own state of Texas, lack  housing because they lost their job or could no longer afford rent;  many suffer from an untreated mental illness that keeps them from  working.   Every day the SSVF program makes a real difference in the lives of  real people.   Veterans like the Air Force veteran who, hoping to utilize the skills  he learned in the service, instead bounced from job to job after being  discharged and found himself sleeping at night on the cold cement under  a bridge in Chicago.   Through the Thresholds Veterans Project, funded through the SSVF,  this hero received steady community service support and eventually was  placed in his own studio apartment.   He now says, in his own words: I have a home. I enjoy bein' inside.''   Veterans like the one in Texas who because he lost his job at a  manufacturing plant and was unable to pay the bills, was forced to seek  shelter for himself and his family at a homeless shelter.   Fortunately, the homeless shelter was a SSVF grantee and was able to  assist the veteran obtain employment and his family in securing  affordable low-cost housing.   There are thousands of similar success stories made possible by the  SSVF Program that I could share but all of them share a common theme:  they involve veterans who served their country proudly, fell down on  their luck, picked themselves back up, and found affordable and  sustainable housing for their families because of the assistance and  support made possible by the SSVF program.   Ensuring that veterans have a place of their own to call home is the  very least we can do.   I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit  ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness  in America.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 34.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to serve on  the Judiciary Committee for a number of years. It is a committee that  has almost two-thirds of the jurisdiction of the United States  Congress. What I love about it: It is a protector of the rights of the  American people through the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.   The pardon is an act of mercy, and this past week I applauded the act  of mercy that was generated for a woman in Alabama who had a sentence  of 100 years for a small, nonviolent drug offense. That woman became a  minister and worked on degrees while she was incarcerated.   I think we can expand on this concept of mercy and pass sentencing  reduction, which goes to the reflection on sentencing that has been  done under mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenses where individuals  are incarcerated across the Nation for 25, 30, 40, 50 years, and even  life. If we do that through the legislative process, we will have a  structure that will look at these individuals to make sure that they  can contribute to society.   We need the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Association  of Law Enforcement, the evangelicals, people of all faiths; we need  lawyers; we need social workers; we need physicians to look at how this  impacts families. We can do this with the House and the Senate. I  commit to this Congress the interest in sentencing reduction.                            ____________________
