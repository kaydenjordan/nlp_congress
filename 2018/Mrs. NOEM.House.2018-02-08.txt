 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Improving Rural  Call Quality and Reliability Act.   Most Americans can rely on their phone service to keep in touch with  loved ones. They can respond to urgent work when away from their place  of business and respond to emergencies. But many of my constituents in  South Dakota continue to have these critical calls dropped with  absolutely no warning.   More specifically, companies in the business of routing voice calls  sometimes purposely drop long-distance calls headed for remote areas as  a way to save money.   While this is inexcusable just for the sheer inconvenience, some of  these calls involve emergencies, leaving families in unnecessarily  dangerous situations.   The provisions within this bill are simple. We simply direct the FCC  to establish basic quality standards for providers that transmit voice  calls. This will help ensure businesses, families, and emergency  responders can count on phone calls being completed.   Mr. Speaker, I love living in a small town in America. It is where I  grew up, and it is where I have chosen to raise my family.   Dependable phone service shouldn't be a question for those who make  the choice to live in wide-open spaces, especially when we are making  new, amazing technological advances on a daily basis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and ensure  that those in South Dakota and rural areas across the country can rely  on their phone calls going through.
