 Madam Speaker, I rise today to show my support for the  millions of families struggling to help their loved ones suffering  through addiction.   My family fought to get help for my nephew, Ian, that he needed  before he lost his life to an overdose in 2016. It was hard for us to  do, even with the resources we had at our disposal.   For most families, it is nearly impossible to navigate our behavioral  health system in its current form. It is a confusing system that leaves  families like mine with no clue what treatment option is right for  their loved one.   Now more than ever, families are on the front lines of this fight.  Overdoses are on the rise across America, and COVID-19 is making  matters much worse. Every single county in my district saw an increase  in overdose deaths last quarter--some as much as 50 percent. And last  year, more Americans died of drug overdoses than ever before--more than  70,000.   Madam Speaker, that is why I introduced the Family Support Services  for Addiction Act with Congressman  Dan Meuser. This bipartisan bill  provides for nonprofits working with families struggling with  addiction. The bill will provide grants to reach more families, create  more tailored treatments, and save more lives.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Meuser, Chairman Pallone,  Chairwoman Eshoo, and Ranking Member Walden for this much-needed bill.  We have got to get this done. Lives are depending on it.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.
