 Mr. Speaker, when will my Republican colleagues divorce  themselves from the NRA? Despite all the uncertainties in this world,  there seems to be one truth, that there will be no Republican action on  gun violence.   That is what the NRA stands for: No Republican Action. That is what  the NRA pays for when it funnels tens of millions of dollars into our  Federal elections.   Two years ago, 49 people were shot to death by a crazed gunman in a  nightclub in Orlando, Florida. On this, the anniversary of that  massacre, I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring those who  were lost by uplifting the spirits of their families.   Mr. Speaker, to truly honor the lives lost at the Pulse nightclub, in  Las Vegas, at Parkland in Florida, and in communities every day across  this Nation, we have to change our laws, and we have to do it now.                            ____________________
