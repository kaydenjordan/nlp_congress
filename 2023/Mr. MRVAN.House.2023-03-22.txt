 Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration that I rise to  celebrate Women's History Month and its 2023 theme: Celebrating Women  Who Tell Our Stories.   This year, I recognize a woman who tells the stories of Gary,  Indiana: Ms. Dorothy Leavell, the editor and publisher of the Gary  Crusader for more than 50 years.   Throughout her career, Dorothy remained grounded in her purpose to  serve as an advocate for the African-American community. Under her  leadership, the Crusader Newspaper Group became a voting member of the  National Newspaper Publisher's Association, a federation of the African  American-owned newspapers in our Nation.   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Women's History Month, please join me  in recognizing the dedication, perseverance, and contributions that Ms.  Dorothy Leavell and so many other extraordinary women have made to  improve our communities through the stories they tell.                            ____________________
