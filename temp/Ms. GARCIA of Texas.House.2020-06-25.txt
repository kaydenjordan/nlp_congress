 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my strong  support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   It is past time for Congress to make systemic changes on issues of  racism, police brutality, and racial profiling. We must put an end to  unjustified use of force by the police that has resulted in the death  of one too many Black and Brown Americans.   As a person of faith, I believe the responsibility falls on each and  every one of us to ensure that everyone is treated as a child of God.  However, the reality is George Floyd was not treated as the child of  God that he is. He wasn't treated that way when he said his last words,  ``I can't breathe.''   Justice demands that we must put an end to police brutality, racial  profiling, white supremacy, and the vicious racism in America.   Justice demands that long-suffering Americans be made whole for being  denied their rights as Americans.   If there is anything that history has taught us, it is that our laws  must be equal to all, and we must boldly affirm that Black lives  matter.
