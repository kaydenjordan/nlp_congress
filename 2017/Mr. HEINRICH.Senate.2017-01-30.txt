 Mr. President, I was unable to cast my vote on  the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Rex W. Tillerson to  be Secretary of State because I was addressing a joint session of the  State legislature in New Mexico. If I had been present, I would have  voted no.                            ____________________
