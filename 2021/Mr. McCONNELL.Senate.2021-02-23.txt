 Mr. President, millions of American kids in the public  school system have been robbed of a year, and counting, of anything  resembling a proper education. It has been a historically tough year.  That is why Americans are so excited our Nation appears to be  approaching a major turning point.   Here are just a few recent headlines:         A U.S. Vaccine Surge Is Coming, With Millions of Doses       Promised    Another headline:         America's vaccine rollout has been among the best in the       world    Another headline:         CDC finds scant spread of coronavirus in schools with       precautions in place    Here is one from my home State:         COVID-19 cases plummet in Kentucky nursing homes, a key       target for the vaccine    So let's take a look at the economy:         U.S. Retail Sales Surprise With Sharpest Advance in Seven       Months        Blue-Collar Jobs Boom as COVID-19 Boosts Housing, E-      Commerce Demand    Another headline:         Consumer Demand Snaps Back. Factories Can't Keep Up.    To be clear, this isn't over. The battle is not won yet. But the day  is approaching when we will be able to end this defensive crouch and  safely reclaim our normal lives.   Last year the Senate built the largest peacetime fiscal expansion in  American history. We spent $4 trillion on five overwhelmingly  bipartisan packages. The most recent became law just 2 months ago.  Funding for hospitals and providers kept our healthcare system above  water. The Paycheck Protection Program saved Main Street small  businesses. Direct relief and extra unemployment aid helped working  families endure the shutdown. Operation Warp Speed laid the groundwork  for our historic sprint toward vaccinations.   These were strong, bipartisan policies, targeted to what families  specifically needed to wage the war, but today Democrats are  steamrolling ahead with a massive spending plan on a completely  partisan basis. It did not receive a single House Republican vote in  committee yesterday because their partisan plan is not targeted toward  helping Americans reclaim their lives and their country from this  invader. Instead, here is what it is: a combination of miscellaneous,  non-COVID-related, liberal wish-list items and the kinds of bandaid  policies that make a defensive crouch slightly less painful but don't  help get us back on offense.   Let's take a look at K-12 schooling. Until very recently, the new  administration's own scientists had been crystal clear. Earlier this  month, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said:         There is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely       reopen.    A major CDC study found in-person schooling does not--not--fuel  community transmission.  [[Page S795]]    Last month, Dr. Fauci said:         It's less likely for a child to get infected in the school       setting than if they were just in the community.    But Big Labor special interests didn't appreciate science  undercutting their political goals. The empire struck back, and the  Democratic leaders who love to claim the mantle of science ran away  from the science as fast as they could. Now the CDC Director admits  that ``the lived experiences''--whatever that is--of government  employees got between the hard science and the final guidance. It is a  lot of points for candor.   The unions had spoken. The goalposts were on the move. And the White  House keeps endorsing the idea that schools need the Democrats' new  spending plan to reopen, when the science disagrees. And furthermore,  just 5 percent--5 percent--of what they propose to spend on schools  would even be spent this year. Let me say that again. In this big COVID  package, only 5 percent of what they propose to spend on schools would  be spent this year. In other words, the spendout is over years ahead.  You would think their view is, we are never going to get over the  coronavirus.   The United Kingdom just announced they will have kids back in school  in less than 2 weeks--2 weeks. Countries like Spain and France have had  kids in classrooms for months already. The European Centre for Disease  Prevention has no problem affirming the science--that closing schools  is ``unlikely to provide significant additional protection of  children's health.'' Even here at home, private and religious schools  have been teaching kids in person for months without causing any  explosion in the spread of the virus.   Science tells us unambiguously that in-person schooling can be quite  safe and that having young children spend all day staring into a laptop  is a nightmare. The evidence is crystal clear. Big Labor bureaucrats  keep refusing to follow the science.   In my hometown of Louisville, our union-backed school board vice  chairman now asserts, with no evidence:         I think we're probably likely to see better instructional       outcomes . . . if we stay [remote] for the rest of the school       year.    Ridiculous. No facts. No evidence. Just a personal whim. These are  the people controlling our kids' futures and their parents' lives.   One anonymous teacher told reporters:         We already have a schedule and a routine going. We don't       need to be babysitting for six weeks because parents are       upset.    Let me say that again.   One anonymous teacher told reporters that we already have a schedule  and a routine going. We don't need to be babysitting for 6 weeks  because parents are upset.   By the way, failing grades in middle schools are up 388 percent in  our county. Failing grades in middle schools are up 388 percent in our  county while these kids are stuck at home.   The Biden administration has a clear obligation to tackle the special  interest madness head-on. Our kids are suffering, not because science  says they must be--it doesn't. It is just because a small group of  powerful grownups has decided they prefer it this way. Instead, the  White House keeps parroting the anti-science myths. They back this  notion that schools need the Democrats' new spending plan before they  can reopen, except that science completely disagrees--completely;  except that only a tiny fraction of the funding request would even be  spent this fiscal year.   Our children's futures are literally at stake. The administration has  got to stop taking orders from the public sector unions that give  generously to Democratic campaigns. This is exhibit A in why relief  legislation must be targeted to the actual needs we face now. American  families should be the starting point, not preconceived political  priorities.
