 Mr. President, I want to follow up on the remarks that  have just been made by our friend from South Dakota.   During his first 100 days in office, President Trump has wasted no  time in fulfilling one of his key promises and one of those promises  that is hard to appreciate because, if bad things do not happen to you,  it is hard to realize they did not happen. Yet there were many bad  things in store for the American people and frankly a lot of bad things  that have happened through the very kinds of regulations, over the last  years, that Senator Rounds was talking about.   Over the last 8 years, any time I had been traveling in Missouri, one  of the top-of-mind issues with group after group had always been a  different and more troublesome and more burdensome recent regulation by  the Federal Government. I had heard about healthcare, but often I had  heard about healthcare with regard to the irrational regulations that  were being put out as part of the bill, and I had heard about taxes.  Yet I would say that the No. 1 issue I had heard about for the whole 8  years was that of out-of-control regulators who were clearly also not  responsive to anybody and did not need to be. Frankly, in the second 4  years of that Presidency, the regulators were even less responsive than  they were in the first 4 years, and I think that is something that  happens way too often.   I hear from families, farmers, and job creators who tell me that the  biggest barrier to job creation and economic growth is exactly what we  are hearing about here this morning; that people do not think out the  real consequences of the regulations.   According to regulations.gov, Federal agencies finalized more than  4,000 new regulations in 2016 alone. That was an average of 11 new  regulations a day in the final year of the Obama Presidency. Let's  think about that. Every one of those 4,000 regulations was a regulation  that the country had lived without for the entire history of the  country and that the Obama administration had lived without for 7  years.   A number of those regulations had been done so late that we had had a  chance to look at them through the Congressional Review Act because  they were still available to the new Congress. That is how late they  happened. One of them went into effect on January 18, and the Obama  administration was over at noon on January 20.   They handed down a record-breaking 600 major new regulations that  imposed more than $700 billion in costs on our economy. Senator Rounds  just mentioned the estimated total annual compliance costs for  regulations of $1.9 billion--almost $2 trillion. Imagine. If half of  those regulations are either duplicative or unnecessary, talk about a  stimulus, if somehow we go back and figure out how to eliminate the  half that does not need to be done so one can really focus on the half  that needs to be done. I am for every regulation that we absolutely  have to have, but I am not for regulations that we do not absolutely  have to have.   What is worse is that the completely unnecessary aim of these  regulations is frankly the amount of effort some of them require.   There is a $12.3 billion regulation on efficiency standards for  central air conditioners. Now, one has to find a lot of efficiency to  find $12.3 billion in savings. That is a lot of efficiency. There is a  $4.4 billion regulation that sets standards for ceiling fans. I like  ceiling fans as much as the next person, but when you add $4.4 billion  to standards, that has to be paid for by somebody just like the $3.6  billion in regulations of the control of commercial vehicle operators.   What the regulators so often do not seem to understand is that  ultimately the consumers have to pay for the costs of these  regulations. The cost of regulations is not really a reflection of the  government's cost of being the regulator, it is the economic cost of  having the regulations.   That is why I have been particularly encouraged to see President  Trump taking the steps he has taken to roll back many of the late  efforts by the Obama administration. Since taking office, President  Trump has signed 13 Congressional Review Act resolutions which,  according to the administration, will save $10 billion in regulatory  costs over a 10-year period of time. With regard to the Congressional  Review Act, the Congress's passing a rejection of the rule and the  President's agreeing to it happened exactly one time in 25 years prior  to this administration. It has happened 13 times this year. It will  happen, I am confident, a few more times, and it will have a real  impact.   When you look at the regulations that have been delayed or repealed  by CRAs and Executive orders--Congressional Review Act resolutions or  Executive orders--the American Action Forum estimates that $18.8  billion would be saved annually. Now, the President is not going to get  much credit for that, and the Congress is not either, but if in the  last few weeks we figured out how to take an $18.8 billion burden off  of people by not moving forward with regulations that the country had  not had prior to just a few weeks ago, in some cases, that is a good  thing.  [[Page S2578]]    Many of the Missourians from whom I have heard are particularly  relieved that the President is also moving back from a couple of  rules--the power rule and the waters of the United States rule--that  Federal courts, fortunately, up until now, had said to President  Obama's administration they did not have the authority to do what they  were trying to do in either of these rules. The rules would have had  devastating impacts on job opportunities and on families in our State.  The power rule would have doubled the utility bills in 10 or 12 years.   I have been reminding Missourians over the last several months that  if you do not think that is going to impact you when you pay your  electric bill the next time, just write it right out of your checkbook  one more time--write it--because that is what you would be doing  sometime in the next decade and see what impact that has on the kinds  of things you and your family would have been doing with the money that  you would have been spending on twice your utility bill.   A week ago, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was in our State, at the  Thomas Hill powerplant, to talk about how these rules would have  affected the State and how one can still fulfill the mission of the EPA  for clean air and clean water and a better environment without having  rules that devastate families as well as deal with problems, many of  which have now been on the priority list for 10 years and longer and  have never been dealt with, while the EPA has been coming up with  something else to do. They would have driven up the cost of groceries.  They would have driven up the cost of the utility bill itself. Of  course, when the utility bill goes up, the utility bill work goes up,  too, and work might not be there at double the utility bill.   The combined cost savings is estimated to be as high as $67.3 billion  over the very foreseeable future of the Congressional Review Act, the  President's Executive orders, the announced decisions that they have  made about things like the clean power rule and the waters of the  United States rule. Even in Washington, $67.3 billion is a lot of  money, not to mention the 52 million hours of paperwork that will be  needed to comply with rules that were not necessary to be there and  that Senator Rounds mentioned.   Our economy cannot grow and thrive with billions of dollars' worth of  regulations dragging it down. Let me say again that I am for every  regulation that we absolutely have to have--there is no argument about  that--but we need to have a process by which we know whether we have to  have them. That is why, in the next few weeks, I plan to reintroduce  the bipartisan Regulatory Improvement Act, which the Congress looked at  last year.   This bill would create a Regulatory Improvement Commission that would  review outdated regulations with the goal of bringing the list back to  the Congress and saying that we think that these can all be eliminated.   I have also cosponsored an act called the REINS Act, which would give  me and the rest of the Congress the obligation to vote on any  regulation that has more than $100 million of impact on the economy so  that if we need it, we are going to go home and justify it, and the  American people--where I live and the Presiding Officer lives--can get  their hands on us if we cannot explain why we thought it was a good  idea to do that.   I believe the government should work for the American people, not the  other way around, and I believe the President and the Congress have  taken advantage of this historic opportunity to drive that peg a little  deeper in the ground.   I look forward to continuing to work on these issues. I think we need  to take more responsibility for these issues. I know some of our  colleagues have said: Well, why did we repeal these late regulations?  Well, they were late regulations for a reason, and the country had done  just fine without them up until now.   So I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer and others to  continue working on this effort to have regulations that make sense  when we need them and not to have regulations when we don't need them.
