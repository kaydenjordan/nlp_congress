 Mr. Speaker, in the last few days, we spent a lot of  time in session in the U.S. Congress reviewing and debating tweets and  personal comments of individuals. In the meantime, policy debate and  the urgent work of the people are excluded from the agenda.   As I speak, among other things, we are apprehending some 3,000  immigrants per day on our southern border, we will lose around 130  people today due to the opioid crisis, and our national debt will  increase another $3 billion or so in just the next 24 hours.   It is clear that the majority leadership does not want to have policy  initiatives that are desired by our current administration to even get  a debate, but, Mr. Speaker, we have an election process to deal with  those concerns.   It is our job to do the people's work. Please, let's go to work.                            ____________________
