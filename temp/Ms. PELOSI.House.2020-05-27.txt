 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank him and Mr. McCaul, Mr. Engel, the chairman, ranking member, and  senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing this  important legislation to the floor. It is an honor to be here with all  of them, and with Mr. Suozzi, who has been a champion for religious  rights throughout the world.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Smith and I go back decades in our fight for human  rights in China, whether it is in Tibet, whether it is in Beijing,  whether it is in Hong Kong. The list goes on and on. I thank Mr. Smith  for his ongoing leadership.   Madam Speaker, I also thank the chairman of the committee, Mr.  McGovern, the chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China  and chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Mr. Smith is the  ranking member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and  I thank Mr. Smith.   Today in this House of Representatives, in a very strong, bipartisan  way, we are sending a message to the persecuted that they are not  forgotten. We are saying to the President of China: ``You may tell  these people that they are forgotten, but they aren't.''   On the floor of the House of Representatives, in bipartisan,  bicameral legislation, we are here in support of the Uyghur Human  Rights Policy Act, strong bipartisan legislation to address and defend  the rights and dignity of the Uyghur people from China's oppression.   Today, again, we are sending that message even as we are heartbroken  as to what China's people are suffering in terms of COVID-19 and that  crisis. We are sad about that.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chris Smith, again, and Mr. Engel and Mr.  McCaul. I thank Senator Rubio, also, for his leadership on this  legislation. He has been a champion working with us on the China  issues.   Beijing's barbarous actions targeting the Uyghur people are an  outrage to the collective conscience of the world. Across Xinjiang, a  Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Uyghur people and other Muslim minorities  face brutal oppression, as Mr. Smith was pointing out:   A pervasive state of mass surveillance and predictive policing used  to discriminate and violate the human rights of minorities;    The mass incarceration of more than 1 million--and that is a small  number, a very conservative, small number--innocent people, with  beatings, solitary confinement, deprivation of food and medical  treatment, and the number is probably much larger than that;   Forced sterilizations and other forms of torture;   Incidents of mass shootings, extrajudicial killings, and the  intimidation and suppression of journalists courageously exposing the  truth.   Today, with this overwhelming bipartisan legislation, the United  States Congress is taking a firm step to counter Beijing's horrific  human rights abuses against the Uyghurs.  [[Page H2298]]    In the House, when brought to the floor in December, this legislation  passed on a nearly unanimous basis. In the Senate, it passed under  unanimous consent, with more than 50 cosponsors from both sides of the  aisle.   This legislation helps uncover the truth, requiring reports by the  Director of National Intelligence, State Department, and FBI about the  depths of the crisis and about China's campaign against journalists  exposing the facts.   It creates accountability and ensures transparency of Chinese and  foreign companies involved in the camps, and it engages the full  firepower of American law and leadership, including by urging the  application of targeted sanctions against those involved in the  oppression of the Uyghur people.   We must continue to raise a drumbeat and shine a light on the abuse  perpetrated by Beijing against the Uyghurs whenever we can--from this  House floor, to the State Department, to our multilateral institutions.   Last Friday, as Speaker, I had the honor of appointing Nury Turkel, a  human rights champion who was born in a camp in the Xinjiang region, to  the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,  largely focused, with Ambassador Brownback's leadership, on freedom of  religion in many countries. There, I am confident that he will continue  to be a powerful voice for the Uyghur people and for the cause of  justice around the world.   In just over a week--just think of it--the global community will mark  the solemn milestone of 31 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre,  when students, workers, and citizens were gunned down as they  peacefully defied an oppressive regime to demand their liberties and  human rights.   Sadly, today, Beijing's human rights abuses continue--blatantly  continue--targeting so many, from the decades-long abuse faced by the  Tibetan people--many of us have visited Tibet and seen firsthand what  is happening there--to Hong Kong's fight for democracy and the rule of  law, which has once again been targeted in recent days in a very  shameful way, to the jailing of journalists, human rights lawyers,  Christians, and democracy advocates throughout the mainland.                                time  1245    To honor all who have been persecuted, we must renew our commitment  to speaking out against China's human rights abuses. If America does  not speak out for human rights in China because of some commercial  interest, then we lose all moral authority to speak out on human rights  violations anyplace in the world. It is a challenge to our conscience.  We must do the right thing, and that is what we are doing today.   In honor of the millions fighting for their dignity, safety, and  rights in China and around the world, I strongly urge a bipartisan vote  for the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020.   I again thank those responsible, Mr. McCaul, Mr. Engel, Mr. Sherman,  Mr. Smith, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mr. Suozzi,  who has been a champion, as I say, on religious freedom throughout the  world.   I want to close by commending Mr. McGovern, again, for being  relentless and persistent in terms of shining a bright light on human  rights violations throughout world and especially in China.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank him for his leadership of the Rules Committee and for bringing us  together so that we can present this FISA bill on the floor today.   Madam Speaker, when we come to Congress, we all take an oath of  office. We raise our right hand to protect and defend the Constitution  of the United States. Protecting that, we are protecting the American  people.   Central to that defense is how we do protect and defend, it is about  our values, which are part of our strength. It is about the health,  education, and well-being of our people, our children, our future,  which is part of our strength. Our military might is part of our  strength. And our intelligence is very much a part of our strength in  order to provide force protection for our men and women in uniform when  they go out there to protect and defend our country. Force protection.   When I first started on the Intelligence Committee in the early mid- 90s, a long time ago, I would soon then rise to be the ranking member,  and I take great pride in that ex officio all these years since then.  When I started way back when, it was about force protection;  intelligence to protect our forces to anticipate any initiation of  hostilities, and also, when engaged, to have the intelligence to  protect them.   Since then, the whole world has changed with technology, and all the  rest, in that period of time. So our intelligence has had to change as  well. And one of the ways it has, has necessitated us having a FISA  bill, the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act.   In the House some weeks ago we passed a bill, honchoed by our two  distinguished chairs, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler  from New York; and the chair of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Schiff  from California, two committees of jurisdiction. It had strong  bipartisan support. It went over to the Senate. In my view, it was  vastly improved in the Senate, and it had 80 votes.   Our bill was bipartisan. Their bill was bipartisan, too: 80 votes in  the United States Senate for the Senate bill, which was amended by the  Leahy/Lee Amendment--very, very protective of the balance that we have  to have between security and privacy, security and civil liberties.  This is the balance that we have to strike.   In my years on Intelligence, I was focused a lot on the civil  liberties part of it, establishing a board, et cetera, to ensure that  whatever we did, that balance with our civil liberties was central and  important to it.   As Benjamin Franklin said: Security and liberties, you can't have one  without the other. They go together, security and liberty.   And so now today, this Rules Committee is presenting that bill, the  USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act coming back from the Senate. Again, our  bill in the House originally was 278 to 136. It was strongly  bipartisan, with 126 Republicans voting for it. This bill coming back  from the Senate, as I said, had 80 votes over there.   So with an intelligence bill, with a FISA bill, nobody is ever really  that happy. I never was. And you always want more or less, as the case  may be, but the fact is--and I say this in all humility, because I  don't pretend to know more than my colleagues--but in all humility, we  have to have a bill. If we don't have a bill, then our liberties, our  civil liberties are less protected.   Some people say: I don't care, just let them extend this and extend  that. No. There is real value in both the House bill that we passed and  then exceptionally so in what the Senate passed. There are those that  would not like us to have a bill. Some of them in the judiciary, the  Department of Justice, just say: Don't have a bill, just give us all  the leeway in the world not to have to protect any liberties. But we  can't have that.   We take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United  States and all the liberties contained therein as we protect the  American people.   So if anybody thinks, well, no, in order to have a bill, we have to  have a rule. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing this rule to  the floor, which enables us to pass a bill. This legislation increases  the power of the Privacy  [[Page H2306]]  and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to pursue its mission to protect  Americans' privacy.   After 9/11 this Congress considered the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, establishing the Privacy and Civil  Liberties Board. That was one of my top priorities all those years ago.  And the Board has done critical work in assessing the privacy and civil  liberties impact of the government's collection activities, including  under various provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   So, again, this has to be a high priority for us. It was a higher  priority in the act that was passed that could get passed in the  Senate.   So, again, I am going to submit my statement for the Record that I  talk about here. But FISA is a critical pillar of America's national  security, which Congress has updated and improved over the last years  to ensure that America's privacies and civil liberties are expected.   Are we ever satisfied? Of course not. Of course not. But legislation  is just exactly that. Legislation. Our attempt to come together to  protect and defend in a way that has already passed the Senate can go  directly to the President for his signature, and I hope that that will  be the case today.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for bringing this rule to  the floor. I urge all of our colleagues to vote for this important rule  that enables us to do important things for the American people. With  that, I urge an ``aye'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization  Act, a strong, bipartisan bill to reauthorize critical FISA provisions.   In March, our Members worked day and night to craft legislation that  strikes a strong, careful balance between security and privacy. We  thank Chairman Nadler and Chairman Schiff for their leadership and the  expertise they bring on this vital national security issue.   We were proud to have passed that bill on an overwhelmingly  bipartisan 278-136 basis, including with the support of 126 of our  Republican colleagues.   Last week, the Senate considered the House-passed FISA bill and  amended it to further expand the robust amicus curiae provisions in the  original House bill. The bill then passed also on an overwhelmingly  bipartisan basis, 80-16, supported by nearly every Republican Senator.   Yet, now, some Members on the other side of the aisle are considering  changing their minds and flipping their position, in order to score  political points with the President.   As should be clear, political gamesmanship has no place in our  national security. Reauthorizing FISA--and doing so in a timely  manner--is a matter of keeping the American people safe.   Indeed, FISA is a critical pillar of America's national security,  which Congress has updated and improved over the years to ensure that  Americans' privacy and civil liberties are respected.   After 9/11, as revelations emerged that the Bush Administration had  engaged in warrant-less electronic surveillance of the public, Congress  strengthened and updated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   Our action helped end this unacceptable practice and ensure that all  electronic surveillance of Americans complies with the law.   Since then, the law has been further updated, including through the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and the USA FREEDOM ACT of 2015.   The bill that the House passed in March took additional steps to  strengthen FISA, which are preserved in the Senate-amended bill:  placing new limitations on surveillance authorities while ensuring that  our intelligence and law enforcement have the tools necessary to keep  Americans safe; ending the NSA's call detail records initiative, which  the government has confirmed that it no longer uses; strengthening the  integrity of the FISA process by increasing transparency and  accountability; and expanding involvement of the court-appointed amicus  curiae in FISA cases--which was expanded in the Senate bill.   We are proud that this legislation increases the power of the Privacy  and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) to pursue its mission to  protect Americans' privacy.   After 9/11, as Congress considered the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, establishing the Privacy and Civil  Liberties Oversight Board was one of my top priorities.   The Board has done critical work in assessing the privacy and civil  liberties impact of the government's collection activities, including  under various provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   As Members of Congress, we take an oath to support and defend the  Constitution, and to protect the American people.   This legislation honors that oath, as it also honors the patriotic  contributions of the men and women of the intelligence and law  enforcement communities and the privacy of the American people.   I urge Members to remember their oath and to once again support this  critical legislation to keep the American people safe.
