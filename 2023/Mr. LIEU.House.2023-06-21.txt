 Mr. Speaker, today we learned that it wasn't just Clarence  Thomas on the Supreme Court who accepted lavish gifts from a  conservative billionaire and didn't disclose it, violating ethical  rules.   We learned that Justice Samuel Alito also accepted lavish gifts from  another conservative billionaire and didn't disclose it.   In addition, both Justices Thomas and Alito failed to disclose the  private jet travel that they received from conservative billionaires.  That is a violation of Federal law.   Americans used to respect the United States Supreme Court. Now I  think the American people can rightfully ask: Is it turning into a  cesspool of corruption? That is why I ask the Speaker of the House to  put on the floor the bill authored by Democrats to put ethical  standards on the United States Supreme Court.   Every Federal judge has to follow ethical standards except for these  nine people. Who do they think they are?                            ____________________
