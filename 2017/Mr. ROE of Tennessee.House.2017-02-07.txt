 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 58, which nullifies the teacher preparation issues rule finalized  by the Department of Education in October of 2016.   Mr. Speaker, it is an unfortunate situation that we find ourselves in  when I consistently hear from educators that they are spending more and  more time trying to comply with misguided rules from the Federal  Government instead of teaching our children and grandchildren.   The Department of Education and the Obama administration have acted  as if they know what type of teacher is best for east Tennessee instead  of the  [[Page H1043]]  people living and working there every day. I want nothing more than to  have the best teachers in our classrooms teaching children all across  this country, but burdensome one-size-fits-all regulations from the  Federal Government that emphasize bureaucracy and compliance instead of  a student education is not the way to get there.                                time  1500    The teacher preparation regulations put forth by the Obama  administration are yet another example of misguided Federal overreach  that would burden schools, institutions of higher education, and  States. These regulations are unfunded and would impose extensive data  collection requirements on States, colleges, and universities. And one  university, Mr. Speaker, in my State spends $150 million a year  complying with government regulations.   Under these regulations, institutions of higher education that do not  meet the rules requirements could lose access to Federal financial aid,  which is yet another example of the prior administration using the  regulatory process to bypass the legislative process. Both the School  Superintendents Association and the National Governors Association have  highlighted how these regulations are a significant intrusion on the  role States play in ensuring accountability for teacher preparation.  The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education has  indicated that these regulations are likely to exacerbate teacher  shortages in areas where they are critically needed, like special  education.   When Congress passed on a bipartisan basis Every Student Succeeds  Act, we expected the Obama administration would work to continue the  momentum for giving States and local school districts the flexibility  they needed to help kids learn. The administration went in the opposite  direction, which is why I encourage my colleagues to support this  resolution.
