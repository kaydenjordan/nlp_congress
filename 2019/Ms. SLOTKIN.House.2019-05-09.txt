 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Protecting  Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act.   For me, this issue is particularly personal. It is a major reason why  I ended up coming here to Congress.   I believe that the sabotage, the attempts at legislating out  protections for people with preexisting conditions, is something that  is just out of touch with the American people, certainly in Michigan's  Eighth Congressional District.   It is particularly personal to me because of my mom. My mom passed  away in 2011 from ovarian cancer. When she was diagnosed, she did not  have healthcare.   She had trouble with healthcare her entire life. She had breast  cancer as a young 31-year-old mom, so for the rest of her life, she had  a preexisting condition.   My parents divorced, and she lost her job. Because of that  preexisting condition, she could not afford health insurance. She went  5\1/2\ years without a checkup and no gynecological exam.   We finally got her health insurance, my brother and I. It was $1,000  a month, with a $10,000 deductible, her highest bill in Detroit.   In 2009, without us knowing, she let it lapse. Two months later, she  walked into an ER and was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer.   I am sure my colleagues around the room know what it is like to have  a loved one get a terminal diagnosis. Your life as you know it  explodes.   That same week and that same month that our lives were exploding was  the same week and the same month we spent filling out the paperwork for  her to declare bankruptcy.   I think no matter whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or an  independent, it is essential that we support people with preexisting  conditions, and I urge my colleagues to do so.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I rise because this motion to recommit is  simply another attempt to take away protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   Madam Speaker, at face value, the amendment appears to maintain  protections for people with preexisting conditions, but make no  mistake, no matter the language included in this MTR, the goal of the  1332 guidance expands and promotes junk plans that discriminate against  people with preexisting conditions. These plans also make comprehensive  coverage for people with preexisting conditions more expensive.   It is not enough to say, my colleagues, that you protect preexisting  conditions. It is what happens on the ground that matters.                                time  1815    If my colleagues are serious about protecting Americans with  preexisting conditions, I urge them to oppose this amendment, support  the underlying bill, and join us in doing what the American public has  made very clear they want.   While Members of the other party may claim they are ready to work to  protect individuals, their actions tell a different story.   Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, exactly this week, most House Republicans  voted overwhelmingly for a bill that would have gutted the ACA and  weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions.   My colleagues--including you, sir--stood on the White House lawn and  celebrated that bill and would have made it more difficult for people  with preexisting conditions.   A few courageous Republicans, who I applaud--including the late  Senator John McCain--joined Democratic Members and Senators in  preventing this bill from becoming law.  [[Page H3549]]    You can boo John McCain if you want.   Since then, the administration has tried every play in the book to  undercut, sabotage, skirt protections in the ACA, including protections  for people with preexisting conditions.   We currently have an open suit from your side that is meant to  invalidate the entirety of the ACA, including protections for people  with preexisting conditions.   I stand in opposition to this motion because the issue of protecting  people with preexisting conditions is deeply personal to me, as it is  to so many people in this room and in our districts.   My mom passed away in 2011 from ovarian cancer, and when she was  diagnosed, she did not have healthcare. She had struggled to afford  healthcare her entire life.   She had breast cancer as a 31-year old mom, leaving her with a  preexisting condition for the rest of her life. When she lost her job  in 2002, she lost her insurance, and it was impossible to find coverage  that she could afford. She went 5\1/2\ years with no insurance, no  checkup, no gynecological exam, no one saying ``you should get  tested.''   In 2008, we finally helped her get insurance. Because of her  preexisting condition, it was $1,000 a month and a $10,000 deductible.  She let it lapse and walked into an ER a few months later and was  diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer.   Now, I am sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know  exactly what it is like to have a loved one get a terminal diagnosis.  Your life as you know it explodes.   And that same week and that same month that my life was exploding,  was the same week and the same month that I spent filing the paperwork  for my mom to declare bankruptcy. So, no one should be gouged because  they happen to be born with a preexisting condition.   We have evolved as a country, as a Nation, to see that, and I urge my  colleagues to evolve as well.   Madam Speaker, in my district protecting people with preexisting  conditions is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It is what people  of all political backgrounds are demanding of us as their  representatives.   That is our mission. That is our mandate. And to ignore the interest  of our constituents at this point, is dereliction of duty, plain and  simple.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment that would  hurt people like my mom. To my colleagues across the aisle, do the  right thing. Put people before politics. Vote against this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
