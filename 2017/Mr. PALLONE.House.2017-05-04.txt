 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   I remind my colleague from Texas that his vote for the healthcare  bill will take away protections for 4,536,000 people with preexisting  conditions in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I heard my colleague from Texas talk about repeal and  replace. This is the myth, the hoax, that the Republicans and the  President are trying to play on the American people. I assure you this  is repeal. There is no replacement.   The people are going to lose their insurance. They are going to pay  more. They are going to have lousy insurance because they are not going  to have any kind of protections.   We passed the Affordable Care Act because the States were not doing  the right thing. People couldn't afford insurance. They couldn't pay  for a premium. They were too high.   So what did we do? We expanded Medicaid, and we provided generous  subsidies for those people who needed it.   We also knew, under the old system where the States were in charge,  that people got lousy insurance if they  [[Page H4140]]  could even find it. Sometimes they didn't have hospitalization, so we  insisted there had to be a package that included preexisting  conditions.   We also said that, you know, if you were paying a lot for your copays  or your deductibles, we are going to put limits on those things as  well. And we put limits also on how much you can charge, what we call  ``community rating.''   Now, what are the Republicans doing here today? They are getting rid  of all that. They want to go back to the old days. And when they tell  you that somehow they are going to be able to do this, the reason they  can't do anything is because they repeal most of the pay-fors that pay  for the subsidies that pay for the Affordable Care Act.   So when they tell you: Oh, we are going to give extra money for this,  for high-risk pools or to help the States if they decide to have  waivers, the bottom line is there is no money left here. There is no  money to pay for those subsidies; there is no money to pay for Medicaid  expansion; there is not enough money to pay for high-risk pools because  they have repealed the underlying pay-fors that we use to pay for the  Affordable Care Act.   What they are doing now is going back to the old system, the Wild  West of the States. They are allowing States to waiver the essential  benefits package. They are saying to States that they can charge  whatever they want for the insurance because they got rid of community  ratings.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself another 15 seconds to say  this: Do not buy into this hoax. There is no money left. They want to  go back to the old system, and the old system stunk. What we did was  correct the problems of the old system. So don't believe this cruel  hoax.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
