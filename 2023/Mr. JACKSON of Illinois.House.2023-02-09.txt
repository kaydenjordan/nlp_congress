 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give mournful  recognition of the 100-year anniversary of the Rosewood massacre, an  event that is still one of the darkest chapters of American history.   On January 1, 1923, the small town of Rosewood, Florida, was the site  of one of the worst racial attacks in the long history of this Nation.   Sparked by false allegations against an innocent Black man, a mob of  White residents descended upon the Black community of Rosewood, and it  is estimated that upward of 200 people were killed and virtually every  building in that small African-American community was literally burned  to the ground.   I stand in this well as the Representative of the First Congressional  District of the State of Illinois, a district with a majority of  minorities, of African Americans and Hispanics, which by pride and  passion, a majority within its soul and sinews, feels the traumatic  vestiges of Americans' inhumanity toward other Americans.   But this is American history, and it is as American as anything we  might say about Concord and Appomattox.    In spite of the dark tragedies interwoven within our story, what  happened in Rosewood 100 years ago is as American as anything that  happened at Gettysburg or Ellis Island. It must be repeated to our  children, lest we deny ourselves all the honesty we need to grow to be  a better country.   I implore my colleagues to join me in condemning the College Board of  Florida for removing AP African-American curriculum.                            ____________________
