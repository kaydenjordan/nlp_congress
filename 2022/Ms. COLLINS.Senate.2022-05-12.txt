 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills aimed  at continuing the important progress we have made so far to prevent and  effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. I know how devastating this  disease is. My father, grandfather, and two uncles all died from  Alzheimer's. I am committed to this effort both as a person whose  beloved family members have suffered from this disease as well as a  Senator concerned about the impact on our families and our healthcare  budgets.   When I founded the Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force in the Senate  in 1999, there was virtually no focus on Alzheimer's in Washington.  Twelve years ago, I coauthored the bipartisan National Alzheimer's  Project Act with my colleague Senator Evan Bayh. Before we passed that  legislation, there was no coordinated, strategic national plan to focus  our efforts to defeat Alzheimer's and ensure that our resources are  maximized and leveraged. NAPA  [[Page S2495]]  fixed this by convening a panel of experts to create a coordinated  strategic national plan to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's  disease by 2025. The expert council updates the plan annually.   We have made some progress in our efforts to find a treatment, means  of prevention, or cure, but Alzheimer's still costs our Nation an  astonishing $321 billion per year, including $206 billion in costs to  Medicare and Medicaid. If we continue along this trajectory,  Alzheimer's is projected to claim the minds of 12.7 million seniors and  nearly surpass $1 trillion in annual costs by 2050. It takes a  tremendous toll on families, too. In 2021, family caregivers provided  16 billion hours of unpaid care for loved ones with dementia. That job  is often 24/7 and often harms the health of the caregiver.   The National Alzheimer's Project Act is set to expire in 2025, so we  need to reauthorize this critical legislation to make sure that our  research investments remain coordinated, and we can maximize their  impact.   The first bill that I will introduce today with my colleagues  Senators Warner, Capito, Markey, Moran, and Menendez, is the NAPA  Reauthorization Act. It would reauthorize NAPA through 2035 and  modernize the legislation to reflect strides we have made understanding  the disease, like including a new focus on promoting healthy aging and  reducing risk factors.   The second bill that I will introduce, with my colleagues Senators  Markey, Capito, Warner, Moran, and Menendez, is the Alzheimer's  Accountability and Investment Act. That bill would continue through  2035 a requirement that the Director of the National Institutes of  Health submit an annual budget to Congress estimating the funding  necessary for NIH to fully implement NAPA's research goals. Only two  other areas of biomedical research--cancer and HIV/AIDs--have been the  subject of special budget development aimed at speeding discovery, and  this ``bypass budget,'' as it is known, helps us to understand the  additional funding needed to find better treatments, a means of  prevention, and ultimately a cure for Alzheimer's disease.   Nearly half of baby boomers reaching age 85 will either be afflicted  with Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it. In many ways,  Alzheimer's is the defining disease of this generation. We have made  tremendous progress in recent years to boost funding for Alzheimer's  research, which holds great promise to ending this disease that has had  a devastating effect on millions of Americans and their families. The  two bills I introduce today will maintain our momentum and make sure  that we do not take our foot off the pedal just as our investments in  basic research is beginning to translate into potential new treatments.  We must not let Alzheimer's define our children's generation as it has  ours.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Markey, and Mr.          Hagerty):   S. 4209. A bill to require a feasibility study regarding establishing  new diplomatic posts in the Pacific Islands; to the Committee on  Foreign Relations.
