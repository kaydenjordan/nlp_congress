 Madam Speaker, just 1 year ago, we learned of the  Trump administration's cruel separation family policy.   Separating immigrant children from their family is a violation of  basic human rights and a betrayal of our values as a nation.   In the wake of this terrible policy, my colleagues and I went to work  and spoke out because, Madam Speaker, we are a nation of immigrants. I  introduced the REUNITE Act, which would require the immediate  reunification of children with their families.   When we learned separated children were being held in a facility in  my district, we worked to reunite them with their parents because we  are a nation of immigrants. My office reunited four families, one of  which I brought to the Capitol as my guest at the State of the Union to  show the President that the people he tried to damage through this  terrible policy are stronger than he thinks.   Today, the other side of the aisle presented a false motion to  recommit. We voted it down because we are, Madam Speaker, a nation of  immigrants.   This administration must own up to its failure, and my colleagues and  I will continue to work to make sure this never happens again.                            ____________________
