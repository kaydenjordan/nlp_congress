 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 271, a resolution  condemning the Trump administration's legal campaign to take away  America's healthcare.   Here is what healthcare means: it is the freedom and security to live  your life the way you choose. It can be the difference between  financial security and bankruptcy, or life and death.   Donald Trump and congressional Republicans want to use the courts to  take health insurance away from 21 million Americans. They want to  eliminate protections for the more than 133 million Americans with  preexisting conditions.   Now, the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but never in American  history has the uninsured rate been lower than it is today.    But rather than be honest about what is working, rather than coming  to the table to work across the aisle and fix what is wrong,  Republicans are fighting tooth and nail to overturn the ACA, with no  plan except one that was so bad, they couldn't pass it when they  controlled both houses of Congress.   Meanwhile, the Democratic majority is proposing real solutions and  smart healthcare policies that will lower costs and expand coverage.   The contrast couldn't be more clear.   Democrats want quality, affordable health coverage for every  American, and Republicans don't.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  resolution.
