 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate a devoted  advocate in my district, Dr. Karla Sapp, who was named the 2020 Mental  Health Advocate of the Year by the Black Mental Health Symposium.   Dr. Sapp has worked tirelessly to decrease the stigma of mental  illness, increase access to care, and improve the wellness of the  individuals in her community.   A native of Midway, Georgia, Dr. Sapp previously served with the  Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice. For the past 11 years, she has  worked as a drug abuse program coordinator with the Federal Bureau of  Prisons. I have had the honor of working with Dr. Sapp during her  tenure at the Federal Correctional Institution of Jesup.   Karla is a mother, sister, advocate, counselor, teacher, resource,  motivator, and public servant. We are blessed to have Dr. Sapp working  to better the lives of those suffering from mental illnesses, and I am  thankful for her commitment to improving countless lives.   I congratulate her on this amazing accomplishment, and I look forward  to her continued journey of service and success.                            Recognizing Ken Griner     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor  [[Page H329]]  Ken Griner of Georgia's First Congressional District for his 33 years  of service in television and his many contributions to Savannah,  Georgia.   Over the duration of his successful career, Ken began as a studio  camera operator, then worked his way to covering late nights as WTOC's  sports director, and eventually became the hallmark coanchor at The  News at Daybreak in historic Savannah, Georgia.   Ken's energetic, warm, and bubbly personality made him an invaluable  and universally loved person within the television community, and I  have personally enjoyed listening to his remarks.   Ken has always been known as a fan favorite; warm and friendly; a  helpful coworker; and, above all, a loving person of all people. He is  a pillar in Savannah, and I am thankful for his many years of dedicated  work in media and for his whole-hearted investment in his community. I  hold Ken in the highest regard and I wish him the best of luck in his  future endeavors.                       Happy Birthday to Mack Mattingly     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Senator  Mack Mattingly, who celebrated his 90th birthday on January 7. Mack  carries a long list of accomplishments and prestigious titles and  awards, but his heart for public service stands out the most.   In the early 1950s, Mack served our country for 4 years in the United  States Air Force and was stationed at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah,  Georgia. He first became active in politics in 1964, when he served as  chairman of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater's campaign for President in  Georgia's First Congressional District.   In 1980, Mack defeated longtime Democratic Senator Herman Talmadge  and served in the Senate from January 1981 until January 1987. Mack was  the first Republican to serve in the United States Senate from Georgia  since Reconstruction.   In his post-Senatorial campaign, President Reagan appointed Mack to  serve as assistant secretary-general for defense support for NATO in  Brussels, Belgium. He was later appointed as ambassador to Seychelles  by President George Bush. Mack has contributed greatly to Georgia and  to the United States as a whole through all the positions he held.   I am thankful for his amazing life, and I wish him and his family the  best in years to come.                           Honoring Stephen Tootle     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Stephen Tootle of Savannah, Georgia, who recently passed away at  the age of 32 on December 20.   Stephen was a man of remarkable character and a giving heart, who  knew no stranger. He and his family were engrained in the local  Savannah community, and everyone who knew him recognized his light- hearted personality and passion for the outdoors.   He was a 2006 graduate of Benedictine Military School and would go on  to attend the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the  Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. During this time, he made many lifelong  friends. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 2010, with a  degree in risk management and insurance, before he returned to his  hometown of Savannah and worked as a commercial fisherman in his  family's crabbing business.   Stephen was known as someone who saw the good in everyone and  everything and had a heart of gold. He also had a way of making anyone  he met laugh. He was a courageous fighter who battled addiction, and I  know his story will continue to touch many lives.   Stephen leaves behind a wonderful, loving family who raised Stephen  to be the amazing person he was, and I am thankful for the life he  lived. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all  who knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Tommy Lee Exley, Sr., who passed away on January 16.
