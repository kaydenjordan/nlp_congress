 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to make a statement prior to the vote that is pending and that  my full statement be allowed to be made prior to that.    Mr. President, you know, we are here at this--normally,  Thursday night we wouldn't be here under normal circumstances, but we  are here because one Member of the Senate has determined to impede the  entire national security infrastructure as it relates to the foreign  policy of the United States.   What we do in the State Department and that which comes through the  Committee on Foreign Relations has to do with the essential security of  the United States. It is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that  has jurisdiction over global arms sales. It is the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee that has jurisdiction over the use of force. It is  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that deals with treaties across  the globe. It is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that deals with  the question of nuclear arms and proliferation and so much more.   And it is the State Department that perpetuates the national  interests and security of the United States in its positions across the  globe, both at home, in the first place, but across the globe.   Now, I have had plenty, over the course of 30 years of doing foreign  policy work between the House and the Senate, and 16 years in the  Senate--plenty of moments where I had a fundamental disagreement, a  very strong one, with an administration about their policy, but I did  not hold up the entire national security infrastructure of the State  Department that puts at risk the Nation.   I hear all these speeches about security. You are putting at risk the  Nation. Wouldn't it be nice if we had some of the critical people--I  just heard my colleague from Texas--in a position, beyond the  Department of Homeland Security, to deal with the hemispheric  challenges that we have on immigration in Central America, in Latin  America?   The Haitians who are at the border today didn't just come from the  earthquake and disasters and assassination and hurricanes that have  taken place. They have been in Latin America for quite some time. They  have just made their way to the border. Wouldn't it be nice if we had  the people in place to deal--Ambassadors and others--to deal in those  countries to find a way forward on how we humanely deal with that  challenge?   Wouldn't it be nice if we had the person in charge of East Asia and  the Pacific to deal with our challenges with China? This Senate came  together a few months ago and said China is the single most significant  national security challenge, the most significant strategic challenge  we have in the world. And yet we have vacancies galore to deal with  that very challenge.   I have Members who come to me and say: This company from my State is  having problems with XYZ. Well, wouldn't it be nice to be able to have  an ambassador in that country to deal with the challenges of that  American company or people who come to me and talk to me about their  challenges in getting a loved one, somebody from their State, to be  able to come? Our consular officers. Wouldn't it be nice to have  somebody in the position to deal with that?   Wouldn't it be critical, as we deal with the questions of law  enforcement and drug trafficking, to have the head of that, the  Assistant Secretary, in position so that we could deal with those  challenges?   So whatever view our colleague from Texas has about Nord Stream, and  I happen to believe that on the substance he is right, but this  procedure is wretchedly wrong because it puts us at risk in so, so many  dimensions. And something will happen--something will happen somewhere  in the world where we are not present because one Senator decided to  hold up that nominee that would have made a difference.   We already saw it. We already saw it as we were trying to deal with  challenges in our hemisphere and those that related to Afghanistan.  Ridiculous.   So our colleague who is holding this all up--because these nominees  overwhelmingly passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee either  unanimously--hear me--unanimously or with strong bipartisan votes. We  just saw the cloture vote before--77.   We are leaving these positions unfilled. The position is untenable to  continue to be able to meet the challenges the State Department has in  fulfilling whose interest? The interests of the American people across  the globe.   So it is time to get over that. We have only passed in this body  two--two--of President Biden's ambassadorial appointments--two. This  administration has been in office 9 months.   If I were to look at the same time period with President Trump, we  did far better. I didn't agree with President Trump on a whole host of  foreign policy decisions, but I understood that having people in place  was critical, even when I disagreed with them philosophically. It was  critical to promote the national interests and security of the United  States.   So it is time to get over this. These positions would normally pass  by voice, much less taking hours--hours, of which, by the way, the  debate is not even about the nominees or their positions. It is about  immigration and this and that and the other. The debate is not even  about these critical national security positions.  [[Page S6654]]    I don't want to hear about people coming to the floor and talking  about national security when they are leaving all these positions  vacant.   Now, let me specifically address the nominees that we are voting on.  I want to express my support for the nominations of Daniel Kritenbrink  to be the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific.  Whoa. China.   Karen Donfried to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and  Eurasian Affairs. Oh, we are trying to have a strong transatlantic  alliance. We are talking about Ukraine, Belarus.   Monica Medina to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and  International Environmental and Scientific Affairs--Scientific Affairs.  Yeah, COVID.   Mary Catherine Phee to be the Assistant Secretary of State for  African Affairs. We are having a huge challenge. I have been privileged  to meet two of the African Presidents here in the last couple of days  since they are here for U.N. Week. China is all over Africa. We need an  Assistant Secretary who is engaged in the continent of Africa to be  promoting the views of America's democracy, human rights, rule of law,  investment, trade, and opportunity. We are nowhere there.   Todd Robinson to be the Assistant Secretary of State for  International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. You know, I hear speeches  about fentanyl; I agree. Wouldn't it be nice to have the Assistant  Secretary of State to work hemispherically and beyond to make sure that  we don't get more fentanyl into our country?   And Jessica Lewis to be the Assistant Secretary of State for  Political-Military Affairs. If ever we needed someone who is engaged on  the conduct of political and military affairs and how that faces  national security challenges, it is now.   These are the people we are voting on. These are the people who  overwhelmingly came out of the committee on either unanimous or  bipartisan votes. These are superbly qualified nominees, and I have, if  it is not obvious, a very deep frustration about them languishing on  the floor for weeks--weeks--due to Republican holds. And I have a  frustration that we have not been able to more precipitously move  people to the committee to bring them to the floor.   We have close to 100 nominations for the State Department and USAID  that are pending. That is a crisis number. These nominations include  positions and ambassadorships to countries throughout Latin America and  Africa: places where competition with China and Russia is real, where  we need Ambassadors in place to project U.S. power, to assist and  protect U.S. citizens, and to promote our companies.   We are less safe when our national security Agencies are so  underwhelmed. We owe it to the Senate and the American people to fix  this problem.   I am pleased to be supporting the nomination of Ambassador Daniel  Kritenbrink to be Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and  Pacific Affairs. In recent years, and on a bipartisan basis, the United  States has reassessed and rebalanced our approach to the Indo-Pacific  to take into account the reality of our competitive relationship with  China. So this is a region rich with pressing challenges from North  Korea's nuclear and missile programs to a rollback in human rights and  democracy across the region.   Ambassador Kritenbrink will be able to draw from decades of  experience in the region to lead our efforts in this area.   Also pleased to be supporting Dr. Karen Donfried's nomination, which  is a testament to the Biden administration's effort to rebuild the  transatlantic relationship, which was significantly damaged by the last  administration.   I know that Dr. Donfried's knowledge and experience--including  previously as the Senior Director for European Affairs at the National  Security Council--will serve the country well as we seek to renew that  transatlantic relationship.   These are issues dealing with Russia, Turkey, Belarus, our support  for Ukraine. I hear all the time in speeches about support for these  countries. Wouldn't it be nice to have the person--forget about nice.  Isn't it critical to have the person that can be promoting that view?   There is Monica Medina to be the Assistant Secretary for Oceans and  International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. I am convinced that  she is eminently qualified, including the time she spent as Principal  Deputy Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere at the Department of  Commerce and in a broad variety of leadership roles focused on ocean  conservation, environmental policy, and science.   Likewise, I am pleased to support Ambassador Mary Catherine Phee to  be the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. As I said, we  have an enormous challenge on the African continent.   I support Todd Robinson to be a leader as the Assistant Secretary of  State for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement  Affairs. If we want to deal with the coyotes whom my colleague was  talking about, let's put somebody in a position to go after them. I  know this work is critical to our international efforts to combat  narcotics, to deal with fentanyl, and to deal with the trafficking  routes that extend through Mexico and all the way back to China.   Then there is Jessica Lewis, finally. It is with a mixture of deep  pride and some sorrow that this body will consider the nomination of  Ms. Lewis to be the next Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of  Political-Military Affairs.   Almost 20 years ago, I hired Jessica for her first job on Capitol  Hill as my foreign policy adviser and staff director of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee's Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, of which I  was ranking member. After moving to the Senate and working for Senator  Harry Reid for nearly a decade, she took up the staff director position  of the Foreign Relations Committee. Throughout her tenure in all of  these positions, Members, Senators, and staff on both sides of the  aisle benefited from her deep knowledge of foreign policy, her  leadership, and indeed her love for Congress itself, with all its  nuanced rules and procedures.   Jessica is recognized across party lines as one of the most effective  and trusted leaders on Capitol Hill. She is a trailblazer for women in  national security. When approved by the Senate--and I have no doubt she  will be--she will be the first woman confirmed to hold this position.   It would be impossible to catalogue all of her accomplishments, from  getting countless bills passed through the committee and into law,  supporting efforts to conduct serious oversight of the executive branch  regardless of which party is in power, to striving to build a truly  diverse staff of the Foreign Relations Committee. I have no doubt she  will bring her commitment to mentorship, integrity, and public service  to the State Department as well.   So we expect to see her, after she gets confirmed, back here  answering questions and being part of this incredibly important job  that she will be doing in bringing political and military affairs  together.   I hope that we do not have to go through these 100 nominees, through  2-hour sessions of each nominee, in order to get them to start working  for U.S. national security. That is what is at stake here.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the  first cloture vote on the Medina nomination, that the other three be  10-minute votes.    Mr. President, I know of no other debate before the  Senate.                            ____________________
