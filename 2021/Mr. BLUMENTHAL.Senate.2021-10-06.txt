 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Daniel W. Crowley, a remarkable patriot, war hero,  role model, and public servant. Dan passed away on September 16, 2021,  at the age of 99.   Dan was born in 1922 and raised in Greenwich, CT. He lived through  the Great Depression and enlisted in October 1940 in the U.S. Army Air  Corps. In March 1941, he was sent to the Philippines and assigned to  Nichols Field, which was destroyed by Japanese forces the day after the  attack on Pearl Harbor.   In the following months, Dan fought with the U.S. Army's Provisional  Air Corps Infantry Regiment to fend off three amphibious Japanese  landings on the Bataan Peninsula. On April 9, 1942, the peninsula was  surrendered, and Dan swam to Corregidor Island through shark-infested  waters. Upon arrival, he became part of the 4th Marines, where they  fought valiantly to maintain the shore, until the fortress fell on May  6, 1942.   In 1944, following several brutal work details in the Philippines,  Dan was sent to Japan on a hell ship. In the many months that followed,  Dan mined copper as a slave laborer. Surviving the harsh, demanding  conditions, he was finally liberated on September 4, 1945.   After, in 1958, Dan joined Northwestern Mutual insurance. His acumen  and quick wits earned him fast recognition as one of the company's top  producers, and he even became a member of their million dollar club.   Dan has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to preserving the  memory of his fellow soldiers. In 2013, he played a key role in  renaming a bridge in Simsbury, CT, the ``Bataan Corregidor Memorial  Bridge'' in their honor. I had the privilege of meeting Dan at the  dedication for this bridge, and I can attest firsthand to what a  remarkable model of public service he is.   The next year, Dan returned to Japan as part of the fifth Japanese- American POW Friendship Program. Furukawa executives refused to meet  with him, but he was given the opportunity to visit one of the mines  where he had previously worked. Later, in 2016, Dan attended the  Veterans' Day breakfast hosted by President Obama at the White House.   I have been fortunate to visit with Dan on a number of occasions  since our initial meeting. My office and I assisted him with obtaining  a prisoner of war registration for his license plate in recognition of  his extraordinary service to our country. I also had the honor of  speaking with Dan and meeting his wife, Kelley, this year. On January  4, 2021, I attended a ceremony at Bradley Air National Guard Base,  where Dan was promoted to sergeant and received an honorary Combat  Infantryman Badge and the Prisoner of War Medal. It was a poignant and  powerful moment.   My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Dan's family  during this difficult time. May their many wonderful memories of Dan  provide them solace and comfort in the days ahead.                            ____________________
