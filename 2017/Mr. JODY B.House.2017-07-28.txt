 HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Larry  Jeff Eley, Sr., a friend and strong advocate for farmers, growers, and  landowners in my home district. He passed away suddenly at the age of  71 on July 17.   He was well known in Greene County, Georgia, as a gentle giant and  will be remembered for his love for his family and his tireless efforts  as president of the Greene County Farm Bureau and his steadfast  leadership in the Georgia Association of Conservation Districts.   Farming was Larry's life. He was a guiding force in the community,  who actively worked with State and local leaders to foster and promote  a better understanding of agriculture. He was a leading voice for  Georgia's farmers. Larry's legacy will better ensure that our children  and grandchildren will experience the same opportunities to enjoy the  natural resources of Georgia's 10th Congressional District just as our  parents and grandparents.   Mr. Eley is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Nancy, and their  four children and their grandchildren. Dee Dee and I both extend our  thoughts and prayers to the family during this time of bereavement.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have known Larry and to witness his  passion firsthand. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his  unyielding commitment to the State of Georgia and our agriculture  community.                            ____________________
