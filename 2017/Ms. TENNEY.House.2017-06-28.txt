 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Central  Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired.   Established in Utica in 1929, CABVI, as it is known, provides a wide  range of opportunities for the blind and visually impaired, helping  them to acquire job skills and training, good wages and benefits, and a  greater independence and quality of life.   In their important mission, CABVI employs a segment of our population  that experiences among the highest levels of unemployment in the  country.   CABVI also provides vital health and rehabilitation services for  people experiencing vision loss. Their resources and services have  improved the quality of life for many in our region, including my late  father who spent the last 7 years of his life legally blind and  confined to a wheelchair. My family is forever grateful to them for  their care and kindness.   Today I was honored to welcome to Washington my good friend Rudy  D'Amico, president and CEO of CABVI; Robert Porter, public policy  director; and Leta Laukitis, executive assistant. Joining them from the  southern tier, colleague Ken Fernald, CEO of the Association for Visual  Rehabilitation and Employment in Binghamton, New York. All joined by  Jennifer Small, chief operating officer; John Ellzey, assistive  technology instructor; Katie Lawson, switchboard operator; and  Chervelle Amaker, purchasing agent and buyer.   Mr. Speaker, I thank them for their important work and their  continued dedication to our community. I look forward to continuing to  advocate for them throughout my time in Congress.                            ____________________
