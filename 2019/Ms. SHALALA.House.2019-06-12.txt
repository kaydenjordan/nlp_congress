 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, last week The Washington Post reported that  the administration is canceling English classes, recreational programs,  and legal aid for unaccompanied minors in migrant shelters.   The largest of these shelters, the Homestead detention facility, is  in my district's backyard. The children housed at the Homestead  facility are between the ages of 13 and 17. Despite their youth, they  have already faced unfathomable hardship, including poverty and  violence in their home countries and the journey they have made to  ours.   But because of our anti-immigrant, antichild policies, their hardship  doesn't end at our border. These children are taken to detention  facilities like the one at Homestead, which currently houses 2,350  kids.   I have seen the prison-like conditions in which they are kept. In  fact, if they were in our Federal prisons, they would be better  treated.   In our Federal prisons murderers have 30-minute meals, but at these  facilities for children, the kids have only 15 minutes to eat their  meals.   Federal prisoners are entitled to 300 minutes of phone calls per  month, while these children have only 80 minutes a month to call their  families.   They are closely monitored, unable to leave the compound, kept in  military camp-like rooms with up to 150 kids per room. We do not have a  Federal prison in this country which houses 150 persons in one room.  They are barred from even hugging their friends or siblings. Some of  these kids have been forcefully separated from their parents without  explanation.   And what is more, the Homestead facility is for profit. We are  letting a private company make money off of these children's tears.   Now, without classes, recreational programs, or even legal aid, these  kids are on their own in every way imaginable. This is utterly un- American. The canceling of classes, programs, and legal aid for these  kids is only the latest step in this administration's anti-immigrant  agenda.   We have a moral obligation to treat these children like we would  treat our own, and that means providing them with the support they need  during and after their detention.   I have introduced an amendment to the appropriations bill, H.R. 2740,  that will increase funding for legal services, child advocates, and  post-release services by $10 million. These are basic services that the  administration is legally obligated to provide to unaccompanied  children who are detained in these shelters. Our laws require us to do  so.   Our budget must be smart; it must be careful; and it must be  compassionate. We have a chance to show that there is no excuse for the  mistreatment of our most vulnerable children. I urge my colleagues to  support my amendment to this appropriations bill. These children are  our collective responsibility, and they deserve better.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Chair, let me just remind everyone that these  children are our collective responsibility. They deserve better, and I  urge my colleagues to support my amendment to this appropriations bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
