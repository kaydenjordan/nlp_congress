 Mr. President, before getting to the matter at hand, I  thought I would take a minute to congratulate the New England Patriots,  the Kraft family, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady, and all of the Patriots  players and fans everywhere for the greatest comeback victory in Super  Bowl history. They really demonstrated the grit and determination and  resilience that New Hampshire and New England is known for, and we are  very, very proud of them.   Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in opposing the  nomination of Betsy DeVos to serve as the Secretary of Education. Our  Nation recognized early in its history that public education is a  necessary foundation for our democracy. It is critical that we continue  to support a strong public education system that prepares all of our  young people to participate in our democracy and to compete in the 21st  century workforce.   All public officials, regardless of their party affiliation, should  share a reverence for the importance of public education to our  country's success, both now and into the future. They must show a  commitment to enforcing our laws so that all students have the  opportunity to succeed. I agree with my colleagues that Mrs. DeVos has  not shown a commitment to or an understanding of these principles, and  that is why I oppose her nomination.   This nomination process has been extremely disappointing from the  start. Mrs. DeVos failed to provide critical information on her  finances. Members of the HELP Committee were only given 5 minutes to  question Mrs. DeVos on her views on our Nation's education system.   In the questions she did answer before the committee, Mrs. DeVos  demonstrated a complete lack of experience in, knowledge of, and  support for public education. She was unable to address basic issues-- issues any New Hampshire school board member could discuss fluently.   She showed that she lacks an understanding of issues facing students  with disabilities. She has potential conflicts of interests that she  still has not answered basic questions about. She supports diverting  taxpayer dollars to private schools without accountability  requirements.   As Governor of New Hampshire, I supported public charter schools.  They play an important role in driving innovation in education and in  providing additional opportunities for nontraditional learners, but  they must meet the same standards as other public schools.   In Detroit, Mrs. DeVos led efforts to oppose accountability  requirements, even for for-profit charter schools. In her testimony  before the HELP Committee, she declined to support enforcing  accountability requirements. It is clear that Mrs. DeVos would pursue  policies that would undermine public schools in my home State of New  Hampshire and across our Nation.   In the past several weeks, thousands of Granite Staters--including  students, parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents--have  called and written into my office. They have shared their concerns  about Mrs. DeVos. They understand that she is completely unqualified  for this position. Our children, their families, and our Nation deserve  better than a Secretary of Education who does not value public  education.   Ensuring access to public education for every student is an issue  that is deeply personal to my family. Shortly after my husband Tom and  I welcomed our first child into the world, our son Ben, we found out  that he had severe and pervasive physical disabilities. It became clear  to Tom and me that we were going to need a little bit of extra help if  our son was going to have the kind of future we all want our children  to have.   We were lucky because we found that help in our community--not only  among friends and neighbors but in a public school system that welcomed  Ben. I still remember the day that a schoolbus pulled into our  driveway. We wheeled Ben onto the lift and up into the bus, and off he  went at age 3 to his first day of preschool--a publically funded,  inclusive preschool. As I sat on the stoop and watched the bus pull  away, I found myself thinking that if Ben had been born a generation or  two earlier, Tom and I would have been pressured to put Ben in an  institution. There wouldn't have been the resources in our community or  in our school system to include Ben.   But because of the work of the champions--the families, the  advocates--who went before the Hassan family, Ben was able to go to  school in his hometown. He was able to learn and to make friends, to do  what we all want our children to do. That is the power of public  education. It is the power of making sure that all kids are included.   Our family was able to live like any other family and feel like any  other family because Ben could go to school in his hometown. As Ben  went from preschool to elementary school to middle school to high  school, we found that his peers accepted him, interacted with him, and  grew with him. I still remember a day when I got a call from one of  Ben's teachers, saying that the tire on his power wheelchair had gone  flat. That is the type of call that a parent of a child with complex  needs dreads because it means that you have to stop everything--because  if the wheelchair can't move, your child can't go through their day.   But instead of my needing to take a day off from work and pursue the  repair of Ben's chair, it was other students in our Career and  Technical Education Center in Exeter who came forward and said: ``We  can fix that.'' Their education preparing them for a trade and a career  served Ben's needs that day beautifully. Both Ben and his peers learned  that day. Ben's experience in public education was made possible  because of so many advocates, educators, and families who came before  our family.   But this was not always the case for students who experience  disabilities. When I served in the New Hampshire State Senate, I grew  to know a woman named Roberta. Roberta, born in the early 1950's, had  spent a good portion of her life in our State's school for individuals  with disabilities. Roberta left that State school as we began to work,  after the passage of the IDEA, to bring people out of institutions and  into the communities.   Later, as Roberta learned to advocate for herself and tell her story,  she recorded some of her memories from the Laconia State School, the  separate school--so-called school--for students with disabilities.  Roberta wrote:         Some of the attendants and residents at the Laconia State       School sexually, verbally, emotionally and physically abused       and assaulted me. The staff said they did this to me because       I misbehaved or acted silly. The attendants and residents       there hit and kicked me with their hands and feet. They       pulled my hair, whipped me with wooden or metal coat hangers,       wet towels, hair brushes, mop and broom handles, hard leather       belts, straps, rulers and hard sticks, stainless steel       serving utensils and clothes.    Roberta adds:         Additionally, they bullied me by laughing at me and calling       me names. They spat at me, bit and pinched my arms and other       body parts causing me pain. The employees and supervisors at       the institution threw buckets of cold water on my body,       clothes and all. They said that the cold water would calm me       down.    Roberta's experience was, unfortunately, what life was like for some  students with disabilities before IDEA. Years later, after Roberta left  Laconia State School, after she was reintegrated into her community,  she appeared before a State senate committee that I was chairing  because she was the main proponent of a law that we passed in the New  Hampshire State Senate to remove the word ``retarded'' from all of our  State statutes. Roberta knew that it was the judgment of people who  first interacted with her, people who believed she had intellectual  disabilities, that caused her parents to believe that they had to put  not only Roberta but her sister Jocelyn in an institution. Both Roberta  and Jocelyn happened to have the misfortune of being born with  disabilities.   It is that contrast between Roberta's experience and my son's that  keeps me focused on the importance of making sure that we include all  children in our public school system but also that we have the laws in  place to ensure that they get the free appropriate education that all  American children deserve.  [[Page S720]]    Unfortunately, Mrs. DeVos has demonstrated a lack of understanding of  the challenges facing students with disabilities. At our hearing  earlier this month, I questioned Mrs. DeVos on whether she would  enforce IDEA. Not only did she decline to assure Senators that she  would enforce the law to protect students with disabilities, but she  was confused about whether IDEA was indeed a Federal law to begin with.   While I am pleased that Mrs. DeVos later clarified that she is no  longer confused about whether IDEA is a Federal law, she has done  nothing to reassure me that she would enforce it or that she  understands how fragile the gains we have made under IDEA are.   The voucher system that Mrs. DeVos supports has often, intended or  not, hurt individuals who experience disabilities. Children and  families lose legal protections enshrined in the IDEA. In some cases,  students and their families have to sign away their civil rights before  they can receive their vouchers. Yet many of the private schools that  take those vouchers--the schools that Mrs. DeVos wishes to push  students to--lack basic resources or accommodations for children who  experience disabilities.   So if a family determines that the school that has accepted their  voucher really does not have the resources or the expertise to educate  their child, they have no legal recourse. Mrs. DeVos's unfamiliarity  with IDEA, her comments on students with disabilities was something my  office heard about often from Granite State parents who contacted the  office with concerns about her nomination.   A mother from Hopkinton, NH, wrote to tell me about her daughter who  attends Hopkinton High School and experiences severe disabilities--is  nonverbal and requires assistance for all aspects of her daily care.   This mother wrote:         Despite all of this, because of the extraordinary support       we have received, she is living a rich and loving life at       home and is part of the public school system. I have no       confidence that Betsy DeVos would understand or support the       role that public schools have for taking care of all       students.    This mother also called Mrs. DeVos's lack of understanding of IDEA  ``appalling.''   I also heard from a parent from Concord, NH, who said:         My stepdaughter currently has a 504 plan for both a       physical and cognitive disability at Concord High School,       who, incidentally, are doing an excellent job of working with       her to make sure her learning needs are met. My children       deserve a future and so do all children.    This parent said she was feeling ``vulnerable'' as a result of Mrs.  DeVos's nomination. Parents all across our Nation deserve to know that  the rights of their children will be protected, and they are rightfully  concerned with Mrs. DeVos's nomination.   In New Hampshire, I am proud of our work to build a future where  every child can get the kind of education they need to be competitive  and successful leaders in the 21st century economy. Just last week, I  visited Souhegan High School in Amherst, NJ. Souhegan has become a  pioneer in competency-based education. I visited numerous classrooms  where students were doing hands-on lessons in Earth science, in  literature to make sure they could master the material before them in a  way that would stick with them.   They were great examples of what we have learned about the importance  of hands-on, project-based learning, how much better students retain  information, knowledge, problem-solving skills, when they actually have  a problem to solve, and how important it is for them to learn to  collaborate with their fellow students, just the way we expect people  to collaborate as a team in the workplace.   After I visited the classes, the students at Souhegan had formed a  panel to talk with me. There, students with a variety of interests,  backgrounds, and education levels talked to about how important it was  for them to have control of their own learning, to learn in a way, in a  style that worked for them to work with their peers and build off of  each other's strengths and learn from each other.   I also talked with them about New Hampshire's pilot, project-based  competency assessment program called PACE, something that New Hampshire  received waivers to do over the last year, and they are in the process  of continuing right now. New Hampshire is piloting a program that moves  us away, just as was recommended and foreseen by the Every Child  Succeeds Acts from high-stakes, one-time testing to project-based  assessments that are built into the project-based competency learning  they are doing.   We are seeing great success with this pilot, and schools across the  country are beginning to adopt it as well. That is the power of strong,  innovative public education. This was an approach developed by teachers  and parents and students and our Department of Education and our  statewide school board as well as local school boards together. Just as  we have important initiatives surrounding project-based learning in New  Hampshire, we also have strong public charter schools.   I still recall a visit to our North Country Charter School in one of  the more rural parts of New Hampshire, a school that was formed--a  regional effort--to allow students for whom traditional high school was  not working, whether it be because of their learning style, because of  particular events that were happening in their home, or other emotional  or developmental issues.   It allows them to come together and go to school in a way and in a  place that works for them, keeping them in school, helping New  Hampshire meet its goal set in law that no child drop out of high  school before age 18.    The strength of the students I saw at the Country Charter School  graduation was extraordinary; students who would overcome particular  challenges, whether it was personal, whether it was academic--speaking  for themselves and about themselves and their vision of their own  future to a crowded, excited room of friends and family.   That is another kind of public education that supplements our  statewide public education system and is something we can work together  to do, holding all schools accountable. The vision that Mrs. DeVos, on  the other hand, outlined and has devoted much of her work to, would  dismantle the progress we have made, diverting taxpayer dollars to  private, religious, and for-profit schools without accountability  requirements.   Mrs. DeVos advocates for a voucher system that leaves out students  whose families cannot afford to pay additional tuition costs, and  leaves behind students with disabilities because the schools do not  accommodate their complex needs. In his book, ``Our Kids,'' Robert  Putnam notes that education should be a mechanism to level the playing  field, but today the inequality gap is growing because affluent  students start better prepared and are more able to pay.   Putnam also points out that daycare and transportation needs  constrain the amount of choice that poor parents have when it comes to  voucher programs. We should all be working to fix that gap, but the  voucher programs that Mrs. DeVos advocates for threaten to increase the  gap. The system that Mrs. DeVos advocated for in Detroit, MI, has  undermined public schools and hurt students in the process.   In 2014, Michigan taxpayers spent $1 billion on charter schools, but  laws regulating them are weak and the State demands little  accountability. The Detroit Free Press reported on the Detroit school  system, finding a system where school founders and employees steered  lucrative deals to themselves or to other insiders, where schools were  allowed to operate for years despite their poor academic records.   The Detroit Free Press described a system with no State standards for  those who operate charters and where a record number of charter  schools, run by for-profit companies, refuse to detail how exactly they  are spending taxpayer dollars.   One Detroit mother said that Mrs. DeVos's ``push for charter schools  without any accountability exposed my children and their classmates to  chaos and unacceptable classroom conditions.''   In Florida, the McKay Scholarship Program voucher for students with  disabilities that Mrs. DeVos has pointed to also raises significant  concerns, including no due process rights for students under IDEA, no  accountability requirements for participating schools, and absolutely  no evidence of student success.   Additionally, the McKay voucher often does not cover the full cost of  the  [[Page S721]]  private school, leaving parents responsible for tuition and fees above  the scholarship amount, not to mention responsibility for  transportation. This puts students and their families at risk. Rather  than taking the approach we have in New Hampshire, where charter  schools supplement a strong public education system, this system of  unaccountable schools destabilizes and undermines public schools.   Now, given that Mrs. DeVos's goals for K-12 education are what they  are and the fact that we were only given 5 minutes to question her at  the hearing, many key issues facing American students were not  discussed at all in her confirmation hearing. In particular, we did not  talk about higher education. When I was Governor of New Hampshire, I  was proud of our work to make college more affordable, building a 21st  century workforce pipeline for our businesses.   We froze tuition for the first time in 25 years at our public  university system, and we actually lowered it at our community  colleges. We engaged in increasing and more robust job training  efforts, where we partnered businesses with community colleges or other  learning centers to make sure we were engaged in the kind of job  training that would prepare students for the 21st century economy.   I was hoping that at our hearing for Mrs. DeVos's confirmation, we  would discuss higher education, but issues relating to higher education  have been lost altogether in this discussion. What is clear, though, is  that Mrs. DeVos has absolutely no experience in higher education. Her  written responses following our hearing were troubling. On student  debt, Pell grants, reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and job  training efforts, her responses were vague and offered no vision for  issues that are critical to millions of Americans. When asked about       for-profit colleges, which have had a history of taking       advantage of students, including but not limited to our       veterans, Mrs. DeVos said she was agnostic--that is her       word--about the tax filing status of higher education       institutions. That is just not acceptable.    I believe we should be expanding Pell grants. We should lower the  interest rates on student loans. We should be expanding apprenticeship  and job training opportunities. We need to crack down on predatory for- profit colleges.   We need an Education Secretary who understands and is able to focus  on higher education, and it is clear that Mrs. DeVos does not have that  experience or focus.   Mr. President, our Founders understood that public education for our  citizens was essential to the functioning of our democracy. In 1786,  Thomas Jefferson wrote:         I think by far, the most important bill in our whole code       is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No       other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of       freedom, and happiness.    Generation after generation has worked to build on those ideals,  including, as we do that work, more and more Americans in the process  and creating a system that gives all students an opportunity to  succeed.   We need an Education Secretary who is committed to upholding that  principle, not rolling our progress back, and we should all be working  together to ensure that we have strong neighborhood public schools, not  dismantling them.   I join with my colleagues here today and the thousands from my State  who have made their voices heard. We need just one more vote to defeat  this nomination and to make clear that the Senate truly values our  Nation's public schools.   I surely hope that there is another Senator willing to break with the  President and vote against this woefully unqualified nominee.   We all have learned in this wonderful country of ours, with each  generation, as we include more and more people who have been  marginalized, left out, who weren't counted, that when we include them,  we certainly honor their freedom and dignity--important and sufficient,  of course, in its own right. Then when we do that, we also unleash the  talent and energy of everyone, and that strengthens us all, helps us  thrive, helps our economy grow, and makes sure that America not only  leads but deserves to.   It is our job in the Senate to listen to the thousands speaking up  for our children and for the public education system that serves all  Americans.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr President, today I wish to ask my colleagues to  join me in recognizing Tom Burack and honoring his more than a decade  of service to the State of New Hampshire. As commissioner of the New  Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, he has been a strong  advocate for our State and our environment.   Our economic vitality as a State hinges on our pristine lakes and  rivers, our clean air, and our strong protection of these natural  resources. Under Tom's leadership, the department has focused on  combating the serious challenge of climate change and ensuring that New  Hampshire citizens and visitors have access to clean air, water, and  land while providing excellent customer service--all of which is  critical to our State's economy and future success. This includes the  development of the 2009 Climate Action Plan, New Hampshire's entrance  into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, the creation of the  MtBE Remediation Bureau, and the formation of the State Government  Energy Committee, among many others.   Tom has also led and facilitated a voluntary, informal network of  State agency commissioners for 8 years, helping to bring agencies  together to improve the operations of and drive innovation and  efficiency in State government. He is a leader on the regional and  national levels as well, including envisioning and coleading an overall  modernization of how environmental protection services are delivered  nationwide through a joint State-tribal-Federal initiative known as E- Enterprise for the Environment. All of these actions and the many  others that are too numerous to list have helped to strengthen our  environment, protect public health, and combat climate change.   New Hampshire's natural resources and scenic beauty must be  protected, and doing so requires strong collaboration. As commissioner,  Tom embodied New Hampshire's ``all-hands-on-deck'' spirit, working  collaboratively with our neighboring States on issues like RGGI, local  communities on issues like water quality and contamination, other State  agencies on issues like State government energy efficiency, and  partners at the Federal level.  [[Page S745]]    New Hampshire and our country have benefitted enormously from Tom's  vision, energy, and leadership, and I thank Tom for his tireless  dedication to protecting our environment and his immense contributions  that have helped make New Hampshire a special place to live, work,  visit, and raise a family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Thank you very much.   Senator Murray, I have been very concerned, as you know, with Mrs.  DeVos's lack of understanding of issues facing students with  disabilities. My son Ben's experience in public education was made  possible because there were so many families and advocates who came  before my family to make his inclusion possible.   Before IDEA, students who experienced disabilities in an  institutional setting often didn't get an education at all and were  often mistreated.   Yesterday when I spoke on the floor, I discussed a woman in New  Hampshire named Roberta who had been in our State school before IDEA  was passed and gave accounts of terrible experiences there.   Do you also have concerns with Mrs. DeVos's lack of understanding of  the challenges faced by students who experience disabilities and her  lack of commitment to ensuring that all students have a free and  appropriate public education?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  opposing the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General  of the United States.   Now more than ever, it is critical to have an Attorney General who is  an independent defender of our Constitution, who puts the rule of law  before all else, and who is committed to ensuring that all Americans  have equal access to justice. Unfortunately, I do not believe that  Senator Sessions is fully committed to enacting those principles, and  every American should be concerned that he will not independently stand  up to President Trump.   Senator Sessions was one of Trump's earliest supporters and has been  a key source of influence for the President's actions. White House  Strategist Stephen Bannon recently wrote to the Washington Post:  ``Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most  dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and  has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and  philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''   In the wake of President Trump's first few weeks in office, in which  he signed dozens of Executive orders--including the un-American  backdoor Muslim ban--it was reported that Senator Sessions played a  role in influencing the President's policy and strategy.   My office has heard from thousands in New Hampshire who have had  serious legitimate concerns about the President's actions in his first  few weeks. I am concerned by reports that Senator Sessions pushed for  an even more aggressive approach.   The Washington Post reported: ``The Senator lobbied for a `shock-and- awe' period of executive action that would rattle Congress, impress  Trump's base, and catch his critics unaware. . . . `'   Senator Sessions' record in Congress and his history of standing  against the constitutionally protected rights of millions of Americans  is deeply troubling. These are issues that my office has heard from  constituents across New Hampshire. As a resident from Merrimack wrote:  ``Pick a current civil rights issue and Sessions is on the wrong side  of history.''   I do not have confidence that Senator Sessions would be an  independent Attorney General who would put the rights of all Americans  before the whims of this President, and that is why I oppose this  nomination.   I am incredibly proud that my home State of New Hampshire understands  that the values of inclusion and equality are at the very core of what  makes us American and at the core of our constitutional system. We  believe in freedom and the value of every person, and that is our duty  and our destiny--to extend the same freedoms we enjoy to all of our  people. We value human rights and we see inclusion and equality as core  principles in our laws. These values have helped our State become a  leader in advancing the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, and queer community, recognizing that all people deserve  the legal right to fully participate in the social, civic, and economic  life of our communities.   Years ago, New Hampshire led the way in becoming one of the first  States in the Nation to pass marriage equality, and I took great pride  in casting my vote for that legislation as a State senator. When we  passed that legislation, we made clear once again that when we as a  State or a country bring people in from the margins into the heart and  soul of our democracy, we all get stronger.   About a year after we took that step in New Hampshire to enact  marriage equality, I was sitting on a plane in the window seat, and the  man next to me noticed my name on the notebook I was reading and said:  Aren't you elected in New Hampshire? What do you do there?   I told him I had been a State senator.   He looked at me and said: Did you have anything to do with marriage  equality passing?   Now, I wasn't sure what this man's point of view was as I sat next to  him on this plane ride. I said: Well, yes, I was in the New Hampshire  Senate, and I voted to pass marriage equality.   He said: I want to thank you for it. I am a recruiter for one of our  State's largest employers, and marriage equality is one of the best  recruitment tools we have.   I asked him to expand a little bit on that. He said: It isn't that we  have any particular percentage of LGBTQ applicants or employees that is  unusual, but the fact that New Hampshire passed marriage equality  signals to people we are trying to recruit that we are an open and  inclusive State, where everybody is welcome if they are willing to work  hard and do their part to move us forward.   During my time as Governor, we continued to fight for progress for  the LGBTQ community, including issuing an executive order to prohibit  discrimination in our State government on the basis of gender identity  or gender expression.   Unfortunately, Senator Sessions' record and previous comments call  into question whether he will enforce the Federal laws designed to  promote equality and protect the LGBTQ community. Senator Sessions has  been a vocal opponent of marriage equality, going as far as to label  same-sex marriages as dangerous.  [[Page S902]]    In 2004, he stated: ``But I do believe that it is not disputable that  adopting a same-sex marriage culture undermines and weakens marriage.''   Following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision that guaranteed marriage  equality in all 50 States, Senator Sessions said: ``The marriage case  goes beyond what I consider to be the realm of reality.''   As Attorney General, it would be Senator Sessions' job to implement  and defend this ruling. I am extremely concerned that he would not  follow through with that responsibility.   Senator Sessions has also worked to undermine the Federal hate crimes  law designed to protect LGBTQ Americans. In explaining his vote against  the 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention  Act, Sessions argued that Federal protections for LGBTQ Americans were  not necessary. When debating the law, Sessions said: ``I am not sure  women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of  discrimination.''   Following Senator Sessions' nomination as Attorney General, Judy  Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, for whom that law was named,  wrote a letter for the Human Rights Campaign opposing Sessions'  nomination. Shepard wrote:         In 1998 my son, Matthew, was murdered because he was gay, a       brutal hate crime that continues to resonate around the world       even now.        Following Matt's death, my husband, Dennis, and I worked       for the next 11 years to garner support for the federal Hate       Crimes Prevention Act. We were fortunate to work alongside       members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, who       championed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate       Crimes Prevention Act with the determination, compassion, and       vision to match ours as the parents of a child targeted for       simply wanting to be himself. Senator Jeff Sessions was not       one of these members. In fact, Senator Sessions strongly       opposed the hate crimes bill--characterizing hate crimes as       mere ``thought crimes.''        My son was not killed by ``thoughts'' or because his       murderers said hateful things. My son was brutally beaten       with the butt of a .357 magnum pistol. [They] tied him to a       fence, and left him to die in freezing temperatures because       he was gay. Senator Sessions' repeated efforts to diminish       the life-changing acts of violence covered by the Hate Crimes       Prevention Act horrified me then, as a parent who knows the       true cost of hate, and it terrifies me today to see that this       same person is now being nominated as the country's highest       authority to represent justice and equal protection under the       law for all Americans.        As Attorney General, Senator Sessions would be responsible       for not only enforcing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, but a       myriad of other Civil Rights laws including the Violence       Against Women Act, which includes explicit protections for       LGBTQ people. Senator Sessions' very public record of       hostility towards the LGBTQ community and federal legislation       designed to protect vulnerable Americans, including the       Voting Rights Act, makes it nearly impossible to believe that       he will vigorously enforce statutes and ideas that he worked       so hard to defeat.    I agree with Judy Shepherd, and it is clear that Senator Sessions'  record shows that he will not stand up for the rights of LGBTQ Granite  Staters and Americans if he becomes Attorney General.   There are other issues of concern as well. I have always fought to  protect a woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own  health care decisions and control her own destiny, and I always will.  Roe v. Wade is a landmark decision that protects women and their access  to abortion. It guarantees a fundamental right for women, and it  affirms that a woman has the right to decide whether to continue or  terminate a pregnancy without government interference.   Sessions' record leaves questions on whether he will enforce the law  in this area. During his time in the Senate, Sessions has been  dedicated to opposing a woman's constitutional right to safe and legal  abortion. He voted to grant legal status to an embryo. He has  repeatedly voted to deny women in the military the right to use their  own private funds for abortion care at military hospitals. He has said  that he would like to see a woman's constitutional right to make her  own health care decisions overturned.   This is unacceptable for a nominee to lead the Department of Justice  whose role would be to uphold the very law that he seeks to overturn.  We also know that a woman's right to make her own health decisions  isn't just a matter of freedom. It is a matter of health. It is also a  matter of economics and finances.   When women have to pay more for their health care, and it puts them  in an economic disadvantage. As Governor, I restored family planning  funds and pushed to restore State funding to Planned Parenthood because  I know how critical access to these services are for the women and  families of my State.   Planned Parenthood provides critical primary and preventive health  care services to thousands of New Hampshire women, including preventive  care, birth control, and cancer screenings. There are countless stories  of women whose lives have been changed as a result of access to Planned  Parenthood in my State.   A young woman named Alyssa in my State lost her health insurance. She  was on her father's health insurance. She was younger than age 26.  Suddenly her father passed away, and then she had a medical emergency.  She didn't know where to go. Grieving for her father, she was also  without health insurance. She turned to Planned Parenthood, and they  were able to provide her the care that she needed.   Alyssa's story and the stories of thousands of others across our  State make it clear why it is essential that we have an Attorney  General who will protect a woman's constitutionally protected right to  make her own health care decisions.   Senator Sessions has voted six times to block patients from accessing  health care at Planned Parenthood health centers. Senator Sessions has  stated that Planned Parenthood should not receive Federal funds for any  services because, among the other health care services it provides, it  provides the constitutionally protected care--abortion--that a woman  needs when she decides she must terminate a pregnancy.   Senator Sessions has opposed women's access to no-cost birth control  that is now provided through the Affordable Care Act. Sessions even  refused to condemn President Trump's remarks in the ``Access  Hollywood'' tapes released last year, saying that he did not  characterize the behavior President Trump described as sexual assault.   He voted against the 2014 reauthorization of the Violence Against  Women Act, which is critical for the investigation and prosecution of  violent crimes against women. The Violence Against Women Act was signed  into law by President Clinton in 1994 and has been reauthorized by  bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 and 2005 and signed by  President George W. Bush.   The idea that the Attorney General of the United States would not  support his commonsense legislation to protect women from violence is  unacceptable. As Governor, I also fought to expand economic opportunity  for women and families.   We passed the New Hampshire Paycheck Fairness Act in New Hampshire,  making sure that an equal day's work gets an equal day's pay.   I also strongly support efforts to expand paid family leave to ensure  that workers are able to support their families during times of need at  home.   I am troubled that Senator Sessions has worked to roll back the  progress of equal pay. Senator Sessions voted against the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and has consistently voted against the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   I am far from the only one in New Hampshire who opposes the idea of  Senator Sessions as our Nation's top law enforcement officer. I have  heard from many of my constituents regarding the impact of Senator  Sessions' nomination on women's right.   One constituent wrote:         I truly fear for the future of women's rights and my       daughter's right to an autonomous life if Jeff Sessions is       confirmed. The bottom line, Senator Sessions has a record of       undermining the civil and constitutional rights of women in       this country.    On another topic, in recent weeks there has been much discussion  about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, otherwise known  as IDEA, and the fact that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos seemed  confused about the fact that IDEA is Federal law and also declined to  commit to enforcing it. This contributed to my vote against Mrs.  DeVos's nomination yesterday.   What is also appalling is Senator Sessions' previous comments on  IDEA. In 2000, Senator Sessions gave a speech  [[Page S903]]  on the Senate floor suggesting that disciplinary problems in schools  stemmed from IDEA. Sessions said:         Teachers I have been talking to have shared stories with       me. I have been in 15 schools around Alabama this year. I       have talked to them about a lot of subjects. I ask them about       this subject in every school I go to, and I am told in every       school that this is a major problem for them. In fact, it may       be the single most irritating problem for teachers throughout       America today.    He continued.         There is no telling how many instructional hours are lost       by teachers in dealing with behavior problems. In times of an       increasingly competitive global society, it is no wonder       American students fall short. Certain children are allowed to       remain in the classroom robbing the other children of hours       that can never be replaced.        There is no need to extend the school day. There is no need       to extend the school year. If politicians would just make it       possible for educators to take back the time that is lost on       a daily basis to certain individuals, there is no doubt we       would have better educated students.    He added:         It is clear that IDEA '97 not only undermines the       educational process, it also undermines the authority of       educators. In a time when our profession is being called upon       to protect our children from increasingly dangerous sources,       our credibility is being stripped from us.    As I have discussed over the last couple of weeks, the passage of  IDEA was a groundbreaking moment in American history for people who  experience disabilities in their families. After IDEA was passed, all  schools--all public schools in our country--were required to provide a  free and appropriate education for children with disabilities.   Children like my son, now 28 years old, and a graduate of Exeter High  School, who used to be relegated to institutions, subjected to inhumane  conditions and maltreatment, treated as truly less than human were  included in our public schools. There is not a parent of a child like  my son who does not acknowledge that including new people with  different needs in any setting can be challenging, but we are  Americans, and we are supposed to do challenging things, and that is  what IDEA challenged us to do.   I have seen the power of inclusion not only in my own home, but in my  community and in our schools. I have seen it strengthen other students.  Just last week, one of my son's classmates from fifth grade reached out  because he had seen the coverage of the hearing concerning Mrs. DeVos's  nomination. He said in an email to me: You know, I don't remember much  about fifth grade, but I do remember having lunch with Ben. And I  remember even now Ben's lighthearted disposition.   What a lesson for our children to learn that even if you have severe  and debilitating physical disabilities that prevent you from speaking  or typing or walking or eating in a typical way, you could be  lighthearted and love your life. There are always challenges connected  to including new students with different learning styles, different  behaviors. But because of IDEA, we have learned how to help those  students cope and learn and adjust their behavior. And for anybody to  suggest that it is the fault of people with disabilities, that it is  their disability that is undermining our education, is appalling.    Various groups who represent individuals with disabilities have,  therefore, voiced their opposition to Senator Sessions' nomination. The  Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates has written to the Judiciary  Committee arguing that:         [Sessions] has compiled a longstanding and consistent       record, including public statements, policy proposals, and       other various actions that serve to discriminate against the       rights and dignity of children and adults with disabilities.        Sessions' disdain for special education and opposition to       community integration of individuals with disabilities is at       odds with the laws, inconsistent with our nation's commitment       to supporting individuals with disabilities, and will lead to       far higher societal costs in the future.    And a constituent with Etna, NH, wrote to share her concerns on  Senator Sessions' record on individuals with disabilities. She said:         Senator Sessions has a long, well-documented history of       active opposition to respect for the human rights of the       American citizenry, particularly those of us who experience       multiple marginalizations in our society. And as such, he is       unfit for the office of Attorney General. It is abundantly       clear to me, as a disabled woman, that his Justice Department       would not support my equal protection under the law.    Americans with disabilities and their families deserve better than an  Attorney General who has consistently spoken out against their rights.   I also have concerns about Senator Sessions' voting rights record.  Voting is our most fundamental right, and ensuring that everyone can  exercise that right is critical to making our democracy successful.  Everyone deserves representation and the opportunity to vote on who  represents them.   Throughout his time in office, Senator Sessions has demonstrated an  opposition to ensuring that all Americans have the right to vote. In  1986, Senator Sessions called the Voting Rights Act ``an intrusive  piece of legislation.'' In 2006, after the Senate passed the Voting  Rights Act reauthorization, Senator Sessions joined other Republicans  in issuing a highly unusual committee report that sought to undermine  the same legislation that they had all just voted to support. Chief  Justice Roberts cited the report in his Shelby County v. Holder  opinion, which gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Senator  Sessions celebrated the Shelby County decision and stated it was,  ``good news for the South.''   Since that decision, and despite the passage of voting restrictions  in several States by Republican legislatures, Sessions has said, ``I  don't think the Supreme Court ruling has damaged voting rights in any  real way.''   It is clear that Senator Sessions is not committed to protecting  voting rights. Many Granite Staters have written to my office,  highlighting Senator Sessions' record on voting rights as a reason that  the Senate should oppose his nomination.   A constituent from Tilton, NH, said:         Our country has battled long and hard to throw off the       errors of our past, but voting rights are under assault. Jeff       Sessions is not the right person to safeguard the integrity       of our voting process, nor can he be trusted to work on       behalf of all Americans in the cause of Justice.    At a time when we are discussing ensuring equality, justice, and  inclusion for all of our citizens, I am reminded of my father's story.  My father was born and raised in the segregated South. His father was a  traveling shoe salesman, and his mother was a school teacher who,  during the Depression, got paid in food stamps. That is what kept the  family going. Through hard work, a scholarship, taking on jobs like  waiting tables and moving furniture, and a bit of good luck, my dad was  able to attend Princeton University. It wasn't long before his studies  were interrupted, however, when, following the bombing of Pearl Harbor,  he left to volunteer to fight in World War II, eventually being thrown  into the Battle of the Bulge.   The Battle of the Bulge marked one of the first times in World War II  that White and Black American soldiers fought alongside each other.  Thousands of miles away from the school where he had been studying,  this young man from the Deep South found himself learning more about  the values of equality and inclusion than he ever could have learned  back at home. And after my father's experience in that battle, where  African-American soldiers fought and died alongside their White  counterparts, Dad returned home to a life of working to make the notion  that every single one of us counts a reality. Our Founders believed in  that principle, that when you count everyone and bring more people in  from the margins, we all grow stronger.   We know that our Founders didn't count everyone at first, but they  had faith that we would continue striving, as our Constitution commands  us to, to build a more perfect union, that generation after generation,  we would continue to deliver on our Nation's promise of equality. And  while the road to greater inclusion is not without significant  challenges, time and again, we have persevered to build a better  future.   We need leaders who are committed to those values and who are  committed to enforcing the laws that have included more and more  Americans. Senator Jeff Sessions' record shows that he is not committed  to those values, and he has demonstrated that he lacks the independence  needed to stand up to President Trump.   For these reasons, I cannot support Senator Sessions to be the next  Attorney General of the United States. I  [[Page S904]]  urge my colleagues to vote no on this nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
