 Madam Speaker, I wonder if President Trump intended for  his budget to be a joke. After all, he entitled it ``Better America''  but proposed massive cuts to education programs, the Special Olympics,  Medicare, Medicaid, and AIDS programs.   Nothing about that will make America better. In fact, it will make  life worse for millions of Americans.   Trump also likes to call himself the Builder President, but his  budget includes not a single penny to fund the country's most critical  infrastructure project, the Gateway project.   Gateway is a nationally significant project to replace the crumbling  tunnels that run under the Hudson River  [[Page H2656]]  and connect New York and New Jersey. It is a critical project to truly  build a better America. After all, Gateway is the linchpin of Amtrak's  Northeast Corridor, which supports 30 percent of the Nation's jobs and  produces 20 percent of our GDP.   The Gateway project isn't just about connecting New York and New  Jersey. It is about ensuring the stability of the national economy and  the free flow of workers from North Carolina to Maine.   Trump can't be the Builder President if he doesn't build anything.                            ____________________
