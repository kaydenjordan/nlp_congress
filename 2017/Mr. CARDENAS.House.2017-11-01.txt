 Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and an honor to  represent the community of the San Fernando Valley here in the United  States Congress. I think it is my duty and responsibility to make sure  that when something is going on in Washington, people should know what  is going to happen to them and how it affects them.   I think it is really important for everybody to understand that right  now in the workings--and it is probably going to come to this floor in  just a few days--is the Speaker Ryan-McConnell tax giveaways to big  corporations, which will actually increase taxes for working families,  working mothers and fathers.   I think it is important for people to understand that this is  something that is being sold as a middle-income tax cut. Actually, what  it is going to do is it is going to cut the take-home income to middle  class families.   What it is going to mean is if you are a police officer or a teacher  or a waitress, you are going to see less money every week. It might be  $5 less a week, it might be $50 less a week, it might be $100.   Let me tell you, the opposite of what is going to happen should this  become law is that the biggest corporations in America are going to see  $1 million less in taxes a week, maybe $50 million less in taxes paid a  week, maybe $100 million less per week paid in taxes.   Some people are thinking: Well, they earned it. They should keep it.   Well, okay. I understand what you are saying. But, see, this is the  fundamental problem of this $1.5 trillion reduction in the ability for  our Federal Government to fund things like Medicaid and Medicare.  Because when we see less money, you are going to see Members on this  floor and in committees throughout this House and in the United States  Senate saying: Well, we don't have the money.   When they see a mother whose child has cerebral palsy and she is  saying, ``I go to work every single day, and thank you, government, for  allowing my child to be in a program so that he or she can be safe  while I go to work,'' they are going to say, ``You know what? I agree  with you, ma'am. We should fund that, but since we don't have the money  anymore, we are going to stop funding that.''   This is a woman who just wants to work for a living. This is a person  who just wants to make sure that she can have the dignity of work and  have her child in a safe place, but we are going to cut those programs  if we have this tax giveaway go through Congress and signed by this  President.                                time  1045    You see, it is a multistep process. And what some of my colleagues-- and  [[Page H8303]]  so far, the only ones voting for this tax giveaway are my Republican  colleagues. I say that accurately, not to be partisan, but just to be  honest and accurate. They say we have to do this; it is going to  stimulate the economy.   Well, also, in this package, this plan that they want to make into a  law, basically what it will do, it will actually incentivize the  biggest corporations in America, American corporations. It is going to  incentivize them to go ahead and close up shop in your neighborhood and  go set up shop somewhere else in the world.   And the only connection they are going to have with you, ladies and  gentlemen, is they are going to want to sell those products to you,  built by other than American hands in other parts of the world. The  only other connection they are going to have is this: They are going to  be able to bring their money, their profits, back to the United States,  pretty much free and clear, and just count their money here, where they  call themselves an American corporation.   I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, that we recognize that  this is something that is wrong. This is something that is going to  hurt the middle class. This is something, again, if you are a teacher,  if you are a police officer, if you are busdriver, this is going to  hurt you.   If you are a single mother who is working every single day, proud to  do that, you are going to see that you are not going to have the  support you need to make sure that that childcare continues for your  child.   If you are a family member that has a mother or father whose only  income is Social Security, they probably depend on Meals on Wheels.  They probably depend on programs like that. Some of that comes from  your Federal Government. But when these Republican colleagues cut $1.5  trillion out of the United States budget, it is going to come out of  you, ladies and gentlemen. The people who have worked hard, seniors who  are finally retired and should have the dignity of having a dignified  life and having at least one darned meal a day, that is where it is  going to come out of.   Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to warn you, please call your Members  of Congress. Please make sure that you let them know: I don't want that  kind of giveaway.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks  to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle A of title IX, add the following new       section:       SEC. 9__. STUDY ON USE OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES TO SUPPORT                     WILDLAND FIRE RESPONSE AND MANAGEMENT.         (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall       conduct a study to evaluate--        (1) the feasibility, safety, and cost effectiveness of       using unmanned aerial vehicles for the purposes of supporting       wildland fire response and suppression and forest restoration       and management; and        (2) the effect that increased use of unmanned aerial       vehicles for such purposes will have on employment.        (b) Consultation.--In conducting the study, the Secretary       of Agriculture shall consult with the heads of other Federal       agencies involved in wildfire suppression and aviation,       including the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of       Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, and the       Secretary of Transportation.        (c) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than two years after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Agriculture shall submit to Congress a report containing the       results of the study.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Cardenas) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, this year, wildfires have devastated the  American West. It has been particularly tragic in my home State of  California. Entire neighborhoods are gone, and families have been left  with nothing.   While we know that proper forest management requires burning, we need  to be able to contain wildfires that threaten communities.   This month, wildfires killed 42 people, burned over 245,000 acres,  and destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures, most of them people's  family homes, according to Cal Fire.   The fires aren't just dangerous themselves, they produce thick smoke,  toxic ash, and debris that pose long-lasting risks to our health and to  the environment.   These wildfires continue to grow in frequency and ferocity. We must  ensure that we are using all of the available tools to prevent and  contain these fires. That is why I ask that this amendment, which  promotes innovation in wildfire management, be adopted.   The amendment would require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a  study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and cost effectiveness of  using unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise known as drones, for the  purposes of fighting wildfires. It will also study the use of drones  for forest restoration and management, which could be effective for  replanting remote areas of forest.   The Secretary of Agriculture would have to work with several other  agencies that also deal with wildfire suppression and aviation. This  amendment would require consultation with the Department of  Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safety  for our aircraft and the pilots flying in the same airspace.   It would also assess the impact of using drones on employment in the  U.S. Innovation will take us into the future.                                time  1645    But we need to know, eyes wide open, how this affects the employment  landscape of our communities. And that is why these studies are also  important.   The Department is required to report to Congress within 2 years of  enactment. If implemented, I look forward to seeing the results of this  study. I believe it will help add another tool to the toolkit in  protecting American lives, homes, property, businesses, wildlife, and  forests from devastating fires.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt amendment No. 4, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I like the kind words that my colleagues  have said about this amendment, and I hope that it goes forward.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
