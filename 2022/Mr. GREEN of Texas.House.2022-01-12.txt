 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today in  support of this legislation because the Guard and Reserve deserve  parity. They have been there for us, and we must be there for them.   When natural disasters beset the land and there are wildfires on the  West Coast, they are there. When hurricanes ravage the Gulf Coast, they  are there. When tornadic activities are within all the midsection of  the country, they are there. They have been there for us, and we must  be there for them.   They do leave their families, just as the Active-Duty servicepersons  do. Yes, they leave their children. They leave their wives. They leave  newborns. They come to severe and protect us, just as they did after  the assault on the Capitol.   They were here to prevent democracy from being eroded. They were here  to protect the President and the Vice President. They have been here  for us, and we must be there for them.   They have been there when many of us had no other hope other than to  have them show up to defend us.   I remember Katrina. I remember what was happening in New Orleans. I  went down there. I saw the National Guard come in. I saw them protect  and defend.   We have a duty and an obligation to them, and this is our opportunity  to fulfill it.   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for what you are doing today for a  multiplicity of reasons, one being that I don't want to see what  happened to the Merchant Marine happen to the National Guard and the  Reserve. It took them 44 years to get GI benefits. We cannot allow this  to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I am there, I am here, and I will be there for them.
