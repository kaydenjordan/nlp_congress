 Mr. President, California and the nation lost a  trailblazer and a war hero. Mr. Eddie Fung served our country bravely  throughout his tour with the Army National Guard as part of the 2nd  Battalion, 131st Field Artillery of the 36th Infantry Division,  including 3\1/2\ years in a Japanese prisoners of war camp. Mr. Fung  will be buried with full military honors at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park  in Colma, CA, on June 20, 2018.   Born in San Francisco in 1922, Eddie left home at 16 to become a  cowboy in Texas. He joined the National Guard at 17, and his unit was  activated in November 1941 as part of the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field  Artillery of the 36th Infantry Division that was sent to Java, now part  of Indonesia, to fight the invading Japanese in the early months of  WWII.   Eddie became the only Chinese-American soldier captured by Imperial  Japan during World War II. His battalion was known as the Lost  Battalion, as it was not until near the end of the war that there was  any news of what happened to the men.   Of the 558 men and officers who landed on Java on January 11, 1942,  534 became prisoners of war, POWs. Ninety-nine were sent to Japan to be  slave laborers at Japanese factories and mines, and 435, including  Eddie, were sent to work on the Thai-Burma ``Death'' Railway that was  made famous by the film ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.'' Eddie endured  nearly 4 years of grueling work, near-starvation, beatings, and  tropical diseases as he worked on the infamous railroad project that  resulted in the loss of over 12,000 Allied POW and 70,000 Asian lives.  Eighty-nine of the men from the battalion died in captivity.   Although Eddie said his capture was a defining moment in his life,  the horrific experience is just one aspect of his long and rich life.  It includes his Chinese-American upbringing and his life after the war,  when he studied chemistry at Stanford University on the GI bill. He  also worked as a metallurgist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and  became a Tai Chi master after retirement.   As he concluded in his autobiography, ``The Adventures of Eddie Fung:  Chinatown Kid, Texas Cowboy, Prisoner of War,'' University of  Washington Press: ``Taking my life as a whole, I've had many more good  days than I've had bad ones. But even the bad days serve a purpose.  They remind me of how good I have it now, in the sense that if you have  never known hunger, you will not appreciate food; if you have never  been enslaved, you will not appreciate what it means to be free.''   Eddie Fung is a hero and a role model, and we will miss his vibrant  spirit. The thoughts of San Franciscans and Californians are with his  wife, Judy Yung of Santa Cruz.                            ____________________
