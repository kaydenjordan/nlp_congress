 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act. This  legislation will authorize the Smithsonian Institution to establish a  Women's History Museum, which will be located alongside our existing  Smithsonian museums in our nation's capital.   The contributions by women to the history and advancements of the  United States are historic and consequential. Women have always served  this nation, from nurses in the Revolutionary War to the ceaseless  quest today for equal pay, civil liberties, and equal access to health  care.   I am particularly determined to ensure that the contributions and  perspectives of women of color are reflected in this proposed  institution, as our country must demonstrate their historic and  unquestionable significance. The creation of the Smithsonian Women's  History Museum will allow all people in this nation and the world to  better recognize and appreciate the significant contributions women  have made throughout history.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
