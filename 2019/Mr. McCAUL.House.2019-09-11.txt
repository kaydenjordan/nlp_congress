 Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition  to H.R. 1941, which will block oil and natural gas lease sales in the  Atlantic and Pacific.   To start, this bill reduces the United States' ability to develop our  domestic energy resources. Furthermore, it emboldens Russia to continue  to use its oil and gas as a weapon against Europe.   At a time when Putin is using all available tools to sow discord and  chaos around the world especially in Europe and the Middle East, we  need to work together to stop him from further harming our national  security interests and those of our allies. This bill is a step in the  wrong direction and will further empower Putin   In addition to this bill's geo-political ramifications, it also  ignores the fact that American energy extraction technology and  techniques are the best in the world. Inhibiting U.S. energy production  will create a void for Russia and others to fill with their more  ecologically damaging methods, while also sacrificing American jobs.   Based on the negative effects H.R. 1941 will have on global security,  the environment, and our economy, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  bill.
