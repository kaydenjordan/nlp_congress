 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life of an Alabama  hero, Officer Sean Tuder, of the Mobile Police Department. Officer  Tuder was tragically killed on January 20 while conducting an  investigation.   Officer Tuder joined the Mobile Police Department in 2016. He was  named Officer of the Month for his exceptional work in improving public  safety. As another sign of his commitment to service, Sean was a member  of the Alabama National Guard.   Mr. Speaker, Officer Tuder was the second Alabama police officer  killed in the line of duty this month.   Police officers are the peacekeepers of society. They go to work  every day in an effort to keep our families in our community safe.  Sean's story reminds us that we should never take their sacrifices for  granted.   To Sean's wife, Krissy, and his entire family, know that you are in  our prayers and will continue to be in our prayers in the months and  years ahead.   We will never allow Sean's legacy of servant leadership and sacrifice  to be forgotten. May the words written in Matthew's Gospel comfort all  of us:         Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the       sons of God.                            ____________________
