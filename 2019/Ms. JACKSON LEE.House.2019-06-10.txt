 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3151,  the ``Taxpayer First Act of 2019.''   H.R. 3151 aims to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  modernize and improve the Internal Revenue Service, and for other  provisions.   The bill would create an independent means for taxpayers to appeal  actions of the IRS, limits the capacity of private debt collectors to  target low-income citizens, allows taxpayers to request an  identification protection PIN number to protect themselves from  identity theft, and creates a single point of contact so that taxpayer  conversations with IRS agents can be documented and tracked.   It is critical that we amend the Internal Revenue Code because we  have a duty to our constituents to improve their contact with the  Internal Revenue Service concerning appeals, identification protection,  and financial inequity.   This legislation also codifies the popular Volunteer Income Tax  Assistance Program and authorizes $30 million in matching grants for  the program.   When enacted, H.R. 3151 will create a better framework for the  Internal Revenue Service which will in turn ensure that American  taxpayers are at the forefront of our agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3151  to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 bringing it into the 21st  century.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        June 10, 2019, on page H4364, the following appeared: A motion  to reconsider was laid on the table.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise in strong support of H.R. 3151, the ``Taxpayer First Act of  2019.'' [ETC . . .]      The online version has been corrected to show the Jackson Lee  General Leave Statement in the proper position in debate.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2476,  the ``Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism Act  of 2019.''   H.R. 2476 reauthorizes the Department of Homeland Security's  Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP).   The bill would fund the NSGP at $75 million through fiscal year 2024;  where $50 million would be reserved for nonprofit institutions located  within UASI jurisdictions, and $25 million would be reserved for  nonprofit institutions located outside of UASI jurisdictions.   This bill is caused by the recent increase in violence and threats of  violence against nonprofit institutions.   Examples of such violence against nonprofit organizations include:   April 27--attack on the Poway synagogue that killed 11 April 21--a  coordinated terrorist attack on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka that  killed nearly 250 people and injured more than 500 people.   March 15--the deadly New Zealand mosque shootings, where 5o people  were killed.   It is critical that we better understand the seriousness of such  violent crimes as they impact not only the victims, but also their  families, communities, and the generations of people to come.   This bill will allow the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to--Target  activities, including physical security enhancement equipment,  inspection and the screening systems.   Pay for security training relating to physical security and  cybersecurity, target hardening, terrorism awareness, and employee  awareness.   Along with, any other appropriate activity, including cybersecurity  resilience activities, as determined by the Administrator.   When enacted, H.R. 2476 will create a better understanding on how we  can manage and prevent terrorist acts towards non-profit organizations  by targeting activities and increasing security training.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2476  to confront such violence against nonprofit institutions, which pose as  a strong threat to the citizens of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1158,  ``DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams Act of 2019.''   H.R. 1158 codifies DHS' National Cybersecurity and Communications  Coordination Center (NCCIC) Hunt and Incident Response Teams which the  Department currently deploys to provide intrusion analysis, identify  malicious actors, analyze malicious tools, and provide mitigation  assistance to entities requesting assistance after a cybersecurity  incident.   H.R. 1158 also requires the NCCIC to submit information to Congress  regarding metrics for the teams, at the end of the first four years  after enactment.   In 2017, a malware named NotPetya was released from the hacked  servers of a Ukrainian software firm servicing a management program  used by some of world's largest corporations, causing an estimated $10  billion in damage.   When this bill passes, it will assess and mitigate situations of  cyberterrorism that undermine our nation's security and civil liberties  such as our national elections.   Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated every day.  [[Page H4369]]    Due to the vulnerability of corporations' operations, we need  extensive measures to identify, analyze, and alleviate threats of  cyberattacks.   Affected asset owners and operators will receive critical information  to improve their overall network and control systems security to lower  cybersecurity risks, and other recommendations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1158  to protect our nation from malicious attempts of cyberterrorism that  strategically weaken our democracy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2083,  the ``Homeland Procurement Reform Act.''   H.R. 2083 would reform the . way the Department of Homeland Security  procures uniforms and items related to national security interests.   This bill seeks to encourage the procurement of domestically sourced  uniform items to ensure higher-quality uniforms and equipment are  issued to the Department.   Specifically, this bill would allocate that no less than one-third of  the funds obligated for uniforms and protective equipment are used for  items that are manufactured in part or provided in the United States by  entities that qualify as a U.S. small business.   Additionally, H.R. 2083 will ensure that uniforms and protective  equipment are purchased at fair and reasonable prices, and that uniform  allowances provided to Department frontline personnel are adequate.   Last, the bill mandates that suppliers--   store such covered item in a locked area;   report any pilferage or theft of such covered item occurring at any  stage before delivery of such covered item; and   destroy any defective or unusable covered item bearing official DHS  insignia not manufactured in the US.   I stand to support this bill that will bring more opportunities for  American small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2083  to reform the way the Department of Homeland Security procures uniforms  and items related to national security interests.
