 Madam President, tomorrow will be 4 weeks--4 weeks-- since House Democrats impeached the President of the United States with  purely partisan support.   Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff did not wait to fill out the  factual record. They did not even wait to see their own subpoenas  through the legal system. They plowed ahead for two reasons: They said  impeachment was too urgent to wait--too urgent to wait--and they said  they had already proven their case.   But since then, House Democrats have spent 4 weeks contradicting both  of those claims. They spent 4 weeks demonstrating through their actions  that impeachment is actually not that urgent--not that urgent--and they  do not actually have much confidence in their case.   An arbitrary 4-week delay does not show urgency. These demands for  the Senate to precommit to reopening the House investigation do not  show confidence. There is a reason why the House inquiry that led to  President Nixon's resignation took 14 months of hearings in addition to  the separate special prosecutor. There is a reason why the Clinton  impeachment inquiry drew on years of prior investigation and mountains  of testimony from firsthand fact witnesses. That is because both of  those Houses of Representatives knew they had to prove their case-- prove their case before submitting it to the Senate for judgment.   Both situations involved legal battles over executive privilege and  extensive litigation, both times not after a trial had been handed to  the Senate but beforehand. When the cases were actually being compiled,  there were mountains of evidence, mountains of testimony, and long  legal battles over privilege. None of this discovery took place over  here in the Senate.   The Constitution gives the sole power of impeachment to the House. If  the House majority wants to impeach a President, the ball is in their  court, but they have to do the work. They have to prove their case.  Nothing--nothing in our history or our Constitution says a House  majority can pass what amounts to a half-baked censure resolution and  then insist that the Senate fill in the blanks. There is no  constitutional exception for a House majority with a short attention  span.   I think everyone knows this process has not been some earnest,  factfinding mission with House Democrats following each thread wherever  it leads. The Speaker of the House did not reluctantly decide to  impeach after pouring over secondhand impressions of  [[Page S168]]  civil servants. This was a predetermined political conclusion. Members  of her conference had been publicly promising it literally for years.   That is why the investigation stopped long before the House had come  anywhere near proving what they allege. They pulled the plug early  because the facts were never the point. They were never the point. The  point was to check a political box.   For goodness' sake, the very morning after the House's historic vote,  Speaker Pelosi literally chastised reporters for asking too many  questions about impeachment. She tried to change the subject to  economic policy. She said:         Any other questions? . . . Anybody want to talk about the       SALT tax. . . . I'm not going to answer any more questions on       this--    Referring to impeachment.   Really? Really? You impeach a President of the United States, and the  very next morning, there is nothing to see here? Does that sound like  the Speaker of the House really thinks the survival of the Republic is  on the line? Does anyone really think that if Democrats truly believe  the President of the United States was a criminal who is imperiling our  country, they would have abandoned the search for evidence because they  didn't want to make time for due process; that they would have pulled  the plug on the investigation just because it sounded good to finish by  Christmas; that they would have delayed the trial for months while they  test-drove new talking points; that they would have been trying to  change the subject 12 hours after the vote?   I cannot say what Democrats do and do not really believe, but they  certainly do not seem to display the urgency or the seriousness you  would expect from people who actually thought they had proven the  President should be removed.   On television last weekend, the Speaker bragged that ``this President  is impeached for life,'' regardless of what the Senate does--regardless  of what the Senate does, as if the ultimate verdict were sort of an  afterthought.   Likewise, the Senate Democratic leader recently said that as long as  he can try to use the trial process to hurt some Republicans'  reelection chances, ``it's a win-win.'' That is what this is all about.  The Democratic leader just laid it right out there in case anybody had  any doubt.   What a revealing admission. Forget about the fate of the Presidency.  Forget about the Constitution. As long as the process helps Democrats'  political fortunes, our Democratic colleagues call it a ``win-win.'' Do  these sound like leaders who really believe we are in a constitutional  crisis, one that requires the most severe remedy in our entire system  of government? Does it sound like that?   Here is how deep we have come into bizarro world. The latest  Democratic talking point is, if the Senate conducts a trial based on  what the House itself looked at, we will be engaged in a coverup. Did  you get that? Unless the Senate steps outside of our lane and takes it  upon ourselves to supplement the House case, it is a coverup?   Do they think the entire country has forgotten what they were saying  just a couple of days ago? We heard over and over that the House case,  on its own, was totally damming and convincing. That is what they were  saying a few days ago.   Clearly, a majority of the House felt that it was sufficient to  impeach, and a number of Senate Democrats were happy to prejudge the  case publicly and suggest the House had proven enough for removal.   But now, all of a sudden, the story has reversed. Now, we hardly know  anything. Now, the investigation is just beginning. Now, what the House  has produced is so weak that they are calling their own investigation a  coverup. Who would be the author of this coverup--Chairman Schiff?   We have arrived at a simple contradiction. Two things cannot both be  true. House Democrats' case cannot simultaneously be so robust that it  was enough to impeach in the first place but also so weak that the  Senate needs to go fishing. If the existing case is strong, there is no  need for the judge and the jury to reopen the investigation.   If the existing case is weak, House Democrats should not have  impeached in the first place. I think I am beginning to understand why  the Speaker wanted to change the subject to tax policy. Unfortunately,  no matter how irresponsibly this has been handled across the Capitol,  impeachment is not a political game, and the U.S. Senate will not treat  it like one.   A House majority fueled by political animus may have started this  with frivolity, but it will fall to the Senate--to the Senate--to end  it with seriousness and sobriety. It will fall to us to do what the  Founders intended: to take the long view, to move beyond partisan  passions, and to do what the long-term good of our institution and our  Nation demands.                            ____________________     Madam President, every day brings more repudiation of  the conventional wisdom of the Democratic foreign policy establishment,  breathlessly--breathlessly--amplified by the mainstream media, that the  strike on Soleimani would unite Iranians behind the regime. Remember,  that is what they were all saying, that the strike on Soleimani would  unite Iranians behind the regime. Proud Iranians continue, however, to  take to the streets not to rage against America or Israel but to vent  their frustration against the corrupt, theocratic regime that has led  Iran down a ruinous path.   I spoke about these protests before the strike on Soleimani, and I  will continue to speak out about them. I have long believed the United  States should care about human rights and democracy, whether in Russia,  China, Hong Kong, Burma, Cuba, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Syria, or Iran.  The promotion of human rights and the defense of democracy should not  necessarily be the driving force of our foreign policy, but it should  be an important component.   I ask my Democratic colleagues who share this view to set aside their  hatred for Donald Trump--even just for a moment--and to step back to  look at what has been happening across Iran for years: the repression  of women, the persecution of ethnic and religious minorities, and the  brutal suppression of dissent.   Was the Obama administration right to meet the 2009 Green Revolution  with silence?   Consider the story of Iran's only female Olympic medalist, who this  week defected--defected--from Iran and requested asylum; or the Iranian  state TV broadcasters who quit, apologizing to the public for years of  lying on behalf of the mullahs; or the innocent protesters who are  being killed and wounded by agents of the state.   These are well-known realities. They were well known when, 12 days  ago, the United States took the most dangerous terrorist off the  battlefield, but mystifyingly, many voices here in Washington and the  media sought to blame the escalating tensions in the region on  President Trump.   We heard from leading Democrats that the operation to eliminate  Soleimani was one of the administration's ``needless provocations''-- needless provocations. We heard that the cycle of violence was  America's responsibility. All of this--all of it--flies in the face of  the reasonable analysis some of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle were offering before--before--Donald Trump became President.   In 2007, 30 Democratic Senators joined Republicans to support an  amendment warning of the need to prevent ``Iran from turning Shia  militia extremists in Iraq into a Hezbollah-like force that could serve  its interests inside Iraq, including by overwhelming, subverting, or  coopting institutions of the legitimate government of Iraq.'' That was  back in 2007, with 30 Democrats.   Few more prescient warnings have been pronounced by this body, but,  unfortunately, it went unheeded by the Obama administration, which  withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq, effectively abandoning it to Soleimani  and his proxies.   As recently as 2015, the Democratic leader warned that the JCPAO  failed to address Iran's destabilizing malign activities and that Iran  would use its windfall to ``redouble its efforts to create even more  trouble in the Middle East and, perhaps, beyond.'' That was the  Democratic leader in 2015.   Senator Menendez hit the nail on the head as well. He warned: ``If  there  [[Page S169]]  is a fear of war in the region, it will be fueled by Iran and its  proxies and exacerbated by an agreement that allows Iran to possess an  industrial-sized nuclear program and enough money in sanctions relief  to significantly continue to fund its hegemonic intentions throughout  the region.'' Senator Menendez.   So many of our Democratic colleagues understood all this quite  clearly when a Democrat occupied the White House, and it came true. It  came true. Iran's aggression only accelerated after the Obama  administration's deal. The question for us is not whom to blame. That  much is clear. The question is what to do about it.   As Iran's aggression became focused on the United States, as the risk  to our personnel and interests grew, after months of repeated warnings,  President Trump took action. I am glad the strike against Soleimani has  provided some justice--some justice--to his countless victims, hundreds  of Americans and many more across the Middle East.   We don't yet know if Soleimani will prove irreplaceable, but his  death will significantly disrupt Iran's death machine and will change  Iran's long-held misconception that they could literally get away with  the murder of Americans without a meaningful response. President  Trump's strategy seems to have reestablished deterrence.   The Senate risks jeopardizing what we have gained with this strike if  it ties the military's hands and tells Iran that we have no stomach for  this. America can hardly be defeated on the battlefield, but we can be  defeated at home on the political front. We can allow ourselves to  become divided and play into the hands of our adversaries. Our  divisions at home are significant. Let us not allow them to pollute our  judgment on foreign affairs. Let's not make our adversaries' lives  easier by tying our military's hands.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the community in Harlan County, KY,  will gather next month in honor of a devoted caregiver and friend as he  prepares to begin a well-deserved retirement. Today, I would like to  join them in paying tribute to Dr. Samir Guindi for the 45 years of  devotion he has given to Southeastern Kentucky.   Dr. Guindi--Sam to his friends--and his wife, Laila, are originally  from Egypt. They arrived in Harlan in 1975, where Sam spent much of his  career as the only ear, nose, and throat surgical specialist in the  area. As a result, his services were constantly in demand, and he  dedicated himself wholeheartedly to the vital work. Conservative  estimates by his colleagues show Sam conducted more than 200,000  patient visits during his impressive career. He performed approximately  30,000 procedures. Many of the patients Sam treated were children at  high risk of ear damage and deafness.   On top of his busy professional schedule, Sam partnered with the  well-regarded Appalachian Regional Healthcare System to provide  charitable care for families in need. He was based in Harlan, but Sam's  work extended into nearby Bell, Letcher, and Perry Counties as well. He  spent countless hours on the road to see scores of patients in a single  day, often without any compensation. In a region that has long faced a  scarcity of medical professionals, Sam's tireless generosity and  kindness made a remarkable impact on families in Southeastern Kentucky.   Sam's life has been a wonderful example of selflessness. Both of his  sons, Alfi and Sherif, are successful attorneys, and Sherif followed  his father into the service of his community by working as a public  defender and an assistant Commonwealth's attorney. It is my privilege  to join the Guindi family, the Harlan community, and all of Sam's  patients in thanking him for his decades of providing vital medical  care in Appalachia. I wish Sam the very best as he enjoys a relaxing  retirement. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in commending this  outstanding Kentuckian.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is a pleasure to join the  residents of Warren County, as well as law enforcement professionals  throughout Kentucky, in congratulating my friend Tommy Loving as he  marks 50 years of distinguished service in law enforcement next month.  With a dedication to service, Tommy has been instrumental in the  protection of Kentucky's families and communities. He continues to  answer the call of duty each and every day, and our Commonwealth is  safer as a result.   Tommy's career in law enforcement began at age 21 when he joined the  Kentucky State Police, KSP, as a dispatcher. He would wear the gray  uniform for more than two decades, serving as a trooper and then  sergeant at posts across the Commonwealth.   In response to the ongoing struggle against illegal drugs, local  leaders established the Bowling Green-Warren County Drug Task Force in  1997. They asked Tommy to put his experience to work protecting  families from the spike of substance abuse as the organization's  inaugural director. For the last 23 years, Tommy has done just that.   The task force is a collaborative team from the local police  department, the county sheriff, Western Kentucky University's police  force, the KSP, professionals from the Kentucky Governor's and Attorney  General's Offices, and Federal law enforcement. These officers,  bolstered by chemists, prosecutors, and support staff, lead the fight  against the spread of dangerous substances in Warren County. As  Kentucky continues to endure the devastating consequences of the opioid  epidemic and a resurgence of methamphetamine use, the task force's  expertise is vital now more than ever.   Because of his decade-long record leading this highly specialized  team, Tommy was asked to take on an additional responsibility as the  executive director of the Kentucky Narcotic Officers' Association,  KNOA. With a mission to assist law enforcement personnel throughout the  State with training and support as they combat illicit drug abuse, KNOA  has increased the wellbeing of communities throughout the Commonwealth.   In recognition of his success in both local and State law  enforcement, Tommy was selected to be the regional director for the  National Narcotics Officers' Association Coalition in 2010. Now, he  coordinates with officers and policymakers across six States and our  Nation's Capital to share best practices and enhance public safety.  Other States are looking to Kentucky for leadership, and Tommy's  experience is benefiting families and communities around the country.   Thankfully, last year Kentucky saw the largest decrease in drug  overdose fatalities in a decade. It was a long-awaited glimmer of hope  in our fight against addiction. The service of law enforcement  officers, like Tommy, is a critical part of our comprehensive response  to the addiction epidemic, and I hope he and his colleagues are proud  of their contributions to this good news. In 2018, the KNOA Board  unanimously voted to bestow on Tommy their Lifetime Distinguished  Service Award for his decades of work protecting families and  communities from substance abuse.   It is a distinct pleasure for me to join the chorus praising Tommy  for his half-century in law enforcement. We may never be able to repay  the selfless sacrifices of the brave men and women who protect our  communities, but we can and should show our gratitude. Tommy's  leadership and service are a great asset to Kentucky, and I know I  speak for many when I say thank you. As he celebrates this milestone, I  hope my Senate colleagues join me in sharing our congratulations with  Tommy Loving and thanking him for his faithful service to Kentucky  families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
