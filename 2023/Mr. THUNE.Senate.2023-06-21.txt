 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate Armed Services  Committee is marking up the fiscal year 2024 National Defense  Authorization Act. The NDAA is one of the most important pieces of  legislation we consider literally every year. It is a bill that  authorizes funding for our men and women in uniform and our defense  needs and lays out our defense priorities. Hopefully, it is one of the  things that force us to sit down and seriously consider the state of  our national defense and what we need both now and in the future to  ensure that America's military is prepared to deter and if necessary  confront any threat.   I like to say that if we don't get national security right, the rest  is conversation. And it is true. All these other things we debate and  talk about, if we can't protect the country, really end up being very  secondary. The security of our Nation is the precondition for  everything else--for the continued enjoyment of our freedoms, for a  flourishing society, for a healthy economy, for the government's  ability to do anything.   My Democratic colleagues these days often seem to think we can let  defense spending take a back seat to the latest Big Government issue,  but that betrays a fundamental lack of understanding of reality. We  live in a fallen world, and as long as we live in a fallen world, there  will be evil people bent on aggression. So our national defense is not  something we can ever afford to minimize or take for granted. We have  to be prepared at all times to deter and to meet any threat.   The United States has a reputation for having one of the strongest  militaries in the world. While that reputation is deserved, the fact of  the matter is that our military readiness is not where it needs to be.  Thanks to budgetary impasses and increased operational demands, by  2018, our readiness had eroded to the point that the bipartisan  National Defense Strategy Commission released a report warning that we  might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia or China.   While we have made progress since then, we are still a long way from  where we need to be. Recent U.S. war games positing a U.S.-China  conflict following an attack on Taiwan have had grim results, showing  enormous military and economic costs on both sides. One news story on  these war games noted, and I quote:         And while the ultimate outcome in these exercises is not       always clear--the U.S. does better in some than others--the       cost is [clear]. In every exercise the U.S. uses up all its       long-range air-to-surface missiles in a few days, with a       substantial portion of its planes destroyed on the ground.    Let me just repeat that line.         In every exercise the U.S. uses up all its long-range air-      to-surface missiles in a few days, with a substantial portion       of its planes destroyed on the ground.    That is not a promising scenario, and it points to serious readiness  shortages, particularly deficiencies in our inventory of munitions. I  don't need to tell anyone that the side that runs out of munitions  first is likely to be the side that loses in any conflict, which is why  we need sustained investments in rebuilding our supply chain--an effort  that is reinforced by multiyear purchases.   China is flexing its power with increasingly aggressive actions in  the Indo-Pacific. It is investing heavily--heavily--in its military.  China's defense budget has doubled over the last decade, and this year  it will increase by more than 7 percent for the second year in a row.  That doesn't even count any additional defense funding that China  hides. So it should come as no surprise that China is outpacing our  military in modern capabilities like hypersonic missiles and has  amassed a larger navy.   I said that China is growing increasingly aggressive in the Indo- Pacific, but China is also growing increasingly aggressive toward the  United States. Everyone remembers the Chinese spy balloon that flew  over our country earlier this year, but that is just the tip of the  iceberg. Recent reports indicate that China is using Cuba as a base for  intelligence gathering against the United States. Now it has emerged  that China is in discussions with Havana to establish a new joint  military training facility in Cuba. That is not even to mention the  aggressive behavior of the Chinese military toward U.S. assets in the  Indo-Pacific.   It is impossible to overstate the necessity of ensuring that we have  the  [[Page S2155]]  military and economic strength necessary to deter attacks from China  or, in the worst case, confront and defeat them.   While China is obviously a major focus, we cannot forget the threat  posed by Russia, as we continue to see in Ukraine, which is why it is  vital that the United States and the Western world continue to support  Ukraine in its fight and that NATO members take seriously or exceed  their commitment to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense.   Outside of great power threats, there are rogue nations like Iran,  which is deepening its ties with both Russia and China and is  dangerously close to becoming a nuclear power.   The legislation the Senate Armed Services Committee is considering  this week is vital, and I hope the markup will produce a strong bill  that helps address the shortfalls in our readiness.   I put forward a number of proposals that I hope will be included in  the final legislation, with full funding for development of the new B- 21 bomber, which will be housed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South  Dakota, at the very top of my priority list.   I am also working to ensure that, in addition to funding for the B-21  and the necessary support facilities, the Ellsworth area gets the  resources it needs to support the military personnel and their families  who will be coming to the area with the arrival of the B-21s.   Ronald Reagan once said:         We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of       freedom are strong, but when they are weak. It is then that       tyrants are tempted.    Today, as ever, it is vital that we make sure the forces of freedom  are strong, and I will do everything I can to help ensure that this  year's National Defense Authorization Act advances our Nation's  readiness so that we can be prepared to deter any threat or meet it if  called upon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham).
