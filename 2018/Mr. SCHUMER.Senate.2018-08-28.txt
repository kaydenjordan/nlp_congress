 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as the Senate continues to mourn the  loss of our friend and fellow Senator John McCain, let us dwell on how  best to remember this great man; his friendship, his service, his  integrity, his career in the Senate.   One of the ways to carry on his memory is for us to try to live up to  the expectations he had for the Senate, expectations he shared with us  even in his waning days: to act with more humility, to ignore the  critics, to put aside our differences when necessary, and learn to  trust each other more.   In Senator McCain's memory, we can try to live by those principles  and make this Senate a place where, despite the noisy din of politics,  progress can still be made.  [[Page S5964]]    That is a sentiment I hope will long outlast the memorials, the  tributes, and the observances this week.   I also propose that we recognize Senator McCain's legacy by renaming  the Russell Senate Office Building in his honor. For three decades,  Senator McCain was a fixture in those marble halls, an institution of  the Senate. It is only fitting that his name should adorn a physical  institution of the Senate, particularly one that housed the Armed  Services Committee. What better way to encourage future Senators, their  staffs, reporters, and average Americans to study his noble but  imperfect example.   Today I will be circulating a letter with Senator Flake, asking all  of our colleagues if they will be willing to join us in a resolution to  officially rename the Russell Building the McCain Building. I hope that  many, if not most or all, will join because Senator McCain was a dear  friend to all of us and a great American, a great Senator, a great man.  Let his name be an example to future generations, as his service and  character were to every one of us.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, next week the Senate  Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on President Trump's nomination  to the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. For Senators both on and  off the committee to do their constitutional duty, to advise and  consent on his nomination, they must have time to review the nominee's  record.   Unfortunately, Chairman Grassley has so far frustrated our effort to  get full access to the judge's records.   First, he requested only 10 to 15 percent of Kavanaugh's White House  record, unilaterally declaring the bulk of his time in the White House  irrelevant.   As the National Archives works through that request, the Judiciary  Committee has been accepting documents from a lawyer hired by the Bush  Library to prescreen documents. That lawyer, Mr. Burck, who counts  Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and White House Counsel Don McGahn among  his clients, has provided only 6 percent--6 percent--of Kavanaugh's  White House record to the Judiciary Committee, recently declaring some  documents personal rather than Presidential records, a determination we  have been given no basis for.   Judiciary Republicans went even further in their efforts to conceal  Judge Kavanaugh's record by labeling another small portion of those  documents committee confidential. So of the 6 percent, close to one- third cannot be seen by anyone but members of the Judiciary Committee,  and they can't talk about it to others. That is 4 percent of  Kavanaugh's record being made public, and there are no guidelines, no  rules, as to which 4 percent is being made public and which 96 percent  is being withheld. Obviously, one might think the lawyer, who is  clearly totally hooked into the Republican appointment of Kavanaugh  mechanism, would not allow things that might be controversial, that  might put Kavanaugh in not such a good light. Yet there is not even a  standard as to which documents are made public and which are kept  confidential.   Does that sound fair to the Senate? Does that sound fair to the  American people who have a right to read and understand who this  potential future Supreme Court Justice may be?   The burden of proof should not be on disclosure of documents. We  believe in disclosure. We are an open place. Senator Grassley has made  disclosure of things throughout the executive branch a hallmark of his  career. Yet now they make the burden of proof on those who want to  disclose, and the presumption is documents will not be disclosed. It is  so wrong.   Any fairminded observer would be hard pressed to say that the review  of Judge Kavanaugh's record has been transparent, open, and fair. It  has not been.   The Supreme Court Justice, the next one, will have immense influence  over the lives of Americans for generations on issues ranging from  women's reproductive rights to healthcare, protections for preexisting  conditions, civil rights, labor rights, environmental rights, LGBTQ  rights, and so much more. The next Supreme Court Justice may very well  make crucial decisions about the limits of Executive power and  accountability, something that hangs in the balance right now with all  of President Trump's actions.   We know already that Judge Kavanaugh has some deeply troubling views  on these issues, both because of his writings and because he was  selected by a President who explicitly promised to pick pro-life judges  and judges hostile to our Nation's healthcare law.   So, in order to get a complete picture of Judge Kavanaugh's views on  these crucial issues, his record should be made public. There may be  some highly relevant information on issues like Roe v. Wade, campaign  finance, affirmative action, and more, contained within the documents  Chairman Grassley has labeled ``committee confidential.''   Again, there is very relevant and significant information, even in  the committee confidential documents, about Roe, campaign finance,  affirmative action, and more. They should be made public, and Senator  Grassley can do it with a flick of his pen. I would appeal to him as a  man, again, who has stood for disclosure and openness, who has probed  and gotten angry at executive branch members of both parties for  withholding information. Now, of course, we have this 180-degree turn.  It is not like the best of Chairman Grassley, and I hope he will change  his mind.   Certainly, there is an offer to allow Senators to view these  documents, but they ought to be released to the public. We don't have  secret proceedings when we choose a Supreme Court Justice. It is not  the Senate going into the Old Chamber and debating among themselves.  These documents should be made public. The Senate should not be in the  practice of shrouding the eyes of the public from the crucial business  of learning what a Supreme Court nominee will be like.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
