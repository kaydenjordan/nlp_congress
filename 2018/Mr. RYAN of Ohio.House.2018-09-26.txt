 Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis brewing in America.  Two-and-a-half million workers face the challenge of losing their  pension through no fault of their own. These are the folks who get up  every single day, they work hard, they play by the rules, and all they  want is a fair shake, some decent healthcare, and the retirement that  they earned and that they paid for.   One of these people is Ed Barker, III, from Youngstown, Ohio. He  worked for 45 years driving a truck. He worked 60 to 70 hours a week, 6  to 7 days a week. He now faces a 50 percent cut in his pension. He  missed baseball games, he missed birthdays, and he missed family events  because he was driving a truck with the promise that at the end of his  career there would be a solid pension.   Now he and his wife are taking care of their 96-year-old father, they  try to baby-sit for their kids when they get deployed and try to help  out with the grandkids, and they try to help their kid through grad  school to make a better life, all based on the promises they were  given. But now they face the horrendous situation where they may lose  half of their pension, cuts to healthcare, and all the rest that come  with that. They did nothing wrong.   Yes, this is going to cost money. But let me share with the American  people, and remind some of my colleagues, that we had no problem in  this Congress giving a $142 billion bailout to Bank of America, $280  billion to Citigroup, $25 billion to the auto industry, $180 billion to  AIG, $400 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $30 billion to Bear  Stearns, $18 billion to the airline industry, and $300 billion to the  savings and loans.  [[Page H8892]]    Mr. Speaker, if we can bail out corporations that have done  everything wrong, we can bail out the workers who have done everything  right.                            ____________________
