 Madam Speaker, as of yesterday, the United States death  toll from COVID-19 has reached over 100,000 precious lives.   Recent headlines tell the story of COVID-19 risks as workers report  to work with no testing. The Toledo Blade reports: ``Coronavirus  Strikes Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant During Refueling.'' Reuters reports:  ``All Three Detroit Automakers Had Workers Test Positive for COVID-19  Since Plants Reopened.'' And Willamette Week reports: ``The Reopening  of Vancouver, Washington, Is On Hold as 65 Workers Test Positive for  COVID-19 at a Fruit Processing Facility.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the articles I mentioned.                       [From the Blade, Apr. 8, 2020]    Coronavirus Strikes Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant During Refueling; Utility                               Keeps Working                               (By Tom Henry)         Newport, Mich.--An undisclosed number of coronavirus cases       have been documented inside Fermi 2 during the nuclear       plant's latest refueling outage.        But owner-operator DTE Energy said it believes it has       enough precautions in place now to complete the work and get       the plant restarted in the coming weeks.        In a statement, DTE spokesman Stephen R. Tait said the       company ``can confirm that we have had employees test       positive, but are  [[Page H2350]]       not giving out numbers, locations or names at this time.''        Media reports showed the first worker tested positive about       the same time the refueling outage began on March 21. A       Detroit television station reported at least two more       positive cases were documented within days of that.        DTE won't say for the record when it expects to complete       Fermi 2's outage.        But many similar operations--which once took six weeks or       longer--have been shortened to about a month in recent years.       Utilities lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential       electricity sales each day nuclear plants sit idle.        Nuclear plants are refueled every 18 to 24 months,       depending on the type of uranium used in their reactor cores.        Fermi 2, located along western Lake Erie in northern Monroe       County's Frenchtown Township, is one of many nuclear plants       across the United States scheduled to be refueled during the       spring or fall of 2020, the two seasons when demand for       electricity is lowest.        Energy Harbor's Davis-Besse nuclear plant along the Lake       Erie shoreline in rural Ottawa County recently completed its       latest refueling.        Both plants are about 30 miles from downtown Toledo.        The coronavirus pandemic has, of course, complicated those       efforts this year.        To help keep refuelings on schedule, the U.S. Nuclear       Regulatory Commission last month allowed for an exemption       from rules which limit the number of consecutive hours       workers are allowed to be inside the plant at a time. The       agency said in a March 28 letter to the Washington-based       Nuclear Energy Institute that it will consider such requests       on a case-by-case basis, and that exemptions will be limited       to 60 days.        ``We are aware of the NRC's willingness to relax some rules       for overtime at plants if there is a need,'' Mr. Tait said.       ``At this time, we have not requested any variances.''        The NRC has ``no immediate concerns in this area,''       Viktoria Mitlyng, agency spokesman, said. ``We are       communicating regularly with Fermi staff to discuss current       activities and future plans, including staffing, medical       screening, reductions in nonessential maintenance work, and       other related matters.''        In nearly all refuelings, including at those at Fermi 2 and       Davis-Besse, hundreds of specialized, out-of-state       contractors augment the regular plant workforces, often       resulting in 1,000 or more workers assigned to any given site       at a time. Work is usually divided into eight-hour shifts,       with activity occurring 24 hours a day.        Officials have noted those contractors move throughout the       country from job to job, bringing with them the potential of       carrying viruses outside of the sites they last worked.        Monroe-area resident Michael J. Keegan, a longtime activist       associated with the activist group Don't Waste Michigan, said       he worries the NRC will again allow DTE to postpone some of       the work planned for the submerged portion of Fermi 2's       pressure suppression chamber, also referred to as the torus.        The utility came to an agreement with the NRC to fix       degraded coating there, a situation that has lingered for 31       years. It was first identified in 1989, the NRC has said.        One of the concerns is that loose paint chips in drains       could make it difficult for vital reactor coolant pumps to       move water in the event of an emergency.        The NRC told DTE it will grant the utility's request to       remove only coatings found to be degraded through       inspections.        ``If degraded coating is found, they will remove it prior       to returning the reactor to operation after the spring 2020       outage,'' Ms. Mitlyng said.        Fermi 2, one of Michigan's largest employers, is about 30       miles south of Detroit, which is now one of America's hot       spots for the coronavirus pandemic.                                   ____                         [From Reuters, May 27, 2020]    All Three Detroit Automakers Had Workers Test Positive for COVID-19                           Since Plants Reopened         Detroit.--In the week since U.S. auto factories reopened       after coronavirus lockdowns, workers at all three Detroit       automakers have tested positive for COVID-19 but only Ford       Motor Co has temporarily closed plants.        The U.S. auto industry reopened many plants last week after       a two-month shutdown due to the global pandemic. To ensure       safety during the outbreak, companies imposed new safety       measures, including screening employees, use of face masks       and social distancing.        Ford paused production at its Claycomo, Missouri, plant for       an hour on Tuesday after a worker tested positive. Work       resumed at the plant, which builds the F-150 pickup truck and       Transit van, without workers being sent home following a deep       cleaning, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said Wednesday.        General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA)       said Wednesday they have had workers test positive since the       restart, but have not been forced to idle plants. They did       not disclose the number of workers affected.        On Wednesday, a union leader at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant       said on Twitter a worker there tested positive, but had not       worked since May 21. Felker said the plant never closed.        Last week, Ford closed two assembly plants, due to a       positive test at its Dearborn, Michigan, factory and a parts       shortage due to a positive test at a supplier that closed the       Chicago plant. It had marked the second consecutive day for       closures in Chicago following two positive tests.        United Auto Workers Local 600, which represents hourly       workers in Dearborn, last week demanded testing for every       worker there and that Ford shut down the plant for 24 hours       after a positive test. Ford said the safety of its workers is       a top priority and cited the safety measures it has developed       in conjunction with the UAW.        In Mexico, Ford told workers it was targeting a May 28       restart at its Hermosillo plant. GM and FCA have restarted       operations in Mexico.                                   ____                        [From wweek.com, May 25, 2020]     The Reopening of Vancouver, Wash., Is On Hold as 65 Workers Test            Positive for COVID-19 at a Fruit Processing Facility                              (By Tess Riski)         Clark County's application to move into Phase 2 of       reopening has been put on pause.        The COVID-19 outbreak at a fruit processing plant in       Vancouver, Wash., climbed from 38 workers Friday to 65       employees Monday. The Oregonian first reported.        The facility, called Firestone Pacific Foods, halted       production May 19. On May 23, Washington state health       officials suspended Clark County's request to enter Phase 2       of the state's reopening plan due to the outbreak.        The state health department cited the Firestone outbreak as       its reason for suspending Vancouver's reopening.        The county health department said in a press release       Saturdav that it is identifying and notifying close contacts       of all who tested positive and asking them to quarantine for       14 days.        Firestone processes frozen fruit mostly berries. Food       processing plants have been epicenters of COVID-19 outbreaks       across the U.S., in part because social distancing is       difficult on assembly-line floors.        The facility told The Oregonian it's unaware of any workers       who have been hospitalized because of the virus.        ``While this outbreak is unfortunate, our response       demonstrates we have the confidence and capability to respond       to situations like this,'' Dr. Alan Melnick, the Clark County       health officer, said in a press release.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, May 25, 2020]      `This Is Not the Hunger Games': National Testing Strategy Draws                                  Concerns                (By Apoorva Mandavilli and Catie Edmondson)         The Trump administration's new testing strategy, released       Sunday to Congress, holds individual states responsible for       planning and carrying out all coronavirus testing, while       planning to provide some supplies needed for the tests.        The proposal also says existing testing capacity, if       properly targeted, is sufficient to contain the outbreak. But       epidemiologists say that amount of testing is orders of       magnitude lower than many of them believe the country needs.        The report cements a stance that has frustrated governors       in both parties, following the administration's announcement       last month that the federal government should be considered       ``the supplier of last resort'' and that states should       develop their own testing plans.        ``For months, it was a tennis game, it was going back and       forth between the feds and the states, and it's now landed       with the states,'' said Scott Becker, executive director of       the Association of Public Health Laboratories.        Mr. Becker noted that the federal government plans to       distribute some testing supplies, including swabs and viral       transport media, and to store test kits in the strategic       national stockpile. ``That's actually quite significant,'' he       said. ``That's a positive step.''        The Department of Health and Human Services prepared the       strategy, which meets requirements under the Paycheck       Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, signed       into law by President Trump on April 24, that federal       agencies come up with a strategic testing plan within 30       days. It was reported earlier by The Washington Post.        Mr. Becker, public health experts and Democratic leaders       panned the proposal, saying the strategy runs the risk of       states competing with one another and may create deep       inequities among them.        The strategy mirrors a divide that has played out in       Congress for months. As they negotiated the virus relief bill       in March, Democratic lawmakers pushed to require the       administration to submit this national testing plan to       Congress. Republicans resisted, saying those decisions       belonged to each state.        Mr. Becker and others said it's reasonable to expect states       to implement some aspects of the testing, such as designating       test sites. But acquiring tests involves reliance on national       and international supply chains--which are challenging for       many states to navigate.        ``That's our biggest question, that's our biggest concern,       is the robustness of the supply chain, which is critical,''       Mr. Becker said. ``You can't leave it up to the states to do       it for themselves. This is not the Hunger Games.''  [[Page H2351]]         In a joint statement on Monday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi;       Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader; Representative       Frank Pallone, Democratic chairman of the House Energy and       Commerce Committee; and Senator Patty Murray, the ranking       Democrat on the Senate's health committee, said the Trump       administration was not taking responsibility for ramping up       national testing capacity.        ``This disappointing report confirms that President Trump's       national testing strategy is to deny the truth that there       aren't enough tests and supplies, reject responsibility and       dump the burden onto the states,'' the lawmakers said. ``In       this document, the Trump administration again attempts to       paint a rosy picture about testing while experts continue to       warn the country is far short of what we need.''        Experts also took issue with the report's assertion that       continuing to test only about 300,000 people a day, by       targeting only those likely to be positive, would be enough       to contain the outbreak.        ``On the face of it, the idea that 300,000 tests a day is       enough for America is absurd,'' said Dr. Ashish Jha, director       of the Harvard Global Health Institute.        He offered a quick rundown of the numbers to illustrate the       estimate's inadequacy. Most hospitals nationwide now test       everyone who is admitted for any reason, roughly 100,000       tests each day, fearing that they may be asymptomatic and yet       still spreading the virus. Testing the 1.6 million residents       of nursing homes--known to be at high risk of coronavirus       infection--and workers every two weeks would require 150,000       more tests each day. Add high-risk places like meatpacking       plants that need regular testing, and the numbers rapidly       build.        ``Without having tested a single person for symptoms of       Covid, we would quickly exhaust our entire national supply of       testing if all we have is 300,000 tests per day,'' he said.        The H.H.S. report noted that an analysis by the Safra       Center at Harvard estimated the need at more than three       million tests per day. But the federal report said that       estimate was based on faulty assumptions.        The Safra authors who crafted the estimate said that the       federal report had cherry-picked one simple example from       their analysis without considering other evidence.        ``We ran multiple models, all of which pointed to the same       order of magnitude,'' said Danielle Allen, director of the       Safra Center. ``They've selected one non-primary model in an       appendix and selectively adjusted assumptions to generate a       different number.''        Dr. Allen said millions of daily tests would be required to       have 4 percent of people test positive with the coronavirus--      the level they say is needed to halt the spread of the virus.       The administration's target, 10 percent, would allow only for       mitigation.        ``There is not a single country that I'm aware of that       achieved disease suppression with a positivity rate of 10       percent,'' she said.        And 300,000 daily tests would be insufficient even for       mitigation, Dr. Jha said, estimating that would require at       least 900,000 tests per day.        The proposal also leaves it to states to plan for contact       tracing and isolation, rapidly identify new clusters of       coronavirus infection and adopt new technologies. It says the       federal government is ``supporting and encouraging'' states       to rely heavily on guidance from the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention.        However, the C.D.C. has been slow to release guidance for       states during this outbreak, Dr. Jha said. And the agency       fumbled its role in testing strategy, most recently with last       week's dust-up over the mixing of test results for active       infection with serology. ``This is not C.D.C.'s shining       moment,'' he said.        Governors have bristled at claims from the administration       that the supply of tests was adequate, routinely asking for       more federal assistance. Some states have ultimately decided       to negotiate directly with suppliers to obtain test kits.        Federal virus relief legislation required states to release       their individual testing plans last week, but they requested       an extension to later this week. If elements of those state       plans prove promising, Mr. Becker said, the federal strategy       could be revised or merged with them.                                   ____                           [From CNN, May 21, 2020]           Coronavirus Testing Is `a Mess' in the US, Report Says                              (By Maggie Fox)         Coronavirus testing in the United States is disorganized       and needs coordination at the national level, infectious       disease experts said in a new report released Wednesday.        Right now, testing is not accurate enough to use alone to       make most decisions, including who should go back to work or       to school, the team at the University of Minnesota said.        ``It's a mess out there,'' Mike Osterholm, head of the       university's Center for Infectious Disease Research and       Policy (CIDRAP), which issued the report, told CNN.        ``Testing is very, very important, but we're not doing the       right testing.''        The number of tests that have been completed--numbers       widely reported by states and by the White House--show only       part of the picture, the report reads.        ``The data is really kind of screwed up,'' Osterholm said.       ``It's because the public health system is overwhelmed.''        The report has some specific recommendations for diagnostic       tests that check to see if someone is currently infected with       coronavirus.        Testing is most useful for clinical care of patients, for       disease surveillance and contact tracing and for monitoring       frontline workers such as emergency responders, doctors and       nurses who may have been exposed, the report recommends.       People with symptoms should also be tested, it says.        But coronavirus testing is not accurate enough yet to use       in many other ways, the CIDRAP team said.        It recommends against:        Universal testing in hospital settings        Testing in schools or other low-risk settings        Widespread community-based testing        Antibody tests to decide who goes back to work        Immunity passports        It might be useful to test asymptomatic people in long-term       care facilities in some cases because they are likely to have       many cases, the report said. ``Asymptomatic shedding of the       virus may be detected with a molecular test (which looks for       the virus itself) or an antigen test (which looks for       important pieces of the virus). It is not yet clear where,       when and how asymptomatic individuals should be tested.''        The report also says that antibody tests should be used       only with caution. These tests check the blood for evidence       of an immune response to the virus, and indicate that someone       has been infected for some days or has even cleared an       infection. They are most useful for identifying donors of       plasma used to treat patients or for deciding on how to       manage patients when standard diagnostic tests are negative,       the report says.        It's not clear if antibody tests are useful for testing of       health care workers to determine immune status, according to       the report.        ``We believe that greatly expanding SARSCoV-2 testing is a       critical element in our response to COVID-19,'' the report       reads. ``For testing to be maximally effective, coordination       across the system and across jurisdictions is necessary.       Ideally, this requires federal guidance, leadership and       support, with strong jurisdictional buy-in at the state and       local levels.''        The report calls on the US Department of Health and Human       Services to appoint a panel to oversee and organize testing.       ``The panel should include representatives from public       health, clinical laboratory, and medicine; the laboratory       testing research and development, marketing, and product       support industries; ethicists; legal scholars; and elected       officials,'' it says.        Osterholm noted that some states are combining data from       diagnostic tests and antibody tests to make estimates about       how many people have been infected. The Food and Drug       Administration advises against using tests in this way and so       does Osterholm. ``You need to do the right test at the right       time to get the right result,'' he said. ``Nobody is thinking       through that.''        Plus, there's not enough coordination to ensure that states       have the testing supplies they need. This is a system and if       a system breaks down anywhere, it breaks down everywhere,''       Osterholm said.        ``What good are the test results if you can't trust them?''                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, May 25, 2020]  As Meatpacking Plants Reopen, Data About Worker Illness Remains Elusive        (By Michael Corkery, David Yaffe-Bellany and Derek Kravitz)         The Smithfield Foods plant in Tar Heel, N.C., is one of the       world's largest pork processing facilities, employing about       4,500 people and slaughtering roughly 30,000 pigs a day at       its peak.        And like more than 100 other meat plants across the United       States, the facility has seen a substantial number of       coronavirus cases. But the exact number of workers in Tar       Heel who have tested positive is anyone's guess.        Smithfield would not provide any data when asked about the       number of illnesses at the plant. Neither would state or       local health officials.        ``There has been a stigma associated with the virus,'' said       Teresa Duncan, the director of the health department in       Bladen County, where the plant is located. ``So we're trying       to protect privacy.''        Along with nursing homes and prisons, meatpacking       facilities have proven to be places where the virus spreads       rapidly. But as dozens of plants that closed because of       outbreaks begin reopening, meat companies' reluctance to       disclose detailed case counts makes it difficult to tell       whether the contagion is contained or new cases are emerging       even with new safety measures in place. The Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention said there were nearly 5,000       meatpacking workers infected with the virus as of the end of       last month. But the nonprofit group Food & Environment       Reporting Network estimated last week that the number has       climbed to more than 17,000. There have been 66 meatpacking       deaths, the group said.        And the outbreaks may be even more extensive.        For weeks, local officials received conflicting signals       from state leaders and meatpacking companies about how much       information to release, according to internal  [[Page H2352]]       emails from government health agencies obtained through       public records requests by Columbia University's Brown       Institute for Media Innovation and provided to The New York       Times. The mixed messages left many workers and their       communities in the dark about the extent of the spread in       parts of Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado.        The emails also reveal the deference some county officials       have shown toward the giant meatpacking companies and how       little power they have in pushing the companies to stem       outbreaks.        ``Bad news spreads way faster than the truth,'' said a       county health official in Colorado of an outbreak at a       Cargill plant, according to notes from a conference call last       month. ``At this point, we are not doing anything to cast       them in a bad light. Will not throw them to the Press.''        Questions about the transparency of governments and       companies about the coronavirus extend far beyond       meatpacking. Chinese officials have been widely criticized       for not fully disclosing the extent of the virus's spread       within their borders. And in the United States, President       Trump has questioned the official death toll from the       coronavirus, suggesting that the numbers may be inflated even       as public health experts and statisticians say the opposite       is more likely true.        The meat companies are not legally required to disclose how       many workers are sick. But legal experts say privacy is not a       valid reason for keeping the numbers from the public.        ``Alerting a community about the number of cases in a       particular place is a standard public health response;' said       Nicole Huberfeld, a public health expert at Boston       University. ``People need to act appropriately if they are       exposed.''        The lack of full disclosure also demonstrates the       industry's sway as a major employer in the Midwest and the       South.        While more than 80 percent of beef and pork workers are       unionized, even labor leaders acknowledge it is not as easy       to shut down meat plants as other factories because they are       essential to the food supply. Auto plants, for example, were       shut down relatively early during the pandemic and have only       just begun to reopen.        After some slaughterhouses did close, restaurants and       stores experienced significant shortages of meat, leading Mr.       Trump to issue an executive order designating meat plants       ``critical infrastructure'' that must stay open.        But the order did not address crucial issues like testing,       leading many companies to reopen plants or keep them       operating without fully assessing whether employees had       contracted the virus.        Across the country, many local health departments have       encouraged companies to test employees--but stopped short of       ordering them to do so.        On April 21, health officials in Dallas County, Iowa, told       Tyson Foods that they could provide rapid testing kits for       workers at its local plant in Perry, according to the emails.       An early draft of that message to Tyson managers underscored       the urgency, saying, ``At this time, we strongly recommend       this option be implemented immediately.''        But the county's lawyer asked that the language be revised       to read, ``At this time, we ask you to consider this be       implemented as soon as possible.''        In an interview, the county attorney, Chuck Sinnard, said       he recommended revising the language because he did not       believe the health department had the authority to order       Tyson to conduct tests.        ``It was in the vein of choosing wording cautiously and       conservatively so we didn't get in a position where we were       overstepping our bounds,'' he said.        On May 5, the state health department, which ultimately       worked with Tyson to test employees, said 730 workers, or 58       percent of the plant's work force, had tested positive for       the virus. About two weeks ago, Tyson started to disclose the       number of coronavirus cases at a handful of its plants around       the country where there has been widespread testing.        In North Carolina, workers and community advocates in the       Tar Heel area started to raise the alarm in April, as local       news outlets reported a string of infections linked to the       Smithfield plant.        In neighboring Robeson County, 59 residents who work at the       Tar Heel facility have become infected, out of a total of 669       cases in the community, according to Melissa Packer, the       county's assistant health director.        But like the rest of the public, Ms. Packer does not know       the full extent of the outbreak at the plant.        In conversations with state officials this month, Ms.       Packer said, a number of county health directors requested       that plantspecific numbers stay private. One of the reasons,       she said, was that the local officials wanted to avoid       antagonizing the meatpackers while they worked alongside them       to curtail the outbreaks.        ``A lot of the concerns were around fractured       relationships,'' Ms. Packer said. ``Some local health       directors from the counties where there are processing plants       expressed some concerns about how that may negatively impact       the relationship they have built with the management of the       companies.''        A spokeswoman for North Carolina's health department, Amy       Ellis, declined to reveal plant-specific data. She said the       state has recorded a total of 1,952 cases across meat plants       in 17 counties.        Smithfield said it continued to ``report all Covid-19 cases       to state and local health officials, as well as the C.D.C.''       and was working to provide free testing to all its employees.        This month, Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska announced that       the state would not disclose the number of coronavirus cases       in specific meat plants without the consent of the companies.       The state is releasing aggregate case numbers across the meat       processing industry, the governor's spokesman said. Some of       Nebraska's big meatpackers have also started revealing less       about case numbers to their employees.        Eric Reeder, a local union president representing workers       in 14 plants around Nebraska, said that the larger the       outbreak, the less transparent some of the companies have       become about the case numbers.        ``When a plant hits several hundred cases, they get more       tight-lipped, and that makes it difficult for workers to       protect themselves and their families,'' said Mr. Reeder,       president of the United Food & Commercial Workers union local       293.        Those transparency issues were on display last month when       Teresa Anderson, the director of the Central District Health       Department in Grand Island, Neb., told the meat processor JBS       that she planned to conduct coronavirus testing at a park       near the company's plant, which employs 3,700 people.        JBS wanted assurances that the test results would not be       made public.        ``We understand that you will be asking and recording the       employer,'' Nicholas White, a compliance official at JBS,       wrote in an email to Ms. Anderson on April 15. ``But we would       ask that you not disclose that information as part of any       public disclosure of the testing results.''        Six days later, though, Ms. Anderson announced that more       than 200 people connected to the Grand Island plant were       infected. By May 5, at least 328 employees had tested       positive, according to the emails from Grand Island, some of       which were previously reported by ProPublica.        A spokesman for JBS, Cameron Bruett, said the company did       not want to publicize the number of positive cases at the       plant because little testing was being conducted in the       broader area. Releasing the data, he said, ``would distort       any one company's role in community spread.''        The tussle over whether plants should test workers has       stretched for months in some states, creating critical delays       in isolating infected workers. Local health authorities       concede that asymptomatic employees are still coming to work       with the virus, fueling the spread.        As recently as May 14, health officials in Wyandotte       County, Kan., warned that the virus was continuing to spread       inside a National Beef plant.        ``The outbreak has gone on for a month,'' a county       epidemiologist said in an email to her colleagues.        ``Should we bust in, show our badges and test everyone?'' a       colleague suggested. ``Ha!''        A National Beef spokesman said the company was following       the county's health guidelines.        Even when case numbers are disclosed, many health       departments say they have little authority to act at meat       plants.        Last month, a worker in a Triumph Foods pork plant in St.       Joseph, Mo., emailed the city saying at least two employees       were infected and 90 percent of the staff was still working       ``less than a meter away'' from one another.        ``Workers are scared,'' the employee said. ``Can the       government take action on the matter for the protection of       workers and the city?''        A health official wrote back on April 21, saying the city       had ``limited authority'' in closing a business and suggested       that the workers cover their noses and mouths and use hand       sanitizer.        Since then, Triumph has supplied workers with masks, among       other protective measures, according to the company website.       But at the time, the plant worker was not comforted by the       city's assurances.        ``Are you telling me that it doesn't matter that two       workers are infected,'' he wrote. ``Because the plant is       worth more than the workers' health?''    Madam Speaker, testing requires a national strategy, not  a 50-State, helter-skelter search for limited supplies. Without  rigorous expanded surveillance testing, many more American lives are  put on the chopping block because of pure stupidity and callousness.   If the President can find billions to build more nuclear weapons,  then surely we can find the money to protect those who build them and  all workers who dedicate their talents to moving our Nation to full  throttle again.   Mr. President, get a testing regimen in place. It is your duty. No  excuses.
