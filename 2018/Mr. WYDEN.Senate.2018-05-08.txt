 Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the  distinguished Senator from Vermont, who has been such a role model to  me since I came to the Senate--we started working together on  technology issues and worked together on so many matters dealing with  appropriations and finance--for all his counsel, not just on this but  over the years. I thank him for the courtesy of being allowed to go  next.
