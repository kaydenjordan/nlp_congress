 Mr. Speaker, a few hundred feet north of here in the  Senate, Secretary of State Pompeo will soon testify about President  Trump's disastrous performance at the recent NATO summit and, worse, at  his meeting in Helsinki with Russia's dictator, Vladimir Putin.   Now, if you are a Member of this body and you are interested in what  Mr. Pompeo has to say on these topics, you had better turn on your  television, because he isn't coming over here.   Secretary Pompeo is ignoring the House, despite our request that he  come testify or brief our Members. He is blowing off half of the  legislative branch. This is outrageous, and I bet if Secretary Pompeo  were still a Member of this House, he would think so too.   We have too many unanswered questions, Mr. Speaker. What happened in  President Trump's secret meeting with Putin? They sat together for 2  hours with no one else aside from interpreters.   What deals were made? What agreements were reached? The Russians are  claiming that a great deal was discussed, but so far, we have heard  nothing from this administration.   President Trump's actions in Helsinki were a betrayal of his duties.  He had already insulted our closest friends and allies, and with the  world watching, he sided with Putin over our own intelligence and law  enforcement communities about Russia's attack on our democracy.   So we need to see Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis and Director  Coats. I recently joined with my fellow ranking members, Mr. Smith on  the Armed Services Committee and Mr. Schiff on the Intelligence  Committee, demanding that these senior officials come to the Hill and  shed light on what took place. We don't know, and the Secretary of  State is not coming to the House to tell us.   We have gotten no response to our requests. With Secretary Pompeo set  to appear in the Senate, that is really a slap in the face to this  body. Every Member of this body should object to the fact that this  administration won't give us the time of day. I object, and I will keep  pushing until we get the answers we need.                            ____________________
