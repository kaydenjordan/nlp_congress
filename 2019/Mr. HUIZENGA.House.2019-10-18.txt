 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the ranking member yielding  me the time.   As I was hearing my colleagues describe what this bill does and whom  it is targeted at, it just struck me, there is an untethering from  reality of what our economy is and how our economy functions.   Certainly, along any of the border--and, yes, we have a northern  border, while in Michigan it is actually to the east of us. When you  look at what happens in the automotive industry, and when you look at  what happens in the agricultural industry, that is the most porous  border in the world because that is our largest trading partner in the  world. In just the State of Michigan alone, Canada is the seventh or  eighth largest trading partnership in the entire world.    As we have been piling on regulation upon regulation over the last  number of decades, Mr. Chairman, you saw companies leaving the United  States. Sometimes, though, they were for different reasons. It is the  supply chain. It didn't have anything to do with lower labor markets in  Canada. The UAW strike also was the Canadian workers' strike. This is  all linked together.   In the bill itself, there is a disclosure requirement that we have to  desegregate by State, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth,  territory, and possession, and compare a percentage. So, Mr. Chairman,  as you are shifting from Ohio to Detroit, Indiana, or Wisconsin, you  are going to have to track all of those things as you are going  through--by the way, not by numbers but by percentages of the total  number of employees who physically work in and domicile in another  country outside of the United States.   Again, you are going to have to do that same thing as you are  shifting automotive parts production between subsidiaries. That happens  all the time, whether it is going from Troy, Michigan, or to Windsor,  Ontario.                                time  0945    That is a free flow that goes back and forth all the time. That has  nothing to do with some nefarious shipping of jobs overseas. That is  called supply chain.   So this bill is flawed because it paints an incomplete company  picture. Simply knowing one percentage of a company's workforce  residing abroad--which obviously means everywhere and on anything--just  really does not give you any kind of picture or flavor or test of what  is happening within that.   And, yes, it is duplicative. In fact, I will have an amendment on  this bill a little bit later. We already have conflict mineral  reporting. We have all kinds of other reporting that had happened  because of Dodd-Frank.    I can tell you that the lack of competitiveness in the  United States and one of the challenges that we have on our committee  that we constantly talk about is how do we make sure that the United  States is an area for growth, innovation, entrepreneurship.   Because these companies that are now public, none of them started out  public. They became public companies. And we have seen a plunge in the  number of publicly traded companies. That is why I supported regulatory  reform. That is why I supported tax reform, because we had to make the  United States more competitive.   This bill does nothing to help the United States become more  competitive. It becomes less competitive and more burdensome, and all  with the goal of shaming companies, not actually getting aggregate  information that helps anybody.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, what we just heard a little while ago from  the other side of the aisle can be easily explained. They don't  understand the power of the Federal Government fully on how it can  deter growth in our economy.   It is not one big, giant thing. It is death by a thousand cuts. It is  creating the atmosphere or destroying the atmosphere that allows  innovation, allows growth, and allows the entrepreneurial spirit that  has set America apart from the rest of the world. It is putting it on  the chopping block.   That is why I oppose this bill. Once again, we are using the massive  power of the Federal Government to bully companies around.   I am kind of curious, if this is all about foreign jobs, why in the  world, under section (A)(i), we are going to need all this information  disaggregated by State--by State.   This has nothing to do with whether a job is going to Mexico or China  or Vietnam or Canada. It has to do with whether it is going from  Michigan to Ohio or from Indiana to Iowa.   Yet, you are going to force the companies to continue to do all of  this work for zero benefit, no benefit--not a benefit to an investor,  not a benefit to the employee, certainly, unless, apparently, you have  something against Michigan or against Ohio. I have got something  against their university, not the State.   But why we continue to just pile this on is why I believe this is  deeply flawed and it paints incomplete pictures of what is going on.   So, today, my amendment is this: I am offering a simple amendment  that would exempt issuers from making these disclosures if they are  already required to make a CEO pay ratio disclosure and disclosures  relating to conflict minerals.   I cannot describe to you fully in these 5 minutes the damage that has  been done with conflict minerals alone in a wide swath of industries,  including the automotive industry.   People would think: Why in the world would that have anything to do  with it? It has been hundreds and hundreds of man-hours to try to track  something down that is untrackable. We still have no idea where all  this is.   So, my amendment today--and, if this is really about foreign jobs and  all those kinds of things, which we know it is really not because we  need to disaggregate it by State; but, if it is about that, then it is  time for the authors to step up and support this amendment.   We need to stop mandating frivolous disclosures for public companies.  Well, we already have two with the CEO pay ratio and the conflict  minerals.   I believe this is reasonable to say, that if you already are doing  those, you no longer have to do these additional disclosures.   We should be looking at ways to lower costs, reducing barriers on  those seeking to become the next Ford, the next Amazon, the next  Microsoft. Instead, we are just putting up speed bump after speed bump  after speed bump. What happens, Mr. Chair, is those speed bumps  eventually turn into a wall, and that stops all progress.   So, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I will make it quick, because this is pretty  easy.   What you just heard isn't true, Mr. Chairman, because if, truly, the  other side cared about anytime there was a job getting shipped  overseas, they would not have, under the (B)(2) disclosure requirement,  an exemption with respect to an emerging growth company.   If they actually put their money where their mouth is, they wouldn't  have that exclusion in there because,  [[Page H8239]]  apparently, an automotive job isn't as valuable as an emerging growth  company job.   So, I am confused. If that is really what it is all about, then we  ought to make sure that the rules apply to everybody and that there  should not be an exemption.   And I am confused as to why the author of this bill would allow that  to happen, would allow those technology companies to ship those jobs  overseas, without any respect of having to report that.   Obviously, Mr. Chairman, I am being a little sarcastic, but it just  goes to show why this is a flawed bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
