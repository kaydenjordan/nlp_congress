 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in  morning business.    Madam President, I wanted to offer some remarks about two  of our former colleagues who passed away, and I know many have already  spoken about both of their lives and their contributions, their public  service. And so I am not speaking today about the pending legislative  business but just wanted to make sure that I took some time today to  talk about both of these individuals. I will go in the order of their  passing just in the last week, really.   The first is the former Senator from Wyoming, Mike Enzi, who served  in this institution since being elected in 1996 and then left the  Senate after 2020 was concluded. I will have a longer statement that I  will ask consent to put in the Record. But I just wanted to share some  personal reflections because sometimes, when you outline someone's  career in a position, whether it is in government or otherwise, that  doesn't really tell the story about who they were, and we all have  different impressions, but it is remarkable how often, in the last  couple of days, Members of both parties in the Senate have commented on  Mike Enzi as a person.   I said last weekend at the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, of which he and I were both members and overlapped for a  number of years, that Mike Enzi was the paragon of decency, and that is  probably an understatement. ``Decency'' isn't a word that is often  attached to public officials, unfortunately, but in Mike's case, it  applied. He was a decent human being and treated everyone with respect,  and we could all learn more than one lesson from the way he treated  people and the way he conducted himself as a person and the way he  conducted himself as a U.S. Senator.   Just in terms of work, a number of us can share stories about issues  we worked with Mike on. I can share one or two.   One, in particular, I remember a bill that had not been  ``reauthorized.'' That is another fancy Washington word for taking a  policy or taking a program and, in a sense, reinstituting it by  updating it and, maybe, getting authorization to have either new policy  or new appropriations or additional appropriations. But we wanted to  reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical Education Program, but the  bill had not been acted on. The proposal, the bill itself, or versions  of the bill were around for something like, oh, gosh, about 12 years,  between 2006 and 2018, before we finally got it done.   I won't walk through the policy but just share a personal story that,  when Mike Enzi and I were working on the Senate version of it--there  was another version in the House very similar, if not identical, but it  needed work in both Chambers--we were working with then-Chairman  Alexander, Lamar Alexander and the ranking member, Patty Murray. So the  four of us had to work very hard to get it done. But once it was done,  I remember standing here on the floor, and Mike Enzi was standing on  that side of the floor talking about what we had done. And as I was  paying tribute to his work and commending him, I thought: My goodness.  I may be getting him in trouble back home by having a Democrat  compliment him so much, and he was complimenting my work. But I  remember that because it was a typical--in some ways, a very typical  Mike Enzi work product. It defied resolution for a long time, but he  stayed at it, and he stayed in the room, so to speak, until we had it  done.   So I want to thank him for that work that will allow more and more  Americans to have the opportunity to have that career in technical  education that they would not have or at least not would have it in the  manner that the bill set forth, which was a dramatic and substantial  improvement in that kind of career in technical education, from a  Federal Government perspective.   The final thought that I will share--because I want to be brief  because I also have a statement to submit--are on our budget votes.   As many Americans know, if they are watching--and maybe they aren't  watching when we do a budget resolution, but it is vote after vote,  hour after hour, often well into not just the evening but well into the  next morning. And to preside over that, as Mike was at the time as the  chairman of the Budget Committee, I just recall him standing at the  lectern, hour after hour, having to comment on every amendment, whether  he opposed it or supported it, and if he opposed it, of course, he had  to make an argument against it. That is part of the job of being the  chair, standing there all those hours.   But even when he was making the case against Democratic amendments,  which was often, and stating his opposition, there was no snarl; there  was no--rarely political rhetoric. He would just state his objections  very forthrightly and very soberly and then move on. There was no  finger-pointing, no demonization of the other point of view. So I  always appreciated how he did that in an environment where there often  is that kind of invective flying back and forth.   So, Mike Enzi, when I say he was the paragon of decency, that applied  to his whole life, and we know how terribly his family must miss him  and how his State mourns the loss of Mike Enzi, but that loss was felt  in a bipartisan fashion here on the Senate floor and within the Senate  family.   Madam President, today, I wish to pay tribute to the distinguished  life and career of Senator Michael B. Enzi, who passed away on July 26,  2021. Senator Enzi was an honorable public servant and decent man who  always had a kind word for everyone in our shared office hallway in the  Russell Senate Office Building. I was privileged to have spent 13 years  working alongside him.   While Senator Enzi was born in Bremerton, WA, in 1944, he grew up in  Wyoming, the same State he would devote more than four decades of his  life to by serving in local, State, and Federal Government. He  graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting from George Washington  University in 1966. Senator Enzi was dedicated to his education and his  sense of civic responsibility, and he earned an MBA in retail marketing  from the University of Denver in 1968 while also serving in the Wyoming  Air National Guard from 1967 to 1973. After receiving his graduate  degree, he followed his father's footsteps and worked as a shoe  salesman and business owner.   Senator Enzi's long career in government started when he was elected  mayor of Gillette, WY, in 1974. He served in the Wyoming State  Legislature as a member of the House of Representatives and State  Senate beginning in 1987. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and  would go on to serve 4 consecutive terms. It was during the 110th  Congress that we became colleagues and began our committee work  together, first on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs and later on the Committee on Finance and the Committee  [[Page S5552]]  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Senator Enzi loved ``solving  problems for folks in Wyoming and America,'' and I am honored to have  had the opportunity to work with him on bipartisan solutions to help  Americans.   The passing of Senator Enzi is a terrible loss for his wife, Diana;  his children, Amy, Emily and Brad; his four grandchildren, Trey, Lilly,  Megan, and Allison. He will be dearly missed by his family, friends,  and former staff. I echo my Senate colleagues and fellow citizens when  I say that we are grateful for his service to our Nation. May he rest  in peace.                            Remembering Carl Levin    Madam President, and then just some additional comments on another  colleague we lost this year, this time a Democratic Senator, Carl  Levin, who served the people of Michigan starting in 1978--I think,  almost immediately after serving on the city council in Detroit--and I  will submit a statement about his life as well.   But Carl, as well, was decent and honorable, and I have no doubt that  people in both parties had that same impression of him, dealing with  him--again, I will say--as a person and as a U.S. Senator, as a public  official.   Carl Levin had a work ethic which was second to none. I don't ever  remember him in a setting where he wasn't working. It was as if he was  never relaxed and kind of turned off. He was always on the floor,  trying to get support for an amendment, trying to get support for a  bill. And the difference between Carl and many of us is that he knew  the detail of that bill sometimes as well or better, maybe, than the  staff. He knew every part of the policy. If he were allowed to be on  the Senate floor, with his jacket off, he would roll up his sleeves.   Someone was telling a story the other day how that was kind of an  image we had of Carl; that his sleeves were always rolled up when he  was working, but, of course, on the Senate floor, he wasn't allowed to  do that. But it was emblematic, I think, that rolling up of his sleeves  when he was traveling or addressing constituents or the like--it was  emblematic of his work ethic and the scholarship that he put into the  work he did for the people of Michigan and often for, of course, the  workers. There have been stories that have been told in the last couple  of days about him carrying around his union card when he worked in a  factory as a young man.   He never forgot those workers. It wasn't just a symbol of a union  card in his wallet; he never ever stopped fighting for them--workers in  Detroit, whether they are autoworkers or otherwise.   So that is something we pay tribute to today, and his work on behalf  of those who were powerless or those with little power, those who don't  have a lobbyist, those who don't have the opportunity to influence  legislation directly--Carl Levin always made sure that their voice was  heard.   And as much as he was a supporter--and I think a consistent and  strong supporter--of a strong national security, no Member of the  Senate could say they did more than Carl Levin to support our national  security, both in terms of what he supported, but in terms of his  leadership on the Armed Services Committee, and ultimately as the chair  of the committee, working in a very bipartisan fashion to keep us safe,  working with Senators like John McCain and others, Democrat and  Republican alike.   But even though in the midst of--or in the course of supporting  national security you deal with big institutions, big defense  contractors, big, powerful interests that he worked with and made sure  were part of the best national security in the world, he was also very  tough on those same big institutions; because, as many of you know-- many people here in the Senate know, Carl was the chairman of what is  known as the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, maybe the most  powerful subcommittee in the entire U.S. Senate, or at least for many  years it was.   And as the chairman of that subcommittee, Carl Levin held the feet of  powerful interests--held their feet to the fire over and over again  with a cross-examination skill that very few Senators would possess,  even Senators who were good lawyers.   And Carl Levin would not let those powerful interests up for air if  he thought they had information that he needed to extract from them in  the public interest. And anyone who appeared before him knew how tough  he could be on the most powerful people and the most powerful  institutions in the country, if not in the world.   So we appreciate Carl Levin's decency and the honorable service that  he rendered, but we also appreciate how hard he fought for people who  didn't have power.    I want to thank the senior Senator from Delaware for those  kind, personal reflections about Carl Levin   Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to the life and career  of Senator Carl Levin, who passed away on July 29, 2021. As the  longest-serving senator in Michigan history, Senator Levin was a role  model as a person and as a public official.   Senator Levin was born on June 28, 1934 in Detroit, MI, the city he  would call home for his entire life and continually fight for during  his six terms in the Senate. I am proud to say that he received his  bachelor's degree in political science at Swarthmore College, which is  located in my home state of Pennsylvania, in 1956. During his  undergraduate education he worked as a taxi driver and on an auto  factory line. He would continue to keep his union card in his wallet  for many years, a habit emblematic of his commitment to American  workers. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1959, he practiced  law for several years before becoming an assistant attorney general and  general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, beginning his  long career as a defender of civil rights.   Senator Levin first entered elected office as a member of Detroit  City Council in 1969. In 1978, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where  he would earn a reputation as an effective legislator, tenacious  investigator and person of integrity. He understood that serving in  political office is a public trust and demanded the same degree of  accountability and transparency from corporations and government that  his constituents came to expect from him. Whether on the floor of the  Senate or abroad during our trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2008  when he served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services,  Senator Levin led with humility and a sharp intellect.   Senator Levin's service in the Senate was the kind of public service  we should all emulate and his death is a loss for our Nation and, of  course, his loving family. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife,  Barbara; his three daughters, Kate, Laura and Eric; his six  grandchildren; and his nephew, Congressman Andy Levin, as they mourn  his passing. May we all learn from Senator Levin's example, and may he  rest in peace.   I yield the floor.
