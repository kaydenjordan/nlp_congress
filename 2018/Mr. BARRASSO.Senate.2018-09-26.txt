 Mr. President, today I wish to share my appreciation  for Governor Matt Mead. He will complete his second term as Wyoming's  commander in chief this year. It is an honor to recognize his devotion  to our servicemen and women.   Here in Wyoming, we rely on the cowboy code. The Code of the West was  adopted as the State's official code of ethics. It reminds us to ``live  each day with courage'' and ``be tough, but fair.'' It also reminds us  to ``take pride in our work.''   Governor Mead can certainly take pride in his role as a champion and  advocate for Wyoming's military members and their families. Since 2008,  Matt attended 22 deployment ceremonies for members of the Wyoming Air  and Army National Guards. In 8 years, exactly 2,235 airmen and soldiers  have been deployed to fight the war on terror and protect our Nation.   Matt knows the importance of supporting our troops, both at home and  overseas. He visited deployed troops on six separate occasions to bring  words of support and encouragement from home. Similarly, he was on the  ground with families and friends at 22 homecoming events, greeting  returning men and women with a smile on his face.   Governor Mead is also dedicated to thanking those who have already  served. During his tenure, he attended 53 Veterans Day and welcome home  events. These welcome home ceremonies began as a way to honor veterans  of the Korean conflict and the Vietnam war who returned home without  receiving proper recognition of their service and sacrifice.   In addition, he signed legislation designating Interstate 25, which  runs north to south from Buffalo, Wyoming, to the Colorado border, as  the Vietnam Veterans Welcome Home Highway.   Finally, under his direction, the Wyoming Veterans Commission  assisted over 8,000 veterans and family members with problems or  requests for information. Matt's determination to provide high-quality  care and support to Wyoming's veterans is unparalleled.   Matt does not stop at honoring veterans and supporting Active-Duty  servicemembers. In 2011, he saw a need to recognize those just  beginning their service. Now, he regularly hosts enlistment ceremonies  for young men and women who commit to joining the Armed Forces.   At these special events, Governor Mead takes time to share his  appreciation for their bravery, patriotism, and desire to serve our  Nation. His warm words of inspiration provide reassurance to these  young people and their families as they embark on this momentous  journey. Since the first ceremony, a total of 3,035 enlistees have been  recognized for answering the call of duty.   Governor Mead is not alone in his efforts to celebrate their selfless  sacrifice. He is aided by the Hon. Gary Hartman, who serves as Mead's  military and veteran policy analyst. Judge Hartman is a U.S. Air Force  veteran who served in Vietnam. Judge Hartman coordinates each ceremony  and plays a vital role in ensuring each and every one of these talented  individuals is celebrated.   In addition to his military service, Judge Hartman served for 25  years on the Fifth Judicial District Court. His extensive knowledge of  the law, along with his passion for veterans' affairs, allowed him to  help bring a veterans treatment court to Laramie County. The program's  unique approach aims to add much-needed mental health and mentoring  services to veterans facing criminal charges. His experiences, both in  the Air Force and on the bench, make him a proud advocate who never  hesitates to uphold, encourage, and defend veteran causes.   Wyoming holds two enlistment ceremonies each year. On November 12,  Matt, with Judge Hartman's assistance, will host his final ceremony as  Governor. Addressing a new group of enlistees, he will impart wisdom  and speak about Wyoming's legacy of service. I have been honored to  attend many of these ceremonies. It will again be my honor to stand  beside my friend as we commend these fine young folks.   President Teddy Roosevelt famously said, ``People don't care how much  you know until they know how much you care.'' Time and time again,  Governor Matt Mead demonstrates his respect and gratitude for our  servicemembers. He leads with honor, integrity, and pride, and our  State and Nation are better because of his dedication.  [[Page S6337]]                                ____________________
