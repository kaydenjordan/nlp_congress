 Mr. President, let me begin my remarks this evening by  expressing my appreciation to Senators Portman and Sinema for their  extraordinary leadership of our group, our bipartisan group, of 10  Senators, who have labored so hard to bring before the Senate the  bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   This legislation represents the most significant investment in our  infrastructure since the construction of the Interstate Highway System.  Think about that. For generations, for decades, we have talked about  the need to rebuild our roads and our bridges, our airports, our  seaports, our waterways, our water treatment systems, and, today, to  expand high-speed internet access to Americans throughout our country  no matter where they live--whether they are in the northern regions of  Maine or an inner city neighborhood--and that is exactly what this  legislation would do.   I want to just quickly give an example from my own State of Maine.   Maine has 315 bridges and nearly 1,500 miles of roads that are rated  as being in poor condition. Now the State of Maine will have the  funding that will enable it to make major investments in the repair and  replacement of this critical infrastructure. I am particularly pleased  that the legislation includes $65 billion to expand access to  broadband.   And I want to thank my colleague Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who worked  so closely with me. We were partners in this endeavor, and this is  going to make such a difference to students who are doing online  courses, to seniors who want access to telemedicine, to individuals who  are able to work from home, but none of that is possible without access  to high-speed internet services.   I am very pleased to be part of this group, and I am also delighted  to demonstrate to the American people that we can work across the aisle  in a bipartisan way to achieve real results that matter to the people  of this country.   I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.
