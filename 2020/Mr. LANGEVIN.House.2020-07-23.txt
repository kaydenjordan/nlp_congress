 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts.   This amendment would effectively prevent the Department of Interior  from moving forward with a decision to revoke tribal lands from being  held in trust. Although I appreciate my colleague's advocacy on behalf  of the tribe in his state, the tribal land trust process is based on  complex legal precedent and has no business being included in a bill to  fund the federal government. We are familiar with the complexities of  tribal law in Rhode Island as the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri  v. Salazar had implications for our state. But any legislative remedy  for Carcieri shouldn't lie in an ad hoc approach that favors one  particular tribe.   What's more, this amendment could cause serious economic harm to  Rhode Island. It effectively preserves the opportunity for the  construction of a new casino in Taunton, Massachusetts, by putting  pending administrative decisions on hold for the next year. My  colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation are hoping for a last minute  judicial or administrative reversal that would allow the stalled casino  project to begin. The project would be in direct competition with  established casinos just over the state line. Twin River and Tiverton  casinos have been important economic drivers in my state, generating  hundreds of millions of dollars each year. We are already feeling the  economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in Rhode Island, as I know  our neighbors are in Massachusetts. If this amendment becomes law, it  could compound the economic pain for our businesses, their workers, and  our state.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
