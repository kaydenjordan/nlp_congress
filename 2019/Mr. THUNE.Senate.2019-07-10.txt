 Mr. President, we just heard the Democratic leader talking  about the issue of healthcare and attacking the President and  Republicans for not being supportive of protections for preexisting  conditions, and I can tell you that is just not true. I can't think of  a single Republican who doesn't believe we ought to provide protection  for people with preexisting conditions.   Democrats have not acknowledged that ObamaCare has failed, and I  think we can all see the evidence of that. We have seen skyrocketing  premiums, copays, out-of-pocket costs, deductibles--all of those things  have gone through the roof for a lot of people, particularly in the  individual market--as well as a reduction in the number of choices and  options. Fewer options and higher costs have been the legacy of  ObamaCare, so the Democrats know it has to be replaced. The reason they  know it and you can tell it has to be replaced is that they are already  out there talking about a proposal--a completely one-size-fits-all,  government-run, national approach to taking over people's healthcare in  this country called Medicare for All, at a cost of $32 trillion, which  I will come back to in just a moment.   The President and his administration have also acknowledged that  ObamaCare has failed because of the skyrocketing costs and fewer  choices and have chosen to try to get that repealed through the courts.  Either way, we are going to be having a discussion about healthcare  here and about what is the best system moving forward.   Republicans, of course, as I mentioned, believe we have to protect  people with preexisting conditions. Whatever follows in ObamaCare's  wake, I think there is agreement on both sides of the aisle--both  Republicans and Democrats--that preexisting conditions will be covered.   So let's just take that political argument off the table because that  is all it is. It is nothing more, nothing less, nothing else than a  political argument made by Democrats when they know full well that  Republicans are on the record in support of protecting people with  preexisting conditions.   The question is, What will we replace it with? We believe, obviously,  that there is a much better approach that gives people more choices,  more options, and creates more competition in the marketplace, which  would put downward pressure on prices.   The Democrats, as I said, have endorsed and are supporting a $32  trillion government takeover of the healthcare system in this country,  which will put enormous costs on the backs of working people in this  country. I will come back to that in just a moment.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Indiana (Mr. Young).
