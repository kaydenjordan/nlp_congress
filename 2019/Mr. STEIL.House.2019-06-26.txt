 Mr. Chair, I will start by thanking Chairman Quigley and  Ranking Member Graves for including this amendment in the en bloc.   I rise today to urge support for my amendment considered en bloc.  This amendment expresses congressional support for the important work  of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, known as FLEC.   FLEC's mission is to improve financial literacy and help Americans  make good financial choices. This is an important task, especially for  at-risk groups such as minority communities, rural Americans, and other  historically disadvantaged groups. FLEC should continue to support  efforts to improve financial literacy in our communities.   As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I closely follow the  rapid transformation of the financial sector. Thanks to innovation and  smart regulatory reforms, more people now have access to mortgages,  personal and business loans, retirement products, and other financial  services. If we want all Americans to succeed and thrive in today's  growing economy, we must support efforts to provide education on how to  make smart financial decisions.   Mr. Chair, this amendment reinforces Congress' commitment to  financial literacy, especially for at-risk communities, and I urge  support for this en bloc amendment.
