 Mr. President, today I wish to offer my  congratulations to Dr. Matt Jones, the 2018 American Optometric  Association Young Optometrist of the Year.   As the American Optometric Association, AOA, notes, there are young  optometrists--those who have been in active practice 10 years or less,  including residency or fellowship--who often show remarkable leadership  skills when serving their profession, their patients, and their  community.   Dr. Matthew Jones graduated from the University of Evansville in 2005  with a bachelor of science in biochemistry. From there, he attended my  alma mater, the Southern College of Optometry in Memphis, TN, where he  graduated with honors in 2009. Dr. Jones lives in Blytheville, AR,  along with his wife and daughter, and practices in Blytheville and  Osceola.   He also serves as president of the Arkansas Optometric Association.  Dr. Jones received the Arkansas Young Optometrist of the Year Award in  2012 and serves on many committees in the organization, including State  legal legislative, national legal legislative, convention, career  guidance, and AOP-PAC. He is also a member of the board of directors  for the AOA's charitable foundation, Vision Arkansas.   In the community, Dr. Jones is a member of the Blytheville Rotary  Club, where he previously served as treasurer. He is currently chairman  of the Blytheville Rotary Foundation, in addition to being secretary/ treasurer of the Great River Charitable Clinic board of directors where  he provides free eyecare services and materials for the under-served.   We are so proud of Dr. Jones and his accomplishments. He is a great  care provider, leader, and member of the community. This recognition is  yet another example of the respect and admiration his peers have for  him.   Congratulations to Dr. Jones on this well-deserved honor, and I look  forward to his continued leadership in the coming years.                            ____________________
