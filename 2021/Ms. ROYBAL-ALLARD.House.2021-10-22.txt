 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the PUMP Act  to expand workplace protections for breastfeeding moms and ensure they  have access to appropriate and necessary accommodations.   Decades of research have shown that breastfeeding is one of the most  cost-effective interventions for improving maternal and child health.   Compared with formula-fed children, breastfed babies have a reduced  risk of ear, skin, stomach, and respiratory infections, sudden infant  death syndrome, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, asthma, and childhood  leukemia.   However, while 84 percent of U.S. babies are breastfed at birth, only  25 percent are still exclusively breastfed at 6 months of age.   I commend my colleague, Carolyn Maloney, for her career-long  dedication to improving these breastfeeding statistics.   Congresswoman Maloney's 2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers law  provided the first critical protections to ensure mothers would have  reasonable break times and a private place to pump breast milk.                                time  0945    Mothers with this access to workplace support have lower healthcare  costs, absenteeism, and turnover and show improved job morale,  satisfaction, and productivity.   However, that law unintentionally excluded 9 million women from these  workplace protections, including teachers, software engineers, and many  nurses.   Expanding workplace protections to include these women is important  because research clearly shows that without protections, breastfeeding  employees have increased risk of painful illness and infection,  diminished milk supply, and are more likely to stop breastfeeding  early.   As cochair of both the Maternity Care Caucus and the Public Health  Caucus, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the PUMP Act, which  is a commonsense solution to eliminating workplace barriers that  interfere with successful breastfeeding.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act is critical to ensuring all mothers  have the opportunity to reach their personal breastfeeding goals to  protect their babies, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  Written Statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Before the         United States House of Representatives, September 27, 2021         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Members of       the U.S. House of Representatives: The Academy of Nutrition       and Dietetics submits this letter to the U.S. House of       Representatives in full support of the Providing Urgent       Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R.       3110).        Representing more than 112,000 credentialed nutrition and       dietetics practitioners, the Academy of Nutrition and       Dietetics is the world's largest organization of food and       nutrition professionals. The Academy is committed to       improving the nation's health and advancing the profession of       dietetics through research, education and advocacy. Our       vision is a world where all people thrive through the       transformative power of food and nutrition. Our mission is to       accelerate improvements in global health and well-being       through food and nutrition.        The Academy's impact goals include increasing equitable       access to food, nutrition and other life-style related       services. As an organization that is overwhelmingly composed       of women in the workforce, the struggle to balance       professional responsibilities and motherhood is well-known to       our members as is the nutritional case for breastfeeding and       its continuance despite returning to work. Thus, for the       Academy, the issue of workplace accommodations for       breastfeeding women is both personal to our members and their       health and professional given the unquestionably essential       role of human milk in early nutrition for infants.        For over a decade--truly since the passage of the       Affordable Care Act--the Academy has advocated for       legislation addressing workplace accommodations for mothers       doing their best to meet the demands of earning a wage,       caring for their infants and protecting their own health but       who work for employers not included in existing law.        Women choosing to continue breastfeeding after returning to       work should be supported in this very personal yet       consequential decision that carries life-long outcomes for       both mom and infant.        It is unfortunate that such an important decision is often       not supported or understood by employers who benefit       directly. In one study, only 40 percent of mothers reported       having access to both break time and a private space to pump       while on the job. There is also inconsistency regarding how       employers meet legal requirements to accommodate       breastfeeding workers, even for those currently covered by       the law. As shared in the media, stories from women employees       report janitorial and other closets as the designated pumping       location and reveal barriers faced by moms requesting an       unpaid break.        A key recommendation of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines       for Americans is, ``For about the first 6 months of life,       exclusively feed infants human milk. Sadly, among women who       work full-time, only 10% of those who started breastfeeding       their babies will still be breastfeeding by the time their       infant reaches six-month of age. The anticipation and       apprehension associated with how to continue to breastfeed       after returning to work prevents some moms from even       initiating breastfeeding.        There are three key reasons that Congress should pass the       PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act: 1) Human milk offers superior       nutrition and health benefits compared to infant formula, 2)       employers benefit from breastfeeding moms who return to work       and 3) increasing breastfeeding initiation and duration are       public health priorities of the United States. Examining the       rationale more closely demonstrates the positive outcomes       expected with passage of the bill.      1. Human Milk Offers Superior Nutrition and Health Benefits           Compared to Infant Formula        The Academy has previously noted that ``. . . exclusive       breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and health       protection for the first 6 months of life and breastfeeding       with complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12       months of age is the ideal feeding pattern for infants.       Breastfeeding is an important public health strategy for       improving infant and child morbidity and mortality, improving       maternal morbidity, and helping to control health care costs.       Breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of otitis       media, gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, sudden infant       death syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, obesity, and       hypertension. Breastfeeding is also associated with improved       maternal outcomes, including a reduced risk of breast and       ovarian cancer, type  [[Page H5805]]       2 diabetes, and postpartum depression. These reductions in       acute and chronic illness help to decrease health care       related expenses and productive time lost from work.      2. Employers Benefit from Breastfeeding Moms Who Return to           Work        Aside from nutrition and the health benefits to the mother       and baby, employers gain from women who continue to       breastfeed after returning to work. First, breastfeeding       employees miss work less often. One-day absences to care for       a sick infant or child happen twice as often for mothers who       chose to feed their infants formula. Second, since       breastfeeding is associated with lower health care costs for       mother and baby, employers also benefit from lower medical       insurance claims. One insurance company, CIGNA, found that       343 employees participating in a worksite lactation support       program resulted in an annual savings of $240,000 in health       care expenses, 62 percent fewer prescriptions and $60,000       savings related to absenteeism rates over a two-year period.       Finally, for businesses that offer a worksite lactation       program, there are even greater tangible benefits to the       employer. These include lower turnover rates and absenteeism       for working women, fathers and partners; additional health       care savings; higher productivity and loyalty; as well as a       positive public image.      3. Increasing Breastfeeding Initiation and Duration are           Public Health Priorities of the United States        Across federal agencies, significant resources are       appropriated and authorized to encourage mothers to initiate       breastfeeding and to continue after returning to work. A few       examples include:                          Health and Human Services         In 2011 a landmark policy document, The Surgeon General's       Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding, outlined measurable       goals and objectives for stakeholders' efforts to align       national policy with public health goals. While progress has       been made over the past decade because of the recommended       actions, there continue to be gaps and opportunities to       address policies that support breastfeeding including those       related to employment and the workforce.        The Office of Women's Health offers support for women       through published guidance and notably for employers through       its ``Business Case for Breastfeeding.''                        U.S. Department of Agriculture         The Women, Infants and Children's Program receives       appropriated funds to support its peer counseling program and       the program extends participation to women who continue to       breastfeed for one-year post-partum.        The 2020-2025 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans led by       the USDA recently added new recommendations for children from       birth to two years of age. As noted, a key recommendation is       that for the first 6 months of life, infants should be fed       human milk. After 6 months of life, complementary foods and       breastfeeding are recommended until one year of age.                  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention         The Centers CDC has made breastfeeding a public health       priority and encourages state health departments, hospitals       and local communities to implement public health goals and       align resources to support breastfeeding rates for       communities of color. ``Because of the importance of       breastfeeding for the health of mothers and babies, CDC       supports breastfeeding through hospital initiatives, work       site accommodation, continuity of care, and community support       initiatives.''        The federal government advocates for breastfeeding and its       continuance for working women, but laws and regulations don't       make it easy for women in all sectors of the workforce to       fulfill breastfeeding public health goals and objectives.      Why will the PUMP Act help?        It is reasonable to expect that if breastfeeding and       workplace accommodations are seen as public health priorities       by the federal government and tax-payer dollars are used to       fund programs designed to encourage and support breastfeeding       for the public, that policies protecting and advancing the       interest of the government's investment should be       implemented. The PUMP Act is one such policy that will       eliminate barriers for women who are teachers, flight       attendants and other exempt workers.        The bi-partisan PUMP Act will bring equity to nearly nine       million women in the workforce and their families who       currently lack protections as they seek to provide       recommended nutrition to their new babies.        Women in the workforce are striving for economic stability       to help support their families. The country benefits from       their contributions to our economy. Instead of focusing on       what happens when employees need unpaid time to feed their       baby as their doctor, nutrition experts, and the U.S.       government recommend, consider what happens and the cost to       our nation when they do not. Through WIC, the U.S. government       provides services to approximately 53 percent of all U.S.       infants. Infant formula is the most expensive item in WIC       food packages and costs to the government exceeded $927       million in fiscal year 2010. The direct cost to the       government of providing infant formula and the related       indirect cost of employee turn-over, absenteeism and most       importantly, the increased health care costs of formula-fed       infants make this bill a win for all parties and protects the       economic interest of the U.S.        Perhaps then Federal Reserve Chair and current Secretary of       Treasury Janet Yellen said it best in an essay following her       2017 remarks at the ``125 Years of Women at Brown       Conference'' sponsored by Brown University in Providence,       Rhode Island:         ``. . . a number of factors appear to be holding women       back, including the difficulty women currently have in trying       to combine their careers with other aspects of their lives,       including caregiving. In looking to solutions, we should       consider improvements to work environments and policies that       benefit not only women, but all workers. Pursuing such a       strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in       women's involvement in the workforce, which has contributed       not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the       welfare and prosperity of our country.''         The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics urges all members of       Congress to vote in support of this bill because it is the       right step to support babies, mothers, employers and       ultimately the health and prosperity of our nation.        Thank you for your consideration.      Jeanne Blankenship, MS RDN,        Vice President, Policy Initiatives and Advocacy, Academy of       Nutrition and Dietetics.
