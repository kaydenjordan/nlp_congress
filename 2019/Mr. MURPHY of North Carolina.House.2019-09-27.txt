 Mr. Speaker, I speak this morning on  our Nation's security.   Over 200-plus years ago, brave men and women literally sacrificed  their lives to create a nation that was based upon freedom. That has  now continued, and we have today a nation of laws. And now we have that  nation of laws and the sanctity of that country threatened.   If you look back on the last several Republican and Democratic  Presidents of the United States who, right from that very seat, spoke  about our border crisis, they spoke about what they needed to do to  keep the sanctity of our borders, yet nothing was ever done.   The American people have complained incessantly on how this Congress  does not act. It is a stalemate. Now we have a President, bold as he  is, who is finally acting on this crisis. We are literally overrun by  folks from the southern border.   Yes, there are drugs. I heard that was mentioned by the gentleman  earlier. There are drugs that are coming in.   But we also talk about human trafficking, that is, the trafficking of  young men and women into this country into, essentially, slavery. We  now want to open the borders up and have this country, what was  previously a nation of laws, now become overrun and say that laws are  no longer sanctified in this country.   Ladies and gentlemen, we have a President who is bold, who has  recognized what has not been recognized by previous Presidents, that we  do have an emergency, that we do have the need for a physical structure  to prevent a physical object from moving from point A to point B.  [[Page H8070]]    We need a sanctified and a secure border, and I wish the Republicans  and Democrats would get together and recognize that we do need this for  our country and it is truly an emergency.
