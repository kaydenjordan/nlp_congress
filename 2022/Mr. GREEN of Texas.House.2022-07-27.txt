 Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mrs. Torres for being  very generous with the time of the Rules Committee.   I support all aspects of what I consider to be historic legislation.  I would like to also thank Mr. Hoyer who has worked tirelessly to help  us to bring this legislation to the floor. It will mean a lot to many  people. It will mean an awful lot to me.   I appreciate anyone who is going to vote for it, and I encourage  everyone to vote for it.   Today is a unique day in history, and I trust that this bipartisan  legislation will prove such to be the case.   I am not going to prolong my time. I just want to be grateful to all  Members of the House, including the Speaker, the whip, the caucus  chair, persons on both sides, and the minority leader--everyone. I am  grateful. I trust that we will vote to pass the legislation.
