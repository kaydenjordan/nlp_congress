 Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed and tireless colleague  from the District of Columbia, Congresswoman Holmes Norton.   In this very Chamber, we have, throughout our Nation's history, long  debated statehood for many lands and many people, and adding new States  we have.   In 1837, Michigan statehood was passed by Congress as the 26th State  and signed by President Jackson, who proudly stated Michigan was  ``admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States  in all respects.''   In 1959, as we added Hawaii to the Union, the Secretary of the  Interior declared: ``The great statehood of Hawaii will be granted and  prove to the world . . . that we practice what we preach.''   Now, as we add Washington, D.C., and recognize the over 700,000  people, hundreds of thousands of Federal taxpaying people, to this  Union, we reaffirm, we restore, and we continue to flourish our  democracy that manifests to promote the general welfare.
