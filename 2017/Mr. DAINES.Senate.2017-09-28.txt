 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing a multigeneration cornerstone of the community in  Fallon County. Baker Furniture has served the people of eastern Montana  for over eight decades. Through the years, the team at Baker Furniture  has skillfully navigated changes in consumer tastes and a shifting  business climate in order to provide quality furniture and appliances  for the folks in Baker.   Baker Furniture initially began operations on Main Street in 1936, by  the original proprietor, Leif Holmlund. Leif's understudy in the  furniture industry, Army veteran Orville Stevens, would eventually take  the reins of the enterprise in the 1960s. Under Orville's guidance, the  business flourished. Orville's sons, Tom and Dave, also pitched in to  help make the business a success.   Tom and Dave went on to assume the primary duties for the business in  the late 1990s. After a life that included service to his Nation,  raising a family, and operating a successful business, Orville passed  away in 2009. Since his passing, the business that Orville developed  has continued to thrive and meet the needs of the community.  [[Page S6222]]    Small businesses, operated by hardworking family members, are an  engine of commerce for many rural communities across Montana. Baker  Furniture is a shining example of this business model, and many  shoppers in Baker and the surrounding area are grateful. Thank you to  the team at Baker Furniture for the many years of excellent service to  your neighbors, and I wish you continued success in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
