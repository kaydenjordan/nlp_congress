 Madam Speaker, the ``thugs.'' Are those the friends of  the folks who attacked this Capitol? Is that who you are talking about?  Those are thugs.   Madam Speaker, for 44 years, I have been a member of the IBEW. My  brothers went to college. I did the other thing. I went to the other 4- year school, an apprenticeship. My entire life has been about speaking  for those voices, those workers who didn't have a voice.   Listen to this: Employers shouldn't make the decision, and unions  shouldn't make the decision. Employees make the decision whether or not  they want to enter into a collective bargaining agreement.   That is one of the reasons why I and five others formed the Labor  Caucus, because their voices are not being heard.   Unlimited money, the total control of the workplace--OSHA injuries  are much higher on nonunion jobs than union jobs. Why? Because workers  have a voice. They have better health benefits; they have better  pensions; they have dignity in retiring.   Madam Speaker, I have spent 44 years and have been involved with 30  organizing campaigns. I know what it is like to go out and get those  cards signed. I know what it is like to have a fair election, and that  is what we need.   Fairness in America still counts, and workers have been on the wrong  end of that deal for so long.   Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to do what is right for  America. Pass the PRO Act. We are all in this together.
