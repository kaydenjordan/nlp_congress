 Madam President, in March, I spoke here on the Senate  floor about the highest reported gasoline prices ever. At that time,  according to AAA, the average price in West Virginia, my home State,  was $4.12. Well, today--today--West Virginia's average is up to $4.90  while the national average is $4.96.   Last week, the national average for a gallon of gas was more than  $5--more than $5. Think about that. And, worse, these high gas prices  hit our hardest working Americans the hardest. As Axios reported,  ``Americans who earn less than $50,000 a year are currently spending .  . . 10% of their credit card bills on gas, compared with 6% for those  households earning . . . $125,000.''   These prices are not sustainable for the American families,  especially when you consider not only gas, but with out-of-control  inflation, they are battling gas, electricity, groceries, and other  necessities.   As the New York Times reported, ``Prices climbed 8.6 percent in the  year through May, a reacceleration of inflation that makes it  increasingly difficult for consumers to afford everyday purchases.''   So people ask me: How did we get here? Unfortunately, we shouldn't be  surprised, even if it is hard to imagine that things would get this  bad. From the earliest days of his Presidential campaign, President  Biden promised to be anti-American-energy. As President, his policies  and personnel choices have delivered on his campaign promises, and high  prices are just part of the bargain, as they would say.   The administration has canceled pipelines, rescinded previously  issued approvals for other pipelines, and raised barriers to building  new ones. They have frozen oil and gas leasing and proposed raising  royalties--costs that are passed on to every consumer and, remember,  those hardest working Americans who are now paying 10 percent of their  income.   They are revising the NEPA process, which is the environmental review  process, undoing the streamlining that was done during 2020 to speed up  project delivery. That means faster pipelines, faster infrastructure  development of all kinds. Biden's EPA has hammered small refineries,  including the one in my State, by denying hardship relief that could  immediately help lower fuel prices. And Biden's EPA has also recently  announced a proposal under section 401 of the Clean Water Act to make  it easier for activists to work to prevent infrastructure projects.   Then there is the regulation on the power sector. The EPA has  publicly announced plans to slam the electricity sector--already the  most regulated sector by EPA--with a fresh new slate of new  requirements.   The damaging policies I have laid out today have led to the energy  crisis and skyrocketing energy and electricity prices that we face  today. These policies are going to continue to fan the flames of this  crisis, making it worse and not better. As costs continue to climb and  energy production gets more expensive--thanks to this regulatory  assault--utility operators are already warning of blackouts this  summer. Operators are under tremendous strain, thanks to the Biden  administration's policies.   So what has the White House done to address this crisis? Well, I  think GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan said it well:         White House begs all companies to improve situation. Can we       drill? We'd rather you not. Can we build a refinery? We'd       rather you not. Can we build a pipeline? We'd rather you not.       Just make it better.    So it is no wonder that all of these mixed messages have industry and  investors confused. I am confused. The American public is confused why  nobody woke up to what was going on here--and the President in the  White House. The administration made releases from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve. What good did that do? It hasn't started to abate  the steady rise in gas prices. They have pointed fingers at energy  producers and refiners with claims of price-gouging. They have pointed  fingers at Vladimir Putin, despite the fact that gas prices were  steadily rising months before the invasion of Ukraine.    The White House is content to keep finger-pointing while refusing to  take responsibility for their own actions. They know their actions are  causing pain. They know, with these policies and pledges from our  climate czar John Kerry to stop using our own American fuels, they are  chilling investments that we need today. For example, who would make a  billion-dollar, 40-year investment in the refining capacity we  desperately need today when John Kerry promises that oil and gas  investments will be ``stranded assets.''   Nothing the White House has promised will fix these kinds of issues.  The President himself says energy producers should take immediate  action to increase the supply of gas. Yet his advisers in the White  House are counseling everyone otherwise. In effect and in the messages  they send, this is going to make things worse.   This administration is fiercely determined to kill the oil and gas  industry and baseload power sector in this country rule by rule,  Executive action by Executive action. And the hard-working Americans  are paying for it at the pump.   The American people are really smart. They see what is happening  here. The Democrats want to layer on more regulations and legislation  that will keep passing more and more costs on to those consumers, those  hard-working Americans who are paying 10 percent monthly from their  monthly  [[Page S3060]]  earnings. All the while, the Biden administration is working as hard as  it can to shutter coal and natural gas energy production and  electricity.   Do you know what? Without a 180-degree turn on several actions I have  laid out, we can expect costs to stay high and blackouts and brownouts  to occur.   Americans deserve better. I am an optimist. Americans deserve better.   I ask the administration to reverse course on some of these policies  I have outlined and to put the livelihoods and the quality of life of  our constituents first.   I yield the floor.
