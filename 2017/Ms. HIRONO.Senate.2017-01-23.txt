 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Mike Pompeo to serve as Director of the Central  Intelligence Agency.   Representative Pompeo has been wrong on many critical intelligence  issues during his 6 years in Congress.   He will not disavow his past support of torture.   He opposed the release of the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence's torture report.   He has advocated for reinstating mass surveillance of American  citizens.   He recently left the door open to outsourcing surveillance of  American citizens to foreign governments to circumvent existing laws.   He opposes the closure of Guantanamo.   He opposes the Iran nuclear agreement.   Congressman Pompeo is the wrong person to the lead the Central  Intelligence Agency.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on his nomination.
