 Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen).    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Conyers, Ms.  Jackson Lee, and all of those who have spoken in support of this bill  this morning, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act.   It is exactly as it has been described. It is an important moment for  us, in a bipartisan consensus that we have reached, to protect our  young athletes. It has been articulated well, the purpose behind the  bill, and it is a proud moment for all of us as we stand for these  young athletes to defend them as they perform and use their God-given  talents that make our Nation so proud.   So, without belaboring the point, Mr. Chairman, I just want to  commend, again, Mrs. Brooks for introducing this important legislation,  and I also urge all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman  Goodlatte, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, strike line 16, and all that follows through line 3       on page 3, and insert the following:        ``(9) the term `covered individual' means an adult who is       authorized by a national governing body or a member of a       national governing body to interact with a minor or amateur       athlete at an amateur sports organization facility or at any       event sanctioned by a national governing body or a member of       a national governing body;        ``(10) the term `event' includes travel, practice,       competition, and health or medical treatment; and        ``(11) the terms `amateur athlete', `amateur sports       organization', and `national governing body' have the       meanings given such terms in section 220501(b) of title 36,       United States Code.''.        Page 4, line 19, strike ``file'' and insert ``filed''.        Page 7, strike line 16 and all that follows through line       25, and insert the following:        ``(C) reasonable procedures designed to avoid one-on-one       interactions between an amateur athlete who is a minor and an       adult (who is not the minor's legal guardian) at an amateur       sports organization facility, at any event sanctioned by a       national governing body, or any event sanctioned by a member       of a national governing body, without being observable or       interruptible by another adult, except where the safety and       welfare of the minor requires; and''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 352, the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I am happy to introduce this manager's amendment to H.R. 1973, the  Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. This amendment is very  simple. It defines who is covered by the mandatory reporting  requirement in the underlying bill. The definition harmonizes language  with the underlying statute, defining this class not by location, but  by simply keeping the jurisdictional reference where it belongs: in the  national governing body or a member of a national governing body.   The amendment also defines the term ``event'' to include travel,  practice, competition, and health or medical treatment. This definition  is important as events in USA Gymnastics revealed abuse by USA  Gymnastics' team doctor Larry Nassar, who molested dozens of young  girls under the guise of medical treatment. Moreover, other allegations  of abuse show that it sometimes took place during travel to various  competitions.   The amendment also clarifies duties of national governing bodies.  Under the amendment, national governing bodies must implement  reasonable procedures designed to avoid one-on-one interactions between  minors and adults that are not within an observable or interruptible  distance.   This amendment assures that the 47 different national governing  bodies can implement procedures that make sense, given the sport they  cover, the reach of their influence, and the resources available to  them.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I echo what has been  [[Page H4581]]  said already, and I appreciate the comments of my colleagues and  acknowledge, again, that the manager's amendment is very simple. It  simply seeks to clear up language and define these terms. It is a  necessary alteration to the bill, and I encourage our colleagues to  support the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).   The amendment was agreed to.                     AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. COSTA    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  part A of House Report 115-152.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    I appreciate the gentleman's remarks and  his support for this important legislation.   Victims should, of course, have reasonable opportunity to seek  justice and face their accusers in court. This bill is a good one and  fair to all parties, and I look forward to working with the gentleman  to get it to the President's desk.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to this commonsense amendment, as has just  been articulated.  [[Page H4582]]    The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mr. O'Halleran  and Mr. Biggs for offering this amendment. It will help to prevent  abuse at these national governing bodies and, as stated, it will  encourage children to report abuse when they are able to quickly and  easily access this information.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his  courtesies. I want to enthusiastically congratulate and thank the  gentlemen and gentlewoman from Arizona for responding to their  constituents and answering a question positively about protecting our  young people.   I spoke earlier today about what happens with young people and their  aspirations when they engage in sports. They want to win, but they also  want to, if you will, to impress adults and to show that they can do  the very best that they can do.   So I want to congratulate them for this amendment that advances the  purposes and goals of protecting young victims from sexual abuse by  requiring the national governing bodies to include resources and  information regarding sexual assault and having sexual assault hotlines  and other victim support services on their websites.   With this new technology, it will be at their fingertips. They don't  have to, in essence, expose themselves. They can get this information  and readily access the very people that will help them.   So I want to congratulate the manager, Mr. Conyers, and, of course,  the chairman of the committee and the proponents of the underlying  bill. I want to congratulate Mr. O'Halleran. His efforts here are to be  commended, and I thank him for this insightful amendment to the  legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of  my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).   The amendment was agreed to.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  McCarthy) having assumed the chair, Mr. Poliquin, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1973) to  prevent the sexual abuse of minors and amateur athletes by requiring  the prompt reporting of sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities,  and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 352, he  reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the  Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poliquin). Under the rule, the previous  question is ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment  reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the  gentleman for his leadership on this issue to help save those who have  been trafficked across not only just America, but around the world.   Mr. Speaker, they didn't list her name in the report, and that makes  sense. It all happened before she even reached the age of 16. So to  protect her identity, they called her Tonya.   She ran away from home and ended up living with a man they called  Eddie. Eddie was the stepdad of one of her classmates. Tonya and Eddie  started a relationship. Tonya felt that she really loved him. Eddie  took advantage of that, and he pressured Tonya into a life no child  should have to live.   Tonya was saved in large part by luck. A tip to the police led to  action by the Federal special agent. And now Eddie is behind bars  finishing the second year of his 12-year prison sentence. Meanwhile,  Tonya is just trying to return to a normal life.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say this story wasn't true, that these  fictitious names didn't reflect hard reality. I wish I could say it was  isolated. I wish I could say that this type of thing doesn't happen  here in America, but it does.   It repeats itself with different details even more disturbing than  Tonya's story in towns and cities across our Nation. It is not just sex  trafficking. It is forced labor. It is exploitation. It is slavery. And  every single instance cries out against the moral truth written on  every human heart.   Now, the numbers are staggering. 20.9 million people are trafficked  globally. Of that number, over a quarter are children. The majority are  pressed to work for little to no wages. And 4.5 million of these people  are victims of forced sexual exploitation.   Here in America, there were 7,572 cases of human trafficking reported  in 2016. That is an increase of 35 percent over just the year before.  My home State of California is particularly dire. Of all the cases in  the Nation, 1,323 come from California.   Though we need no explanation for why we are passing anti-trafficking  and exploitation legislation today, I think it helps that we understand  the magnitude of this evil.   We have, in this body, voted on 11 bills so far. Today we will vote  on two more by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson). Altogether, these bills address  many aspects of this problem: international trafficking, recording and  transmission of child pornography, abuse uncovered on the U.S. Olympic  teams, the handling of trauma cases in our justice system.   I don't believe that these bills alone will end human trafficking or  exploitation in and of themselves, but they will help. They will help  prevent these crimes, they will help the victims recover, and they will  bring us closer to a world where every person, especially those who  need us most, won't be abused but will be truly loved.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work in this effort.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I am honored today to speak in support of my legislation, the  Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act, which aims to close a court- created loophole, and as the title suggests, further protect our  children from predators.   When I first arrived to Congress after almost 20 years of litigating  constitutional law cases and drafting legislation for municipalities to  control the proliferation of sexually oriented businesses, I was deeply  concerned to learn that this particular loophole even existed in  current Federal law, which essentially allows a child rapist to admit  to sexually abusing a child and yet still evade punishment.   The background is important to reiterate. As my chairman stated  moments ago, this comes from a 2015 case, United States v. Palomino- Coronado, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  reversed the conviction of a child sex offender simply because the  court determined the perpetrator lacked specific intent to record the  disgusting images that were found on the offender's smartphone. This is  despite the fact that the defendant admitted to sexually abusing the 7- year-old child from next door and memorializing the conduct.   In its opinion, the court decided the lack of purpose or specific  intent was enough to overturn the conviction, even though the defendant  himself took the photo of the heinous act and subsequently admitted to  sexually abusing this child. This is absolutely in clear contradiction  of our responsibility and this Congress' intention to protect America's  children.   In Scripture, Romans 13 refers to the governing authorities as  ``God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the  wrongdoer.'' I, for one, believe we have a moral obligation, as any  just government should, to defend the defenseless.   My legislation presents a simple fix and updates title 18 of the U.S.  Code to ensure future defendants are not able to circumvent the law by  simply claiming a lack of intent, especially after knowingly creating a  visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually conduct.   More specifically, my legislation amends section 2251 of title 18 to  prohibit the production and transmission of a visual depiction of a  real minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.   Furthermore, it amends current law to include prohibiting the  depiction of a minor assisting any person in engaging in a sexually  explicit act.   Lastly, to clarify potential circumstances of misinterpretation of  the statute and to ensure the statute is not used erroneously to  prosecute internet services providers when they have not engaged in  wrongdoing, my legislation emphasizes that to be criminally liable  under section (a)(3), an internet service provider must have actual  knowledge that the child pornography is on its server and that it must  intentionally transmit that image or intentionally cause its  transmission.   We also take the step of prohibiting any criminal or civil liability  for internet service providers who are required to transmit child  pornography to law enforcement in response to a legal process, such as  a search warrant in child exploitation cases. Of course, we would  never anticipate a prosecution of an internet service provider for  merely responding to a legal process, but it is my hope that explicitly  providing for this immunity in the statute will further enhance the  relationship between internet service providers and law enforcement to  work together to combat these predators.    In answer to the opposition that we have heard here, it is important  to reiterate this legislation does not create new mandatory minimums.  However, I would like to address the comments regarding the current law  on mandatory minimum penalties under the production of child  pornography statute.   There is simply no evidence that Federal prosecutors are abusing this  statute. I think we should all recognize that producing child  pornography is a horrific crime. It often means luring young children  into acts that no one, man, woman, or child, should be forced to do.   It is not a photograph of a nude child. It is something far worse.  Each photo is a crime scene. Such a horrific act by the perpetrator  requires the maximum amount of legal deterrents.   While mandatory minimums have reached much scrutiny in the drug  statutes, in this venue for this statute, there could be no doubt that  the penalties that exist under current law are appropriate. Child  sexual exploitation is vastly underreported. The number of images of  child pornography keeps growing and the images are becoming more and  more depraved. The harm is too great to these victims not to have  significant penalties available to deter this conduct and punish the  producers of child pornography.   Every time an image of child pornography is viewed, the victim gets  revictimized. Once an image is on the internet, it is irretrievable and  can continue to circulate forever. This permanent record of a child's  sexual abuse can alter his or her life forever. Many victims of child  pornography suffer from feelings of helplessness, fear, humiliation,  and lack of control, given that their images are available for others  to view in perpetuity.                                time  1045    These images are becoming more sadistic and violent, and the age of  the average victim is becoming younger and younger. It is a horrifying  fact that it is not uncommon for even toddlers and infants to now be  subjects of these images.   It is also important that there is no confusion about one fact: The  very creation of these images is repulsive, regardless of whether or  not the abuse was done with a specific intent of creating an image or  if the intent to memorialize this conduct was a secondary thought.   Consider the facts of the case that led to this bill. As was  mentioned, an adult male had sexual relations with a 7-year-old girl  who lived next door and decided to photograph it. That is the  production of child pornography. There is no question about it. No one  should be permitted to escape responsibility merely by asserting they  did not have a specific intent to create the image before they abused  the child. The act of taking a photo or making a video is enough to  demonstrate intent.   Mr. Speaker, that is what this bill does. It is appropriate that we  are doing all this on the day that we recognize as National Missing  Children's  [[Page H4586]]  Day. I am going to urge all my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to just say a couple of important points in rebuttal to  what we have heard.   For one thing, there has been no evidence that the cases referenced  by the gentlewoman involving conduct between minors are being  prosecuted at the Federal level. I have not seen even one that has been  cited. The point here is that prosecutorial discretion has been a  sufficient buffer.   In committee, our colleagues on the other side have invoked stories  of juvenile offenders being charged for consensual conduct and placed  on sex offender registries unjustly; however, these are all cases that  were prosecuted at the local level. Not one that has been mentioned has  been a Federal case.   It is important to note that, for offenders under 18, the Federal  Department of Justice policy on charging juveniles means that juvenile  prosecutions very rarely occur, and only if no State court can assume  jurisdiction. In fact, certification from the Attorney General himself  is necessary to proceed against a juvenile.   Again, I know of no such case in which a juvenile has been prosecuted  federally under any child pornography statute. So while we appreciate  and understand the concerns about mandatory minimum sentencing and its  abuse, particularly with the drug statutes, again, it is important to  reiterate here, that is not the case with child pornography.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I would oppose these arguments and  trust that my colleagues will see the wisdom in supporting this very  important and timely legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the concerns stated today  are misplaced. The child pornography statutes have never been the  subject of abuse by Federal prosecutors, and there is no evidence that  that would happen in the future. However, the abuse that is being  allowed and that we must address today is that of our children, and  that abuse is being allowed because of a loophole that was, sadly,  created by a Federal court.   Today we have an opportunity to correct that wrong. We have an  opportunity to do what we all acknowledge to be the right thing: to  defend the most defenseless among us. It is, indeed, an honor for us to  take this action on the week that commemorates National Missing  Children's Week and here, even, on this day, National Missing  Children's Day.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Protecting  Against Child Exploitation Act. We hope that everyone will do the right  thing here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx). All time for debate on the bill  has expired.                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No.  1 printed in part B of House Report 115-152.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, line 3, insert after ``section 2258B.'' the       following:        ``(h) Notwithstanding subsection (e), a person who violates       paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (a) and is 19 years of age       or younger at the time the violation occurred may, in the       alternative, be punished for a violation of this section by       imprisonment for not more than 1 year or a fine under this       title, or both, if--        ``(1) the minor is 15 years of age or older and not more       than 4 years younger than the person who committed the       violation, at the time the sexually explicit conduct       occurred; and        ``(2) the sexually explicit conduct that occurred was       consensual.''    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 352, the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.                                time  1100    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I associate myself with the words of  the ranking member, Mr. Conyers.   I look forward to strengthening these laws and, as well, working on  legislation to continue to protect our children, our innocent children,  from sexual abuse, sexual assault, and the devastation that it has on  their lives.   So I rise to continue that theme and to indicate, as I said earlier,  that some of the clarifications in the underlying bill are important,  and important to clarify, and important to provide prohibitions that  will be clear in possible further court interpretations. But I maintain  that we cannot predict the court interpretations, and the better and  clearer that we are to protect our children, I believe, is a route that  we should take.   The bill would add new classes of offenses. But section 2251 does not  provide for Romeo and Juliet exceptions; i.e., the penalties apply even  when conduct is consensual and when the victim and offender are close  in age. For example, a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old who videotaped  themselves engaged in a sexual act, then emailed the video to their own  email accounts, the 19-year-old would be subject to mandatory minimums.  That is the basis of the amendment, the Jackson Lee amendment.   The Jackson Lee amendment is a Romeo and Juliet exception. The  amendment is a reasonable approach to treatment of adolescent behavior  that should not be left to prosecutors. The pervasiveness of personal  technology, such as cell phones and tablets, have given rise to teenage  sexting. Research has shown that teenage sexting is widespread, even  among middle school-age youth.   Under section 2251, teenagers prosecuted for talking and sending  messages, and then taking and sending messages, would be subject to  mandatory prison sentences of at least 15 years and sex offender  registration.   In light of the recent troubling statements by Attorney General  Sessions, Congress should provide an alternative to existing mandatory  penalties in sexting cases, particularly with juveniles. We cannot say  that a juvenile will not be prosecuted federally. They could be, under  this particular statute.   So this is a carve-out, a Romeo and Juliet carve-out, to ensure that  it does not happen, to protect against the possibility of it happening.   A study conducted by Drexel University found that more than half of  the undergraduate students who took part in an online survey said they  had sexted when they were teenagers, and 30 percent said that they  included photos in that message, meaning that they had sent sexual  texts.   Therefore, I ask that my colleagues come together and support the  Jackson Lee amendment for a Romeo and Juliet carve-out.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Madam Speaker, it is not only unnecessary,  but it is fashioned in such a manner which may potentially create the  type of loophole that we are looking to close.   Under current law, so-called Romeo and Juliet cases, such as those  between 19- and 50-year-olds, could be prosecuted under any of the  child pornography laws--possession, production, or distribution. That  has always been the case.   However, I reiterate that we know of no such instance that has been  brought under any of these Federal provisions under the circumstances  covered by this amendment, which further supports the fact that Federal  prosecutors do not appear to be bringing such cases. There is just  simply no evidence that has been produced to suggest otherwise. For  that reason, the amendment is completely unnecessary, and it is based  upon no evidence at all.   On the contrary, the underlying bill is based upon a real case where  a real 7-year-old girl was sexually abused and photographed by a real  sexual predator.   Our colleagues on the other side have also continually referred to  Attorney General Sessions' recent charging memoranda which suggests  that under the policy in his memo prosecutors will suddenly be forced  to aggressively prosecute 19-year-olds who are engaging in consensual  sexual conduct under this statute. But that notion is preposterous and  is also based on no evidence.   As an initial matter, the minority completely ignores the fact that a  prosecutor makes an initial determination as to whether to commence or  decline prosecution. And this is distinct from the subsequent decision  of what charges should be brought, which would only occur if the  decision to prosecute is made in the first place.   According to the U.S. attorneys' manual, in making the initial  determination to commence a prosecution, a prosecutor must consider  whether ``a substantial Federal interest would be served by the  prosecution,'' and whether, ``in his or her judgment: One, the person  is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or, two,  there exists an adequate noncriminal alternative to prosecution.''   The Sessions memo doesn't change any of that, and it is absurd to  think that the memo will cause the Department of Justice to suddenly  shift its prosecutions to aggressively go after Romeo and Juliet cases.  This is especially ridiculous, as Attorney General Sessions had made  clear from the outset, that the priorities of DOJ and this  administration are to prosecute violent crimes and violent offenders.   I think that the minority just fundamentally misunderstands and  mischaracterizes not only the Sessions memo but this legislation. For  that reason, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, let me quickly say that I respect the  [[Page H4588]]  gentleman, but I take great issue in calling a Member's amendment, or  the analysis of that amendment, ridiculous, because it is not  ridiculous. It is an extremely reasonable amendment. And unless he has  some powers that I am not aware of, no one can predict when a  prosecutor will determine that they will prosecute. We cannot. We pass  criminal justice laws every day and cannot predict.    Whether or not it is based upon the Sessions memo, which as far as  anyone who can read knows that we are going back to a stricter  enforcement of everything criminal against everyone. That is clear.   The Jackson Lee amendment recognizes that not all sex offenses are  the same. And currently, section 2251 is a one-size-fits-all sentencing  scheme. It fits all, even a 19-year-old.   The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a better alternative.  Punishment will be available involving offenses. When defendants are no  more than 19 years old, they would have other alternatives. The judge  would have discretion. That is simply what we are asking for.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article entitled, ``Keep  Mandatory Minimums Out of the Juvenile Justice System.'' This bill does  not do that; and I also include an article entitled, ``Teenage Sexting  is Not Child Porn.''                              [June 16, 2014]     OP-ED: Keep Mandatory Minimums Out of the Juvenile Justice System                             (By Lizzie Buchen)         Across the country, mandatory minimum sentences are falling       out of favor. From Sen. Rand Paul to Attorney General Eric       Holder, people from both ends of the political spectrum are       blaming these harsh and punitive sentences for driving our       skyrocketing incarceration rates and exacerbating racial       disparities in the criminal justice system. But in this era       of smart sentencing reform--particularly toward young       people--a disturbing piece of legislation is coasting through       the California legislature, threatening to wrench the state       in the opposite direction. Senate Bill 838, authored by state       Sen. Jim Beall (D-Santa Clara), would break new ground by       establishing the first mandatory minimum sentences in the       state's juvenile justice system.        The juvenile justice system was founded on the       understanding that young people who commit offenses are often       struggling in situations outside of their control, are highly       amenable to rehabilitation and have the potential to lead       productive and law-abiding lives. Mandatory minimum sentences       automatic sentences of incarceration or confinement, meted       out regardless of the facts of the case are completely at       odds with these foundational principles. They are determined       not by the youth's past circumstances or potential life       ahead, but by what he or she has done. The only result is       punishment, a sharp contrast to the rehabilitative ideals of       the juvenile justice system.        Mandatory minimum sentences are completely incompatible       with how juvenile court works. When a youth has committed an       offense, juvenile court judges tailor sanctions to best meet       a youth's unique needs for rehabilitation by weighing a       comprehensive set of factors, including the severity of the       crime, the statement of the victims, and the circumstances of       the youth's life--including mental health issues and       experience with abuse, homelessness and extreme poverty. The       judge then chooses from a wide range of community-based and       residential options, allowing him or her to tailor the       sanction to best treat the youth and protect the community.       In line with this focus on rehabilitation, the sentences are       indeterminate, with terms based on the youth's progress.        Proponents of mandatory minimum sentences, including       supporters of California's youth mandatory minimum bill,       claim that these sentences deter crime. But the evidence       tells us this is a dubious notion at best. Although this bill       would introduce the first mandatory minimum sentences in       California's juvenile justice system, such sentences have       been in place in the adult system for decades--and are widely       recognized as failures. A large and growing body of research       has found that mandatory minimum sentences have come at       enormous social, financial and human costs, with little       benefit to public safety. There is no evidence that these       sentences have a significant deterrent effect. If anything,       these harsh punishments are counterproductive, putting the       public at risk by disrupting families, impoverishing       communities of human capital, making it more difficult for       people to return to law-abiding society and diverting       precious public resources away from social services and       toward costly incarceration.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 2016]                     Teenage Sexting Is Not Child Porn                          (By Amy Adele Hasinoff)         Teenagers who sext are in a precarious legal position.       Though in most states teenagers who are close in age can       legally have consensual sex, if they create and share       sexually explicit images of themselves, they are technically       producing, distributing or possessing child pornography. The       laws that cover this situation, passed decades ago, were       meant to apply to adults who exploited children and require       those convicted under them to register as sex offenders.        Though most prosecutors do not use these laws against       consensual teenage sexters, some do. The University of New       Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates       that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child       pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared       images with peers consensually.        Almost two dozen states, including New York, Illinois and       Florida, have tried to solve the legal problems that surround       sexting with new legislation, and others, like Colorado, are       considering new sexting laws. These reforms typically give       prosecutors the discretion to choose between child-      pornography felony charges or lesser penalties like       misdemeanor charges or a mandatory educational program.        These new laws may seem like a measured solution to the       problem of charging teenage sexters with child pornography       felonies. However, once they have the option of lesser       penalties, prosecutors are more likely to press charges--not       only against teenagers who distribute private images without       permission, but also against those who sext consensually.        Given the extensive research that shows that young people       who are nonwhite, low income, gay or transgender are       disproportionately prosecuted for many crimes, there is good       reason to suspect that laws that criminalize teenage sexting       are being unfairly applied as well. As legislators have tried       to cope with the legal fallout, they have also opened up more       types of images to scrutiny: While child pornography laws       apply only to sexually explicit images, many new sexting laws       criminalize all nude images of teenagers, including photos of       topless teenage girls.        A better solution would be to bring child pornography laws       in line with statutory rape laws by exempting teenagers who       are close in age and who consensually create, share or       receive sexual images. Vermont tried to enact major reform to       its child pornography laws in 2009, but abandoned the effort       after a national backlash and settled instead on a new       misdemeanor law.        In February, New Mexico passed a limited version of child       pornography reform, which shields teenagers who receive a       sexual image from a peer from facing child-pornography       possession charges. Teenagers who create or share sexual       images can still be convicted of child pornography production       or distribution.        Both existing child pornography laws and new sexting-      specific laws criminalize a common behavior among teenagers.       Studies have shown that roughly one-third of 16- and 17-year-      olds share suggestive images on their cellphones. Among young       adults, rates are above 50 percent. In the past, partners       wrote love letters, sent suggestive Polaroids and had phone       sex. Today, for better or worse, this kind of interpersonal       sexual communication also occurs in a digital format. And       it's not just young people: An article in an AARP magazine       describes sexting as ``fun, easy and usually harmless.''        Like any sexual act, consensual sexting is somewhat risky       and requires trust, but it is not inherently harmful as long       as partners respect each other's privacy and are attentive to       consent. Studies have found that around 3 percent of       Americans report that someone has distributed private sexual       images without their permission, and around 10 percent of       sexters report negative consequences. The risk of       distribution is significantly higher among those who were       coerced into sexting.        The victim of a sexual privacy violation can be traumatized       and humiliated, and is often blamed for his or her       victimization. Unfortunately, the criminalization of sexting       worsens this problem because teenagers know that if they       report the incident they may be punished at school and       possibly charged with the same offense as the perpetrator. In       most jurisdictions, distributing a sexual image of a teenager       is illegal, regardless of whether one is consensually sending       a nude selfie to a partner or maliciously distributing a       private photo of another person without permission.        Though some people believe that prohibiting sexting       discourages the practice and protects teenagers from harm,       research on abstinence-only sex education demonstrates that       those policies actually increase unwanted pregnancies and       sexually transmitted infections. Abstinence-only messages       about sexting are likely to be counterproductive as well.        What parents and educators need to do instead is help young       people learn how to navigate sexual risk and trust. Whether       or not it is criminalized, we cannot prevent sexting, just as       we cannot prevent teenagers from having sex. What we need to       focus on is preventing acts of sexual violation, like the       distribution of a private image without permission,       pressuring a partner to sext or sending a sexual image to an       unwilling recipient. Though not all teenagers are sexting,       those who are (and those who will when they are older) need       to learn how to practice safer sexting, which means that it       always has to be consensual.        As State Senator George Munoz, a prominent supporter of the       amendment that established New Mexico's new sexting regime,       told  [[Page H4589]]       The Guardian, ``Our laws have to change with technology.'' To       keep up with those changes, the first step is to       decriminalize consensual sexting by creating exceptions in       child pornography laws for teenagers who are close in age.        Once we do this, we can concentrate on developing better       ways to deal with the new digital forms of harm.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the  Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about my amendment to H.R. 1761,  ``Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act.''   As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, I  offer this amendment to help make H.R. 1761 a better bill to achieve  its intended purpose.   Though troubled by any sexually explicit activity that may exploit  and otherwise, harm our children, I believe that H.R. 1761, the  ``Protecting Against Child Exploitation Act,'' is deadly and  counterproductive to ensuring protection of our youth population in our  new technology era.   This bill will exacerbate overwhelming concerns with the unfair and  unjust mandatory minimum sentencing that contributes to the over- criminalization of juveniles and mass incarceration generally.   Simply put, this bill will add to the already tragic realities of  many juveniles. Rather than proceeding with the caution befitting an  expansion of the mandatory sentencing penalty, H.R. 1761 is being  rushed to the House Floor, without a single hearing and without the  opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to whether our  system of criminalizing juveniles for sexting is fair, just, and sound  policy.   Though presented as a proposal to protect children, H.R. 1761  excessively penalizes juveniles and creates life altering criminal  charges when engaged in `sexting'.   Rather, it raises new constitutional concerns; and it does not  address documented and systemic unfairness and racial disparity in the  imposition of mandatory sentencing and its overbroad sweep of  criminalizing juveniles.   My amendment fixes that problem. It creates an alternative punishment  (not more than one year of imprisonment) under section 2251 for  teenagers who participate in ``sexting'' and might otherwise be subject  to mandatory minimum sentences of at least 15 years in prison.   The Jackson Lee is a thoughtful, narrowly-drawn provision that  provides judges with a sensible sentencing option for teenagers no more  than 19 years old who participate in sexting that may be applied in the  judges' discretion, in appropriate cases.   The Jackson Lee amendment is a reasonable approach to treatment of  adolescent behavior that should not be left to prosecutors. The  pervasiveness of personal technology, such as cellphones and tablets,  has given rise to teenage ``sexting.'' Research has shown that teenage  sexting is widespread, even among middle school-aged youth. Under  section 2251, teenagers prosecuted for taking and sending such messages  would be subject to mandatory prison sentences of at least 15 years and  sex offender registration. In light of the recent troubling statements  made by Attorney General Sessions, Congress should provide an  alternative to existing mandatory minimum penalties in ``sexting''  cases.   A study conducted by Drexel University found that more than half of  the undergraduate students who took part in an online survey said that  they sexted when they were teenagers. Thirty percent said they included  photos in their messages and 61 percent did not know that sending nude  photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another online  survey published in 2008 found that almost 40 percent of teenagers  between ages 13 and 19 had sent ``sext'' messages, almost 50 percent  had received a sext message, and 20 percent posted nude or semi-nude  content online.   The Jackson Lee amendment recognizes that not all sex offenses are  the same. Currently, section 2251 employs a one-size-fits-all  sentencing scheme. Under section 2251, a 19 year-old, who engages in  ``sexting'' (sending or receiving a sexually explicit photo or video of  a minor) with a willing, 17 year-old girlfriend or boyfriend, would be  subject to the same mandatory minimum sentence as a 50 year-old man,  who engages in the same conduct with a 17 year-old.   The Jackson Lee amendment would provide a better alternative. The  alternative punishment would be available in prosecutions involving  offenses under section 2251(a)(2) or 2251(a)(3), when the defendant is  no more than 19 years old, the difference in age between the defendant  and victim is no more than four years, and the sexually explicit  conduct depicted in the photo or video was consensual. Judges would not  be required to sentence teenagers pursuant to the alternative  punishment.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).    Madam Speaker, I have tremendous respect  for my colleagues on the other side, Mr. Conyers and Ms. Jackson Lee. I  understand her amendment is heartfelt and has the proper motive and  attention.   I would just suggest, again, that the risk of this amendment  outweighs any potential benefit because it creates the kind of  loopholes that we are trying here desperately to prevent.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question  is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
