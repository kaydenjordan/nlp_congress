 Mr. Speaker, I thank my great friend, Mr. Smith, and  a great fighter for life for many years, and we appreciate all of his  work on that.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 49th anniversary of the Roe v.  Wade tragedy and to remember the more than 60 million unborn lives it  has taken and the tragic, irreversible mark it has left on countless  mothers, fathers, and families.   Every innocent life is precious, from conception until natural death,  but for nearly five decades abortion has remained one of the greatest  tragedies of our Nation.   The Supreme Court now has the opportunity to right some of the  terrible wrongs committed in this country against the unborn since Roe  v. Wade. I pray for our Justices, that they make the right decision,  for many lives will depend on it.   We will continue to fight for the lives of unborn children.
