 Mr. President, I know the night is going on. I just want  to take a moment to express my appreciation to all the staff members  and Senators who remain here on the floor. A lot of folks who work  here, from the gentleman typing very quickly, all the way to a lot of  the folks working, I just want to express my gratitude for the long  night, particularly to the pages. It is their second week here, and  they suddenly are being forced to grapple with not just school but the  long nights of the Senate. I really do respect them and am grateful for  their, how should I say, endurance tonight as well.   I rise today, as many of my colleagues have, to speak to the  nomination of Betsy DeVos and to speak specifically in opposition to  her nomination to serve as Secretary of Education. I have listened to  as many of my colleagues' words as I can. I want to say that  particularly those on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pension  Committee have and will and continue to expand upon many of the  concerning elements of Mrs. DeVos's record, concerns that I share about  her lack of support for critical accountability measures, her lack of  familiarity with many of the basic financial aid policies and programs  which are so essential for people to have access to higher education,  her inability to say that guns should not be in school, and her seeming  lack of understanding of many of the fundamental yet critical education  policy perspectives that I think are necessary for a job of this  magnitude.   I know there has been much said and there will be many more issues  brought up of concern to many of the Democrats who spoke tonight, but  tonight I would like to focus on an area that is very personal to me  and also very personal to millions of Americans, that is essential to  this role but one that may not be immediately understood when you talk  about a Secretary of Education, but it is absolutely critical to that  Department. In fact, I think it is one of the more critical roles of  that Department when it comes to fulfilling the ideals of our Nation.   Within the Department of Education is the Office for Civil Rights.  That office is profoundly important, but it is one that many people  don't have a full understanding of. What I would like to do right now  is highlight four areas in which the Office for Civil Rights functions  and also talk as it relates to my concerns about and my opposition to  Betsy DeVos to serve as Secretary of Education.   First, I would like to talk about what is at stake for children with  disabilities and their families and their parents. About 13 to 14  percent of our American school-age children--about 6.5 million kids and  young adults in America--are students with a disability.   Here in the United States, I am so proud that we have a deep belief  and, in fact, our laws, passed by people of both Houses, both parties,  dictate that all children be treated with dignity and respect and that  they will get the educational opportunities all children deserve.  Indeed, our laws reflect that, but the spirit of America is to see that  in this Nation all of our children have unique gifts, all of our  children have beauty, and we as a nation collectively believe they all  deserve a strong pathway to the fundamental American ideal. They  deserve pathways to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that  when we say ``justice for all,'' we really do mean all children.   But unfortunately, as the work of the Department of Education's  Office for Civil Rights demonstrates, the Federal Government is often  at odds with some school districts that do not properly enforce  protections granted to students with disabilities under the Federal  law, again passed by both Houses, passed by both parties. Within our  country, thousands of parents do not believe their children are  receiving justice in their local school systems for their children with  disabilities. They reach out to the Federal Government for help, for  relief, for that justice.   Take the example of one child, the case of a 9-year-old child in  California whose name is withheld for privacy. This child--and let's  call her Jane--is a student like so many others. She has the same  dreams and aspirations, has hopes, has promise, and has untapped,  unlimited potential.   At the age of 9, this child, ``Jane,'' had been physically restrained  in her school more than 92 times during an 11-month period by her  school because of her disability. As a part of that restraint, she had  been held facedown for a total of 2,200 minutes.   The Office for Civil Rights at the Federal level, the Federal  Government, it took them to investigate this case, and they found that  the district was in violation of the Federal law and required the  school district to stop using these kinds of restraints on students and  to actually take the time and energy to invest the resources in  training the staff on alternative intervention methods, methods that  recognize the dignity of that child and show that we have the potential  and power to elevate that child, not to so savagely restrain them.   This was not only unconscionable treatment that the Federal  Government intervened in, but clearly it was illegal within the bounds  of Federal law. This is not the way that anyone here, anyone in this  body with a child with a disability, any of us would want our children  to be treated.   If I had a child, I know it is not the way I would want them treated.  Frankly, when it comes to the children of America, they are our  children. Whether Republican or Democrat, we know that our children,  our kids, American children--all children, frankly--deserve better than  this kind of physical abuse. It is for these kinds of reasons  [[Page S737]]  that I believe we need to have an aggressive Office for Civil Rights  because the story of Jane, of a 9-year-old, is not an anomaly. It is  not something that is rare.   Unfortunately, as we are seeing, there are many violations of Federal  law that go on when it comes to our children with disabilities. There  is tremendous evidence that this kind of abuse still goes on in our  country, and there needs to be an ultimate authority that can  investigate this abuse and, if necessary, hold those people accountable  who are the abusers. And the additional step that the Office for Civil  Rights does is it gives advisement, gives instruction on how to make  sure the abuse does not happen in the future.   We need our Office for Civil Rights to work with school districts to  establish those policies and procedures to prevent that abuse.   When Mrs. DeVos, during her testimony, was given the opportunity to  speak to the millions of parents who have real, legitimate concerns  about their children with disabilities and the treatment they receive  in school--she was given the opportunity to speak to the vital role of  the Federal Government in protecting our children and affirming those  rights, about the role of the Office for Civil Rights, and instead of  taking that opportunity, instead of seizing the moment to talk about  what she would be doing to lead, she actually denied a role for the  Federal Government. When asked about protecting students with  disabilities, she simply said: ``It should be left up to the States.''   Well, I will tell you right now, for that 9-year-old child physically  restrained more than 92 times, held facedown for hours, the Federal  Government clearly had an important role to play for that mom, for that  family, for that child in making sure this kind of atrocity doesn't  happen and will not happen for more children.   Secondly, I would like to talk about what is at stake with the Office  for Civil Rights as it relates to children who are different, whether  that be the color of their skin, whether they wear a hijab to school as  an expression of their faith or if they are a minority or, again, a  child with a disability.   For example, I have spoken much as a Senator about the school-to- prison pipeline and often how certain categories of children experience  different types of discipline for the same act in school just because  of how they look.   School disciplinary policies, we know, play a big role in a child's  success, and those disciplinary policies are clearly treating different  children in different ways. There will be different outcomes for those  categories of kids.   We know that children who have out-of-school suspensions often  graduate at significantly lower rates, have significantly higher run- ins with the law. I am one who believes we cannot allow discrimination  to happen in that manner in our school.   These are the facts. This is the data. Take, for example, the fact  that Black students are 3.8 times more likely than their White peers to  receive one or more out-of-school suspensions, while students with  disabilities actually are twice as likely as those without to receive  one or more out-of-school suspensions.    Let me give you the specific case of Tunette Powell, who wrote about  her son who is Black. His name is Joah. He was suspended five times in  2014. He was 3 years old.   She said: ``One after another, White mothers confessed the trouble  their children had gotten into. Some of the behavior was similar to  JJ's,'' her son's. ``Some was much worse. Most startling'' to her was  that ``none of their children had been suspended.''   She continues to write. ``After that party,'' where she had heard  this from other White parents, ``I read a study reflecting everything I  was living. Black children represent 18 percent of preschool enrollment  but make up 48 percent of preschool children receiving more than one  out-of-school suspension, according to the study released by the  Education Department's Office for Civil Rights in March,'' she writes.   One of the critical things about the Office for Civil Rights is that  they have been proactively collecting data about differences in  treatment in our schools.   Now there are many people who actively assert that the role of the  Office for Civil Rights has grown too large, that they are poking  around in local matters too much, that even collecting such data, as  was relied on by this mother, is an intrusion into States' rights. I  believe, when it comes to civil rights, when it comes to religious  freedom and the treatment of our children, I do not believe that the  Office for Civil Rights has grown too large. I believe they are  offering critical transparency into the workings of our schools; that  they are collecting data that parents and policymakers and civil rights  groups can use to see who is being left behind, who might be facing  discrimination, who is not receiving justice.   What do we have to be afraid of even on just the collection of data  to allow ourselves to have that transparency, to create an environment  of accountability?   I worry that if this is not a priority for the next Secretary of  Education, then closing the achievement gap, shutting down the school- to-prison pipeline, and empowering all children to have an equal  opportunity to learn will be undermined.   These are real problems in our country, and they aren't just going to  go away. The Federal Government, especially when they insist upon data  transparency, is an active partner in helping us to receive the justice  that we deserve and need and pledge allegiance to as a country.   I had hoped during the hearings of Mrs. DeVos that I would hear more;  that even if I had the opportunity to talk to the nominee myself, I  would have asked for more information around these issues, but I didn't  have that opportunity, and in the very rushed hearing, the issue wasn't  raised.   I believe, though, that based on the testimony that was given, that  the nominee may not see this as a vital function of the Office for  Civil Rights and, in fact, may shrink that office and the ongoing  proactive investigations that we see right now into such matters.   We know that the school-to-prison pipeline, particularly for young  people of color, isn't just real; it is actually pervasive. But during  Mrs. DeVos's confirmation hearing, when asked about the Office for  Civil Rights within the Department of Education that is responsible for  rectifying such unjust situations, she refused to comment. She refused  to comment. She refused to commit herself even to directing the Office  for Civil Rights to investigate such civil rights violations. I don't  understand why it is difficult to even commit the Department to  continuing such investigations, but that commitment was denied.   I want to next talk about the serious problem we have in America with  sexual assault and sexual violence in schools and on college campuses.  Mr. President, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually assaulted in  their college years, but only 1 percent of assailants on college  campuses are arrested, charged, or convicted.   We still know that too many people on college campuses who have been  sexually assaulted, who are survivors, are routinely denied justice and  are forced to even live or even go to class with their attackers.   The Office for Civil Rights has risen to this challenge and this  crisis. They have opened investigations in over 200 schools in America.  There is a crisis of campus sexual assault in America, and now the  Office for Civil Rights is expanding their work. They have stepped up  to that challenge. In addition to that, they have issued guidance to  all college campuses on preventing and combating sexual assault.   Mrs. DeVos, again, during her testimony--many of us were hoping she  would rise to the occasion, that she would speak to this issue. She was  given a chance, given a chance not just to speak to the issue but to  talk to the Federal role in meeting this crisis, to acknowledge that  this is an issue our Nation must grapple with and must end, but she did  not speak to the concerns of parents. She did not speak to the concerns  of survivors. She did not speak to America about the urgent need for  all of us to be engaged in dealing with the crisis for which there has  been silence for too long.   More than this, she did not speak to the role of the Office for Civil  Rights, to the expanding role they have been taking, to the expanding  investigations on college campuses all across the country, giving no  confidence to me or  [[Page S738]]  to others that this will be a role that will continue--in fact, a role  that I believe should be expanded.   Again, even when she was specifically asked about upholding guidance  within the Department of Education on combating and preventing sexual  assault--not asked to commit on the investigations, not asked to commit  to expanding the efforts but just asked about upholding the guidance  within the Department of Education on combating and preventing sexual  assault, she refused to commit to maintaining that guidance.   I would like to speak to another area. Before I do, I do believe in  this idea of transparency that my previous colleague talked about when  it comes to donations. Some of the charities that have received  donations from Mrs. DeVos have a history of fighting against efforts to  combat sexual assault, and some of these organizations worked to make  it more difficult for sexual assault victims to seek justice.   That brings me to an area in which I have a deep level of concern. I  hope Mrs. DeVos will take the opportunity to set the record straight  because much has been written even before the hearings involving an  area where there is a clear crisis in our country. It is the crisis  involving the safety and security of our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  transgender youth in America.   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth face a stunning level  of discrimination inside and outside of schools starting at a very  young age. We know that LGBT youth are two times more likely than their  heterosexual peers to be physically assaulted in schools. LGBT youth  are four times more likely to attempt suicide. According to youth risk  behavior surveys, 34 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender  students were assaulted on school property. More than one-third of LGBT  school students were bullied on school property, and 13 percent of  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students did not go to school  because of concerns for their safety. We know in America that this kind  of harassment has no place in our classrooms, no place in our schools,  and it has no place anywhere in our country, but it is all too common  and all too often unaddressed.   I would like to talk about a parent. Her name is Wendy Walsh. The  harassment against Wendy's son Seth began for him in the fourth grade  when his classmates suspected he was gay. By the time he reached the  seventh grade, the bullying, the verbal and physical abuse in person  and online was so bad that he was afraid to walk home from school. This  child lived in terror of just going to class. After one bullying  incident in a local park, his mom says that 13-year-old Seth came home  from school. She talked to him. He asked to borrow a pen from his mom.  That conversation will be the last time she would see her son alive.  The next time Wendy saw her son Seth, he had hanged himself on a tree  in their backyard.   After Seth's death, Wendy, experiencing a level of grief and agony I  cannot imagine, decided to file a complaint with the Department of  Education Office for Civil Rights. When the Office for Civil Rights  came in and investigated, they found that Seth's school district was in  violation of several Federal laws, that they failed to intervene and  stop the bullying and harassment and torment that this child endured  from a precious age until his death, that their actions could have  potentially prevented the death of one of our children, an American  child, a child of beauty and of worth and of dignity and protection.   Wendy went to the Federal Government to the Office for Civil Rights,  and they took her concerns seriously. They aggressively investigated.  Because of their investigation and because of Wendy's courage in her  time of grief, the school district, in violation of Federal law, was  required to take steps--though not there to prevent her child's death-- they were required to take steps to prevent the kind of harassment,  tormenting, and bullying from happening to other students. I am not  sure if any of that is solace to a mother who lost her child. I am not  sure if it gave her comfort, but I am hopeful that with an active  Office for Civil Rights at the Federal Department of Education, at a  time where more than 10 percent of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are  missing school because of that kind of fear, when one-third are  reporting bullying and harassing in person or online, at this level of  unconscionable treatment for any child, there is a role for the Federal  Government to protect our children. I believe if we take these matters  seriously that we can insure that this kind of bullying and harassment  will come to an end in America. It is unacceptable in a country this  great. There are laws against this, and there are folks who have an  obligation to enforce those laws; that is, the Office of Civil Rights.   I believe things will get better, but they will not get better  automatically because we hope for them, because we pray for them; they  will get better because we are a country that loves our children, and  love is not a being verb. It demands action. We see time and time again  that children aren't seeing the kind of action where they are, and  thank God right now there is a place for parents to go. They can appeal  to the Federal Government. The Department of Education, the Office for  Civil Rights, has to be led by someone who takes this seriously, who  sees the calls for justice for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender  youth as valid, that sees the crisis, that sees the problem.   It was widely reported, when Mrs. DeVos's nomination was made--widely  reported--that her family had given support, significant support, and  that she herself gave significant support to discriminatory extremists,  dangerous and hateful groups that promote ideas that say a child who is  gay is somehow lesser than a child that is not; groups that have  supported things like conversion therapy, something that has been  resoundingly condemned--dangerous ideas that are hurtful to children.  With all of that, with all the articles that have been written, this  was a chance for Mrs. DeVos to sit before the American public knowing  that these concerns are out there, and it is understandable, even if  she doesn't hold them, it is understandable that this was a moment for  her to allay the fears of the thousands and thousands of children who  are being isolated and hurt by bullies, the people who are assaulting  their dignity--these children have suicide rates that are  unconscionably high--for the parents mourning their kids, with all that  swirl, the hearing was her chance to set the record straight to say: I  will uphold the value and dignity of these children, but more than  that, I recognize there is a crisis in our country, and I will work  with the Office for Civil Rights to do something to address this evil  in our country. We have so many kids being hurt and harmed. This was  her chance to go beyond just denying that she believed in conversion  therapy, to go beyond just words in asserting that she values equality.  This was her chance. It should have been understood that because of the  record and the charitable donations that there was a degree of  suspicion; that there was an understandable degree of legitimate fear  that she would not continue the courageous work of the Office for Civil  Rights in combating discrimination, harassment, and physical abuse of  children across our country. She had the opportunity.   Given the fears and concerns that have been expressed, I would have  hoped she would have spoken directly to the work of the Office for  Civil Rights to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender teens  who are factually experiencing some of the highest levels of hate  crimes and violence and bullying of any children in America; that she  would have made some affirmation that she would be a champion for their  equality, for their dignity, and the Office for Civil Rights would  continue its needed work, but she didn't.   I hoped she would stand up and say: We have violence on our college  campuses; that right now silence is allowing insidious realities to  exist. We have a problem with reporting rates. We have a problem with  reports being made and not being taken seriously; that she could have  used that as an opportunity to speak against what is happening to an  unconscionable level of young women on college campuses--something that  we would never want to have happen to any of our daughters; to make a  pledge that the Office for Civil Rights would not just continue campus  advisories but would fight to hold those college campuses accountable,  but she didn't.   For students and families across the country, this may not be a  celebrated  [[Page S739]]  part. We may not all know in America that the Department of Education  has an Office of Civil Rights, but for so many families with children  on college campuses and preschools, grade schools, high schools, the  Office for Civil Rights has been the difference--the difference makers  between injustice and justice, the difference makers between violence  and security, the difference makers between who we say we are as a  nation, liberty and justice for all, and experiencing a terrible, awful  lie.   I feel compelled to speak out on the vital importance of the  Education Secretary, regardless of party, regardless of background. I  feel a personal responsibility to assure that if I cast my vote as a  Senator, that whoever takes that office will be tireless in the defense  of all the rights, privileges, and liberties of our students because I  personally stand here today because of the role of the Federal  Government in enforcing civil rights laws. I stand here today because  of the courageous Federal laws that were put in place--bipartisanship,  Republicans and Democrats, great battles on this floor for civil rights  and disability rights, for title IX protections for women. I am a  product of these kinds of fights over the Federal role when it comes to  civil rights. I stand here today because of our collective history. I  stand here today because of our dramatic history. I believe in States'  rights. It is enshrined in our Constitution, but I cannot ignore the  role of the Federal Government. Brown v. Board of Education is perhaps  one of the most famous Supreme Court cases affirming the Federal role.    I hung a picture in the front of my office. I come out of my office  into where my assistant sits, and the first thing I see on the wall in  front of me is a Norman Rockwell painting. There is this young girl in  that painting, and she is striding proudly to school, and behind her  are racial epithets, a tomato smashed against that wall. She is a  little girl--God, her courage--named Ruby Bridges. There are these  White men surrounding her walking just as tall, and they are escorting  that girl to school. There is clearly hate swirling around. You can  look at that picture, and you can feel it. But I don't care what your  background or religion is, you look at Norman Rockwell's painting--as I  make sure I do every day as I leave my office as a U.S. Senator and I  see that picture--and I am reminded that sometimes when there is hate,  sometimes when there is violence, sometimes the State doesn't get the  job done. Sometimes, the most vulnerable child needs a little help--not  just from a loving teacher or a loving parent but from a government  that stands behind her and says: You matter.   I can't stand here today without recognizing that this is my history,  that this is your history, that it is all of our history, and that our  Federal Government has a role to play. I drink deeply from the wells of  the freedom and the struggles and the sacrifice. I reap the harvest  from Ruby Bridges and her courage.   Our country has come so far. There is so much love, so much more  recognition of the dignity of all children. But, come on, we are not  there yet. Children are often harassed because they wear a head scarf.  I recently heard about a Sikh child wearing a turban who was still  harassed; a mother concerned that her kid, no worse than another but  seems to get suspended more for the same behavior. As to children with  disabilities, parents are still concerned that even though we have  affirmed their rights and dignities in law, those laws aren't being  carried out like they should.   God, there are young women on a college campus today who rightfully  question whether their campus is committed to eradicating sexual  violence.   With all of these things going on, we have to have champions here. We  have to have people who understand that public education is a right for  everyone. Some of the most profound battles in our country have been  fought to get equal access for children to school, so that they can  stride toward that school door knowing that they will get a quality  education, free from bullying, free from harassment, free from the  binds of hatred or discrimination that might hold them back in their  lives.   Now, I have faith in who we are as a Nation. I know we are a loving  country and a good country, but we haven't got it perfect yet. So I  stand here today in opposition to this nomination because I believe we  need a champion. I wish I had a chance to meet with the nominee. I wish  the hearings had been longer. I have never seen them so rushed. But  there is too much at stake right now. There are too many problems that  still exist.   Sadly, there still is a need for an Office of Civil Rights in the  Department of Education that is aggressive when it comes to the defense  of freedom and our rights. I did not hear such a commitment from this  nominee. There are millions of parents who didn't hear her speak to the  concerns they have about their gay child, the concerns they have about  their child with a disability, their concerns about their children  going off to college. We did not hear that commitment. In fact, what we  heard was a belief that States can figure it out. There was a failure  to commit to even the most basic continuance of the Office of Civil  Rights.   I am glad I hung that picture in front of my office. I may not be  able to get what I consider an open hearing and answers to these  questions because I walk by Ruby Bridges. I feel I owe her a duty to  not vote for someone who has been silent on the issues that are so  critical to this country being who we say we are.   There is a child, I think, who wonders right now. Somewhere in  America, that child is wondering if this country will prove itself true  to them. They are probably enduring some things I never had to endure.  They are probably worried about their safety. They are probably being  put in a situation where they are questioning their worth. They  probably feel alone and isolated. My prayer is that this child knows  that, even though it isn't perfect and it won't be easy, that child  somehow knows that they are not alone, that there will be people  fighting for them. I was taught, in the words of a great poet, that  there is a dream in this land with its back against the wall; to save  the dream for one, we must save it for all.   May the Office of Civil Rights in the years to come remain vigilant,  remain strong, and remain expansive in their efforts. I have no  confidence it will do so under this person and, therefore, I oppose  this nomination. Thank you very much.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  privileges of the floor be granted to the following member of my staff:  Erin Robinson.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to continue the  dialogue of the conversation about the candidate, the nominee for  Attorney General. I rise to join my colleagues in opposition to the  nomination.   I witnessed earlier tonight something that greatly disappointed me.  One of my colleagues, as was mentioned earlier, stood up to read into  the Record a letter, as we just saw, that has been a part of the record  of this body for decades--to read that letter into the Record. That was  then stopped through the Chair because it was said to impugn another  sitting Senator.   As Chuck Schumer said, that is selective enforcement, but to me there  is that going on and a lot more.   I used to preside in the first months I was in the U.S. Senate and  sat and listened to the speeches of many of my colleagues. I have to  say, I am proud to be a Member of the body, where folks on both sides  comport themselves with a level of comity that is admirable.   I heard some people tonight decry the descending of this body into  unfortunate places, but the reality is, my experience has been, on the  whole, very positive. The respect and the collegiality here is  something that makes this place incredibly valuable to work. Though the  public might not see it, there are a lot of bills that get worked on  together and even get to the floor, many of them get votes, many of  them get passed. I am proud to have passed many of those bills with my  colleagues, colleagues whom I don't just consider colleagues; frankly,  I consider them friends.   But within that context, I have to say I have watched when I sat in  the Chair and had to listen many times when people said things that  made me feel they were unfortunate. I watched the President of the  United States talk about his character and his motives in ways that I  thought were disparaging, but amidst all of this, in my 3 years, I have  never seen someone stopped from speaking on the Senate floor when, as  the Democratic leader said so clearly, there could have been many other  times where that rule was used, and that is a frustration.   But what makes it more of a frustration is the context in which it  happened tonight. You see, Senator Warren stood up and was speaking  with a passion about this nomination. And in the midst of her speaking  her truth, in the midst of her speaking her heart, she was stopped as  she read something into the Record that had been there for decades. To  me that is problematic not just because it was a regular speech but  because this had to do with her constitutional duty of providing advice  and consent. She wasn't just quoting someone, something that she heard  on the street, some hearsay. She was actually quoting Coretta Scott  King, a civil rights hero, the wife of the slain Martin Luther King,  who we, as Americans in our Nation--we don't have many of them-- literally recognize with a national holiday. So that makes it all the  more disturbing to me that Senator Warren would stand up, exercising  what is one of her specifically constitutional, mandated duties and was  stopped because of a rule being enforced that in my opinion, as well as  Leader Schumer's, is selectively enforced. But let's go further into  the fact that the contents of that letter, much of it shared, are  actually substantive and have bearing on the thoughts and feelings of  many people in the Senate.   I was raised by a family who made very clear to me something that I  think Elie Wiesel said: The opposite of love is not hate, it is  silence. It is a profound sin to witness injustice, to see something  wrong, and to simply be a bystander, to not speak up.   What I respect about many of my colleagues, even those with whom I  disagree--and what I respect about Senator Warren--is that they embody  a tradition that I was taught by my parents: to speak truth to power,  to speak truth even if your legs are shaking, even if your voice  quivers. Speak truth. Do not be a bystander. Do not sit in  indifference. Stand up and speak your truth. Do not let your soul be  silenced.   We are here as a country because at a time of rife moral injustice,  people didn't remain silent. This idea of speech in this country is so  important that it is enshrined in the Constitution that we should have  freedom of speech, and, yes, it is not always comfortable to hear.   I sat where the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Alaska, is  sitting, and  [[Page S874]]  there were many times I heard things that were uncomfortable, that I  disagreed with, that I thought were wrong, but this body should respect  the idea of free speech.   Tonight, I am proud of Senator Warren. She stood and told her truth.  To see this body act as it did tonight is disappointing to me, and it  is not a violation of the ideals of comity. It is not.   I heard great conversations from people I revere. Senator Hatch spoke  tonight. He is a great man. I don't agree with him all the time. I  think some of his ideas--I actually think sometimes they are dangerous  ideas, but I respect him. He and Teddy Kennedy--two men who argued with  each other, sometimes with voices raised in a lack of comity--had a  love for each other.   I was told by other senior Senators when I first arrived: Yeah, give  it all you have got in debates. Argue and fight, but understand that in  the end we are all people who love our country.   Nobody is questioning Jeff Sessions' love of country. Nobody here is  questioning his kindness and collegiality. I experienced that. I have  spent 3 years in the Senate. He is far senior to me, and there is no  time that we connected on the floor or in the Senate gym in which he  didn't show me kindness and respect. Let's put that aside.   He and I even stood together and passed a resolution here in this  body to give the Medal of Freedom to marchers across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge. One of those marchers was John Lewis.   Does that mean that if John Lewis believes strongly that to have Jeff  Sessions ascend to the most powerful law enforcement office in the  land, he should remain silent? Does that mean he should be quiet about  that? No. In fact, John Lewis testified in the hearings in the  Judiciary Committee against Jeff Sessions. Why? Because that is our  tradition.   So I start my remarks tonight, aggrieved by what I saw happen to  Elizabeth Warren. In fact, it stunned me. I didn't even believe it when  I heard that a U.S. Senator would be silenced by another U.S. Senator  from reading something that had been in the record for 30 years, as if  somehow we are afraid to hear that truth on that paper or in her heart.  God bless her for standing up and speaking up and refusing to be  silent, and then, in the tradition of the King family, taking the  consequences.   I want to state that what she did respects a difference that is worth  analyzing for a moment. We have colleagues here with whom we disagree.  We are part of the U.S. Senate. There is a lot of respect back and  forth. Again, the senior Senator from Utah is a giant in my eyes. The  eulogy he gave at Senator Teddy Kennedy's funeral was one of my  favorite U.S. Senate moments, even though it didn't happen on this  floor. But it did show that two men could fight and disagree and could  still have respect for each other; two men could raise their voices at  times and have passionate arguments about what they believed in. This  body was designed to bring people of diverse geographies--thank God,  eventually diverse racial backgrounds, diverse gender--all together to  represent our States and to have it out.   No one Senator has supreme power. This is not the Executive branch.  Both sides have to want things. We have to meet a 60-vote threshold on  some occasions. That is the type of power we have here.   When someone from here leaves this position and moves to the  executive branch and is heading an agency, they have tremendous power.  In fact, the Attorney General is one of the most powerful positions in  America and actually even in some sense is independent of the  Presidency. The idea of the Attorney General is that when the President  is wrong, the Attorney General has a role and lets the President know  that, taking the appropriate action.   So while Jeff Sessions is a valued colleague as a Senator, there is a  moral obligation that all of us have enshrined in the Constitution of  the advice and consent power to tell our truth because here our power  as individuals is made manifest by our ability to develop coalitions.  But in the executive branch, especially in the Attorney General's  position, that power is residing in the individual, that power is real,  that power has dramatic effects on the lives of everyday Americans. So  when that is happening, we cannot remain silent.   I am so proud that Senator Elizabeth Warren actually did not just  read a letter of Coretta Scott King; she honored that Martin Luther  King tradition. King said: ``Our lives begin to end the day we begin to  be silent about things that matter.'' King also wrote: ``There comes a  time when silence is betrayal.''   I can't betray my values or my ideals. This body is in many ways a  testimony to the ideals of freedom of speech in America, a body that is  exhibiting in many ways to this country why fervent debate is so  important in the marketplace of ideas.   To silence a voice, to silence a Senator--that is unconscionable  under the pretext that somehow she was impugning the character of  another Senator. That is unacceptable, especially in light of so many  things that have been said on the Senate floor that weren't checked,  weren't called out. But at a time when a Senator is standing strong for  what she believes and speaking her truth, there is what is tantamount  to a censure.   I came to this body on a very auspicious day. It was Halloween. I was  sworn in on Halloween, 2013. It was October, and my election was just  days earlier. Six days before I had been elected to the U.S. Senate, my  father died.   I confess, on that day I was feeling a sense of pride, standing right  over there with the Vice President. I was feeling pride, but I was also  hollow in my heart. I was hurting because I knew my dad would have  wanted to see me become a Senator. This guy who was born poor in a  segregated community in the South, in the mountains of North Carolina,  could never have imagined that one day his son would be sworn in as a  U.S. Senator.   My dad taught me lessons, as so many of our fathers did. I learned  about hard work. I learned about sacrifice. Jane Baldwin said it best:  Children are never good at listening to their elders, but they never  fail to imitate them. I thank God to this day that I had models to  emulate.    But if there is anything my father taught me, it is: Son, you didn't  get where you are on your own. That is interesting for me to hear from  a guy who, by every other measure, was a self-made man. To watch my dad  go at his craft, to watch him work and sacrifice on snow days in New  Jersey, when I was a grade school kid, the first sound I would hear  would be him shoveling the driveway because he was going to be the  first person at work, no matter what. Often I would come home from  school or go to my games and my dad wouldn't be there because he was  going to make sure to be the last one to leave the office, setting the  bar as a manager.   But here was a self-made man, looking at me every step of the way,  and letting me know: Son--sometimes it would be boy--you didn't get  here on your own. I would walk around my house, staring in the  refrigerator, and he would say: Boy, don't you dare walk around this  house like you hit a triple. You were born on third base.   Well, yes, I got it after years because my father said: Son, you are  where you are because of this Nation, not just the values and ideals. I  mean, come on, I want to tell the truth. This is a country that was  formed with a level of genius that I can't take away from, a level of  ascendant thought in the span of human history that is remarkable, and  my father respected that, but he knew that what makes this country real  was not just what our Founders did, it is what average Americans did to  make real the promise of this democracy. Even when challenges occurred  in this country, they didn't think they befell themselves, they somehow  fought to make this country more real.   As great as our Founders are and as great as our Constitution is,  let's look at those documents and be honest with each other. Native  Americans are referred to as savages in our Declaration of  Independence. Women aren't referred to at all. African Americans were  fractions of human beings. What was the spirit that took an imperfect  document and founding ideals and made them more perfect? What was that  spirit?   (Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.)   I want to read the words of Thurgood Marshall. He delivered them in  May of 1987. I was a high school student. It was  [[Page S875]]  on the vacation of the bicentennial of the Constitution itself. This is  what he said:         The year 1987 marks the 200th anniversary of the       Constitution. A commission has been established to coordinate       the celebration.    He goes on:         Like many anniversary celebrations, the plan for 1987 takes       particular events and holds them up as the source of all the       very best that followed.    He writes:         Patriotic feelings will swell, prompting proud       proclamations of the wisdom, foresight and sense of justice       shared by the Framers and reflected in a written document now       yellowed with age. This is unfortunate--not the patriotism       itself but the tendency for the celebration to oversimplify,       and overlook the many other events that have been       instrumental to our achievements as a nation. The focus of       this celebration invites a complacent belief that the vision       of those who debated and compromised in Philadelphia yielded       the ``more perfect Union'' that is said we now enjoy.    This is Thurgood Marshall:         I cannot accept this invitation, for I do not believe that       the meaning of the Constitution was forever fixed at the       Philadelphia Convention. Nor do I find the wisdom, foresight,       and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly       profound. To the contrary, the government they devised was       defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a       civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the       system of constitutional government, and its respect for the       individual freedoms and human rights, we hold as fundamental       today. When a contemporary American cites ``The       Constitution,'' they invoke a concept that is vastly       different from what the Framers barely began to construct two       centuries ago.        For a sense of the evolving nature of the Constitution we       need look no further than the first three words of the       document's preamble: ``We the People.'' When the Founding       Fathers used this phrase in 1787, they did not have in mind       the majority of America's citizens. ``We the People''       included, in the words of the Framers, ``the whole Number of       free Persons.''        On a matter so basic as the right to vote, for example,       Negro slaves were excluded, although they were counted for       representational purposes as three-fifths each. Women did not       gain the right to vote for over 130 years.    Thurgood Marshall writes:         These omissions were intentional. The record of the       Framers' debates on the slave question is especially clear:       The Southern States acceded to the demands of the New England       States for giving Congress broad power to regulate commerce,       in exchange for the right to continue the slave trade.        The economic interests of the regions coalesced; New       Englanders engaged in the ``carrying trade''--and it       continues.    Thurgood Marshall goes on:         Even these ringing main phrases from the Declaration of       Independence are filled with irony, for every draft of what       became the Declaration assailed the King of England for       suppressing legislative attempts to end the slave trade.        The final draft adopted in 1776 did not contain this       criticism. And so again at the Constitutional Convention,       eloquent objections to the institution of slavery went       unheeded.    Thurgood Marshall goes on to so eloquently discuss the evolutions it  took to come to where we are today. He writes that the men who gathered  in Philadelphia in 1787 could not have envisioned the changes that have  taken place that resulted in the world in which he was living here in  1987.   He writes:         I could not have imagined, nor would they have accepted,       that the document they were drafting would one day be       construed by the Supreme Court, to which had been appointed a       woman and the descendant of an African slave--    Thurgood Marshall himself--       that ``We the People'' no longer enslave, but the credit does       not belong to the Framers, it belongs to those who refused to       acquiesce an outdated notion of liberty, justice, and       equality, and who strived to make them better.    So when I swore my oath, days after my father died--after the man who  taught me that the liberties and the freedoms and the privileges and  the abundance that I enjoyed when I had the fortune of calling myself  an American--that those liberties, those freedoms, the justice, the  opportunity that I enjoy--yes, I may be a hard worker; yes, I may  sacrifice; yes, I may struggle; but all of this was made possible  because of the fights and the struggles and the courage of others. It  was made possible by people who did not sit on the sidelines of  history, who understood that democracy is not a spectator sport; that  even though it is not comfortable or convenient or easy, sometimes, in  the course of human events, for the cause of your country, you have to  stand up and fight.   So before I swore that oath, my mom--before I hit the Senate floor  and became a Member of this august body, she took me across the Capitol  to meet with another man because she wanted the last thing that I did  to be a humble recognition of upon whose shoulders I stood. The last  thing I did before I became a U.S. Senator was to meet with John Lewis.   Congressman Lewis, if you know him, you are shaken by his goodness  and his decency. You are shaken by his kindness. I don't want to  elevate him. He is not a perfect man, but this is a hero to me and to  so many Americans. He is someone who lives his values, doesn't just  preach them. And when I sat to have a meal with him--he had put a  spread together--he told me that when I was sworn in as the fourth  popularly elected African American in the history of this body, it was  a triumph for him, that it made him proud. Here I am standing before my  mom's classmate, my parents' generation, and he is elevating me and  telling me how important this day is to him.   What is fascinating to me was he didn't just speak those words. I  looked around his office and it was like a civil rights museum--people  who marched for me and you and others; people who went on freedom rides  for me and you and others; people who fought for voting rights for me  and you and others. All the while I am sitting there, and he will not  even let me get up. He is serving me food. That is his spirit.   What is incredible to me is it gives incredible testimony to this  truth that this Nation is great not because it was easy to get here,  not because it was destined to be so but because Americans all along in  our history did the challenging thing to try to move this democracy  forward.   So does John Lewis love Senator Sessions? Yes. John Lewis is an  embodiment of love. He is a man who has forgiven his attackers, who  literally has had people who beat him years later become people he  embraces. And even though we love each other and respect each other,  love is difficult and hard. It is a hard thing to do. Sometimes love  requires telling the truth. Love requires not being silent. Love isn't  politic, and sometimes love breaks traditions.   I chose to testify against a Senator, and I took criticism for it-- probably deservedly so--but I did so because when I testified, what  made it more evidently clear or highlighted my decision is that I was  sitting next to John Lewis. He never asked if it was convenient or  politic for him to freedom ride. He didn't ask if it was safe to march  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He didn't ask if it might make people  feel uncomfortable or be the subject of scorn. He was telling people to  go out and register to vote. He decided to do it because it was the  right thing to do.   I want to read from his testimony. On that day, I was privileged to  sit next to my hero in a judiciary hearing. This is what he wrote. This  is what he spoke:         Millions of Americans are encouraged by our country's       effort to create a more inclusive democracy the last 50       years, but what some of us call a beloved community, a       community at peace with itself. We are not a minority. A       clear majority of Americans said they want this to be a fair,       just, and open Nation. They are afraid that this country is       headed in the wrong direction. They are concerned that some       leaders reject decades of progress and want to return to the       dark past when the power of the law was used to deny the       freedoms protected by the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,       and the amendments. These are the voices I represent today.        We can pretend that the law is blind. We can pretend that       it is even handed. But if we are honest with ourselves, we       know that we are called upon daily by the people we represent       to help them deal with unfairness in how the law is written       and enforced.        Those who are committed to equal justice in our society       wonder whether Senator Sessions' call for law and order will       mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back       then. The rule of law was used to violate the human and civil       rights of the poor, the dispossessed, people of color. I was       born in rural Alabama, not very far from where Senator       Sessions was raised. There was no way to escape or deny the       choke hold of discrimination and racial hatred that       surrounded us. I saw the signs that said ``White Waiting,       Colored Waiting.'' I saw the signs that said, ``White Men,       Colored Men;'' ``White Women, Colored Women.'' I tasted the       bitter fruits, the bitter fruits of segregation and racial       discrimination. Segregation was the law of the land to order       our society  [[Page S876]]       in the Deep South. Any Black person who did not cross the       street when a White person was walking down the same       sidewalk, who did not move to the back of the bus, who drank       from a White water fountain, who looked at a White person       directly in their eyes, could be arrested and taken to jail.    The forces of law and order in Alabama were so strong that to take a  stand against its injustice we had to be willing to sacrifice our lives  for our cause. Often, the only way we could demonstrate that a law on  the books violated a higher law was by challenging that law, by putting  our bodies on the line and showing the world the unholy price we had to  pay for dignity and respect. It took massive, well-organized,  nonviolent dissent for the Voting Rights Act to become the law. It  required criticism of this great Nation and its great laws to move  toward a greater sense of equality in America. We had to sit in, we had  to stand in, we had to march. And that is why more than 50 years ago a  group of unarmed citizens, Black and White, gathered on March 7, 1965,  in an orderly, peaceful nonviolent fashion to walk from Selma to  Montgomery, AL, to dramatize to the Nation and to the world that we  wanted to register to vote, wanted to become participants in a  democratic process. We were beaten, tear-gassed, left bloodied, some of  us unconscious, some of us had concussions, some of us almost died on  that bridge.         But the Congress responded. President Lyndon Johnson       responded, and the Congress passed a Voting Rights Act, and       it was signed into law on August 6, 1965. We have come a       distance. We have made progress. But we are not there yet.       There are forces that want to take us back to another place.       We don't want to go back. We want to go forward. As the late       A. Philip Randolph, who was the dean of the March on       Washington of 1963, often said, ``maybe our forefathers and       our foremothers all came to this great land in different       ships, but we are all in the same boat now.''        It doesn't matter how Senator Sessions may smile, how       friendly he may be, how he may speak to you. But we need       someone who is going to stand up, speak up, and speak out for       the people that need help, for people that have been       discriminated against. And it doesn't matter whether they are       Black or White, Latino, Asian, Native American, whether they       are gay or straight, Muslim, Christian, or Jews. We all live       in the same house--the American house. We need someone as       Attorney General who is going to look out for all of us and       not just for some of us.    Now, he speaks:         I ran out of time. Thank you for giving me a chance to       testify.    John Lewis had 5 minutes before the Judiciary Committee--5 minutes to  enter words into one of the greatest historical records of all time-- the record of this body, the record of the Judiciary Committee. He  brushed on issues that aren't a passing fancy to him. He has lived for  these issues. He has fought for these issues. He has dedicated his life  to these issues. This man, this champion, chose not to be silent. He  had a window of opportunity.   That doesn't mean he doesn't love Jeff Sessions. I know he does. It  doesn't mean that he doesn't think he is kind and collegial when the  two meet. I have watched them. Senator Jeff Sessions and I were there  to present him with the Congressional Medal. But what it means is that  he has real concerns about the cause of our country, because this  Nation has made such dramatic strides towards freedom and justice. It  has made those strides because people like him, folks from all  different backgrounds didn't just pledge allegiance to the flag. They  didn't just say the words ``liberty and justice for all.'' They put  their lives on the line to make it happen.   I have seen this kind of patriotism made real in my lifetime by the  men and women who put the uniform on to serve us overseas, all the way  to men and women putting uniforms on to protect our neighborhoods, who  make rational choices every day to fight for our safety, our security,  for our liberty, and for our justice.   I stand here now to speak out against Jeff Sessions becoming the  highest law enforcement officer of the land, not because of any  personal feelings I have about him--because I too, like I was called to  do as a little boy in Sunday school, believe in the ideals of love thy  neighbor. It doesn't detract from that love to speak up, to speak my  heart, to speak my mind.   Senator Elizabeth Warren stood up speaking the words of Coretta Scott  King. It doesn't detract from the collegiality of this institution for  her to speak her mind, especially when those are issues that are at the  core of our Constitution.   Take voting rights. I don't have the authenticity to speak on voting  rights that someone like John Lewis has. But I have watched what is  happening in my country--all this talk coming from the highest office  in the land about voting fraud. The chances of encountering in-person  voting fraud in this Nation is about the chances of getting struck by  lightning. You might even have a better chance of going and playing the  lottery tonight and winning than in encountering voter fraud. But the  real issue is voter suppression.   Now, I am not just saying that as a partisan spouting. I am actually  referring to actual judicial inquiries of the Federal Government. In  the State of North Carolina, as soon as the Shelby decision came and  before the ink got dry, States like North Carolina, Texas, and others  started to change their voting laws. It is hard to do things in the  cover of night without the power to investigate what actually happened.  A Federal judge saw in North Carolina, and said that they were  discriminating against African Americans, that they had tailored this  law--I think the quote exactly is--with surgical precision to  discriminate against African-American voters. This is not fiction. This  isn't made up. These are the facts.   There are still people in this country in positions of power who are  seeking to pervert the law to discriminate against certain populations  and advantage themselves politically. It is not just cheaters. But it  is clearly discriminatory in this case on race.   Now, if we know that is going on, John Lewis, myself, millions of  Americans, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents believe that we  should investigate these things. But the problem is we now have someone  that is nominated to the very office, the Justice Department, who has  said that the activities around voting rights to investigate these  issues are intrusive. This is at a time when we still have issues with  voting where States are moving not to open up the access to voting, not  to make it easier, not to make it more free and fair. There are folks  who are trying to create laws that are choking it, and some of these  laws factually have been designed to disadvantage certain populations.   The highest law enforcement officer in the land has an obligation to  aggressively investigate these potential violations of law. But we have  listened to what the priorities are of Senator Sessions. It is not to  investigate what is real, what is substantive, what has happened and  likely will happen. It is to investigate the fiction created,  documented, that somehow millions of Americans woke up in the morning  and said: Do you know what I am going to try to do? I am going down to  a polling place and fake my way into voting. It is hard to get millions  of Americans to vote, period, sometimes, but somehow this fiction is  the highest priority when it comes to voting of this Attorney General.   I will not be silent on this issue. I am here and we are here because  people fought to stop violations of voting. We as Americans should have  confidence that the highest law enforcement officer in the land won't  criticize any efforts on voter suppression but will actually work to do  something about it.   Something else that was spoken about in John Lewis's testimony that  is a real issue in America and this has to do with the prevalence in  this country of ongoing hate crimes. Senator Sessions, as a Senator,  again in a body in which one Senator does not have the power to pass  legislation, failed to stand with the majority of Senators when it came  to issues of laws that were designed for dealing with bias-motivated  crimes that target specifically people's sexual orientation and gender  identity.   There was a specific law, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr.,  law. These are two Americans who were targeted because of their  respective sexual orientation and race. Senator Sessions' comments at  the time were that this law would ``cheapen the Civil Rights  Movement.''   You have in the testimony a civil rights hero talking about the  challenges facing the LGBT community, a civil rights hero who is joined  with me and others, decrying the fact that in this country right now  you may have  [[Page S877]]  the right to marriage equality, but still in most States in America if  you get married, you post it on your Facebook page, you go to work the  next day, your boss says you are fired because you got married to  someone of the same sex, and there is no legal recourse.   Senator Sessions on same-sex marriage even went as far as to say it  is not disputable that adopting a same-sex marriage culture undermines  and weakens marriage. I don't even know what to say about a same-sex  marriage culture. I would never question that love and that bond  between two Americans that now is the law of the land.   I don't know what it means to someone when they criticize a law that  is going to work against violence. Please understand, this violence is  not a rare thing like in-person voter fraud. We know that today still  too many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans feel unsafe  in their communities. A significant percentage of gay and lesbian  children report missing school because of fear.   The data from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs shows  that 20 to 24 percent--about one in five--of lesbian and gay people  experience hate crimes and that LGBT Americans of color are  particularly at risk. Often those hate crimes are utterly tragic.   In 1998, Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old student at the University  of Wyoming. He went to the bar that evening, like many 21-year-olds do.  Two men offered him a ride home, and he accepted. Instead of bringing  him home, they brought him out into a field. They taunted him with  epithets, hatred directed at him because he was gay, and then they beat  him savagely and left him for dead.   This is what one of our Nation's magazines, Vanity Fair, wrote:         A passing cyclist saw what he thought was a scarecrow       lashed to a wooden buck fence on a remote plot of land. The       scarecrow turned out to be Matthew, unconscious, a huge gash       in his head, his face drenched with blood except where his       tear trails had washed it clean. His shoes were missing.        After police questioning, Aaron McKinney confessed that he       and his friend Russell Henderson had met Matthew at the       Fireside Bar & Lounge on Tuesday night and posed as gay to       lure him into their truck. Then they drove him to an out-of-      the-way location, bound him to a fence, pistol-whipped him,       and taunted him while he begged for his life. Then they       banded the gentle five-foot-two, 105-pound freshman to hang       there for 18 hours, losing blood as the temperature dropped.    That same year, James Byrd, Jr., a 49-year-old African-American man,  was walking home from his parents' house in Texas when he was also  offered a ride home. They didn't bring him home either. They brought  him to the middle of the woods where he was beaten and then chained to  a pickup truck and dragged along the road for 2 miles. He had been  targeted by three White supremacists.   The Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division  at the Department of Justice Jocelyn Samuels wrote the following in  2013: But while the men responsible for the Shepard and Byrd killings  were later convicted of murder, none of them were prosecuted for  committing a hate crime. At the time these murders were committed,  neither Wyoming nor Texas had hate crime laws, and existing Federal  hate crime protections did not include violent acts based on the  victim's sexual orientation and only covered racial violence against  those engaged in a federally protected activity, such as voting or  attending school. Four years ago today, President Barack Obama signed  the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act. This  landmark legislation, championed by the late Senator Ted Kennedy,  greatly expanded the Federal Government's ability to prosecute hate  crimes. The law enables the Justice Department to prosecute crimes  motivated by race, color, religion, and national origin without having  to show that the defendant was engaged in a federally protected  activity. The Shepard-Byrd Act also empowers the department to  prosecute crimes committed because of a person's sexual orientation,  gender identity, gender or disability as hate crimes. The law also  marked the first time that the words ``lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender'' appeared in the U.S. Code. Under the leadership of  Attorney General Holder, the Criminal Section of Civil Rights Division  and U.S. attorney's offices around the country have used that law to  address the most serious hate crimes. Over the last 4 years, 44 people  in 16 States have been convicted under the Shepard-Byrd act for their  discrimination in crimes against others on the basis of race, religion,  national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.   This is what we expect from the Department of Justice. Hate crimes  against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender are tragically  common in this country. Discrimination, hate, and violence is not rare  in this community. It is real. It is a scourge. It must be stopped, and  the highest law enforcement officer in the land must follow the Federal  law, must see it as a priority, must see it as an urgency, must use  their prosecutorial discretion to put resources toward those  prosecutions.   So when Civil Rights leaders like John Lewis understand the truth  that the Civil Rights Movement wasn't about Black people, it was about  American people, it was about justice for all, it was about freedom  from violence for all, it was about equal rights for all, that he  cannot be silent when someone is discriminated against because of how  they pray or how they love.   None of us can be silent if we believe in those words: liberty and  justice for all. At a time where this is a real problem, we should  trust that the highest law enforcement officer would do something about  it, would vigorously and seriously defend and fight against the kind of  horrific crimes that are still being perpetrated in America. That is  not all.   We see that in his testimony. We see that Jeff Sessions spoke at  length about this idea of law and order. I respect that idea of law and  order, but the call of our country isn't law and order. We have seen  totalitarian States. We have seen dictatorships. We have seen all kinds  of countries that restrained freedoms and liberties, found the  repression and oppression. We found that law and order can be  established in many ways. This country was founded with a higher ideal  to pursue. It is what has called so many Americans forth in pursuit of  this high ideal.   It is not just law and order. It is the pursuit of justice. It is an  understanding that as King said, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to  justice everywhere.'' One of those fundamental principles of justice is  this idea of equal protection under the law.   The Attorney General has an obligation to pursue this idea of equal  justice. I used to be a mayor. In the city in which I still live, in  Newark, NJ, we were always looking to fight crime, and we knew lowering  crime didn't just have to do with police. Sometimes police are busily  working on the symptoms of the deeper problems, and we as a society  have to address them. That is why drug treatment is such a critical way  of delivering justice and fighting crime. That is why programs that  help people coming home from prison help to lower crime. That is why  mental health care is so important for fighting crime, but you cannot  take it away from any American.   The truth is there is so much of a need to celebrate our law  enforcement in this country. I have watched law enforcement officers do  acts of heroism and courage that shows they are worthy of the highest  celebrations, and so many Americans don't know this. They don't  understand that so many law enforcement officers every single day risk  danger, and our law enforcement officers should be lauded for these  great women and men who, every single day, are out in our communities  entering into difficult circumstances.    I still remember my police director--one time he was on the phone.  There was an awful hostage situation, and we were discussing how to  deal with it. Then over the phone I heard gun shots go off, and  suddenly in the background I heard officers yelling, ``Go, go, go,  go!'' These officers, hearing bullets firing, had no situational  awareness whatsoever and stormed into that building. Most of us hearing  gun fire would drop down; these men and women stood up. Most of us  hearing gun fire might run in the other direction; these men ran toward  that problem.   As the mayor of a city working directly with police officers, I could  give countless examples and great testimony as to the strength and  courage of  [[Page S878]]  officers. I commend Jeff Sessions for talking about how important our  police officers are, but understand that it does not diminish our  respect and our love and our admiration and our gratitude toward police  officers, toward law enforcement in this country to ask that we make  sure, through systems of accountability, that we are holding law  enforcement officers to the highest levels of professional conduct.  There is not an officer I know that has any problem with that.   This is what concerns me: We know in this country that we have  challenges with an equal application of the law. One recent study from  researchers at the University of Louisville and the University of South  Carolina documented that unarmed Black men were shot and killed in 2015  at disproportionately higher rates. We have seen other challenges with  poor communities and African-American communities having unjust usage  of the law directed toward them. We all know about Ferguson, MO, where  the city's law enforcement practices disproportionately impacted  African Americans. It was the Justice Department that investigated the  Ferguson Police Department and found that from 2012 to 2014, Blacks  accounted for 85 percent of vehicle stops, 90 percent of citations, and  93 percent of arrests. This is in spite of the fact that Blacks made up  only 67 percent of the total population. The information came to light  because of the Justice Department's investigation.   In Baltimore, the Department of Justice found that the Baltimore  Police Department targeted policing of certain Baltimore neighborhoods  with minimal oversight or accountability, disproportionately harming  Black residents; the Baltimore Police Department stops African-American  drivers at disproportionate rates. African Americans accounted for 82  percent of all vehicle stops compared to 60 percent of the driving age  population in the city and only 27 percent of the driving age  population in the greater metropolitan area. Racial disparities in the  Baltimore Police Department's arrests are more pronounced for highly  discretionary offenses. Blacks accounted for 91 percent of the people  charged solely with failure to obey or ``trustpass.'' Blacks were 89  percent of the 1,353 people charged for making a false statement to an  officer; 84 percent of the people were arrested for disorderly conduct.   These challenges with policing are complex. Even communities very  conscious of and sensitive to these issues struggle with the equal  application of justice. I don't just say this; I experienced it.   When I was mayor of Newark, we were making a very conscious effort to  improve, yet we still found difficulties. When the Department of  Justice came to our city, they were able to do data gathering that we  did not do. Perhaps we didn't have the resources, didn't understand the  urgency. But when the Department of Justice came in and pulled that  data, put a lot of resources into analyzing it, they found about 80  percent of the Newark Police Department stops and arrests involved  Blacks, while the population is 53.9 percent Black. Black residents of  Newark were at least 2.5 times more likely to be subjected to a  pedestrian stop.   The data that was pulled by the Department of Justice helped us to  step up our work with the ACLU and others and begin to address these  issues. The Department of Justice's investigations, accountability,  working with local law enforcement departments have helped make changes  in Newark and Ferguson and will help make change in Baltimore and all  around our country.   But Senator Sessions has aggressively criticized the use of these  kinds of consent decrees, this kind of intervention. This is a critical  tool that the Justice Department is now using to curtail patterns and  practices of discrimination within police departments. But Senator  Sessions calls them an end run around the democratic process.   During his confirmation hearings, Senator Sessions said: ``I think  there is a concern that good police officers and good departments can  be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have some  individuals within the department doing things wrong.'' That is  problematic to me because it is a failure to understand the larger  challenges we have with policing in America: This is not something; it  is just a few bad officers. And even that construction of this idea  that it is somehow bad officers versus good officers--when it comes to  implicit racial bias, and how it is impacting law enforcement in  America, sometimes people don't even feel comfortable with those terms,  ``implicit racial bias,'' as if it is somehow calling people racist,  which it is not. It is actually this idea that we, at the Federal  Government, the Justice Department, working with localities, can  actually help departments begin to address the reality in this country  that we have a justice system that does not have equal application of  law enforcement. This is a real problem in this country. And when I say  it is a real problem, again, this is not a partisan issue.   FBI Director James Comey, one of our highest law enforcement  officers, to my knowledge, is a Republican. This law enforcement  officer speaks with clarity about the urgency and the need to address  this issue within American policing. He says that, unfortunately, in  places like Ferguson and New York City and in some communities around  this Nation, there is a disconnect between police agencies and many  citizens, predominantly in communities of color. Serious debates are  taking place about how law enforcement personnel relate to the  communities they serve. This is Director Comey in a speech he gave:         Serious debates are taking place about how law enforcement       personnel relate to the communities they serve, about the       appropriate uses of force, and about real and perceived       biases, both within and outside of law enforcement. These are       important debates.        Every American should feel free to express an informed       opinion--to protest peacefully, to convey frustration and       even anger in a constructive way. That is what makes our       democracy great. Those conversations--as bumpy and as       uncomfortable as they can be--help us understand different       perspectives, and better serve our communities. Of course,       these are only conversations in the true sense of that word       if we are willing not only talk, but to listen, too.    Director Comey continues in his speech:         I worry that this incredibly important and incredibly       difficult conversation about race and policing has become       focused entirely on the nature and character of law       enforcement officers, when it should also be about something       much harder to discuss. Debating the nature of policing is       very important, but I worry that it has become an excuse, at       times, to avoid doing something harder.        Much research points to the widespread existence of       unconscious bias. Many people in our white-majority culture       have unconscious racial biases and react differently to a       white face than a black face.        We simply must find ways to see each other more clearly.       And part of that has to involve collecting and sharing better       information about encounters between police and citizens,       especially violent encounters.        The first step to understanding what is really going on in       our communities and in our country is to gather more data       related to those we arrest, those we confront for breaking       the law and jeopardizing public safety, and those who       confront us. ``Data'' seems a dry and boring word but,       without it, we cannot understand our world and make it       better.        How can we address concerns about ``use of force,'' how can       we address concerns about officer-involved shootings if we do       not have a reliable grasp on the demographics and       circumstances of these incidents? We simply must improve the       way we collect and analyze data to see the true nature of       what's happening in the all of our communities.        The FBI tracks and publishes the number of ``justifiable       homicides'' reported by police departments, but again,       reporting by police departments is voluntary and not all       departments participate. That means we cannot fully track the       number of incidents in which force is used by police, or       against police, including nonfatal encounters, which are not       reported at all.        Without complete and accurate data, we are left with       ``ideological thunderbolts.'' And that helps to spark unrest       and distrust, and does not help us to get better.        Because we must get better, I intend for the FBI to be a       leader in urging departments around this country to give us       the facts we need for an informed discussion, the facts all       of us need, to help us to make sound policy and sound       decisions with that information.    This is the FBI Director talking about the urgency of collecting data  and what the Justice Department has been doing for departments where  people are making a case for bias in policing. I know this because it  happened in Newark. The Justice Department comes in and collects data,  analyzes the data, and comes to objective conclusions that are not, as  Director Comey says, ``ideological thunderbolts.'' And what they seem  to be finding where they do these investigations is: Do you know what?  Yes, a lot of  [[Page S879]]  these communities have a right to be upset because the policing  practices do reflect bias, and there is not an equal application of the  law.   If we are to breathe understanding and cooperation--trust me, I know  this--to lead to even more effective policing, better police-community  relations, we need to get the data out there. But we now have someone  who is nominated to the highest law enforcement office in the land who  has criticized this kind of work during a time over the last few years  that we have seen cities erupting in protests. We have seen the call of  hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people trying to talk about  Black Lives Matter, at a time when people are questioning law  enforcement. What Director Comey and others are saying is: Let's get to  the bottom of this. Let's not talk from sentiments or feelings; let's  talk from experience and data.   So Senator Sessions' views on this are out of date. They run contrary  to where criminal justice reform is moving. They are in direct conflict  with the people whom his office obliges itself to serve.   Given what he has said on the record, we can have no confidence that  the issue of policing will be a priority if he is leading the Justice  Department. In fact, we actually, with some certainty, can be confident  that the Justice Department will not do this kind of aggressive data  collection to understand the facts--the kind of work the FBI Director  is calling for.   But it is not just the FBI Director. Listen to a letter from a group  of over 160 law enforcement officials that was sent to the Senate about  the need for comprehensive criminal justice reform. They write:         As current and former leaders of the law enforcement       community--police chiefs, U.S. Attorneys, federal law       enforcement, and heads of national law enforcement       organizations--we believe that protecting public safety is a       vital goal. Our experience has shown us that the country can       reduce crime while also reducing unnecessary arrests,       prosecutions, and incarceration. We believe the Sentencing       Reform and Corrections Act will accomplish this goal and       respectfully urge you to support it. We appreciate your       leadership on and concerns for the important criminal justice       issues facing the country today.        Our group, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and       Incarceration, unites more than 160 current and former police       chiefs, district attorneys, U.S. Attorneys, and attorneys       general from all 50 states. Our mission is to replace       ineffective police policies with new solutions that both       reduce crime and incarceration. To achieve this goal, we       focus on four policy priorities--one of which is reforming       mandatory minimum sentences.    Let me pause there for a second. The wisdom in law enforcement now  understands that you have to build faith and legitimacy in a  department, and you do that through police-community relations. Law  enforcement officers know that data collection is important.   When I was mayor of Newark, we made CompStat stronger and better-- analysis of crime patterns and data. We use it to more effectively  fight crime. But at a time of heightened suspicion and concern, at a  time when leaders are talking about the reality of implicit racial  bias, the highest law enforcement officer in the land should respect  the truth and direction of criminal justice reform. But it is not just  in policing; it is also in how we are looking at overall criminal  justice reform.   In the United States of America, we have seen now that our criminal  justice system since about 1980 on the Federal level has grown close to  800 percent, costing us as taxpayers billions and billions of dollars  to lock up nonviolent offenders. We are disproportionate with the rest  of planet Earth. We only have 4 to 5 percent of planet Earth's  population, but one out of every four imprisoned people on the planet  Earth is right here in the United States of America.   Do not tell me that when it comes to human beings on the planet  Earth, Americans have a greater proclivity for criminality. That is  just not true. Yet our so-called War on Drugs took us from being on par  with the rest of planet Earth and suddenly shot us up with an 800- percent increase on the Federal level--500 percent overall in our  Nation in throwing people in jail. This is disproportionately  overwhelmingly nonviolent people.   This drug war, incontrovertibly, has been persecuted on the poor.  Drug laws are not equally enforced in this country, leading one great  legal mind in our country, Bryan Stevenson, to say: We have a nation  that seems to sometimes treat you better if you are rich and guilty  than poor and innocent.   Well, let me tell you, in America, if you just use the lens of race,  there is no difference between Blacks and Whites for using drugs or  dealing drugs--none whatsoever. But if you are African American, you  are about 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for those nonviolent  drug crimes. But the truth is, if you use just race, socioeconomic  status, you look at these issues, you see the poorest Americans  disproportionately filling our jails and prisons. But what is worse  than that, disproportionately you see addicted Americans not getting  treatment, getting jail time; mentally ill people not getting health  care, getting jail time.   All of this is running up the bill to a point in American history--at  around the time I went to law school to the time I became mayor of  Newark, we were building a new prison--about one every 12 days. The  rest of the world was building better bridges, faster trains, better  infrastructure than us. Our infrastructure has been crumbling, but,  hey, as we are battling it out for infrastructure bills in this body-- or hopefully will be--the reality is that we have been building out  infrastructure like crazy, putting the rest of the Earth to shame when  it comes to building one type of infrastructure: prisons-- overwhelmingly, disproportionately warehousing poor people, addicted  people, mentally ill people, and people of color.   What is beautiful about this issue amidst all of the negativity that  I am expressing is that there is a bipartisan coalition of Americans  that range from Grover Norquist, to Newt Gingrich, the Koch brothers,  Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute--these are all  folks on the right--who believe we need to reform our criminal justice  laws, joining with people like me who are Democrats and Independents,  Christian Evangelicals who know what the Bible says about people in  prison. All of these coalitions, from libertarians, to Christian  Evangelicals, even some vegetarians--we all are coming to a national  consensus on criminal justice reform.   In this body, you have Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin partnering with  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley; Mike Lee; the  Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn--all came together to put together a  bill that was talked about by these law enforcement officers, a bill  that would help us to bring justice to our criminal justice system, a  bill that would help us reduce the level of incarceration but empower  people to be more successful.    What is astonishing about this is this was not a bill showing  leadership; it was showing followership because similar bills are being  passed in States all across our country, from Georgia to Texas. Guess  what they are finding out. When they lower their prison populations,  they lower crime as well.   These mandatory minimums in our country have perverted our criminal  justice system. In fact, most people still think that criminal justice  is about courts and judges and juries, but that is not the case. Since  we have seen this War on Drugs, this race to put more and more  mandatory minimums, what has actually happened is, now most criminal  convictions happen through plea bargain--about 98 percent are done  through plea bargain--not trials any more.   There was a great book about why innocent people plead guilty. That  is because you suddenly have a nonviolent drug offense for doing things  that past Presidents have admitted to doing, but you have a mandatory  minimum charge thrown at you that you either plead guilty to or we are  going to take you in for 5 years or more.   Well, our law tried to do the obvious: Lower these mandator minimums.  Stop wasting taxpayer money by putting nonviolent criminals in jail for  extraordinarily long times.   I was just at a Federal prison in New Jersey. I had the warden  walking with me, telling me: There are people in here way too long.  They are not a danger, but we are paying tens of thousands of dollars a  year to lock them up. Meanwhile, our kids can't get money for public  schools. We can't get money for fixing our roads.  [[Page S880]]    So this bipartisan coalition came together and put together  legislation that reflects what is happening in the States. That would  have brought more justice to our criminal justice system, but it was  fought against and criticized by Jeff Sessions.   But even beyond that, the Justice Department, acting on its own, has  been lowering mandatory minimums, has been giving instructions to  prosecutors on nonviolent drug offenses not to use mandatory minimums.   So with all of this, from policing, to sentencing, to rehabilitation,  to access to drug treatment, all of this reform that is going on--not  in a partisan way at all--one of the few people standing against this  bipartisan work, not just criticizing the legislation but criticizing  the Justice Department for their work, has been Jeff Sessions.   Why is this an issue that, just like voting rights, LGBT, freedom  from fear, freedom from violence, women's rights--why is this issue  important? Why is it an issue that should be seen as so fundamental to  our country? What we are seeing is the issue of mass incarceration  affect our Nation in ways that most people don't fully understand.   It affects voting rights. One in five Black folks in Florida has lost  their right to vote because of felony disenfranchisement overwhelmingly  involving drug crimes, often doing things that people in Washington, in  elected offices, have admitted to doing. That affects voting rights.   It affects poverty. One study came out that said we would have about  20 percent less poverty in America if we had incarceration rates that  were similar to other nations. Why would we have 20 percent less  poverty if we didn't have one-fifth of the global prison population?  Well, because when you make that mistake for doing something that  George Bush or Barack Obama admitted to doing, when you create that  felony crime, what happens is you come out of prison and you can't get  a Pell grant. You come out of prison and you can't get a job. You come  out of prison and you can't get food stamps. You have door after door  closed to you.   So these issues, taken together, are more than just about  incarceration. It is about public safety. It is about empowering  communities. It is about equal justice under the law.   The most powerful law enforcement office in the land sets priorities  and has to drive forward the ideals of our country.   We are a nation that is great not just because, as I said earlier in  my remarks, of our founding document, which, as Thurgood Marshall  wrote, took a civil war and amendments, took an expansive vision of who  is included in the ideal of ``we the people,'' but it is the spirit of  America that has pushed forward, where people in positions of power as  well as grassroots folks embody that great American spirit.   I want to read from one of our great Americans, a man named Learned  Hand. Judge Learned Hand wrote a speech called the ``Spirit of  Liberty.'' He hand-delivered the speech during World War II to 1.5  million people. It was a time when a whole bunch of naturalized  citizens were there. He spoke to first-generation Americans and folks  who could have traced their lineage far, far back.    He writes:         We have gathered here to affirm a faith, a faith in a       common purpose, a common conviction, a common devotion.        Some of us have chosen America as the land of our adoption;       the rest have come from those who did the same. For this       reason, we have some right to consider ourselves a picked       group, a group of those who had the courage to break from the       past and brave the dangers and the loneliness of a strange       land. What was the object that nerved us, or those who went       before us, to this choice? We sought liberty--freedom from       oppression, freedom from want, freedom to be ourselves. This       then we sought; this we now believe that we are by way of       winning.        What do we mean when we say that first of all we seek       liberty?        I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much       upon constitutions, upon laws, upon the courts. These are       false hopes; believe me, these are false hopes.        Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies       there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no       constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it.        While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no       court to save it.        And what is this liberty which must lie in the hearts of       men and women? It is not the ruthless, the unbridled will; it       is not freedom to do as one likes. That is the denial of       liberty, and leads straight to its overthrow. A society in       which men recognize no check upon their freedom soon becomes       a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage       few, as we have learned to our sorrow.        What then is the spirit of liberty?        I cannot define it; I can only tell you my own faith. The       spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it       is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to       understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of       liberty is the spirit which weighs their interest alongside       its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that       not even a sparrow falls to Earth unheeded; the spirit of       liberty is the spirit of him who, near two thousand years       ago, taught mankind that lessons it has never learned, but       has never quite forgotten--that there may be a kingdom where       the least shall be heard and considered side-by-side with the       greatest.        And now in that spirit, that spirit of an American which       has never been, and which may never be--nay, which never will       be except as the conscience and courage of Americans create       it--yet in the spirit of America which lies hidden in some       form in the aspirations of us all; in the spirit of that       America for which our young men are this moment fighting and       dying; in that spirit of liberty and of America so       prosperous, and safe, and contented, we shall have failed to       grasp its meaning, and shall have been truant to its promise,       except as we strive to make it a signal, a beacon, a standard       to which the best hopes of mankind will ever turn; in       confidence that you share that belief, I now ask you to raise       your hands and repeat with me this pledge:        I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of       America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation       under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.    It is this spirit that, to me, must be emboldened in our country. We  still have work to do. We still have challenges. We still have  unfinished business. We have a position of Attorney General because  there is still injustice. It is not just the fact that we still have  crime in communities, still have people who live in fear of violence.  That is a reality. But there are also people who live in fear of hatred  and in fear of discrimination. There are people who often don't have  people at the local level to go to, and only the Federal Government can  play that role of strident actor for justice.   There are still people who, for all these years, have their basic  American freedoms--like their right to vote--being undermined, where  people in power are trying to craft ways to discourage, to stop them  from exercising that franchise. We still have a nation in which people  are striving for justice.   I am proud of the voices we have heard tonight. I am proud of my  colleague Elizabeth Warren, who felt the need to stand up and speak her  truth. I am proud of heroes like John Lewis who testified and told his  truth.   I realize that the hour is late, but the Senator from Hawaii is now  here.   I oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions and will vote no on the  floor, and I hope my colleagues will join me in doing so as well.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
