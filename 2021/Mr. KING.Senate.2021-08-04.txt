 Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend from  Mississippi, I don't consider this a friendly amendment. I consider  this a major departure from the agreed-upon structure of this broadband  section of the bill that we are talking about.   This, as we all know, was a heavily negotiated bill. There are  provisions in it that I don't like. There are provisions in it that I  wish were there that aren't there because of the negotiation.   This provision, which appears innocent, to reinsert the  Administrative Procedure Act into this process would bureaucratize the  process, slow it down, and would not assist in the process.   Here are some points that I think need to be made:   The first is I consider the broadband section one of the crown jewels  of this entire bill. And the fact that it is structured in such a way  that the grants will go to the States and the States will decide how  best to administer those programs because of their knowledge of their  needs in their States--yes, they are going to use maps--updated maps, I  should say--from the FCC, but this is, really, a State-driven process.   The Administrative Procedure Act is principally a regulatory process,  and we are not talking about a regulatory process here. We are not  talking about the issuance of a lot of long and detailed regulations.  We are talking about a grant program to States, and so the burdensome  administrative requirements of the APA are really not necessary in this  case because it is not a regulatory process.   There is already significant oversight built into the statute. There  are 68 pages that have all kinds of requirements for public notice,  filing online, public disclosure, comment, and involvement of  communities of other providers, of all of those interested parties in  this process. So it is not like it is some kind of closed process.   There is no doubt that this will slow down the process. There is no  doubt that this would restrict the ability of the NTIA to tailor  programs to fit individual States.   As I said, that is one of the beauties of this whole provision, is  that it has the flexibility to meet the needs of States as they define  them. It would hamper that State flexibility, and it would make it more  difficult for the States to follow through on a timely basis to make  this tremendously important.   Where the Senator and I agree--and I know how hard he has worked on  this, as have I. This is, I think, one of the most important things  that we can do in this bill, to get Americans connected. I don't need  to make that argument. Everyone in the Chamber knows that.   The other piece, unfortunately, that this amendment would do would be  enable and, in fact, invite lawsuits. There would, undoubtedly, be  challenges to the regulations, challenges to the--if indeed the APA  said you have got to do this by regulation, you are building a whole  new bureaucratic process, and the bill already provides for the kinds  of protections that the Senator is talking about.   So I think this is an unnecessary amendment. I certainly, as one of  those  [[Page S5803]]  who worked on the negotiation of the bill, don't consider it a friendly  amendment, and I believe that it is a major change in the agreement  that would not have been agreed to in the negotiation; and I hope my  colleagues across the aisle who have supported this agreement will  oppose this amendment because it is not something that was in the  negotiation and it would not have been accepted by those who were  negotiating it on this side of the aisle.   So with that, I strongly oppose this amendment. It is a--I don't  think I can say it. It makes this a bureaucratic process that is  unnecessary, will only slow and impede the distribution of these  desperately needed funds to connect the people of America.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2146
