 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  October 2021 as Hindu Heritage Month.   Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. With 3 million  devotees in the United States, Georgia's First Congressional District  is home to many Hindu followers. The Hindu heritage, culture, and  traditions serve as a source of inspiration for the individuals who  look to the teachings of Hinduism for guidance.   The Hindu-American community has contributed tremendously to our  community, enriching the lives of our citizens. As doctors, lawyers,  artists, business leaders, and government officials, the Hindu  community has contributed immensely to the State of Georgia and our  great Nation. This month the Hindu community will celebrate their  heritage by focusing on their culture and the traditions rooted in  India.   Madam Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to join me in recognizing  October as Hindu Heritage Month 2021.   To those celebrating, I wish all a joyous celebration of Hindu  Heritage Month 2021.                            ____________________
