 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 14, after line 9, insert the following:       SEC. 11. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.         Section 511(j) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       711(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Allocation of funds.--To the extent that the grant       amount awarded under this section to an eligible entity is       determined on the basis of relative population or poverty       considerations, the Secretary shall make the determination       using the most accurate Federal data available for the       eligible entity.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my  bipartisan amendment, which is cosponsored by Congresswoman Jenniffer  Gonzalez-Colon from Puerto Rico and Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez from  New York.   The American citizens in Puerto Rico and the neighboring U.S. Virgin  Islands are enduring an incredibly difficult situation in the aftermath  of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria.   As a Member whose central Florida district is home to over 100,000  individuals of Puerto Rican heritage, I join my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle who have made crystal clear to our brothers and  sisters in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that they will  receive all the Federal support they need to stabilize the situation in  the short term, to rebuild in the medium term, and to emerge stronger  in the long term.   We are part of one American family. And like any close-knit family,  we always have each other's backs, especially when times are tough.   My amendment will ensure that Puerto Rico and the other U.S.  territories are treated equally under the Maternal, Infant, and Early  Childhood Home Visiting Program, which the underlying bill  reauthorizes. The amendment will implement a recommendation made by the  bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in  Puerto Rico.   This Federal program provides annual grants to States and territories  to fund home visiting services for families with young children. Visits  are conducted by social workers and other professionals. They provide  parenting education and other support services with a goal of helping  at-risk families succeed. It is a great program that invests in  children and families, helps lift them out of poverty, and increases  the chance that they will become productive and successful members of  society.   In theory, the program treats States and territories equally when it  comes to the distribution of grant funding. In practice, however,  Puerto Rico is treated unfairly. The Department of Health and Human  Services makes allocations based, in part, on a U.S. Census Bureau data  product on childhood poverty, but that data does not include  information on Puerto Rico or the other territories. Therefore, Puerto  Rico always receives the minimum grant allowed by the law, even though  the island of 3.4 million has a high rate of childhood poverty.   My amendment would simply require HHS, when making grants, to use the  best Federal data available for every State and territory and to use an  appropriate alternative data source, if necessary, in the case of  Puerto Rico. This will ensure that Puerto Rico receives its fair share  of funding and not one penny more and not one penny less.   I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and that we will  continue to do everything possible to help our fellow citizens in  Puerto Rico.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would simply  reiterate my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
