 Madam President, on the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I wish  to honor a member of our Greatest Generation, Stanley P. ``Lucky''  Lawruk, Sr., of Wilmington, DE. Stanley P. Lawruk, a lifelong  Delawarean, served in the U.S. Army Air Corps at the Battle of Normandy  and throughout World War II.   On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 20-year-old Technical Sergeant Stanley Lawruk  was on his fourth combat mission as  [[Page S3650]]  both the flight engineer and top turret gunner on a Boeing B-17G Flying  Fortress. Sergeant Lawruk and his fellow crewmen were part of the 327th  Bombardment Squadron, 92nd Bomb Group, known as Fame's Favored Few.   His squadron's mission on D-Day was to target and destroy the  marshalling yards and industrial center at Thury-Harcourt in Normandy,  France. As the dorsal turret gunner, Sergeant Lawruk manned twin 50- caliber machineguns located just above the cockpit of his bomber.   ``I saw all the ships go across the channel,'' Stan said in a 2014  interview. ``They were so thick, you could almost walk across the  channel [on them]. And you could see the troops.'' Sergeant Stan Lawruk  survived D-Day and the many follow-on missions of the Normandy  campaign. After more than 20 combat flights, Lucky Lawruk had earned  his nickname.   On his 26th mission, Stan Lawruk's luck ran out. On August 25, 1944,  Stan's B-17 was on a bombing mission to destroy a V-2 rocket  experimental station located along the coast of Peenemunde, Germany.  There, his Flying Fortress fell victim to anti-aircraft batteries  below.   ``A direct hit blew off the propeller on our number four engine. That  in turn tore a large hole in our right wing,'' Stan said in a 1945  newspaper interview. ``Another hit put our number three engine on fire  and set another windmilling. We lost altitude rapidly.''   Stan and his fellow wingmen were instructed to bail out over Germany;  however, they decided to stick with the plane if possible. ``Over the  Baltic we started to toss out everything we could move or pry loose,''  Stan said in 1945, stating that he even tried to drop the ball turret.  ``I didn't have a chance to finish the job before I jumped to my crash  position. We came down in a slight crash near a fishing village. None  of the crew was hurt.''   A declassified document, Missing Air Crew Report 8275, recently found  in the National Archives, verifies that all nine crew members survived  the force of the crash landing near Sovde, Sweden. Weather conditions  and visibility were described as ``cloudy smooth.'' The bomber,  numbered 43-37596, was last sighted at ``1322 hours'' that day.   Stan and his crew were rescued by Swedish troops and Red Cross  workers; however, the American airmen would remain in neutral Sweden  for 6 months. The bomber crew were considered prisoners of war until  repatriated back to England. Stan, who originally enlisted in January  1943, remained in the U.S. Army Air Corps until he was honorably  discharged at New Castle Army Airfield in October 1945.   After World War II, Stan did what many GIs did upon returning home.  He picked up where he left off before the war. Stan went back to his  grocery job at the American Store, now known as ACME, located at  Chestnut and Franklin Streets in Wilmington.   Shortly thereafter, Stan Lawruk married Pearl DeLucia in November  1946. Together Stan and Pearl raised three children: Kathy, Stan, and  Tim. Stan eventually landed a delivery job with the Tasty Baking  Company, the maker of Tastykake treats. He worked there for 35 years  until retirement. Topping that record was the nearly 69 years of  marriage shared by Stan and Pearl Lawruk. His beloved wife passed away  in 2015.   Stan, who just celebrated his 95th birthday, is still well known in  our community and in our State. He recently moved to Wilmington VA  Medical Center's Community Living Center, where he quickly became a  favorite among the residents, staff, and veterans.   Stan still loves Tastykake treats and is widely known to be a bit of  a card sharp who enjoys a game of Blackjack. Besides his interest in  playing cards, he recently discovered his talent as an artist. In the  last year alone, Stan has painted more than a dozen works of art. Folk  who know Stan know him to be a loving, caring, social, and extremely  positive person.   In summary, Stanley ``Lucky'' Lawruk is truly part of our Greatest  Generation. I offer him my thanks for his sacrifices for family, for  State, for country, and for humanity.   Stan, on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for your dedicated  service.                            ____________________
