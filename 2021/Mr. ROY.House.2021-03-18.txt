 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me  time.   Mr. Speaker, a couple of nights ago, I was in Laredo, Texas, doing an  interview while overlooking the Rio Grande. My interview was  interrupted by a stream of human smugglers and people shouting ``run  for the ladders, run for the fences'' coming from the water. Then, some  went back across the river.   I went over to a facility where children are being housed right now.  They are the people being smuggled by cartels for profit. That is  happening right now today. While we sit in here and debate this bill,  it is happening right now.   A child is being abused right now by cartels. And this body, the  ``people's House,'' is doing nothing--nothing--to address cartels that  have ownership of our borders right now.   We are not doing our job. A secure border is pro-immigrant. Instead,  what we are doing today is we are going to pass legislation that is a  magnet for more trafficking of children. We are going to pass  legislation today that empowers cartels. We are going to pass  legislation today that is a Band-Aid on a broken system because this  body refuses to do its constitutional duty to secure the borders of the  United States. That is what we are going to do today.   Meanwhile, nothing is going to improve the life of the little girl  sitting in Nuevo Laredo right now being abused under the hands of CDN  for the $3,000 or $7,000 to move that little girl across the river  while Border Patrol doesn't have the resources to secure the border.   I was down on the river with the guy who is on a 3-mile stretch of  the border--one guy--and he can do nothing about that flow while  narcotics and fentanyl come across our border.   So, pat ourselves on the back today, Mr. Speaker, for a bill that is  going to get passed and headline speeches given about how all this is  so great for immigrants. Meanwhile, immigrants today are getting raped,  abused, beaten, sold into indentured slavery, and put into human sex  trafficking because we refuse to secure the border of the United  States. And we will never get a chance to offer an amendment on the  floor of this body to do anything about it.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I hear a lot from my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle that this is not how people should be treated, whether it was  with respect to the first broader amnesty bill, with respect to the  Dreamers, or whether it is this bill with respect to farmworkers, which  is, in fact, an amnesty bill. But the fact of the matter is that nobody  on this side of the aisle and nobody I know in Texas disagrees that the  system is broken and that we need to make sure that people are treated  fairly and treated appropriately. Nobody disagrees with that.   The problem is that what we are doing is putting this bill in front  of any kind of enforcement mechanisms that will prevent the continued  abuse of human beings because we refuse to do our actual job under the  Constitution of the United States to secure our border.   We are just refusing to do it, and then we pass legislation in the  name of helping people who, yes, are stuck in a system because we  created this system because it is so badly broken. You then create the  magnet, Madam Speaker, that empowers cartels and continues the vicious  cycle.    Today, when this passes off the floor, there will be a lot of  backslapping and congratulations: Isn't this great, isn't this awesome,  and aren't we so proud of ourselves for what we are doing for these  immigrants, these workers?   But we are not doing a darn thing to actually fix the system that  prevents the flow, prevents the danger, prevents the cartels, prevents  the abuses, and  [[Page H1552]]  prevents essentially the indentured servitude that this bill would  actually create for the farmworkers in question, leaving them stuck  with Band-Aids of having to work certain hours as farmworkers,  continuing the process, by the way, while we continue to encourage sex  trafficking, human trafficking, crimes, violations, and children being  abused.   As I said before, as we sit here in this august body--not actually  amending, by the way, just bloviating--while we are sitting here, some  little girl is getting raped in Mexico on a journey because of the  pressure that we are causing by empowering cartels to do it. That is  occurring, and we are just whistling, and we are just sitting here,  burying our head in the sand.   Like I said, go give the press conferences and go pat ourselves on  the back as a body for being pro-immigrant. How is it pro-immigrant to  have wide-open borders being exploited by cartels, wide-open borders  with narcotics coming across, and wide-open borders with human beings  coming across it?   By the way, when the media says this Biden crisis has ended, if they  ever acknowledge it exists, it will be because numbers are going down  in facilities because catching and releasing is going up. That is what  is going to occur.    Madam Speaker, that is what is going to occur. My fellow  citizens back home in Texas and Americans, when those numbers go down  in facilities, don't kid yourselves; illegal immigration will continue.   They will be catching and releasing illegal immigrants. They will be  dropping numbers down at facilities. They will close the FEMA facility  in Midland. We will have as much illegal immigration as we have right  now, and the other side will claim: Oh, the crisis is going down.   That is what is coming at us. And today, we are passing amnesty  instead of securing the border of the United States.                                time  1445
