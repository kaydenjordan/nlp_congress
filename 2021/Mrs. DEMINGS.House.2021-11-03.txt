 Mr. Speaker, during his inaugural address in 1960,  President Kennedy said these words: ``Let every nation know . . . that  we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any  friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of  liberty.''   We know what freedom means in America. It is the lifeline of our  Nation. The people of Cuba have cried out for freedom, and because of  who we are, America must answer the call.   The failed socialist regime in Cuba has delivered tyranny instead of  freedom, poverty instead of prosperity, and violence to silence its own  people instead of protection and safety. We denounce that regime and we  stand with the people because we stand for freedom.   One protester said this: ``It's only human to feel fear but that  moved to the background because you knew you were doing the right  thing.''   I say to America, this statement should be familiar to all of us. We  will not stay neutral for neutrality helps the oppressor, never the  oppressed. Democracy and a free economy are the right path forward for  Cuba.   We stand today and we support this resolution so that every Cuban,  like every American and every Floridian, will know that they have a  God-given right to safety, liberty, and the right to freely choose  their own future. Together we stand.
