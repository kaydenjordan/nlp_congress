 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, but,  more importantly, for moving this bill through committee and allowing  it to be brought up for a vote today on the floor.   I rise today as the lead sponsor of H.R. 2991, the Susquehanna  National Heritage Area Act. I am glad the House is taking up this  important bill with bipartisan support from the Pennsylvania  delegation.   The concept of the bill is simple. It would make two counties in  Pennsylvania, Lancaster and York Counties, both located in south  central Pennsylvania, a national heritage area.   National heritage areas are a congressional designation where  ``natural, cultural, historic, and recreational resources form a  cohesive, nationally distinctive landscape arising from human activity  shaped by geography,'' which describes this area very well. According  to the National Park Service, there are currently 49 national heritage  areas in 32 States.   I am very proud of the natural beauty that we find in our  Pennsylvania communities, particularly in these two counties. We want  to ensure we maintain that safe and clean environment into the future  for residents and visitors.   The Susquehanna River and its surrounding landscape have played a  starring role in American history. Our region's heritage reflects  events and causes that exemplify the American experience, many flowing  from the central historical role of the river.   Along the Susquehanna, a tradition of public and private  collaboration has  [[Page H4752]]  helped our region prosper from heritage and outdoor tourism, and this  national heritage area designation will attract more visitors,  stimulate our local economy, and preserve natural resources and  historical landmarks.   I want to thank the countless local officials and Members of Congress  who have worked on this legislation for many years. Without their  tireless work and the sustained input and support from the residents of  York and Lancaster Counties, we would not be here right now. This was a  bottom-up effort led by grassroots support from these communities.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of the dozens of local  organizations that support this legislation.         The following local organizations support the Susquehanna       National Heritage Area Act:        Amishview Inn & Suites/Miller's Smorgasbord/Plain & Fancy       Farm; Borough of Columbia; Bube's Brewery; Colony Packaging &       Machine; Downtown Inc.; Discover Lancaster; Farm & Natural       Lands Trust of York County; Historic Preservation Trust of       Lancaster County; Historic York, Inc.; Lancaster Chamber of       Commerce & Industry; Lancaster County Board of Commissioners;       Lancaster County Conservancy; Lancaster County Parks &       Recreation; Lancaster County Planning Commission; Lancaster       Farmland Trust; Landis Valley Museum.
