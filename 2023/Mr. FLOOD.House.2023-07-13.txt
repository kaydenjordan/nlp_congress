 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bryan Health on  being named one of America's most trustworthy companies by Newsweek.   Bryan Health is a pillar of Nebraska healthcare, notably serving  Lincoln and many communities around the State with locations in 45 of  our State's 93 counties. Bryan cares for over 2,100 trauma patients a  year.   Their work is helping grow Nebraska by ushering in the next  generation. The Bryan Family Birthplace delivered more than 3,000  babies in 2022, including 58 sets of twins and three sets of triplets.   Now they are plowing new territory in behavioral healthcare. They  report they are the first medical center in the Nation to have a  designated behavioral health emergency department.   Bryan Health isn't just a business. They are a key community  stakeholder, giving back more than $200 million of charity care last  year.   On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I  extend our sincere congratulations to the team at Bryan Health. I thank  them, and they should keep up the great work.                         Columbus Community Building     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the City of  Columbus on their new community building.   The Columbus Community Building is a $32 million project that will  provide 75,000 square feet of space for housing a new Columbus Public  Library, City Hall, City Council chamber, and community room.   This project, which took about 3 years, required over 150,000 hours  of labor and 1 million pounds of steel.   Columbus is known as the city of power and progress, and their work  over the last decade and a half is helping grow the community and  setting it up for long-term success.   From their health department to the Columbus Wellness Center to their  STEM program, the community is building the infrastructure they need to  attract families and the workforce that employers rely on.   Since 2000, the community has grown about 15 percent as companies  like BD Medical have invested millions to upgrade their operations.   Columbus, indeed, has a bright future ahead. On behalf of the people  of the First Congressional District, I congratulate the City of  Columbus, Nebraska, on their new community building and all their  recent success.                   Recognizing Colonels Thompson and Howard     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincere gratitude  to Colonel Kristen D. Thompson for her service as Commander of the 55th  Wing headquartered at Offutt Air Force Base.   Colonel Thompson recently completed her time as commander. During  that time, the 55th Wing returned flight operations to Offutt after the  base's runway was rebuilt.   I thank Colonel Thompson for her work and leadership through the  years.   As Colonel Thompson transitions to New York, I also give a hearty  congratulations and welcome to Colonel Mark Howard, who is now taking  over.   Colonel Howard comes to the 55th Wing as a 22-year veteran pilot with  almost 4,000 flying hours, 700 of those in combat.   Colonel Howard also brings years of experience as the 55th Wing's  deputy commander, which will serve him well as he takes on his new  role.   On behalf of the First Congressional District, I extend our sincere  gratitude to both Colonel Thompson and Colonel Howard for their  leadership of the 55th Wing.                             Supporting the NDAA     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of the  National Defense Authorization Act. The NDAA is a pillar of the House  Republicans' commitment to America in building a Nation that is safe.   Our U.S. servicemembers protect our country every day, and they  deserve the best quality of life. This NDAA provides a much-needed pay  raise, access to healthcare, and critical oversight, all while saving  American taxpayers billions of dollars and making key investments in  innovative technologies and our defense industrial base.   One of the most important facets of this NDAA: its provisions to  counter communist China's aggression. It builds up projection forces,  increases funding for essential military construction projects, and  provides more funding for innovative new technologies needed to stop  the CCP.   The NDAA makes critical investments in our national defense while  [[Page H3491]]  honoring the Fiscal Responsibility Act's spending levels.   It accomplishes this by capturing $40 billion of savings by cutting  inefficient programs, obsolete weapons systems, and unnecessary  Pentagon bureaucracy.   This bill also ensures that the taxpayer dollars being spent in  Ukraine have proper oversight. Under our NDAA, a new inspector general  will direct and coordinate an audit of all aid provided to Ukraine by  the United States.   Additionally, the NDAA protects our military from weaponization by  liberal activists by stopping our DOD resources from subsidizing  President Biden's Green New Deal and banning the military from teaching  critical race theory.   I applaud the work of the committee in preparing this year's NDAA,  and I strongly urge my Republican colleagues and friends across the  aisle to come together and pass this critical legislation this week.                            ____________________
