 Mr. Speaker, I would like to also add my condolences to  the Senator's family.   I remember, as a young boy growing up interested in politics, that I  was always struck by his thoughtfulness, the demeanor in which he held  himself in an era where we were in full-contact politics all the time.  Senator Hollings was an extraordinary American and a great patriot, and  I join with my colleagues in offering condolences to the family and  remembering his extraordinary legacy.
