 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1177 is a bill that will allow the city of Old  Town, Maine, to move forward with economic development plans that have  been hampered by Federal red tape. H.R. 1177 removes the current deed  restriction on the land surrounding the Old Town airport. This will  allow the city to implement economic development initiatives that will  create jobs and spur economic activity in the area.   As a pilot, I am glad to see that the airport will not be impacted by  this change and will continue to meet the region's air transportation  needs. Again, H.R. 1177 is common sense, reasonable legislation. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 2154 recognizes former U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary  and former North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer by renaming the Red River  Valley Agricultural Research Center in his honor.   The research center serves the region, including my district in  Minnesota, by coordinating five research units in two Fargo  laboratories. The center does a wide range of work with a focus on  animal metabolism-agricultural chemicals, cereal crops, insect genetics  and biochemistry, sugar beet and potato, and sunflower and plant  biology research.   I worked closely with Ed Schafer when he was at USDA and also during  the time he was North Dakota's Governor. We worked on many things  together. Some of them were pleasant and some of them not so pleasant,  such as floods and so forth.   I think it is a fitting recognition for an outstanding career in  government, and I am happy to be here to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side.  Again, I thank the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer) for  bringing this forward. Mr. Schafer is a great member of our community.  He spends some time in my hometown every year and I have gotten to know  him very well. He very much deserves this honor. I am happy to support  this bill, and I ask my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615
