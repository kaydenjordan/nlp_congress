 Mr. Speaker, I regret that the Chamber is not full of  Members or that the gallery is not jammed with people, for this is a  historic day.  [[Page H3947]]    Many Members have quoted that extraordinary doctrine of civil rights  and human rights articulated by our Founders 243 years ago: ``We hold  these truths to be self-evident.'' I tell people that they may be self- evident, but they are not self-executing.    Today, we will take another step in a long journey toward a more  perfect Union. Today, we will take a step, and, hopefully, it will be  as it was in 1957 when we passed the Civil Rights Act that year;  hopefully, it will be as it was in 1964 when we passed that civil  rights bill; and, hopefully, it will be as we voted on the Disabilities  Act in 1990.   All of those bills were passed in a bipartisan fashion; and, yes,  there were bipartisan votes against those bills, some from my party and  some from my colleagues on the Republican side. My presumption is, and  my hope is, that those who voted ``no'' on those civil rights bills  looked back and said: I made a mistake. That was not the vote I should  have made.   Every Democrat will vote for this bill. Every Democrat will stand up  and say this is another step in the quest for a better America, a more  just America, a more accepting America. That is what we have the  opportunity to do today.   I hope that many, if not all, of my Republican colleagues will stand  not for party, not for policies of party or partisanship, but stand for  principles enunciated 243 years ago but still not yet fully realized.   That is what this day is about.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, which I know will  pass, but I hope, as I have said, it passes with a very strong  bipartisan conviction and confirmation of the fact that ``we hold these  truths to be self-evident.'' This is an opportunity for the House to  come together and reject discrimination and exclusion.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill that Mr. Cicilline  put forward. The Equality Act is about America. It is about who we are,  what we are, and what we believe.   I want to commend the LGBTQ community and the Equality Caucus for  being at the forefront of promoting full equality, equal justice, and  equal opportunity for LGBTQ people and their families in this country.   The world looks to us as the strongest supporter, historically, of  human rights and equal rights. Have we always been so? No, we have not.   My party was the segregationist party for many years, and we said no  to that. We walked away from that. We said that was not the party we  were going to be.   Of course, all of us were not members of that part of the party, but  this day, we should all stand and say, yes, we believe that all men and  all women and all people are created equal, by God, and endowed not by  the Constitution, not by this body, but endowed by their Creator with  certain unalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness, and the right to live as you are.   Yes, we make judgments on what you may do, but not who you are. You  may be Black; you may be White; you may be a woman; you may be a man;  you may be a homosexual; you may be a lesbian; you may be a trans; you  may be anything other than what I am; but you are entitled, from me and  from your country, to respect and equal treatment, as we said 243 years  ago.   Sadly, some States still permit discrimination against LGBT people in  those areas that have been discussed. We need to put an end to that and  ensure that all people in this country, no matter where they live, are  protected against hate and bigotry, exclusion and discrimination. The  opportunities this country offers must be open to everyone in our  country.   When I first ran for office in 1966 for a seat in the Maryland State  Senate, fair housing was the issue, and the proposition was you didn't  have to sell your house to somebody whose color was different than  yours even though they had the ability to buy it and they wanted to  move into that neighborhood.   This issue that we consider today is different in particular, but not  in principle. That idea is at the very core of our American society:  that opportunities exist for all of our people.   Throughout our history, we have reinforced this idea with the passage  of the 14th Amendment, the 19th Amendment, the 1964 Civil Rights Act,  the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and others.  We uphold this commitment to a fair and more just society with passage  of this Equality Act.                                time  1115    Surely, we ought to be able to agree. Republicans, Democrats,  liberals, conservatives, Northeast, South, and West, surely, we can  agree that all men and all women are created equal and are deserving of  equal treatment.   Let's come together to make that promise of our Founders ring true.   The Bible says, ``Love your neighbor as yourself.'' Not love your  straight neighbor, not love your Christian neighbor, not love your  White neighbor, not love your native-born neighbor, not love your  neighbor of some other distinction, but, ``Love your neighbor as  yourself.''   That means, in my view, love your gay neighbor, love your lesbian  neighbor, love your trans neighbor. It means love your Muslim neighbor;  love your Jewish neighbor; love your African American, Latino, and  Asian American neighbor; love your immigrant neighbor.   Love your neighbor, not your hyphenated neighbor, because we are all  created equal.   Martin Luther King, a century after the Civil War, said to America  that we are not living out the promise of America. He called us to  conscience. He called us to be America. He called us to be that light  to the rest of the world.   So today, we say we will judge on content of character. We will be  America. We will be the best we can be of America.   Like we did on so many of the civil rights bills that have come  before us, again let us vote overwhelmingly to confirm America's  promise to its people and to the world. Vote for this critically  important statement of America's values.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for  morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes  postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet  at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative  business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative  business.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   The House will also consider H.R. 1500, the Consumer First Act. This  legislation seeks to reverse the administration's efforts to dismantle  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   In addition, the House will consider H.R. 1994, the Setting Every  Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019. The legislation is  intended to increase the flexibility of 401(k) plans and improve access  to the accounts, particularly for small businesses and employees. The  bill includes a host of provisions aimed at encouraging small  businesses to provide private retirement benefits to their workers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.   As the gentleman knows, we passed an initial bill some many weeks  ago. The Senate didn't pass that. We then passed, more recently, a bill  which did, in fact, take care of everyone we know who has had a natural  disaster in the interim as well as those we had taken care of the first  time around.    So, we think we have a good bill that was passed; however, as the  gentleman also referenced, the President has asked for an additional  supplemental of a little over $4 billion referenced for humanitarian  issues at the border. That is being reviewed.   As the gentleman probably also knows, an offer was made to our side.  [[Page H3954]]  That offer has now been responded to with respect to both the initial  and the supplemental--initial, I mean the disaster bill--and we are  looking for an answer back at some point in time to our response. But,  hopefully, we can reach an agreement.    Will the gentleman yield?    Clearly, if we get an agreement--and that, of course, is  the big if, but, hopefully, we can. If we can do that, then we will  want to move as quickly as possible.    I thank the gentleman for his comment. We have had this  discussion on a number of occasions.   I am convinced that Mr. McGovern, the chairman of the Rules  Committee, does, in fact, want to have the kind of process that we  talked about and that the gentleman just referenced. He also knows  that, in the last Congress, we had the most closed rules of any  Congress in which I have served, and perhaps in history, 103 closed  rules.   But having said that, I am hopeful that the gentleman's side will  come forth with amendments that are, as the gentleman says, subject to  rational debate and are not gotcha amendments. I am not alleging they  are gotcha amendments, but that is obviously a concern that the  gentleman had when he was in charge and that we have when we are in  charge.   But I know that Mr. McGovern wants to have a fair process, and we are  talking about that, so we will continue to do that.    First of all, I would say words are important. That is why  we all debate, because we think words are important.   But having said that, I share the gentleman's view, as he well knows,  with reference to the BDS movement, which I think is contrary to the  interests of our ally, Israel, and contrary to our own interests.   Having said that, as I indicated to the gentleman last week, I have  been discussing this with Mr. Engel, and he, as you know, shares the  view which I have expressed and my friend has expressed, and his  committee is going to be addressing that, I expect, in the near term.  When they do, we will decide what actions to take at that point in  time, and I look forward to discussing it with the gentleman.    My friend mentioned there are essentially four components  of the bill to which he referred, three of which are noncontroversial,  as the gentleman knows, and one of which has issues with respect to its  constitutionality. Without resolving that issue, the three that are in  that bill, I think, enjoy bipartisan support. They were held up in the  Senate, as the gentleman probably knows, but we want to make sure those  three certainly are adopted.
