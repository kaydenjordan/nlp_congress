 Mr. Speaker, what are the best things an American can do  for his or her country?   Public service, military service, community service.   What does a true public servant look like?   Someone who possesses exemplary character, integrity, and inspires  confidence. Someone who has the network of relationships on both sides  to be both respected and effective.   How do you honor a man who gave 20 years to the United States  Government and the House of Representatives, the United States Marine  Corps Infantry, and dedicated his free time to bringing Democrats and  Republicans together in the name of charity?   Ryan Thompson, my trusted chief of staff and dear friend, who sits  here with me, joins us on the House floor for the final time today.   He has accompanied me and our former boss to the floor countless  times and always helped us look and do our best. Today is different,  though, because this is his moment.   Mr. Speaker, there are proud members of the United States Marine  Corps and there are proud graduates of Texas A&M University--Texas  Aggies.   Occasionally, God blesses the world by combining both of those things  in one person. Such is the case with Ryan Thompson.   Ryan is a proud, sixth-generation Texan of the Aggie variety, who  serves as a past president of the Texas State Society. A true  philanthropist, Ryan has dedicated thousands of hours over the past  decade to organizing the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Baseball  Game, which raises millions of dollars for local charities each year.   Furthermore, Ryan founded and leads the Congressional Sports for  Charity Foundation, which was created to ensure that the Congressional  Baseball Game and other congressional charity events live on for  decades to come.   Ryan wisely understands that the game is not only essential to the  many charities it helps but serves another cause in need, the Congress  itself.   Today, on behalf of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Washington, D.C.; the  Washington Nationals Dream Foundation; and the Washington Literacy  Council, which honored him with the Champion for Literacy Award--not to  mention a grateful institution and Nation--thank you and happy trails  to Ryan Scott Thompson.   Like a Texas live oak, he is strong from the roots up.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the right to terminate a pregnancy has  become framed as a woman's health issue, and yet, more and more voices  argue in favor of methods of abortion that place a woman's health at  great risk, such as tele-abortion, a means of killing an unborn child  by acquiring abortion drugs and then being coached, through  telemedicine, on how to use them.   Simple, except the woman taking the drugs isn't in a medical  facility. No medical personnel are present. If the drugs don't work as  planned, and the baby is not stillborn, it may still end up in a  dumpster, and the mother may end up in an emergency room.   The obvious danger is why I have filed the Tele-Abortion Prevention  Act, H.R. 4935. This is commonsense legislation, even more so when one  considers an FDA report that states that there have been more than  4,000 cases of serious adverse events, including more than 1,000 that  required hospitalization.   If the woman's health argument is really more than subterfuge that  puts dressing on a tragedy, please join me in passing H.R. 4935, the  Tele-Abortion Prevention Act.                            ____________________
