 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for next week.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the majority leader of the House.    Madam Speaker, on the school bill, I know one of the big  concerns many people have been raising is trying to get schools open  again.   Last week it was reported that 5,200 different schools were closed  last week. And I know this Congress has sent billions of dollars to  school systems across the country. The intent was that that money be  used to get schools opened, and yet, there are some schools taking the  money and staying closed, which goes against all the medical science  out there. We know the damage this is doing to our young children,  learning, depression, and so many other challenges that it creates for  them.   Will there be any part of that legislation that helps require that in  order to get money schools have to be open?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate that. Maybe we can work on  something that would ensure that as tax dollars are going to school  systems that it is going to keep the schools open, not to allow them to  then shut down on the kids because, as we know, the science is very  clear that kids are much better off in school, safer in school than not  being in school, and that the learning experience is dramatically less  if they are not in school, as well as the mental conditions, the social  development that is not occurring if they are not in the classroom.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.     Madam Speaker, our teachers have been true heroes  through this, our frontline hospital workers, people that work at  grocery stores; we have seen so many people rising up to the challenge,  and even where governments failed their ability to do their job.   I know one challenge that, hopefully, we see resolved in the United  States Supreme Court--it won't be today; we were expecting it maybe  this week, but, hopefully, early next week we see the Supreme Court  resolve these challenges where there were mandates on vaccines that  required people to get fired from their job if they chose a healthcare  decision on vaccinations.   I have been vaccinated. I know the gentleman from Maryland has too,  but for those who haven't, whether they are frontline hospital workers  or teachers, people shouldn't be forced to lose their job based on that  choice they make. But the Supreme Court will, hopefully, address that  and resolve that next week. It is something that is out of our hands  now, but it is in the court's hands at the highest level.    And I would hope the government would drop that mandate,  but if not, it is hopeful that the Court would make it clear that the  government doesn't have the authority to require that people get fired  if they don't get vaccinated, encourage people to follow the science.  If they have questions or concerns, that is a conversation they should  have with their doctor, not a government mandate.   But as the gentleman knows, we may have disagreement on that, but  fortunately for us, it will get resolved at the Supreme Court,  hopefully, early next week.   I wanted to ask the gentleman since, we are looking at the schedule  for next week, I didn't notice any of the bills that we have  highlighted in the past that would address some of the many crises our  country is facing, whether it is inflation, whether it is high gas  prices, whether it is the border crisis--all that are running out of  control--the empty shelves that we are seeing at so many stores.   Will the gentleman commit to working with us to bring some of the  bills to the floor to address the real crises that are hurting  hardworking families like the ones I just mentioned?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Clearly, some of those bills that have been discussed  and offered up in the past to address the inflationary problems but  also the policies of this administration that have caused that. And as  we know from the energy crisis, it is not pandemic related that gas  prices are so high. This President made a decision starting on day one  of his administration to shut down American energy production, to shut  down pipelines in America, green lighting pipelines in other countries,  begging foreign countries to make more oil, but shutting off and making  it harder to make energy in America.   Clearly, that self-imposed supply shortage has created higher prices  that we would love to see addressed. We might disagree philosophically  on how to get there, but I don't think there is much disagreement from  people who spend over $100 filling their car up that it needs to  change. But if you look at the workforce challenges, and every small  business owner I talk to--I would imagine all of us could share similar  stories--our small business owners are telling us they can't find  workers. Somebody might want to go to their favorite restaurant but  they are waiting an hour and a half and wondering why a third of the  tables are empty, because they can't get people to work.   And so as some might want to look at the unemployment number, clearly  the number of people that are not even in the workforce that just  stopped working because they can get paid, right now large amounts of  money, to stay at home is a challenge that we should confront here in  this Congress to help encourage people to get back into the workforce,  not to be paying people not to work. And the enhanced unemployment  benefits were, one, part of that problem, but there were many other  parts of that problem.   But it is the idea that there are too many dollars, as the gentleman  said, chasing too few goods is the driver of inflation, but the biggest  driver of that is all of the money that has been spent in Washington.  And if you look at about $6 trillion that has been spent on various  relief packages--some of it was targeted to COVID, which we all  supported, very bipartisan, some of it had nothing to do with COVID  which, unfortunately, has created higher inflation--there is talk right  now that the administration--and I am not sure if the Democratic  leadership is having serious conversations on this--is looking at yet  another bill, potentially over a trillion dollars of additional  spending.   I would ask the gentleman, is that something that is anticipated to  be brought to the floor? I would urge, if that is being looked at, to  not do it because there is about $800 billion remaining from other  relief packages that are unspent. And hopefully we stop the spending in  Washington that is driving inflation and try to encourage the economy  to get opened at a more rapid pace. And if people need additional help,  to look to the money that is sitting there, the $800 billion that is  unspent, rather than trillions more dollars that would be put into a  marketplace that is already oversaturated with Federal spending that is  driving this inflation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman, and clearly we have a difference  on----    What the effects of spending trillions of dollars would  have. And Build Back Better, as the gentleman brought up, would be  about $4.5 trillion of higher taxes, additional spending, things that,  by many accounts, would increase inflation even higher; but we will see  where the Senate goes on that bill. I am not sure if the gentleman is  anticipating bringing  [[Page H178]]  other legislation, the bipartisan bills that we did, to do things like  create Operation Warp Speed, which was maybe one of the most successful  things government did in reaction to a pandemic in the history of the  world, to come up with not one, not two, but now three proven and  effective vaccines in less than a year to a virus no one even knew  about. It never happened in the history of the world but something that  we came together, Republicans and Democrats with President Trump, to  achieve a great achievement, something we would sure urge President  Biden to build on.   Because President Biden did run with a promise that he would, ``shut  down the virus.'' Clearly, he has failed at that. We have asked through  a number of different means to have hearings on some of the things we  have heard concerns about. And I would start with testing. There was an  article recently that the President was presented with a plan in  October to come up with about 750 million tests that people could have  for COVID at home that would be readily available by Christmas where  they, in October, anticipated a resurgence of COVID by December.   It has been reported that the President rejected that plan. We have  asked for a hearing into that. For whatever reason, the majority has  not agreed to that. Here is a letter I sent to Mr. Clyburn and Mrs.  Maloney through the Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus, as well as  through the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Myself and Ranking  Member Comer asked to have a hearing into some of these things, the  testing failures that were reported. If they are true, we ought to hear  about them. If they are false, the administration ought to be pointing  that out. They have not, which tells me they must be true. But then why  in October would the President have rejected a testing plan that could  have prevented us from getting to the place we are at right now with  this resurgence?   What about some of the national plans that the President said he had  as a candidate that then he later told Governors recently he doesn't  have a national plan on COVID. The mixed messaging coming from the  administration is causing tremendous confusion across America, and we  have asked that we have hearings to clarify, give the administration a  chance to state their plan or the lack thereof, state whether or not  they rejected a massive testing plan for the Nation in October that  would have prevented what happened in December.   The lack of desire by the administration to be transparent about any  of this is creating tremendous confusion across the country. This  Congress could address that by holding hearings to get the facts out. I  know we are going to continue to press for those kinds of hearings. I  would hope we have them, but so far we have not gotten any response to  the affirmative on that.   I don't know if the gentleman has anything to add. Maybe the  gentleman would agree that we would have these kind of hearings to get  some of these facts out or get some of these issues addressed.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    The problem with President Biden's plan is that it has  been reactionary and not visionary. When he was presented with a plan  in October to make sure that every American that needed a test would  have it in December, when they in October said there will probably be a  real uptick in December, the President said no to that.   So if today he says let's go and order 500 million tests, that sounds  fine and well, except that he said no to that in October when he could  have staved off what we see, and that is hours-long lines of people to  get tested. People shouldn't have to be waiting 5 hours in a line to  get tested when the President in October was presented with a plan.   Again, if he wasn't, as it has been reported, he should come out  publicly and say that. The report has been out for weeks now, and he  hasn't done that.   We should be having hearings on this to find out what was the plan  that was presented and who was involved, by the way, in rejecting that  plan. Was the CDC involved? Was NIH involved? Was HHS involved in  rejecting a forward-thinking plan in October that predicted what  inevitably did happen this Christmas?   Who was involved in the rejection of that plan, and why did they do  it? Is it that the administration doesn't want accountability? I don't  know, but we have asked those questions, and we have asked for a  hearing on that.   We have been told that it is not going to happen. I hope the  gentleman would help push to get this to happen, to find this out so we  don't play catch-up every time something happens, when there were there  people saying: Let's try to stop something before it becomes a problem.   If there are people in the White House who said, no, we are not going  to do it until it is a problem for families, those people ought to be  removed from the White House. And they shouldn't be involved in the  decisionmaking chain because their decisions caused maybe more death,  surely caused a dramatic increase in ills that people are facing right  now because it could have been staved off, and it wasn't. We don't  [[Page H179]]  have that information from an administration who promised to be  transparent.   We did have a hearing a few days ago in the select subcommittee. It  was a private hearing; it wasn't open to the public. I didn't agree  with that, but that was the decision made by the majority. We have to  start having transparency, as was promised to the people.   People deserve transparency. They deserve to have these questions  answered and, frankly, to have a more forward-thinking plan, not a  reactionary plan when forward-thinking was presented and rejected.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, under President Trump, when he created  Operation Warp Speed, the one thing he did say is that we are going to  move red tape so we can focus the entire scientific community, both the  Federal agencies but also the private sector, in working together in  removing the red tape so they can focus on getting a vaccine. He didn't  say three, but he said let's at least get them the ability, all of  these great companies, many that are American companies, to go put  their innovation to work and get bureaucracy and red tape out of the  way and follow science but expedite so that we can get there quicker  when many scientists, including some who still testify at committees  today, said it was going to take years to get a vaccine.   In less than a year, we had three. President Biden inherited that  when he walked in the door and took the oath of office. He had three  proven vaccines.   I know the gentleman talks about statistics. Look at COVID deaths.  During the campaign, President Biden not only said he would crush the  virus, but he said that anybody who presided over that many deaths-- that was months before the election--doesn't deserve to be President of  the United States. I thought that was an inappropriate statement.   More people have died under President Biden's watch from COVID than  under President Trump's. It was an unfair standard that President Biden  put in place when he was at one of the debates. If he is going to say  things like he is going to crush the virus and going to have a plan,  but then he comes out and obviously didn't crush the virus and tells  Governors that there is no Federal plan, I do think that is a mixed  message, at the least. That dereliction in his promise, at the worst,  ought to be confronted.   What is the plan, if there is a plan? If there is not a plan, admit  there is not a plan. But you campaigned saying there was going to be a  plan, and clearly, there is not one. Those are other facts that we can  put on the table.   Clearly, when you look at how President Trump pushed the Federal  Government to work and partner with the private sector to move red tape  so we can expedite the research and the trials, more tests than were  ever done maybe on any other attempt for a vaccine, and come up in less  than a year with vaccines when many said it would take years, it was  clearly a remarkable achievement that we all worked on. President Trump  led the effort, and we funded it in a very bipartisan way, and it was  very effective.   Obviously, this is a challenge for every country. There were other  things said that ought to be put out there, and let's at least try to  all be saying the same thing and focusing on the same thing.   When scientific experts say that this is what we anticipate  happening--if you are going to reject that science, at least hold  people accountable who were part of the discussions to reject that  science, as I referred to the October rejection of a testing plan that  would have been in effect for December that was rejected.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Clearly, we have some disagreements, but as we both have  advocated for the vaccine, I do think one of the differences that we  may have is that I strongly feel that it is a personal decision. It is  a medical decision. And if government thinks that shaming people,  threatening people, and firing people is going to address that  challenge, they have missed the mark, and I wish they would instead  move away from the shame and the firing. Hopefully the U.S. Supreme  Court agrees with us and stops at least the firings of people by  mandates from the government and just encourages people to have that  conversation with their doctor if they have hesitation. But,  ultimately, it is a decision that each individual would have to make.   We will continue this conversation I am sure, and I yield to the  gentleman.    To be clear, I never said it was for health reasons. I  said it was a health decision. So this is a medical decision that  people are making.   Again, in the past we have seen this suggested by some in the medical  community inaccurately that if you get vaccinated you can't get the  virus. A Supreme Court Justice said that if you get vaccinated you  can't spread the virus. That turned out to be false. We know whether  vaccinated or not you can get the virus. You can receive the virus, you  can give it to other people, and you can die. We know in the hospitals  the higher propensity of people in the hospitals are unvaccinated.   Those are the kinds of things that we should be encouraging to get  the facts out and then encouraging people to go make their decision  with their doctor if they have concerns and questions.   There are valid questions. There are people in the past who have  raised religious exemptions to other vaccines and, by the way, been  given approval for those religious exemptions that today are not  getting similar religious exemptions for this.    So let's just treat it equally, let's treat it fairly, and let's just  focus on the facts. This idea that if you mandate something and  threaten somebody it is going to change behavior, it is just not  proving itself to be correct, and it is causing more division and  forcing people into corners that they shouldn't be on. So hopefully,  again, we can continue this conversation and get back to a place where  we are in agreement which we have been in things like Operation Warp  Speed.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
