 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  package to fund government operations in fiscal year 2020. I extend my  congratulations to this dynamic duo, the first time we have ever had  females occupy the chair and ranking member of this committee and, for  that matter, I guess, any other committee in the House.   This dynamic duo has produced a very good document, a very good  exercise of the power of the purse of the Congress granted by the  Constitution. I salute these two and wish them well as the day  progresses.   As a former chair of the full committee, I know of the extreme  patience that is required in this job that they are occupying and the  difficulty of getting 435 Members in this body, as well as the other  body, the White House, and the world, together under any stretch of the  imagination, but they have done that. It is difficult to do, and we  salute them for it. I especially, having been there, thank them for the  great patience that they have shown in putting this bill together.   This first package before us reflects our commitment to our Nation's  security and our military leadership across the world. The Department  of Defense receives additional resources to support our warfighters  with the best available technology. We also provide these brave men and  women with a hard-earned and well-deserved pay raise.   Within the committee, I have been particularly focused on keeping the  DOD's electronic health records on track, meshing DOD's medical records  with that of the VA. This bill takes bold steps in the right direction  to ensure our servicemembers continue to receive the best medical care  when they transition out of Active Duty and into the hands of the VA.   Second, President Trump is rightly focused on addressing the crisis  at our southern border. This legislation will support his efforts to  end the seemingly unending flow of drugs that found their way into  every American community and, practically, every American home, as well  as the violence of the brutal cartels that profit immensely from this  trade. Nearly $1.4 billion is included for the border wall, along with  additional resources for the Department of Homeland Security to hire  more personnel and deploy advanced technology in this region.   We were also able to eliminate dangerous riders that would have  limited the President's ability to enforce our immigration laws while  still ensuring a strong humanitarian response that reflects our values  as Americans.   This package also continues our momentum in the fight against opioid  abuse and addiction. With targeted resources for the Department of  Justice and other Federal agencies, the diverse programs funded in this  bill reflect the holistic strategy that Congress has embraced against  this problem: enforcement, treatment, education, and prevention, all  working in concert, in a holistic fashion. Drug courts, veterans  treatment courts, and prescription drug monitoring programs receive  robust support in this first package.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.  [[Page H10383]]    Included as well are antiheroin and antimeth task forces that bring  law enforcement agents from multiple jurisdictions together to end this  scourge.   Finally, the bill allocates $30 million within the Economic  Development Administration for assistance to coal mining communities  that continue to struggle with the downturn in that industry. And it  maintains all pro-life and Second Amendment protections that exist  under current law.   Madam Speaker, this bill is worthy of our strong support, and I urge  the adoption of this masterful package.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise today in support of this second appropriations package to fund  the government for fiscal year 2020. I especially want to state my  heavy support for this portion of the bill that funds the State  Department and our foreign operations around the world.   I thank the distinguished chair, Mrs. Lowey, and the ranking member,  Ms. Granger, on their masterful work to shepherd this compromise all  the way through the maze that is the Congress to this floor where we  sit today.   I especially value Chairwoman Lowey's partnership on the State and  Foreign Operations title of this bill, which she also chairs. She and I  may differ on some issues--in fact, we do differ on some issues--but on  the whole, this bill represents the priorities of Congress in support  of our national security.   The agreement includes significant funding to secure our 200-plus  diplomatic posts around the world, our embassies, consulates, and the  like, and to support critical allies like Israel, Jordan, Egypt,  Georgia, and Ukraine. It will allow us to respond to a growing threat  that China poses to our security.   In our own hemisphere, the bill prioritizes funding for Latin America  as the region continues to face instability from the crisis in  Venezuela, as well as from the rampant drug problem and corruption.   The bill also continues vigorous oversight of U.S. assistance, denies  funding for the Green Climate Fund, and respects the sanctity of life  around the world.   This package also includes a number of provisions of critical  importance to my district in southern and eastern Kentucky.   First, there is a strong commitment to our coal miners and the  communities where they live. I am exceedingly proud that a bill I  cosponsored to protect our retired miners is also included in this  bill. It ensures that these  [[Page H10589]]  hardworking individuals receive the healthcare and the pensions that  they have earned. I hope the 100,000 families impacted by this  provision will have peace of mind heading into this Christmas season.   This bill also provides $115 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands  Pilot Program, which has been monumentally successful in creating new  economic development opportunities in Appalachia.                                time  1230    This funding is a strong complement to the Appalachian Regional  Commission, which is robustly funded at $175 million in this package.  Within the Department of Agriculture, there is strong emphasis on rural  infrastructure, including broadband deployment.   I am also proud that my Kentucky Wildlands National Heritage Area  Study Act is included in today's package. I have been proud to work  with Leader McConnell on this initiative to truly recognize the  incredible natural and historic value of eastern Kentucky.   This legislation will also ensure that the veterans in our region  receive the care they need and deserve. I advocated for a new pilot  program to provide transportation assistance for our Nation's many  rural veterans, like those in eastern Kentucky, and I am grateful for  the seed funding to get that off the ground.   Finally, nearly $6 billion is provided for opioid addiction  prevention, treatment, and recovery, and research into alternative  therapies for pain management. A new loan repayment program that is  funded in the bill will help get qualified treatment professionals into  underserved communities like ours in Kentucky.   But I am especially thankful for the inclusion in this bill of  sufficient funds to help us fight the problem of opioid addiction,  which got its start in my district some 15 years ago.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I urge support  of this bill.
