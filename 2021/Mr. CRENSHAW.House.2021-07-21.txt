 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight a dangerous  implication of this bill and urge my colleagues to vote against it.   There is no disagreement that the Federal Government has a role to  play in cleaning up the most heavily contaminated sites and  establishing standards so that our water is safe to drink. We are  united in this, both Republicans and Democrats.   While this bill shares the spirit of that, frankly, it got hopelessly  lost along the way. Instead, it creates a mess of lawsuits.   We could have fixed this. Republicans have pointed out the pitfalls.  Democrats say those pitfalls don't exist. Experts say, yes, they do. We  could fix this.                                time  1315    In committee we discussed how this impacts a full suite of products,  from medical devices to computer chips.   But there is one element that is particularly concerning to me. Under  this legislation, a police department that purchases one of the most  popular bulletproof vests to protect its officers against rising crime  would now be subject to environmental lawsuits.   And here's why: A bulletproof vest becomes increasingly ineffective  if it is exposed to moisture. As a result, it is protected by a  waterproofing PFAS chemical to keep it dry and effective against  bullets.   By imposing a de facto ban--and it is a de facto ban--on all PFAS  chemicals, even those that pose no risk to human health or the  environment, this legislation will significantly reduce the  availability of lifesaving equipment.   Manufacturers, or others in the supply chain, will seek to avoid the  PFAS liabilities created by this bill under CERCLA. So police  departments, rather than worrying about protecting our communities,  will now have to worry about whether or not they will be subject to an  environmental lawsuit.   Instead, police departments themselves will be forced to make  impossible decisions; continuing to use PFAS-containing, lifesaving  equipment or risk huge legal liability when the equipment is disposed  of.   This bill will bring entities like police departments, and anyone and  everyone who is even remotely involved with PFAS material, under the  wide dragnet of litigation that they don't have the resources to fight.   As Democrats seek to defund police across the country, police  departments are already strapped for cash. So under this bill, we are  forcing police departments to decide whether to defend themselves  against lawsuits or purchase the material they need to keep their  officers safe.   That is why I introduced a simple amendment that would limit the  liability of police departments, first responders, and our military  from being endlessly sued if they require these materials to protect  themselves.   My amendment didn't limit the EPA's ability to actually regulate  these chemicals or even determine which ones are safe or unsafe. Nor  did it allow police departments to dispose of these products in an  unsafe way and be shielded from consequences.   It just said, if a police department or first responder follows the  letter of the law in dealing with these materials, they shouldn't be  threatened with endless lawsuits. But, sadly, my colleagues didn't make  my amendment in order.   So while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are desperately  trying to prove that they support our police officers after a year of  demonizing them, the bill shows that really nothing has changed.   But there is one more chance to make this right. I will be offering  my amendment as the motion to recommit for this legislation. Our police  officers need to know that Congress has their back, especially now.  This motion to recommit is a chance to do just that.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and vote for my  amendment to protect our police and our military and our first  responders.  [[Page H3779]]    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
