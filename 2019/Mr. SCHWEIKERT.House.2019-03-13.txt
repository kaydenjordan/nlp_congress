 Madam Speaker, what we are going to do right now is,  and we are going to hopefully only take about a half an hour, actually  walk through sort of the continuing theme of how at least our math--and  particularly in our office, we have been trying to put together sort of  a unified theory of how do we deal with the reality of what is  happening in our country with our demographics. We are getting older  much faster, and our birthrate has fallen dramatically.   Repeatedly, we have come up here with other boards that basically  show, over the next 30 years, the greatest threat to our economy, to  our society, to our country's priorities, is the fact that our  interest, Social Security, Medicare, healthcare entitlement costs  consume everything. The rest of the budget is functionally imbalanced.   I know this is uncomfortable because it is one of those things that  is hard for us to talk about. It is not Republican or Democratic. It is  demographics. It is math.   Part of that baseline, to understand 2008 to 2028, take those 20  years, 91 percent of the spending increase here in Washington, if you  remove interest, 91 percent of the spending increase is--actually, I  think it does include interest--interest, Social Security, healthcare  entitlements.   We need to understand the basic math. And now, how do you actually  deal with it?   How do you maximize economic growth?   How do you maximize labor force participation?   How do you encourage people, if we built the incentives, to actually  stay in the labor force longer?   How do you actually embrace technology, particularly disruptive  technology that crashes the prices and makes our society healthier and  more efficient?   And then, how do we have an honest conversation of those earned  benefits and build them so they have incentives in there that, if you  are fit and healthy and happy, you are willing to stay in the labor  force longer? Are there certain spiffs and benefits we can design into  these?   So those are sort of our five pillars.   Today, we are going to do something that is fun.   We just grabbed a handful of concepts that are about technology, and  the tough part--when you start talking about disruptive technology--it  makes you sort of giddy for what the future is and the opportunities.   But there is this thing we call incumbency, particularly in  economics--incumbency: the incumbent business; the incumbent medical  provider; the incumbent over here.   These technologies are going to be a real challenge.                                time  1430    The running joke in our office is how many of us went to Blockbuster  Video last weekend. We sort of woke up one night and all decided to go  home and hit a button called HBO Go, Netflix, those things. We no  longer stood in line and got movie suggestions and went home with a  little shiny disc.   We are going to walk through, first, some of the healthcare IT and  why this is so important. I want you to first think about some of the  technologies that are starting to roll out.   If you got to take home or had in the back of the office or we had on  the back of the floor here something that looked like a gigantic kazoo  that you could blow into and it told you whether you had the flu or  whether you had a bacterial infection and, instantly, it could ping  your medical records that you are carrying around both on your phone or  in the cloud and instantly order your antivirals and they were  delivered to your house, did we just crash parts of the price of  healthcare? Of course we did.   Did we just make a lot of incumbent businesses? We are challenging  part of their business model because you used this technology instead  of going to the urgent care center or going to the emergency room or  going to the hospital or even going to the pharmacy. But we have to be  willing to think about these things. These types of technologies are  rolling out all around us.   An Israeli company--the picture over in the far corner--actually has,  and I guess it is being certified all across Europe right now, a  desktop blood test that actually does a whole plethora of different  blood tests with just a few drops. Remember, we talked about this 10  years ago. It turns out the technology now actually exists.   In a couple of blog posts, even the concept of going into an  autonomous healthcare center--and we actually have about 10 of these up  in the Phoenix area where you go in and sign up on an iPad. You take a  picture of your driver's license and a picture of your insurance card.   You go into a booth alone. You put your arm in this thing. It does  blood pressure and does a number of readings. You pick up this  particular tool, and an avatar on the screen says: Can you shine this  down your throat? Can you bend? Can you turn? Now do your ears, your  eyes. It actually does algorithmic healthcare.   What if that few-drop blood test--actually, as a couple of blog posts  talked about, you put your hand on something and it pricks your finger.  It takes the blood test right there, and before you walk out the door,  5 minutes later, it is giving you a full blood workup.   What did you just do using technology to disrupt parts of healthcare  costs?   These things are real. They are rolling out right now. There are  amazing technologies in almost everything you can think of. But we are  going to have to think about both the ecosystem and the complications  of how it is paid  [[Page H2706]]  for--are these things that Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurers will  pay for?--and how we do it.   Also, the data. What happens in a society where you are now going to  be walking around with certain wearables?   You have the fancy watch that helps you manage your hypertension, the  patch that does your blood oxygen, the port that helps you actually  manage your blood sugar. There is lots of data coming off of those  wearables. We, in our office, call them digiceuticals. How does that  all tie into the rest of the ecosystem?   And that data, how do you actually get that data so a doctor or the  algorithm can see, when you open your pill bottle--because the pill  bottle has a sensor in it, we know when you took your pill, and 15  minutes later we see this on your EKG that is coming from your watch,  we see this reaction, can that data become incredibly usable? Can that  data be blinded from your own personal information and help all of  society get healthier because we gained more data in those algorithms?   This is cutting edge, but it is not utopianism. We actually have  those things right now today.   If you start to think about it, you can actually go to Amazon, or I  am sure others online, and see that it exists today. For under a couple  of thousand dollars, you can buy a handheld ultrasound. Think about  that.   Apparently, there are other versions, faster, better, even ones  coming in the future where the algorithm will actually read the  ultrasound. You hold it up on your iPhone, and as you are using this  handheld ultrasound to look at the picture, the algorithm is also going  to help you interpret it.   What did an ultrasound system cost a few years ago? You can buy this  online today. It exists, and we are doing experiments with it right now  in a VA, I believe, just right here in Maryland. Apparently, they are  having terrific outcomes because the doctor can walk up and check  something.   These technologies exist. How do we start to have these technologies  start to disrupt the price of healthcare? Because to be absolutely  intellectually honest, if you actually look at the Affordable Care Act,  ObamaCare, or Republican alternatives, we have spent a couple of  decades in this body having a debate on who pays, not how to disrupt.   With the ACA, we are going to have government pay a lot more. Over  here, in our version, we are going to try to create incentives to have  individuals actually get market competition.   They have been debates on paying. We have almost never stepped up and  said: What are our barriers at the State level? What are our barriers  at the regulatory level? What are the barriers at the HHS levels that  actually prevent the adoption of disruptive technologies?   These things do exist today. We need to actually embrace the concept  of rapid disruptive adoption of these technologies because, remember  our five pillars, if we do not have a disruption in the cost of  healthcare as we are getting older very quickly as a society, remember,  in only 9 years, we have two workers for every one person in  retirement.   In 9 years, if you pull interest out, half the spending here coming  out of Washington, D.C., will be to those 65 and older, and it is,  substantially, healthcare.    We all carry around these smartphones. Should our health records be  on those? Of course they should be, because they should be portable  with us because health data, health records are going to become  something dramatically different than the record that is sitting there  at the hospital. It is going to be living.   How many of you ever use something like Waze or a crowdsource on your  phone? You are going to be having these things on your body, or the  pill bottle that knows when you opened it. That data should be living  with you so you are constantly managing.   There is a debate going on with those folks who build these  algorithms. The fact that you had a surgery 7 years ago that is sitting  on your health record or the health data that is coming off your  wearables from the last 48 hours, which one is actually more valuable  to your healthcare? The living data has incredible value in keeping you  healthy. We need to find a way to embrace this and build this  ecosystem.   This next one I put up, even though there are a dozen, we are going  to show a couple of versions of this just for the fun of it. Think  about the debates we are having here in Washington, D.C., and for those  of us on the Ways and Means Committee in regard to drug pricing.   We need to fix many of the incentives. We need to actually deal with  the fact that some of the games that are played on patents and other  things--okay. That is an honest debate. But understand, the data says  that half the pharmaceuticals that will be picked up at pharmacies  today or delivered in the mail today, half of them will either not be  used or will not be used properly.   Think about that just conceptually. Half of the pharmaceuticals that  will be taken home today aren't going to be used properly. Is there a  data solution?   We have everything from just the pill bottle top that lets us know  that you opened it and when it opened and would tag your healthcare  record, hopefully, be portable with you on your phone so we know that  you actually took it, to actually, now, for those who may be on the  severely mentally ill side who have certain maintenance medications  that are providing miracles--they actually have a super small tiny chip  that is actually in the pill itself that we can actually read that we  know you are digesting it, that we know you took your meds.   Think about it. We need to embrace these types of technologies, even  down to this type of pill dispenser for someone who may have a little  more complicated issue where they take some of their pharmaceuticals  either at multiple times during the day or they have certain  complications.   Here is one that was shown at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las  Vegas about 6 weeks ago. You put your cup under it and it automatically  dispenses at a certain time and tells us what pharmaceuticals were  delivered to you. It is technology dealing with the fact that we have  documented that half the pharmaceuticals aren't properly used or used  at all.   It turns out the data that will flow off of these things actually  will help us. When you have a wisdom tooth taken out, do you really  need 30 pills or do you need 3? It turns out, the data from this may  actually help us dramatically change the way we do prescriptions in the  first place.   So I am making the argument, it turns out that data and technology  are also one of the solutions as we talk about pharmaceutical pricing.   Now we are actually going to move on to something else we, as a  body--and this is going to take my brothers and sisters on the  Democratic side and Republican side. We need to have a very, hopefully,  math-based, honest conversation about how we are going to finance  miracles that are coming, and some of them are going to be here before  the end of this year.   We just put up this slide as part of the thought experiment. In  America, we have about 8,000 Americans who have hemophilia A. The price  range, we have actually found some documents that say the blood  clotting factors and those things may be a half million dollars a year  to keep that American stable.   What happens this November or December--which we are actually very  hopeful is about to happen--when a single shot cures hemophilia A? How  do we pay for it? What are we willing to pay for it? How do you value  that in society? It is a single shot of a very small population so it  is not like the next day there is going to be a competitor drug in the  pipeline like we had with other drugs. In this case, it is a single- shot cure.   But we actually know that over 50 percent of all of our healthcare  expense is to 5 percent of our brothers and sisters who have chronic  conditions. What happens when we start having miracle drugs like a  genomic biological like this that is curing diseases that are part of  our brothers and sisters, that 5 percent who actually have the chronic  conditions that consume over half of our healthcare dollars?    We are actually, as an office, proposing ideas of a type of  healthcare bond so you can actually finance the adoption of the  distribution of these disruptive, revolutionary drugs and then pay for  it using some of what  [[Page H2707]]  would have been the future costs, pull those forward so you get the  disruption of the future savings.   These individuals are out of that chronic condition, but we are going  to have to have a very tricky conversation. How do you price it? What  is the value of a pharmaceutical that is functionally a miracle that  cures something like hemophilia A? How do you price it? There is only  going to be one producer of it, would be my guess, because there is  such a small population. There are only 8,000 Americans with hemophilia  A. Is it worth $1.5 million an injection?   There is actually a math way to get there dealing with the reality of  this is a population that costs us a quarter of a million dollars a  year to keep them healthy, and this is the life expectancy. What was  the research cost, because we want these miracle drugs as part of our  society to help us have that disruption as part of the holistic theory  of technology, these new miracle drugs that are coming, to disrupt the  future healthcare costs.   Now, I want you to take this concept a bit further and spread it  beyond healthcare. Think of some of the crazy debates we have actually  had here on the floor in regards to--forgive me--environment. I want to  argue with you that there is a technology disruption that can make our  environment cleaner but we don't actually hurt the economy. We can  actually help it grow.   So here is my first thought experiment. This has been a fixation of  mine for a few years here.   Think of the community you live in. What if tomorrow, instead of  today's current model--you want to open up a paint shop or you want to  open up a bakery or this and that. You go out and fill out forms. You  send them down to the local environmental regulator. You may also file  them with the State. If you are doing certain types of volatile  organics, you may have to file with the EPA. You are basically filling  up file cabinets. Do filled-up file cabinets make the environment, the  air quality in your community cleaner?                                time  1445    It is an honest concept because we functionally have a 1938  regulatory model of file--lots and lots of paper--maybe even do  quarterly audits, maybe annual audits, fill out more paper, and fill up  file cabinets full of paper that functionally a lawyer gets to come and  look at a couple years later.   Does that make the environment in your community cleaner?   What would happen if you had a few hundred or a few thousand people  traveling around in your community that actually just had the little  sensor traveling with them that they were collecting data on  hydrocarbons, on volatile organics, and on ozone, and you could  actually see the map of your community? If all of a sudden you had a  hot spot over here because you find out you have clowns painting cars  in the backyard of their house, you would know about it instantly, and  the environmental regulator, instead of putting paper in file cabinets,  they would get in, hopefully, their electric vehicle, and go over and  actually stop the clowns from painting cars in their backyard.   Which made the environment cleaner?   The trade-off here is actually very elegant because I don't need you  to file lots of paperwork. I don't need you to actually be doing  quarterlies and annuals because if you screw up, we catch you  instantly.   What made the economy grow, what reduced the bureaucratic burden in  our society, and what actually made our communities healthier and  cleaner?   It is just technology.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Will the gentleman enter into a colloquy?    The gentleman is one of my buddies from Florida. He  actually gets this, but he also knows I actually love the technology  disruptions, because none of us has figured out if it is Republican or  Democrat yet, which actually makes it possible for us to do it. Now,  eventually, we will break it into partisan because everything has  become weaponized and partisan around this body.   But, right now, think of this: this is a natural gas electric  facility. It can power 5,000 homes. It is up and running outside  Houston. It doesn't have a smokestack. All the ACO2, so all  the carbon is captured. They actually came up with this brilliant  technology that the carbon actually flows through. My understanding of  the engineering is it helps spin the turbines, and then the excess  carbon that is generated is safe and sold.   We actually have a tax credit that we adjusted that hopefully made it  more robust as we did tax reform that if you want to take some of that  carbon you can put it in concrete, or a piece of plastic, or do it for  certain types of oil recovery.    It is actually a tax credit according to the amount  of tonnage you produce of ACO2.    Yes. But the beauty of it is that model has said that  we have actually already created a value on this carbon, and if you  don't put it into the environment but actually use it for other things  as a filler in plastics, as a filler in concrete, in putting it back in  to the ground to enhance recovery, we are already doing it. This  technology isn't utopianism, it exists. It is already running.   How many times around here have we talked about that we can actually  have a hydrocarbon generation without a smokestack?   The technology exists. If we are going to talk about a green agenda,  then we actually all need to sit down and actually meet with the really  smart researchers and scientists and actually understand the math and  science. That science is way ahead of where our heads are.   The gentleman from Florida has some amazing technologies coming out  of his State right now on everything from biogeneration to the ways to  manage the environment.    That is actually a brilliant way to phrase it.   My continuing thought experiment, and this is a little beyond where  we were going, but it makes the point, visit Washington, D.C., or a  bunch of other locations now. They are not going to give you a straw or  they are going to give you a paper straw.   The math is--and this actually, I believe, comes from the United  Nations--90 percent of all the plastic in the ocean--and, look, it is a  big deal. I am looking at my data here, roughly 8 million tons a year  of plastic goes in to the ocean. The gentleman is from a coastal  State--comes from 10 rivers, eight of them in Asia, two of them in  Africa.    If you actually really cared about plastic in the ocean, that 8  million tons, we would actually take our environmental policy, our  trade policy, and  [[Page H2708]]  our foreign aid policy and say that we are going to actually help these  10 rivers that are responsible for 90 percent of the plastic in the  ocean and work on those. But instead we do these feel-good, absurd,  theatrical things of ``my community isn't going to do straws, don't we  feel better that we did something for plastic in the ocean?''   It had nothing to do with plastic in the ocean. It is these 10  rivers. Let's grow up and stop the political theater.    I knew you were going to say virtue signaling.   This is a little bit sarcastic, and I mean it to be slightly on the  humor side, one of the first things every Member of Congress should put  into their budgets is the ownership of a calculator, because we  functionally work in a math-free zone where our feelings become public  policy instead of the baseline data where we can actually have an  impact of making our society and the world healthier and more  economically prosperous. If you actually, genuinely cared about plastic  in the ocean, we have 10 rivers, 90 percent of the plastic, we know  exactly where they are; focus there, instead of the absurdity of the  straw at your local whatever.    Coming from Arizona we have sort of this utopian view  that one day Arizona may become a coastal State.    Or an earthquake.    You are very kind, and I thank you for the colloquy.   Look, many of us just want to solve the problems. I have the best  little girl in the world sitting in the back right now. She is 3 years  old.   What does her future get to be like?   We have a demographic crisis. It is just math. We are getting older  very quickly. If we don't grow the economy, if we don't have lots of  labor force participation, and if we don't use trade and tax policy and  innovation, we need these things to grow.   But instead, Madam Speaker, if you listen to the speeches that often  end up behind these microphones, it is an absurdity that is partisan  because we care about power more than actually doing those things that  are so important for our future of this society.   So I want to give you one last, ultimate thought experiment. I am  still just stunned this article hasn't gotten more coverage around the  country, but it is going to require many of us to actually deal with  some of our political constituencies that have lots of folklore built  into their belief systems.   About 6 weeks ago, an article came out. University of Illinois U.S.  Agricultural Research Service published a paper saying--now, you all  remember your high school or your first botany class or when you were  actually learning about cell biology--there is actually a weird  inefficiency in plant cells on how they grab a carbon molecule or  oxygen molecule--we won't geek out too much--but they found a way  through a bit of genetic engineering to make the cell wall  superefficient.   They basically believe that they have broken the Holy Grail that  plants, commodity crops--right now they did it on tobacco plants,  because the reason they do research on tobacco plants is we have known  the genome of tobacco plants for quite a while now--40 percent increase  in efficiency.   We have got to think this through. Now, there is a really disruptive  side of that. Forty percent, tomorrow if you could plant a corn seed or  wheat or something else, and it had 40 percent more yield, what does  that mean to feeding the world 50 years from now?   Yay.   What does that mean to commodity prices?   Scary.   But you need functionally now 40 percent less land, 40 percent less  water, 40 percent less fuel, and we actually have some data here from  the IPCC 2014 report which is from the United Nations that just a  little under one-quarter of all the human emissions, functionally  greenhouse gases, come from agriculture.   If you do the math--think about this--this 40 percent increase in  yield for agriculture would functionally equal removing every car off  the face of the Earth.   Think about the conversations we have here talking about the  environment. Here is a miracle. And the reality we know from other  disruptions in seeds that it can be rolled into society very quickly as  these new seed stocks, except we are going to have to deal with our  brothers and sisters saying: well, that is a genetically modified seed.   Yes, but it has this amazing disruption in the world. If you truly  care about greenhouse gases, if that is your fixation, just moving to  this new disruptive technology that I hope is real, I hope the research  continues to demonstrate a 40 percent production increase, this here  could be the fastest, biggest disruption in greenhouse gases in the  world because you could actually adopt these seed crops within just a  few years.    That is an example of technology not just bringing a small  improvement or even a disruption, in many ways it is a major  disruption, but you have to deal with the politics of belief systems.  It is genetically modified, but it is not a genetically modified seed  stock to deal with pests or this and that, they just dealt with the  inefficiency of the cell wall. It is a miracle. If it is true, it is a  miracle. Think about it, though, but understand the disruptions that  are going to roll through our society.   What happens to the value of agricultural land?   What happens to the ability of nations to ultimately feed themselves  if all of a sudden they had a 40 percent increase in productivity?   But also what happens in our world if I come to you right now, Madam  Speaker, and say that agriculture produces functionally, by my math, a  bit more than 2\1/2\ times the amount of emissions of every car on the  Earth?   So this technology would be as if you just removed every car off the  Earth.   How come we don't have these types of conversations here on the  floor?   It is because it doesn't fit our political folklore model of what has  become just a stunningly partisan gotcha weaponized body.   As we go through our five pillars for the future one more time, the  reason for the fixation on this, we have 74 million of our brothers and  sisters who are baby boomers, the last baby boomer hits 65 in 9 years,  many of the things we should have done we should have done a decade or  two decades ago, and we didn't have the political appetite. We have to  deal with the reality that we have this population bubble that is  getting older and our birthrates have substantially collapsed.   If we are going to keep our promises to those folks who have worked  their entire lives who will be moving into their benefit years, we have  to think disruptively. We have to be willing to do everything from tax  policy, trade policy, and regulatory policy that we have talked about  here using technology, to labor force participation, encouraging people  all up and down the spectrum to actually enter the labor force.   We have to be willing to talk about redesigning some of the programs  to incentivize, if you wish to work, you get to work. We are going to  have to actually also embrace the miracle of these disruptive  technologies and not be scared of them.   But this body is going to also have to deal with something that is  very difficult for a political body, and that is a lot of our friends  are going to either have to change their economic models and a lot of  our States are going to  [[Page H2709]]  have to change their regulatory models just as we will. But it is these  disruptions that give us the economic robustness to actually keep our  promises over the next 30 years.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
