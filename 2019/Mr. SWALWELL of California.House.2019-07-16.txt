 Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity  today to condemn or condone. Birtherism is racist. Saying a Mexican  judge can't be fair because of his heritage is racist. Saying  immigrants from Mexico are rapists is racist. Saying there were good  people on both sides in Charlottesville is racist. Calling African  countries * * * countries is racist, and telling four Members of this  body to go home is racist.                                point of order     Do you think it is not racist?    Do you think it is not racist, Mr.  Collins?    Is that what you are saying right now,  Mr. Collins?   Mr. Collins, is it not racist to say these things?   Because you can say that right now.    Madam Speaker, I will withdraw an  offensive word.   Madam Speaker, may I have an additional 30 seconds?    Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity  today to condemn or condone.   Birtherism is racist.   Saying a Mexican judge cannot be fair because of his heritage is  racist.   Saying immigrants from Mexico are rapists is racist.   Telling four Members of this body to go home because of where you  believe they are from is racist.   There is racism coming out of the White House. There is racism coming  out of the White House. So where will you stand today?   That is the question we face: Where will we stand? Will we stop and  extinguish the flames of racism from the White House or will we  continue to fan them?   History and our children are watching.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of our  committee for working with the minority to put together a bipartisan  piece of legislation that serves our national security purposes.   I also want to acknowledge both of the individuals for whom the bill  is named, but particularly Damon Paul Nelson, the former staff director  for the then-majority at the time, someone whom I and my colleagues saw  put his heart and soul into the committee and someone who was able to  keep many lines of communication that were necessary open during some  of our most trying times. This is a fitting recognition of his service  to our country.   As chairman of the Intelligence Modernization and Readiness  Subcommittee, I celebrate this bipartisan bill and the patriotic young  people who enter service in the intelligence community, sometimes  immediately after college, despite extraordinary student debt. For that  reason, we have included measures to enhance intelligence community- wide student loan repayment and forgiveness programs.   Reducing the financial burden on intelligence community workers helps  us recruit and retain a talented and diverse workforce to remain  competitive with the private sector. To that aim, we have also included  a measure to authorize 12 weeks of paid parental leave for intelligence  community employees in the event of a birth or adoption.   This authority would supplement the 12 weeks of unpaid leave  currently afforded to intelligence community employees and other  government personnel under existing law, sending a strong message to  the intelligence community workforce that they do not need to choose  between their career, serving our country, and their family.   These will help the intelligence community recruit and retain  individuals capable of meeting the security goals of the United States  and will set the example for other Federal agencies seeking pro-worker  policies.   Our goal on the subcommittee is to anticipate the needs of the  intelligence community workforce. Reaching across the aisle for our  intelligence community is how we will secure a next-generation  intelligence community workforce.
