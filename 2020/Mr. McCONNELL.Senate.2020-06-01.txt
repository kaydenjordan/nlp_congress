 Mr. President, this is an hour of great pain and  unrest in our country. Americans from coast to coast have been grieved  and horrified by the killings of three African-American citizens:  Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Breonna Taylor in my hometown of Louisville,  KT, and George Floyd in Minneapolis.   In each disturbing situation, investigations and reviews are ongoing.  In Kentucky, I am glad that local authorities are investigating, I am  glad the FBI is involved, and I am glad our attorney general is  committed to taking any necessary action. We need the truth, and we  need swift justice under law. But here is something that requires no  investigation: In no world whatsoever should arresting a man for an  alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a  man's neck for 9 minutes while he cries out ``I can't breathe'' and  then goes silent.   To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians, and to millions of  outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three  isolated incidents. They look more like the latest chapter in our  national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law  into facts of life for all Americans, rather than contingencies that  sometimes depend on the color of one's skin. Obviously, this struggle  remains incomplete.   I have spent decades in the Senate not only as an advocate for civil  rights but as a First Amendment purist. So I completely support and  fully defend citizens' constitutional rights to speak their minds and  engage in peaceful protests. Our Nation cannot deafen itself to the  anger, pain, or the frustration of Black Americans. Our Nation needs to  hear this.   Yet, over the last several days, citizens have watched with horror as  cities across America have convulsed with looting, riots, and  destruction. On a nightly basis, initially peaceful demonstrations have  been hijacked. Americans have watched protests dedicated to ending  unjust violence mutate into riots that inflict unjust violence  themselves. We have seen small businesses destroyed and public property  defaced. We have seen the men and women of law enforcement--the vast  majority of whom are not bad actors but brave public servants-- threatened and assaulted on our streets.   Free speech and peaceful protest are central American liberties.  Looting, rioting, assault, and arson are violent crimes that have no  place--no place--whatsoever in our society. It is not a display of  courageous citizenship to smash and destroy small businesses that had  just barely hung on through the pandemic. It is not an act of  principled protest to grab expensive merchandise or set fire to a  church. It does  [[Page S2624]]  not advance freedom or justice to vandalize the World War II Memorial  that stands for those who bled and died for exactly those values. You  do not advance peace by committing assault. You do not advance justice  by inflicting injustice upon your neighbors. You do not promote the  rule of law through anarchy. There is no constitutional right to commit  violent crime or to terrorize communities, period.   This cannot continue. It has already gone on for entirely too long. I  hope State and local authorities will work quickly to crack down on  outside agitators and domestic terrorists and restore some order to our  cities. If State and local leaders cannot or will not secure the peace  and protect citizens and their property, I hope the Federal Government  is ready to stand in the breach.   In Kentucky, we are already seeing violence and tragedy compound on  themselves. Several days ago, seven people were shot in Louisville-- none, according to the mayor, by law enforcement. Last night, one  individual was shot and killed by authorities after the police were  fired upon from within a crowd. We are learning about the incident as  fast as we can. I was just briefed by Governor Beshear today, and I  support a full and thorough and immediate investigation. But this has  to end.   These important protests began with the notion that basic physical  safety and legal protections must be non-negotiable for every single  American, bar none; that American liberty and the rule of law must be  universal truths for all, not special privileges for some. That point  is absolutely right. That is a righteous and important mission. And it  is exactly why these senseless and destructive riots need to end. Not  next week. Not tomorrow night. Right now. Right now.   We have real work to do to build constructive paths forward between  law enforcement and affected communities. More violence and destruction  is not just unfair to many innocent people, it also just makes this  important work so much harder.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, these  events only compound what has already been a historically challenging  time for our country.   As our Nation continues to combat and contain the coronavirus, the  Senate will continue to lead the response. To name one example, I hope  and anticipate the Senate will soon take up and pass legislation that  just passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 417 to 1 to further  strengthen the Paycheck Protection Program so it continues working for  small businesses that need our help.   Even as we fight the pandemic, we will remember that other challenges  face our Nation as well. Foreign adversaries are all too eager to  exploit a distracted world.   In recent days, agents of the Chinese Communist Party have taken to  social media to openly taunt--openly taunt--the United States and  defend their violent crackdown on the autonomy of Hong Kong.   It has been almost a year since the world watched Hongkongers embark  on the latest round of peaceful demonstrations against the repressive  grip of the Chinese Communist Party. The world watched as Hong Kong  voters, with American flags in hand, dealt crushing defeats to  Beijing's preferred puppet candidates in elections last fall. But in  recent weeks, as the coronavirus pandemic that China exacerbated has  dominated the world's attention, the Chinese Communist Party is trying  yet again to tighten their grip. New laws--supposedly related to  national security--aim to stifle dissent and curtail Hongkongers' civil  liberties.   When I authored the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act way back in 1992, we  wanted to ensure future Chinese regimes would respect the promises made  regarding this unique, autonomous region, so we made sure the weight  and suasion of the United States of America would stand with  Hongkongers if need be.    Unfortunately, these years later, such a time is upon us. Among other  examples, we received word today that for the first time in 30 years-- 30 years--authorities in Hong Kong will not allow the annual  candlelight vigil that commemorates the Tiananmen Square massacre to  occur. For the first time in 30 years, no commemoration of the  Tiananmen massacre will occur in Hong Kong. For three decades, Hong  Kong has been the only place in China where full-scale remembrances of  the massacre are permitted, but now they, too, will be going dark.   So I am encouraged that Secretary Pompeo is tapping into that law to  formally certify that Beijing's systemic efforts to interfere in Hong  Kong have eroded the region's autonomy. I might say this is exactly  what we were concerned about back in 1992 when the Hong Kong Policy Act  was introduced by me and became law--exactly what we feared.   I hope that the administration will soon identify the specific ways  it will impose costs on Beijing and, just as important, continue  American support for the people of Hong Kong. Under my original  legislation, several tools are available. Their primary aim is to be an  effective friend and partner for Hongkongers who share values of  democracy and freedom and to help preserve the region's unique  character, autonomy, and prosperity.   Our Nation's commitment to those efforts must remain ironclad, and it  must be 100 percent clear that the responsibility for threatening Hong  Kong's economic, political, and social climate rests solely and  squarely on the Chinese Communist Party--the regime that views free  thought as a fundamental evil; the regime that sees peaceful  demonstrations as an existential challenge. That is who is to blame for  this, no matter what the Communist Party's two-bit propaganda is trying  to claim--not the people of Hong Kong, not their friends in the United  States, just the would-be tyrants in Beijing.   Last year, as Congress passed Senator Rubio's update to my Hong Kong  Policy Act, I also secured additional funding to provide legal  protections to Hong Kong protestors and support democracy promotion  activities. But if China moves in the coming days and weeks to  implement its draconian new laws that strangle Hong Kong, there will be  no rule of law left for protesters to appeal to. That is why the U.S.  response should mirror those of other democracies that open their doors  to Hongkongers fleeing oppression. Our Nation has a rich heritage of  standing as a beacon of light and freedom, from refugees of war to  those escaping the Iron Curtain. We should exercise it again for the  people of Hong Kong.   Finally, while we address these latest aggressions, we must not miss  the broader lessons. The Communist Party of China does not play by the  rules. They don't--not the rules of the international economy; not the  rules of its bilateral agreements with other nations; not even its own  rules, which are increasingly subject to the whims of President Xi.   Whether they are cracking down on Hong Kong, trying to cover up a  pandemic, or herding ethnic and religious minorities into modern-day  gulags, this generation of Chinese leadership is telling the rest of  the world every single day exactly who they are--exactly who they are.   America and the world have watched China deepen its tyranny at home,  assert its hegemony abroad, and undermine basic norms that protect the  peace. The question before us is, What will we do to stop it?                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due a second reading, en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings, en bloc.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motions filed  on May 21 ripen at 11:45 a.m. tomorrow. I further ask unanimous consent  that if cloture is invoked on the Mercado nomination, the postcloture  time expire at 2:15 tomorrow. Further, I ask that if cloture is invoked  on the Miller nomination, the postcloture time expire at 4:30 p.m.  tomorrow. Finally, if either of the nominations are confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3846, which was introduced  earlier today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read three times and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.;  further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that following leader remarks,  the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Mercado nomination; finally, that the Senate recess following the  cloture vote on Mercado until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:20 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 2, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
