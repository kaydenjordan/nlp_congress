 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the  Republican Study Committee for hosting this important Special Order.  Our Nation's taxpayers deserve to be respected when it comes to our  Federal budget. Fiscal responsibility is vital for a stable, strong,  and long-lasting economy.   Under the current administration and Democrat control in Congress,  there are actual Federal efforts being conducted at the taxpayers'  expense to redefine gender and demonize traditional American values. We  must put a stop to this nonsense, especially on the taxpayers' dime.   I have always told my children; the government has no money except  for what they extract from the American people. The Republican Study  Committee released a counter budget to the extremely irresponsible and  radical budget that the Biden administration has put forth. This budget  would balance our Federal budget in 5 years, cut spending by $14.4  trillion over 10 years, incorporate 30-plus deregulatory legislative  proposals, and reduces taxes by $1.9 trillion.   The RSC budget will also adopt my bill, the Safety and Opportunity  for Girls Act, to protect spaces for women and girls in schools. The  bill would prevent the Title IX provisions in President Biden's  executive order--it would limit them to being biological and the  genetic definition of sex.   I support the RSC budget proposal because it treats the government's  money as its own and works to promote all the best parts in America.
