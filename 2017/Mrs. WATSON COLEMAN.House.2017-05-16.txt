 Mr. Speaker, this year, the American Society of  Civil Engineers once again gave America's infrastructure a D-plus  rating.   During Infrastructure Week, I must highlight the need for action and  investment in our Nation's infrastructure. Our roads, bridges, and  waterways are neither Republican nor Democrat; they belong to all of  us.   From the New Deal to the Federal interstate highways, infrastructure  projects have traditionally enjoyed broad bipartisan support and  leadership. Improving and maintaining our 21st century transportation  system creates access and opportunities for all, allowing for job  creation, economic growth, and fostering innovation.   As we continue to wait for the President to put forth a plan and true  efforts toward investment in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, we  bear witness to hundreds of millions of dollars in lost economic  productivity and a threat to the safety and security of our Nation.   It is time to build. It is time to invest in America.                            ____________________
