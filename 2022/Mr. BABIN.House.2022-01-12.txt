 Madam Speaker, I am prevented by House rules from using  the profanity that I would like to because I stand here absolutely  outraged. I am outraged because the Democrats have outdone themselves  with this lie. I am outraged because the Democrats have made a mockery  of bipartisan collaboration for cheap political gain. I am outraged  because Democrats have not an ounce of respect for this institution or  the rules or the consequences of their actions in this Chamber.   A few hours ago, H.R. 5746 was the NASA Enhanced Use Leasing  Extension Act, a simple three-page bill that was good for NASA, good  for our space industry, and good for our taxpayers, a bill that I was  very proud to cosponsor.   Now, in the dark of night, this bill has been hijacked and mutilated  to become the latest iteration of the Democrats' Federal takeover of  our election system--a wolf in sheep's clothing. In fact, the only  thing left from this original bill is its number.   What is worse, I can't even remove my name as a cosponsor. Isn't it  ironic that the same bill the Democrats are using as a vehicle to steal  elections in perpetuity was itself stolen? I can't say that I am  surprised. Just like with elections, if they can't do it legally,  Democrats will find a way to hijack and steal it--all of this from the  party who claims Republicans are the obstructionists. Give me a break.   Madam Speaker, I demand that my name be removed from this Trojan  horse, and I urge every single one of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
