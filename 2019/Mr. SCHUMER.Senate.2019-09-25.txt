 Mr. President, last night, Speaker Nancy Pelosi  announced that the House of Representatives would begin a formal  impeachment inquiry of President Trump. I have spoken to her many times  over the past few days. I know she did not make this decision lightly  and took no pleasure in making it. It is her carefully considered  judgment that it is now in the best interest of our country and our  Constitution to proceed with an impeachment inquiry.   I strongly support Speaker Pelosi's decision. If we don't reckon with  President Trump's persistent transgressions, the very foundation of  this great Republic will be at risk. The President kept pushing and  pushing and pushing the constitutional envelope. Finally, the  President's conduct made an impeachment inquiry unavoidable.   The events of recent days have brought sharply into focus the  question of whether President Trump abused the powers of his office and  betrayed the public trust for personal political gain. In open defiance  of the law, his administration has thus far sought to block the  transmission of an official whistleblower complaint to Congress. The  nature of that whistleblower complaint has been deemed both credible  and urgent by one of President Trump's own senior-level appointees--the  Inspector General of the Intelligence Community.   According to public reports, this complaint may detail how the  President of the United States corrupted America's foreign policy by  pressuring the leader of a foreign nation to damage a leading political  rival--an offense the President may have committed, whether or not  there was an explicit quid pro quo. The President went on to admit on  live television that he spoke to the President of Ukraine about his  political rival and about military aid to the country.   The timeline of events that led to the whistleblower complaint must  be scrutinized. The nature of President Trump's communications with  President Putin, as well as Ukrainian President Zelensky, should be  requested and provided, with special focus on the phone call that took  place with Mr. Putin a few days after the Zelensky call on July 25.   The timing of the departures of the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and  the former Director of National Intelligence and his Principal Deputy  must be investigated, as well as the movements of President Trump's  personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, the correspondence between him and  the White House, and his interactions with foreign governments. We must  learn what actions President Trump or his aides took to withhold  congressionally directed security aid to Ukraine and why and more  besides.   The answers to these questions and others can be pursued by the House  committees involved in the impeachment inquiry, and that is precisely  what the inquiry is for. The release of the transcript of one of  President Trump's calls with President Zelensky that just came out will  not assuage our concerns or the public's concerns. Based on early  reports, it may heighten them. We must remember that the President was  reported to have had several calls with President Zelensky over the  summer, and his administration has a well-earned reputation for  dishonesty, altered facts, and incomplete disclosure in public  releases.   We need to see the complete, unredacted whistleblower complaint  without further delay. The whistleblower must be allowed to testify  without fear of intimidation, and then we must pursue the many relevant  avenues of inquiry that I just described.   Yesterday afternoon, the entire Senate--all 47 Democrats and 53  Republicans--agreed to my resolution calling for the whistleblower  complaint to be transmitted immediately to Congress--a reflection of  the seriousness with which these events are viewed on both sides of the  aisle. This was unexpected. In the past, when we have asked to look  into President Trump, our Republican colleagues have stonewalled. But  to their credit, they realized the seriousness of this situation and  unanimously agreed to support our resolution. I hope, I pray it is a  harbinger of things to come, where we can look at the facts, not the  politics, and come to conclusions because, without doubt, the White  House and the President's congressional allies will rush to call this  effort a partisan witch hunt no matter how serious the allegations or  how evenhanded the inquiry. I would remind everyone that just  yesterday, every Senate Republican agreed that the White House's  decision to block the whistleblower complaint from Congress was wrong.  There was unanimous, bipartisan agreement in the Senate on that point.  Not a single Senator objected. Let me be clear, nonetheless, because I  know accusations of partisanship are already being written. This  inquiry was not taken up for partisan reasons, and it does not prejudge  an outcome.  [[Page S5676]]    Our Framers, in their wisdom, assigned to one Chamber of Congress the  right to accuse and to the other the right to judge. The House of  Representatives will investigate and determine whether sufficient  evidence exists to accuse the President of an impeachable offense or  impeachable offenses. If it comes to that, the Senate will be the scene  of the trial, Senators the jurors.   We must take our responsibility with the utmost gravity. Our  Framers--not trusting our liberty to one branch of government alone,  afraid of the ever-present danger of tyranny of an overreaching  Executive--provided a remedy to Congress should the Executive attempt  to subvert or violate the Constitution of the United States.   We are not yet at the stage where any judgments can be made one way  or the other, but I remind my colleagues today that if the day should  come when we are called upon to carry out our constitutional duty,  history will judge whether we did so faithfully or not. History will  judge if each of us acted as a solemn juror of democracy, who placed  fidelity to the Constitution and our system of government above the  narrow considerations of partisan politics.                      Declaration of National Emergency    Mr. President, on another issue, not directly related but with the  same cause, with the same worry, and with the same concern, an  overreaching Executive--the emergency declaration.   The commencing of the impeachment inquiry in the House, while  significant, is not the only significant action Congress will take  today, nor is it the only action dealing with the President's  overreach.   Today the Senate will vote on President Trump's national emergency  declaration, which he is using to steal money from our military in  order to fund a border wall. Rather than accept the reality that a  bipartisan majority has repeatedly rejected this idea, and after  dragging the country through the longest government shutdown in  American history when he didn't get his way, President Trump  deliberately circumvented Congress.   Democrats universally opposed the President's outrageous decision to  declare a national emergency, so let me direct my remarks this morning  to my Republican colleagues.   There are two crucial reasons for my Republican colleagues to vote to  terminate this emergency.   First, the vote today is the surest and likely the only way to  restore funding the President has stolen from our troops and military  projects across the country. President Trump promised Mexico would pay  for the wall, not American taxpayers, and certainly not the military-- the men and women and their families involved in keeping our Nation  secure. President Trump broke that promise, and now over 120 military  projects hang in the balance: a middle school for military families in  Kentucky, medical facilities in North Carolina, a hurricane relief  project in Florida, an Air Force Base in Colorado, a fire station in  South Carolina, and construction projects in Indiana, Louisiana,  Georgia, and more. These were all carefully considered by the military  and Department of Defense and put in the budget because they were very  much needed. These are not frivolous projects at all. A vote for the  President today is a vote in favor of cutting funding for our military  and slashing support for critical military projects in red States as  well as blue.   Second, and maybe even more importantly, my Republican colleagues  should vote to terminate the emergency declaration today on  constitutional grounds. Under the Constitution, the power of the purse  lies with Congress not the President. By declaring a national  emergency, the President has trampled on that authority and is  violating the constitutional separation of powers. We know what an  emergency is--soldiers at risk, the risk of war. Of course, the  President should have flexibility then but not on a policy decision  where there is great dispute in the Congress and in the country and  when the President lost in the legislative battle that ensued. By  voting to endorse the President's emergency--this expansive and  political stretching of the word ``emergency'' in a way it has never  been stretched before--Republican Senators will set a dangerous  precedent that could embolden not just this President but future  Presidents to ignore congressional authority.   So today my Republican colleagues face a choice of whether or not to  defend our troops, whether or not to defend their States, whether or  not to defend this Chamber's undeniable constitutional powers.   Last time we held this vote, 12 Republican colleagues joined us in  voting to undo the emergency. I hope more do so this time because this  isn't about Republicans and Democrats. We don't want any President,  Democratic or Republican, to overreach and use the word ``emergency''  to overcome congressional will. This is about checks and balances, not  about Republicans and Democrats, and the need for the Senate to rein in  an out-of-control Executive.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the Senator  from Arkansas, in this bipartisan motion to instruct.   Huawei is a menace. It is a menace to our national security. It is a  menace to our economic growth. It is a menace to the future of America  in many ways. If we are not tough with Huawei, whom are we going to be  tough with? If we are not tough with Huawei, what are we going to do  when China continues to take advantage of us in ways that are unfair-- whether it be economic, national security, cyber, or whatever.   This resolution will ensure that the conferees know that the Senate  is strongly in support of being tough with Huawei on national security  grounds, on economic grounds, and, basically, on ensuring that America  stays No. 1 in many of the leading technologies that we will need to  create job growth, wealth, and prosperity in the future.   I yield the floor.
