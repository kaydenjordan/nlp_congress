 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of reauthorizing  the Violence Against Women Act.   Congress first enacted this bipartisan law 25 years ago to unite our  Nation in the fight against domestic violence. It ushered in a new era  of protection for all Americans and continues to provide essential  support so that victims have the legal tools and resources to seek  justice and receive care.   Domestic violence is a horrific crime experienced by one out of three  women and one out of four men. We must do all we can to stop it.   Recently, I visited the WINGS domestic violence shelter on the  southwest side of Chicago, and I was joined by Chicago Police Officer  Gino Garcia. Gino was only six when his mother, a Chicago police  officer, was killed by her boyfriend. Gino was inspired to become an  officer and now works with shelters and other domestic violence  organizations.   By reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, we help  organizations like WINGS, and we empower victims and save lives. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.                            ____________________
