 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to the city of  Melvindale and the city of Dearborn Fire Department Captain Michael  Preadmore, who, today, retires after 23 years of service. He knows  safety doesn't take a day off, so he maintained a perfect attendance  record since becoming a firefighter in 1996. He has also received such  awards as the Fire Chief Life Saving Award and the department Medal of  Valor Award for his bravery in the line of duty.    Please join me in saluting Captain Preadmore in wishing him a happy  retirement.                       Honoring General Motors Workers     Mr. Speaker, today, I stand with the United Automobile  Workers by honoring General Motors workers on day 4 of their strike.   This is Grayson Riley Poland, a child of a General Motors worker. She  is only 5 years old. She periodically gets treatment for her cerebral  palsy that keeps her legs from scissoring due to her muscles tightening  up. Her next treatment, Mr. Speaker, is on October 1. Her father is on  strike right now and worried about whether or not he has healthcare  coverage anymore.   Mr. Speaker, the General Motors CEO makes $22 million, 281 times the  median income of their workers. Yet, workers are being asked to pay  more for healthcare.   General Motors workers gave up so much to keep the company afloat.  They didn't abandon GM during their toughest time, but now they are  asking for fair wages and coverage for their healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I am urging my colleagues and the country to join me in  solidarity with them today.                                time  1845
