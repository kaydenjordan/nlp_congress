 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 3981, as  amended, the Isakson-Roe Education Oversight Expansion Act.   Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I was a teacher. When I was  entrusted with the gavel as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  in 2019, one of my primary focuses was helping student veterans. Now, I  serve as ranking member. However, I am incredibly proud of what our  committee did during our 4 years in the majority.   In 2021, we passed a significant student-veteran focused law:  Representative   Mike Levin's Isakson-Roe Veterans Health Care and  Benefits Improvement Act, named for former House and Senate chairmen  Phil Roe and Johnny Isakson. That law was a massive leap forward in  education quality and oversight for student veterans.   Representative McGarvey's legislation, H.R. 3981, builds upon the  Isakson-Roe Act and further improves the system of oversight we  established in the 2021 law. Now, schools will join the process of  reporting violations, no longer waiting for State approving agencies or  VA to uncover errors before it is too late.   The legislation before us also improves transparency for the risk- based surveys created by Isakson-Roe. VA started conducting these  surveys in late 2022, but schools need to know how these surveys work  so they can better deliver for our student veterans. The legislation  improves schools' access to the risk-based survey database.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3981, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  McGarvey), my good friend, who is a member of our Subcommittee on  Economic Opportunity and also the sponsor of H.R. 3981.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 3981, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 1530, as  amended, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act.   I thank the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee  Chairman Luttrell and Ranking Member Pappas for working in a bipartisan  manner on the issues in this package. I commend Representatives  Ciscomani and McGarvey for their contributions, as well.   Madam Speaker, this bill makes several important changes that will  serve to help streamline the medical disability exam process for  veterans.   It will also help strengthen recruitment, hiring, and retention at  the Board of Veterans' Appeals by creating a new internship program for  law students and will expand the reimbursement programs for current  employees to include student loans, professional development  activities, and bar dues.   This bill will also permanently expand the number of judges appointed  to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, allowing the court to  process cases faster and grant veterans and survivors the relief they  deserve.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 1530, as amended, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend, the ranking member of the  House Veterans Affairs' Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 1530, as amended, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for S. 112, a bipartisan  bill sponsored by Senator Braun of Indiana.   This legislation aims to strengthen the Department of Veterans  Affairs' administration of an existing program that provides healthcare  benefits and compensation to children of Vietnam war veterans who were  born with spina bifida. This bill is endorsed by the Vietnam Veterans  of America.   Spina bifida is a birth defect that can cause paralysis, nerve  damage, and bowel and bladder problems. Children born with spina bifida  may receive benefits from VA if one of their biological parents is a  veteran presumed to have been exposed to herbicides such as Agent  Orange during the Vietnam war.   The program is jointly administered by the Veterans Benefits  Administration, or VBA, and the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA.  It provides a monetary allowance, healthcare coverage, and vocational  training and rehabilitation. As of 2022, fewer than 1,000 beneficiaries  were enrolled in the program.   According to a 2021 VA Office of Inspector General report examining  the VA's administration of this program, VBA and VHA were not  adequately communicating or sharing data on spina bifida program  beneficiaries. This contributed to delays in some new beneficiaries  being enrolled in healthcare and improper payments being sent to some  beneficiaries after their deaths.   The inspector general also found the VA did not consistently conduct  outreach to eligible and enrolled beneficiaries and did not provide  effective case management services for the most seriously disabled  beneficiaries. In some cases, VA's call center agents provided  inaccurate information about the spina bifida program or could not  direct callers to reliable sources of information.   S. 112 directs VA to establish an advisory council for the spina  bifida program, which would be responsible for soliciting feedback from  covered children and veterans about the program's effectiveness. This  legislation also requires VA to establish care coordination teams,  which will contact beneficiaries at least once every 180 days to ensure  they are accessing needed care. Finally, S. 112 would require VA to  report to Congress every 2 years on the number of covered children  receiving benefits, the number of children receiving care coordination,  and the outcome of the outreach conducted to these populations.   Madam Speaker, I support this important piece of legislation, and I  ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing S. 112 to strengthen  VA's benefits for children of Vietnam veterans born with spina bifida.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to express my support for S. 475, a bill to  designate the clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Gallup,  New Mexico, as the Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura VA Clinic.   This bill honors a great American from the Greatest Generation. I  thank Senator Heinrich for sponsoring this bill and Representative  Leger Fernandez for offering the House companion.   Born in Gallup, New Mexico, the son of immigrants, Mr. Miyamura  joined the Army in 1944. He was assigned to the now-storied 442nd  Regimental Combat Team, although he arrived too late in Europe to see  much action. However, his military service did not end with World War  II.   He enlisted in the Army Reserves after the war and was called into  Active Duty with the outbreak of the Korean war. He became a squad  leader in the 3rd Infantry Division.   On the night of April 24, 1951, Corporal Miyamura's unit of machine  gunners and riflemen came under attack. He killed 10 enemy soldiers  with his bayonet. He then blasted away with his machine gun, a rifle,  and grenades and wielded his bayonet again to allow his men to retreat.   He killed more than 50 of the enemy before his ammunition was  depleted and he was severely wounded. He was captured and held for 28  months as a prisoner of war until he was released in 1953 after the  armistice.   For his conduct, then-Corporal Miyamura was awarded the Congressional  Medal of Honor for his conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity. He was  awarded the medal in secret in 1951 while he was a POW, but it was  finally presented in public in 1953.   Achieving the rank of staff sergeant, Mr. Miyamura returned to New  Mexico. His dedication and patriotism continued after he returned from  South Korea to share his experiences in the war.   He also served as an integral part of the lives of veterans and  others in his community. Mr. Miyamura once said:         Until I saw that flag--the Star-Spangled Banner waving in       the breeze--did I know. I've learned what it represents. That       alone is what makes you feel so humble. So many of these       fellas who deserve it never came home to any recognition.       There are so many Americans who don't know what the medal       represents or what any soldier or servicewoman or -man does       for this country, and I believe one of these days--I hope one       of these days--they will learn of the sacrifices that a lot       of the men and women have made for this country.    Madam Speaker, let this legislation be an opportunity to let our  fellow Americans know about the service and sacrifice that came before.   Madam Speaker, I support this important piece of legislation, and I  ask my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), my very good friend who serves on the  House Rules Committee and House Committee on Natural Resources.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 475, a bill to designate the clinic of the Department of  Veterans Affairs in Gallup, New Mexico, as the Hiroshi ``Hershey''  Miyamura VA Clinic.   Let me just add that I had three great uncles who served in the  442nd, a storied Regimental Combat Team. It is always a poignant story  about their service, and I thank the chairman for offering his support  in the commemoration of their service to our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
