 Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 4,  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Madam Speaker, I have the great privilege of not only representing  Birmingham, Montgomery, and my hometown of Selma, Alabama, but growing  up, literally, at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I had an  opportunity time and time again to see John Lewis in action.   John would come to my home church, Brown Chapel AME Church, to remind  us all that what happened on that bridge 56 years ago was that  Americans, ordinary Americans, dared to stand up to this country and to  make sure that it lived up to its ideals of justice and equality for  all.    I am proud to say that I get to walk in the footsteps of John Lewis,  but I am more proud of the fact that so many of us in this Chamber  walked with him.   The best way that we can live up to the legacy of John Lewis is to  remember that he fought for every American to have the equal right to  vote, equal access to the ballot box.   I get that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is reserved for the most  egregious State actors. But what it says is that Federal oversight is  needed when States go amok.   Since the Shelby v. Holder decision, I have introduced, in four  successive Congresses, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, and we  renamed it the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   We must live up to John's ideals of equality and justice for all in  voting rights. What we have seen in States like Georgia and Texas, and  around this country, has been State legislatures making it harder for  people to vote.   I just want to say that we must get into good trouble, necessary  trouble. John reminded us that we must be courageous in the face of  adversity and in the face of inequity. I ask for you to please vote for  H.R. 4 and vote for the rule that would get it to the floor.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 4,  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Nothing is more fundamental to our democracy than the right to vote.  [[Page H4394]]  Nothing is more precious to my district, Alabama's 7th Congressional  District, the home of Birmingham, Montgomery, and my hometown of Selma,  Alabama, than the fight to protect the right to vote for all Americans.   It was in my district that ordinary Americans peacefully protested  for the equal right to vote for all Americans.   Nothing is more personal to me, nothing more represents America's  civil rights district than to be able to stand here, as so many of us  have, with John Lewis at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, as I  announced with glee that we have reintroduced H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.   It was on that same bridge in Selma, Alabama, that a 26-year-old John  Lewis was bludgeoned by State troopers with billy clubs in the name of  justice.   Their efforts led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,  the seminal piece of legislation in Congress to protect the right of  all Americans to vote.   Those protections were gutted in 2013 by the Supreme Court's decision  in Shelby v. Holder, and Section 2 was also affected by the most recent  decision in Brnovich.   Today, 8 years after Shelby, Congress is finally answering the  Supreme Court's call to action by passing H.R. 4.   H.R. 4 will create a new coverage formula to determine which States  have been the most egregious actors and subject them to preclearance  that is based on current evidence of voter discrimination.   Madam Speaker, old battles have indeed become new again. While  literacy tests and poll taxes no longer exist, certain States and local  jurisdictions have passed laws that are modern-day barriers to voting.  As long as voter suppression exists, the need for the full protections  of VRA will continue. We must fully restore the VRA.   Why? Because as John Lewis would say: When you hear something or see  something that is not right, that is not just, that is not fair, we  have a moral obligation to do something about it.   We, the Members of the House of Representatives, can today do  something about it. Let's pass H.R. 4. Let's do so not just in the name  of John Lewis; let's do so for the people, the American people. We must  secure the right to vote.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record 14 letters of support and  statements of support from all across this Nation, from civil rights  groups, from labor groups, from amazing folks who are fighting every  day on the front lines for the right to vote.                     Statement of Administration Policy      H.R. 4--John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021--Rep.                      Sewell, D-AL, and 218 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021       (VRAA).        The right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly, the       right to have your vote counted is fundamental. In the last       election, all told, more than 150 million Americans of every       age, of every race, of every background exercised their right       to vote.        This historic level of participation in the face of a once-      in-a-century pandemic should have been celebrated by       everyone. Instead, some have sought to delegitimize the       election and make it harder to vote, in many cases by       targeting the methods of voting that made it possible for       many voters to participate. These efforts violate the most       basic ideals of America.        Yet another massive wave of discriminatory action may be       imminent as we enter a new legislative redistricting cycle.       Unfortunately, incumbents too often cling to power by drawing       district lines to favor their own prospects at the expense of       minority communities, choosing their voters instead of the       other way around.        While anti-voter action undermines democracy for all       Americans, we know that communities of color often suffer the       worst effects of these measures--and all too often, that is       not by accident.        The sacred right to vote is under attack across the       country.        The VRAA will strengthen vital legal protections to ensure       that all Americans have a fair opportunity to participate in       our democracy. Among other things, it would create a new       framework for allowing DOJ to review voting changes in       jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to ensure that       they do not discriminate based on race. It would also clarify       the scope of legal tools designed to challenge discriminatory       voting laws in court, ensuring that the Voting Rights Act       offers protection against modern forms of voter suppression.        In an essay published shortly after he died, Congressman       John Lewis wrote, ``Democracy is not a state. It is an       act[.]'' This bill not only bears his name, it heeds his       call. The Administration looks forward to working with       Congress as the VRAA proceeds through the legislative process       to ensure that the bill achieves lasting reform consistent       with Congress' broad constitutional authority to protect       voting rights and to strengthen our democracy.                                   ____                                                    August 18, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Southern Poverty Law       Center Action Fund, we write to urge you to support H.R. 4,       the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, when the       House considers this essential legislation next week. When       enacted into law, this legislation will restore Section 5 of       the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) and require states and       localities with recent histories of racial discrimination to       seek federal approval before implementing any voting changes;       would require any state or jurisdiction to seek federal       approval before implementing any voting practice known to       have racially discriminatory impact; and would strengthen       Section 2 of the VRA, which gives the Department of Justice       and voters the ability to challenge discriminatory voting       laws and practices.        Through our collaborative, intersectional work with       community partners around the Deep South, the SPLC has       witnessed first-hand continued efforts to suppress the vote       and undermine the democratic process--particularly for       communities of color--since the Supreme Court's Shelby County       v. Holder decision in 2013. Earlier this week, during an       oversight hearing held by the U.S. House of Representatives       Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and       Civil Liberties on the need for federal voting rights       protection legislation, SPLC submitted a series of detailed       reports revealing current, consistent, and well-documented       racial discrimination in voting in Alabama, Louisiana, and       Mississippi for the legislative record. The reports highlight       a range of recent and persistent efforts to make it more       difficult to vote, from reducing early voting to closing       polling places in majority-Black communities and banning       Sunday voting that has the effect--and often the intent--of       blocking Black voters and other voters of color from voting.       The United States claims to be the world's oldest democracy,       but from its founding to today it has never fully secured and       defended the right to vote for all Americans, particularly       Black Americans and other voters of color.        For generations, legislators of both parties and Americans       across all ideologies have supported the VRA--because they       have understood that for our democracy to be healthy, every       voter in the country must have safe, easy, and equitable       access to their fundamental right to vote. The VRA has       extraordinary bipartisan roots. Passed in 1965, Congress has       reauthorized the VRA four times since then, with four       Republican Presidents signing the legislation into law:       President Nixon in 1970, President Ford in 1975, President       Reagan in 1982, and President George W. Bush in 2006. In       2006, after more than twenty hearings, with over 90       witnesses, and over 15,000 pages of evidence of ongoing voter       suppression and discrimination, Congress approved a 25-year       extension of the VRA by a vote of 98-0 in the Senate and 390-      33 in the House. More than ninety current Members of Congress       voted for that legislation. Yet, notwithstanding well-      documented findings and overwhelming congressional support,       just seven years later, in the Shelby County decision, a 5-4       majority of the Supreme Court held that Section 5's coverage       formula was not based on ``current conditions,'' and we lost       a critical tool in the fight for equal voting rights--the       Justice Department's opportunity to review and reject       discriminatory voting changes in jurisdictions with a history       of racial discrimination in voting.        Enactment of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement       Act will enable the federal government to once again act as a       barrier to prevent racially discriminatory voting changes and       help protect a democracy that works for all of us--no matter       where we live. Congress should utilize every legislative tool       in its capacity to get this done; democracy is too important       to be subject to a minority veto.        Last month, Justice Elena Kagan wrote eloquently about the       Voting Rights Act in her stirring dissent in another Supreme       Court refusal to recognize and enforce broad voting rights,       the deeply disappointing Brnovich v. Democratic National       Committee decision:        ``If a single statute represents the best of America, it is       the Voting Rights Act. It marries two great ideals: democracy       and racial equality . . . . If a single statute reminds us of       the worst of America, it is the Voting Rights Act. Because it       was--and remains--so necessary.''        We could not agree more.        In the wake of Supreme Court decisions that have       significantly weakened the VRA, and a proliferation of state       anti-voter laws--primarily in the South--Congress must act to       restore the Voting Rights Act to its full vigor and promise       and ensure that citizens in every state have broad       opportunities to exercise their constitutional right to vote.            Respectfully,      LaShawn Y. Warren,        Chief Policy Officer.      Nancy Abudu,        Interim Director of Strategic Litigation  [[Page H4395]]       & Deputy Legal Director for Voting Rights.                                   ____                                                    August 23, 2021.        Friends: This week, the House is scheduled to take up the       FY22 Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 14) and the John Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4), as well as the rule       to consider these bills. The Human Rights Campaign urges       Members to vote in favor of the rule, the budget resolution,       and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. We will       consider these key votes.        The FY22 Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 14) will pave the       way for reconciliation. The provisions of that package will       include paid leave, a long-needed benefit particularly for       the 40% LGBTQ+ adults working in restaurants and food       service, who often lack the ability to take leave care for a       family member. It will also provide a pathway to citizenship       for the approximately 75,000 LGBTQ+ Dreamers living in the       United States, as well as the millions of TPS holders, many       of whom are essential workers that have helped keep our       country running during the pandemic.        The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4) would       restore key voting rights protections that the Supreme Court       gutted in the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision. Since       the Supreme Court's decision, states and localities have       brazenly pushed forward discriminatory changes to voting       practices, such as changing district boundaries to       disadvantage select voters, instituting more onerous voter       identification laws, and changing polling locations with       little notice. These laws especially disenfranchise people of       color, the elderly, low-income people, transgender people and       people with disabilities.        Transgender people are particularly vulnerable to voting       discrimination and disenfranchisement due primarily to       challenges around valid identification documents. Many       transgender people do not have forms of ID that reflect their       true gender identity, either because they are in the process       of changing their documents or because they face financial or       legal barriers to doing so. In addition, many LGBTQ+ people       face compounded discrimination based on other       characteristics, including race, age, disability, and       economic status. These vulnerabilities weaken our entire       community's voting power.        Again, we urge Members to vote in favor of the rule, S.       Con. Res. 14, and H.R. 4.            Best,                                                    David Stacy,                                        Government Affairs Director,      Human Rights Campaign.                                   ____         Hi Hillary: J Street, along with over 100 other       organizations, is proud to share our support for the newly       reintroduced John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021       (H.R. 4). The bill would restore the preclearance protections       stripped from the Voting Rights Act and strengthen voting       rights across the country.        With voting rights under threat, the passage of H.R. 4       would be a critical step toward protecting the future of our       democracy and functioning governance.        J Street urges both co-sponsorship and a YES vote when the       bill comes to the floor next week.        As always, please do not hesitate to let me know if you       have any questions.            All the best,                                                  Hannah Morris,                              Deputy Director of Government Affairs,      J Street.                                   ____                                           Tuesday, August 17, 2021.      LDF Media      For Immediate Release    LDF Issues Statement on Introduction of H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting        Rights Advancement Act, by the U.S. House of Representatives         Today, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced H.R. 4,       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a much needed       piece of legislation aimed at protecting the right to vote.       In response, Sherrilyn Ifill, President and Director-Counsel       of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF)       issued the following statement:        ``We commend the House of Representatives for taking this       critically important step in protecting the right to vote       with its introduction today of the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act, H.R. 4. This legislation provides the       building blocks for Congress to fully engage in its duty to       protect citizens from any efforts to restrict or abridge       their most fundamental right--the right to vote.        ``H.R. 4 includes provisions that would require states and       localities with recent records of discrimination in voting to       have their proposed voting changes reviewed before they are       implemented to ensure they are not discriminatory. These       provisions are crucial to ensure that people are not       disenfranchised and able to freely participate in the       political process. If these provisions had been in effect       this year--as was the case prior to the Shelby County       decision--the restrictive voting bills that were recently       enacted in states, such as Georgia, Florida, and Arizona,       would not have been able to go into effect unless and until       the states proved that those laws would not discriminate       against racial, ethnic, or language minorities.        ``Time is of the essence. Today's introduction of H.R. 4 is       the beginning of the process that ultimately must end in the       passage of this critically important piece of legislation.       With the fall election season nearly upon us and nation-wide       midterm elections a year away, Congress must ensure that       every voter--especially Black voters and other voters of       color--can exercise their right to participate in the       political process without barriers to having their votes cast       and counted.''                                   ____                                                    August 20, 2021.        Dear Representative: As President and CEO of the National       Urban League, and on behalf of its 91 affiliates in 37 states       and the District of Columbia, I am writing to express our       strong support for H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act as it is considered on the House floor this       week. As a historic civil rights organization dedicated to       ensuring that all people are able to exercise their       fundamental right to vote, we stand with our fellow racial       justice organizations in supporting this bill.        The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act reauthorizes       the Voting Rights Act, while putting in place ``fixes'' in       response to the Shelby County v. Holder (2013) and Brnovich       v. Democratic National Committee (2021) decisions. After the       Shelby County decision, the number of discriminatory voting       laws and practices have drastically increased across the       country. The bill is in response to the current needs of this       nation in the fight for voting rights, which have been       presented in months-long congressional investigations and       hearings. The Voting Rights Act has a long history of       bipartisan support that must continue to prevent future       inequitable bills and manipulative redistricting efforts from       discriminating against voters of color.        Specifically, this legislation updates the ``preclearance       formula'' that blocks discriminatory voting laws from being       implemented by establishing a new review criterion that       accounts for current conditions and requires federal review       of specific voting practices known to impact voters of color.       Additionally, the bill mandates greater nationwide       transparency of voting laws and policy changes, expands and       updates the frameworks that allow courts to ``bail in'' and       ``bail out'' judicial review of jurisdictional practices, and       restores voters' ability to legally challenge racially       discriminatory changes in voting laws and policies. Lastly,       the bill allows the Justice Department to compel documents to       investigate voting rights violations, expands the federal       observer program, and pauses discriminatory voting changes       during judicial review.        This bill is a concrete way to advance the nation's fight       against discriminatory voting laws which specifically target       people of color. We will continue to support the John Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Act and other proposals that       advance the fight for the rights, safety, and empowerment of       all people in our nation.

Sincerely,                                                 Marc H. Morial,                              President and Chief Executive Officer,      National Urban League.                                   ____             Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act   The bill would restore crucial protections that have been removed from                       the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         On Tuesday afternoon, Democratic lawmakers stood on       consecrated ground--the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in       Selma, Alabama.        The members of Congress weren't there simply to honor the       sacrifices of the late civil rights icon John Lewis and the       hundreds of other marchers who braved police tear gas and       clubs for the right to vote, as they've done in the past.       They were gathered to announce the introduction of the John       R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H. R. 4),       transformative legislation that would restore the protections       of the Voting Rights Act that Lewis fought so hard to enact       as a civil rights activist.        In 2013, the Supreme Court's infamous Shelby County v.       Holder decision invalidated the 1965 law's Section 5       ``preclearance'' requirements. which prevented jurisdictions       with a history of racial discrimination from changing voting       rules without permission from the Justice Department or a       federal court. In the ruling gutting the landmark civil       rights law, Chief Justice John Roberts waved away concerns of       new voting restrictions, claiming that ``nearly 50 years       later, things have changed dramatically.''        Unfortunately, things have changed dramatically--just not       how Roberts thought.        The danger of new voting restrictions is no longer       theoretical. It's a grim reality. After record voter turnout       in 2020, Republican state legislators around the country have       responded by cracking down on the right to vote. Brennan       Center research shows that this year, 49 states have       introduced over 400 bills with provisions that make it harder       to vote, 30 of which have become law in 18 states. Just last       month, the Supreme Court's decision in Brnovich v. Democratic       National Committee weakened Section 2 of the Voting Rights       Act, degrading citizens' ability to challenge policies that       lead to voting discrimination.  [[Page H4396]]         This all paints a bleak picture as the nation's first       redistricting cycle since the Shelby County decision looms,       potentially redefining the balance of power in Congress and       state legislatures for the next decade.        As my colleague Wendy Weiser told Congress yesterday, the       bill named for Lewis is an essential step in turning the tide       in this war on voting rights. Restoring preclearance and       strengthening Section 2 of the original Voting Rights Act       would undo much of the damage from the Brnovich and the       Shelby County rulings.        President Biden has placed his full support behind it, and       his Justice Department has told Congress that the bill must       be passed so that the federal government can properly protect       Americans' voting rights nationwide as the midterms quickly       approach. The legislation would provide a desperately needed       bulwark against continuing state voter suppression efforts.        Congress must pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act without delay.                                   ____       Re: NHLA Urges Support of the John Lewis Voting Rights           Advancement Act, H.R. 4       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the National       Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of the       nation's leading Latino nonpartisan civil rights and advocacy       organizations, to urge you to vote ``yes'' on the John Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 (VRAA), H.R. 4. This       legislation restores necessary voting protections to ensure       that discriminatory voting-related changes are blocked before       they are implemented. There is no right more fundamental to       our democracy than the right to vote, and for more than 50       years the Voting Rights Act (VRA) provided voters with one of       the most effective mechanisms for protecting that right. H.R.       4 would provide Latino voters and other voters of color new       and forward-looking protections against voter discrimination.       NHLA will closely monitor all votes related to this       legislation for inclusion in future NHLA scorecards       evaluating Member support for the Latino community.        The VRA is regarded as one of the most important and       effective pieces of civil rights legislation in our country's       history because it protected voters of color from       discriminatory voting practices before they occurred. In       2013, the Supreme Court, in its decision in Shelby County v.       Holder, struck down the formula that determined which states       and political subdivisions were required to seek federal pre-      approval of their voting-related changes to ensure they did       not discriminate against minority voters. After Supreme       Court's decision, states or political subdivisions were no       longer required to seek preclearance unless ordered by a       federal court in the course of litigation. The Supreme Court       put the onus on Congress to enact a new formula better       tailored to current conditions.        H.R. 4 includes both a new geographic coverage formula to       identify those jurisdictions that will have to ``preclear''       their voting-related changes and a new provision requiring       practice-based preclearance, or ``known-practices coverage.''       Known-practices coverage would focus administrative or       judicial review narrowly on suspect practices that are most       likely to be tainted by discriminatory intent or to have       discriminatory effects, as demonstrated by a broad historical       record. Any jurisdiction in the U.S. that is home to a       racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse population       and that seeks to adopt a covered practice will be required       to preclear the change before implementation. The known       practices covered under the bill include: (1) changes in       method of election to change a single-member district to an       at-large seat or to add an at-large seat to a governing body;       (2) certain redistricting plans where there is significant       minority population growth in the previous decade; (3)       annexations or deannexations that would significantly alter       the composition of the jurisdiction's electorate; (4) certain       identification and proof of citizenship requirements; (5)       certain polling place closures, realignments, or efforts to       deny sustenance to voters waiting in line; (6) the withdrawal       of multilingual materials and assistance not matched by the       reduction of those services in English; and (7) certain voter       registration list maintenance changes. Preclearance is an       efficient and effective form of alternative dispute       resolution that prevents the implementation of voting-related       changes that would deny voters of color a voice in our       elections. Preclearance saves taxpayers in covered       jurisdictions a considerable amount of money because the       jurisdiction can obtain quick decisions without having to pay       attorneys. expert witnesses, or prevailing plaintiffs fees       and costs that are incurred in complex and expensive       litigation.        Across the U.S., racial, ethnic, and language-minority       communities are rapidly growing-the country's total       population is projected to become majority-minority by 2044.       Between 2007 and 2014, five of the ten U.S. counties with the       most rapid rates of Latino population growth were in North       Dakota or South Dakota, two states whose overall Latino       populations still account for less than ten percent of their       residents, and are dwarfed by Latino communities in states       like New Mexico, Texas, and California. It is precisely this       rapid growth of different racial or ethnic populations that       results in the perception that emerging communities of color       are a threat to those in political power. H.R. 4 identifies       different voting changes most likely to discriminatorily       affect access to the vote in increasingly diverse       jurisdictions whose minority populations are attaining       visibility and influence. The approach is tailored to the       current needs of voters today and is supported by a large       body of evidence that shows that certain practices are used       routinely to discriminate against voters of color.        Congress must protect the access to the polls, and it must       include a known-practices coverage formula. H.R. 4 is a       critical piece of legislation, including to the Latino       community, that will restore voter protections that were lost       after the Shelby County decision. NHLA urges you to stand       with voters and to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.        Please feel free to contact Andrea Senteno, of MALDEF, at       [email protected] or        (202) 293-2828 with any questions.            Sincerely,      Thomas A. Saenz,        NHLA Civil Rights Committee, Co-Chair MALDEF, President &       General Counsel.      Juan Cartagena,        NHLA Civil Rights Committee, Co-Chair LatinoJustice PRLDEF,       President & General Counsel.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, August 23, 2021.        Re: MALDEF Support for the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act of 2021, H.R. 4        Dear Congressmember: On behalf of MALDEF (Mexican American       Legal Defense and Educational Fund), I write to strongly urge       you to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act       of 2021, H.R. 4. Following the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder       decision, which effectively ended pre-clearance review under       Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), states and       localities moved to implement discriminatory voting practices       that would previously have been blocked by the VRA. What we       have seen post-Shelby County confirms what we have long-      known--that voter discrimination lives on. Congress must act       to restore the pre-clearance coverage formula in the VRA,       legislation that has long-enjoyed bipartisan support.        Founded in 1968, MALDEF is the nation's leading Latino       legal civil rights organization. Commonly known as the ``law       firm of the Latino community,'' MALDEF promotes social change       in the areas of voting rights, immigrants' rights, education,       employment, and access to justice. Since its founding, MALDEF       has worked diligently to secure equal voting rights for       Latinos and to promote increased civic engagement and       participation within the Latino community. MALDEF played a       leading role in securing the full protection of the VRA for       the Latino community through the 1975 congressional       reauthorization of the 1965 VRA. In court, MALDEF has, over       the years, litigated numerous cases under Section 2, Section       5, and Section 203 of the VRA, challenging at-large systems,       discriminatory redistricting, ballot access barriers, undue       voter registration requirements, voter assistance       restrictions, and failure to provide bilingual ballot       materials.        Discrimination in voting, including against Latino voters,       continues to be a serious and persistent threat to our       democracy today. This is demonstrated in the comparative       rates of voter registration and voter participation among       racial groups, including Latinos. The 2020 presidential       general election showed unprecedented numbers of voters       participating and rates of eligible participation unseen in a       century, but instead of celebrating this work to reduce voter       suppression and continue a trend toward expanding the       franchise, the election has been used to justify increased       efforts to reduce minority voter participation in future       elections. This is a continuation of a recent pattern of       increasing voter suppression efforts, which stems from       ongoing demographic changes, including in particular the       unprecedented growth of the Latino voting community.        In the aftermath of Shelby County, MALDEF originated the       idea of practice-based pre-clearance coverage as a limited       complement to a geographic, history-based formula for broader       pre-clearance coverage. Practice-based coverage would address       the increasing introduction and enactment of voter       suppression measures precisely in response to the growth of       the local Latino community to a level viewed as a threat to       the political establishment. Practice-based pre-clearance       would focus administrative or judicial review narrowly on       suspect practices that are most likely to be tainted by       discriminatory intent or to have discriminatory effects, as       demonstrated by a broad historical record. This coverage       would extend to any jurisdiction in the U.S. that is home to       a racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse population       and that seeks to adopt a covered practice, despite that       practice's known likelihood of being discriminatory when used       in a diverse population.        While litigation, by private parties and by the Department       of Justice, under Section 2 of the VRA remains a powerful       means to stop voter suppression, such litigation is not       sufficient to address all the current and future potential       for elections changes tied to voter suppression. Pre-      clearance review benefits jurisdictions by reducing their       costs in  [[Page H4397]]       defending potential elections changes, and benefits voting       rights by yielding more timely resolution of voting rights       disputes.        Congress must protect access to the polls and pass H.R. 4,       including provisions for practice-based preclearance. This       legislation is critical to restore voter protections that       were lost due to Shelby County. We cannot allow any more time       to pass without ensuring that every voter can register and       cast a meaningful ballot. MALDEF urges you to stand with all       voters and to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.        Thank you for your time and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                 Andrea Senteno,       Regional Counsel.                                   ____                                                    August 24, 2021.        Dear Representative: Democracy 21 strongly urges you to       vote for passage of H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act, when it comes to the floor for a vote.        H.R. 4 is a vitally important--and urgently needed--step       forward in the work to protect the sacred right to vote for       all eligible citizens.        Today, millions of Black, brown, other minorities, the       disabled, elderly, and young, are at risk of losing their       ability to vote due to voter suppression laws being passed in       numerous states.        These efforts, if not overridden, will represent the       greatest voter suppression in the United States since the Jim       Crow era.        H.R. 4 will restore the preclearance provision of the       Voting Rights Act of 1965 and would modernize the formula for       determining which states have a pattern of discrimination and       would fall under the preclearance provision.        Voting is not a privilege, it is a right. It is incumbent       that Congress act now as the right to vote is being severely       threatened in states around the country.        The passage of H.R. 4 and H.R. 1, the For the People Act,       which the House passed in March, are essential if we are to       protect the right to vote in federal elections for all       eligible citizens. The two bills protect the right to vote in       complementary ways and both must be enacted.        ``The vote is precious. It is almost sacred,'' the late       Representative John Lewis, the civil rights champion, once       said. ``It is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a       democracy.''        Democracy 21 strongly urges you to vote for H.R. 4.        Our democracy deserves nothing less.            Sincerely,                                                Fred Wertheimer,       President.                                   ____                                                    August 17, 2021.   End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund Statement on the        Introduction of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act    End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund President Tiffany   Muller released the following statement on the U.S. House introducing               the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act:         ``In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the landmark       Voting Rights Act of 1965 during a critical moment in our       nation when Jim Crow laws were being used to prevent Black       Americans from exercising their fundamental right to vote.       Since then, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted by a right-      wing Supreme Court and partisan Republican-led legislatures       have moved once again to take away that right. We've seen 400       bills introduced nationwide that include restrictive voting       proposals with 30 of these bills becoming law in 18 states       just this year alone.        ``The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act is a       fundamental step in protecting our freedom to vote by fully       restoring the power of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and       ensuring that any changes to voting rules could not       discriminate against voters based on race and that we all       have an equal voice in our democracy.        ``From his historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge,       to his decades of fighting for voting rights and social       justice, Congressman John Lewis never gave up in the pursuit       of America adhering to its core values and principles--that       every American citizen should be heard and have a voice.       Congress must honor his legacy by passing the John Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act to       protect access to the ballot and ensure that our democracy is       truly representative of the American people.''                                   ____         Dear Hillary: As you prepare to consider H.R. 4, the John       Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, Foreign Policy for       America encourages you to uphold the principles of democracy       and efforts to protect the right to vote. Foreign Policy for       America urges members of the House of Representatives to       support H.R. 4 to restore democracy and safeguard the right       to vote. We will consider scoring final passage in our 117th       Congressional Scorecard.        Foreign Policy for America (FP4A) is a non-partisan 501c4       organization founded to promote principled American       engagement in the world. Each Congress, we convene a group of       experts from across the foreign policy community to advise on       the development of our Policy Agenda and our biennial       Congressional Scorecard. The FP4A Scorecard offers our       members, concerned voters nationwide, and the media a way to       quickly and easily understand the degree to which Members of       Congress support strong, principled American foreign policy.        America's commitment to pluralism, equality, and non-      partisan election administration are the hallmarks of our       democracy and have inspired transitions to democracy in every       region of the world. The United States is able to rally       allies and mobilize action on the biggest global challenges       because of who we are as a pluralistic, democratic country       that for generations has inspired the world. H.R. 4 is needed       to safeguard our democracy--the beating heart of our       prosperity and strength.        Our democracy is at risk today. The John Lewis Voting       Rights Advancement Act restores and expands key ballot access       provisions enshrined in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that       were dramatically weakened by 2013 Supreme Court decision in       Shelby County v. Holder. The right to vote is one of the most       critical pillars of American Democracy. We must protect it.        We urge all Members of the House of Representatives to       support the John Lewis Voting Rights Act (H.R. 4) to help       strengthen our democracy and protect the right to vote.        Please don't hesitate to reach out if we can answer any       questions about our position.            Sincerely,                                              Cassandra Varanka,                                                  Advocacy Director,      Foreign Policy for America.                                   ____    Civil Rights Groups Tell Congress To Pass John R. Lewis Voting Rights                            Advancement Act Now         Washington, D.C.--Today at 1pm ET, standing on the Edmund       Pettus Bridge, Rep. Terri Sewell will introduce H.R. 4, the       John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill to       restore the pre-clearance protections stripped from the       Voting Rights Act, and strengthen voting rights across the       country. The bill is expected to be voted on in the House       next week.        Stephany Spaulding, Just Democracy Spokesperson and Founder       of Truth and Conciliation, issued the following statement:        ``H.R. 4 is essential legislation to ensure that the over       400 state-level voter suppression laws proposed around the       country will be countered by federal law. But this bill can       only stop the bleeding--it cannot repeal the dangerous       suppression laws already passed in Georgia, Florida, and       more. We need Congress to take comprehensive action to       protect our country's voting rights and pass the For the       People Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and the       Washington, D.C. Admissions Act--and we have to eliminate the       Jim Crow filibuster to get it done.        This fight for voting rights won't be easy, but it is an       existential turning point for the fate of our democracy--      that's why we're marching in cities around the country in the       March On for Voting Rights on August 28, to raise our voices       and demand Congress take action. We're marching in the spirit       of Congressman John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa       Parks, and countless civil rights leaders who never gave up       on the fight for voting rights--and neither will we.''

March On for Voting Rights Responds to John Lewis Voting Rights                 Advancement Act Introduction in the House     Martin Luther King III, Arndrea Waters King, Rev. Al Sharpton, Andi   Pringle and other voting rights leaders organize mass mobilization to             pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act         Washington, D.C.--Today, standing on the Edmund Pettus       Bridge, Congresswoman Terri Sewell (D-AL) introduced the John       Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will restore       critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act gutted by the       Supreme Court. Expected to receive a vote in the House of       Representatives next week, the bill will help stem the rush       of attacks on voting rights across the country by ensuring       that states with a recent history of voter discrimination are       once again subject to federal oversight.        March On for Voting Rights will call on the Senate to pass       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the       People Act on Saturday, August 28, when millions join the       March On for Voting Rights in D.C., Phoenix, Atlanta,       Houston, Miami and more than 40 other cities across the       country to make their voices heard. Marchers will also call       for the Senate to remove the filibuster as a roadblock to       critical voting rights legislation.        Rev. Al Sharpton, President and Founder of National Action       Network, commented in response: ``If you want to understand       why the vote is so important, look at the last 4 years, the       last 10 years, and the last 100 years. Freedom fighter and       Congressman John Lewis knew it was essential that every vote       must count in order to assure every voice is represented, but       unfortunately  [[Page H4398]]       through federal voter suppression and gerrymandering, that       hasn't been the case. Today, Members of Congress continue to       fight for the rights of the voiceless with the introduction       of H.R. 4, the first step to right the wrongs done to the       Voting Rights Act and reassert our Constitutional authority       over democracy. Whether in Congress, in the streets, or       during our March On for Voting Rights, this is the summer of       activism.''        Martin Luther King III, Chairman of the Drum Major       Institute, commented in response: ``Both John Lewis and my       father agreed that there is no right more central to       democracy than our right to vote. It is the cornerstone of       democracy, the way we have our voices heard. Congress must       pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Restoration Act. Our nation       is being put to the test, and we must remember my father's       words about the fierce urgency of now.        Arndrea Waters King, President of the Drum Major Institute,       commented in response: ``Coretta Scott King told us, `Freedom       is never really won, you earn it and win it in every       generation.' Now is the time to earn and win our sacred right       to vote. It is up to us to remind Congress they represent the       people, and the people demand the passage of the John Lewis       Voting Rights Restoration Act.''        Andi Pringle, Political and Strategic Campaigns Director at       March On, commented in response: ``Voting rights in America       hang by a thread, and we are grateful to our leaders in       Congress who understand the gravity of this moment. But some       of those in Congress act as though voting rights are       debatable. They are not--voting rights are a fundamental       requirement of democracy. Without legislation like the John       R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People       Act to protect both voters and elections, millions will be       disenfranchised and America will cease to be the democracy we       claim to be. This is why millions will take to the streets on       August 28 to demand passage of this legislation before it's       too late.''        Stasha Rhodes, Campaign Manager of 51 for 51, commented in       response: ``We are resolved to march on August 28 to make       sure Congress does everything in its power to pass the John       Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the For the People Act       and the Washington D.C. Admissions Act. We can no longer       allow states with long histories of disenfranchising our       communities to strip away voting rights for Black and Brown       people. After it passes the House, the Senate must remove the       Jim Crow filibuster as a roadblock. Millions will march to       make that call crystal clear.''        Sopia Woodrow, Community Manager of Future Coalition       commented in response: ``As a young advocate, it is       fundamental that our voting rights be protected. This act,       combined with the action imminent with March On For Voting       Rights, demonstrates a renewed commitment to protecting the       voices of every American. Congress must pass the John Lewis       Voting Rights Act to ensure the voices of Americans and youth       for generations to come are heard. Disenfranchised       communities have waited far too long for the voting rights       necessary to justice.''    Madam Speaker, in conclusion, I want to thank the  chairman of this committee, Chairman Nadler; the chairman of the  subcommittee,   Steve Cohen; the chairwoman of the House Administration  Committee, Representative Zoe Lofgren; as well as G.K. Butterfield, for  the countless hours of testimony and the reams of documents that show  that voter suppression is still alive and well.   The price of freedom is not free. Let's pay for it by passing the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
