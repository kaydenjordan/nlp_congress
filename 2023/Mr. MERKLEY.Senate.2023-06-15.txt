 Mr. President, I want to share the perspective of  individual Senators who, at various moments, are extremely stressed  over getting their amendment considered or how to deal with a  particular issue that is coming up. There have been moments, for  example, not too far back into last year, when I really wanted an  amendment up and was asking Trish, how do I do this? How do I position  this to get this done? And I know that many of us, when we are trying  to do something we consider important or are concerned about something  happening that is detrimental, our emotions are high. Every time that I  have been in that position, you have been a calm and steady presence  facilitating our efforts--maybe raising an eyebrow now and then about  whether this was the right moment or the right process but giving sound  guidance and taking our levels of anxiety and stress down a few notches  and helping us get the job done.   So all of us who, in moments--critical moments--have come to you and  asked for your help and your insight on how to proceed, thank you for  being a wise and sober and calming counsel to us. And I wish you all  the best in your next chapter.
