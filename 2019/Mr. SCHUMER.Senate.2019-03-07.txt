 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for all of the Senate's vaunted  traditions about grand debates, we very rarely practice the actual  art--the real back and forth, the exchange of ideas. For weeks now, we  have heard our Republican colleagues come to the floor and rail against  the Green New Deal, as the leader just did. Democrats have simply been  trying to get a few honest answers out of the Republican leadership  about their position on climate change so that we might have a real  debate.   Yesterday, as Republican after Republican lined up to give speeches  against taking bold action on climate change, several Democrats tried  to steer the conversation in a more positive direction by asking our  Republican colleagues simple questions--and I ask this again of every  Republican, particularly of Leader McConnell: Do you, Leader McConnell,  and our Republican friends believe climate change is real? Yes or no?  Do you believe that climate change is caused by human activity? Yes or  no? Most importantly, do you believe Congress should do something about  it? Yes or no?   If our colleagues believe it is a problem and agree to that, what is  their plan to deal with climate change? We know they don't like the  Green New Deal. They have made that clear. It doesn't forward the  debate. But what is their plan?   We might have ruffled some feathers on the other side. I think my  colleagues just wanted to give speeches on the Green New Deal and then  leave the floor. It is a sad state of affairs when even a little  debate, even heated debate, is something unsettling here in the Senate.  But I have to give credit to the few Republicans who did engage us.  [[Page S1719]]    A few said they did believe in climate change and offered some  examples of minor legislation where our parties could work together to  begin tackling this crisis. I give them credit for that. But here is  the problem: When is Leader McConnell going to schedule time for  consideration of this and other climate change legislation? We  Democrats are ready to work. Will Leader McConnell bring his own  Members' clean energy legislation to the floor?   Others have said that climate change is happening, but the free  market could take care of it through ``innovation.'' With all due  respect, that doesn't mean much. Most of us would agree we live in an  incredible time of innovation and technology, yet we continue to pour  even more carbon into the atmosphere than in previous years, not less.  Left alone, the market has proved incapable of curing climate change  for the simple reason of what economists call externalities. You run a  coal plant; you make the profits from selling the electricity that the  coal plant produces, but you don't pay the price for the carbon you put  in the air. So it is not going to happen through the free market alone  because of what even Adam Smith recognized: There are externalities  that have to be captured, and it is government's job to at least make  sure they are captured.   Another block of Republicans took a different tack. A few of our  Republican colleagues said yesterday that climate change was real but  only because the climate has always been changing and all flora and  fauna contribute to it. ``What are we to do,'' they say, as they throw  up their hands and look to the sky, ``ban volcanoes?''   Unbelievable. What an amazing canard that is. Those who said it--and  there were a few right here yesterday--would get an F in middle school  Earth science with that kind of reasoning. We all know--at least we all  ought to know--that human activity, particularly the burning of fossil  fuels, has pushed the amount of carbon in our atmosphere to record  levels, trapping more heat than ever before and changing the climate in  ways not seen before in our history.   Maybe denying or misleading about climate change is considered  acceptable in the modern Republican Party, where it has come to be  expected, and we wonder why that is so. Some argue it is because people  don't believe in science. Some argue it is because they just are stuck  in the status quo. And some argue it is because there is a lot of oil  money cascading into the Republican Party, when you read about all  these multimillionaire and billionaire new oil magnates who send tons  of money there. Some argue that. You can't prove which one is true, but  we do know it leads to terrible, terrible inaction.   So I would like to see my colleagues who don't admit the severity of  climate change go talk to the farmers in Iowa dealing with drought, the  fishermen in Alaska and North Carolina, the homeowners in Florida and  the Mountain West. See if denying recent climate change works there. It  sure doesn't work on the south coast of Long Island, where we had  Sandy, which made believers out of many who were skeptical in the past.   Nonetheless, we made some progress yesterday. At the very least, my  friends on the other side know they will not able to execute their  standard playbook. Democrats are not going to sit around while  Republicans come to the floor and yell about socialism as they have the  past two decades. We are going to make Republicans answer core  questions about real change. That is what America wants.   One of the reasons all of these scare tactics didn't work in 2018 and  the House is now Democratic and we kept most of our seats, even in very  red States--I suspect many of my more reasonable colleagues would  prefer that--a real debate--over ``gotcha'' politics that Leader  McConnell is so adept at playing and is playing once again with this  cynical Green New Deal ploy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, voting rights, today  marks the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the protest march in  Selma, AL, that led ultimately to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.   It was one of the most noble acts in American history. The courage of  those who marched across that bridge, including our colleague,   John  Lewis, will be remembered centuries from now. It is a reminder that one  thread of the American story is about how, despite our founding, our  democratic principles, there has been a long march toward achieving the  franchise.   We had democratic principles in the beginning. It was brand new. It  was great, but remember, in 1789, in almost every State, the only  people who could vote were White, male, Protestant property owners. I  would imagine that would probably leave out even a majority in this  Chamber who would be able to vote.   We have to keep improving that democracy. No one says we should only  have White, male, Protestant property owners vote today because it was  true in 1789. We have to move forward. We have to make voting more  available and easier because the right to vote, without barriers, is  what our soldiers, for centuries, have died for and what the people on  that bridge marched for.   The march is still not over. In the wake of the disaster that was the  Supreme Court's Shelby decision, 19 States rushed to pass  discriminatory voter restrictions.   In North Carolina, the Republican State legislature drew up laws that  ``targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' How  despicable. How despicable that the Republican legislature did that.  Those are not my words; those are the court's words after looking at  the evidence.   Fifty million Americans are now not registered to vote. Even though  we don't talk about it enough, we have a population larger than two  States living here in Washington, DC, without full congressional  representation. We Democrats are ready to work.   Again, Leader McConnell gets up, and he talks about all of this  negativity, exaggeration, hyping, and scaring just like Donald Trump.  Why doesn't Leader McConnell put some legislation on the floor? Today,  on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I want to mention three things we  could do right now to bolster voting rights: one, undo the damage of  the Shelby County decision by restoring the formula for preclearance;  two, automatic voter registration; three, DC statehood.   Anyone who has been observing the floor of the Senate will have  noticed by now just how vociferously our Republican leader opposes H.R.  1, which, among other things, would make election day a Federal holiday  and attempt to get Big Money out of politics. Leader McConnell has gone  on to call these ideas a power grab, labeling the bill the Democratic  politician protection Act.   Leader McConnell, we are proud that we want more people to vote. Why  are you ashamed of it? Why do you run away from it?   Leader McConnell, we are proud that we want to get the influence of  big, special interest money out of politics. Why do you say that is  partisan? It is the wrong thing to do, and 90 percent of all Americans,  Democratic and Republican, don't like to see Big Money cascading into  politics. Argue the merits, Leader.   When you think doing those things are democratic things, we are  proud, and the Republican Party should be ashamed that they are not for  them and have to call them names. To say that allowing more Americans  to vote and getting Big Money out of politics is bad for Republicans  and good for Democrats, that says a lot right there.   It is a dark day--a dark day--for the Republican Party if their  leader in the Senate has to argue against more Americans voting because  it would hurt their party at the polls. Maybe we should go back to the  old days and have fewer people vote, like in 1789, when only White,  male, Protestant property owners could vote. Come on. This idea that  having more people vote is a Democratic power grab, when it is part of  the fundamental root of our democracy--it is an act of desperation by  the Republican leader.   I don't think it is a coincidence that the Republican leader has  pledged to bring up his version of the Green New Deal for a vote but  not H.R. 1. He is happy to twist words against it himself, but he knows  voting rights are a hard thing to argue about.   If he wants to try to bring it up on the floor, we welcome it. We  welcome a  [[Page S1720]]  discussion. Make no mistake, Democrats are going to fight to make the  ballot access easier, challenge all attempts to disenfranchise American  citizens, and get the influence of big special interest money out of  politics.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on China, news reports continue  to suggest that President Trump is close to cementing an agreement with  Beijing that, unfortunately for America and for American workers, would  fall far right of expectations.   Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that China is drafting  new laws on foreign investments to pacify the United States, but those  new laws do not include any changes to how China forces American  businesses to transfer technology and know-how as the cost of doing  business.   If our best companies were allowed to sell to China unfettered, they  would have huge amounts of profit, and they would employ huge amounts  of people in America more. China doesn't let that happen, but they can  sell freely here.   The President was right to target China. The President was right to  impose tariffs on China. The President will have taken defeat out of  the jaws of an almost victory if he now backs off for the sake of a  photo op or some brief changes in what China purchases and forsakes  American wealth and American workers, while China is stealing our  wealth and jobs from our workers every single day.   If President Trump accepts a short-term purchase of American goods in  exchange for a reduction in our tariffs without structural reform to  China's predatory trade practices, shame on him. If he thinks that  photo op will help him; it will not. If he thinks a temporary, little  bump in China buying more soybeans or more steel products will help; it  will not. He will lose because one of the best things he has done-- something I, many other Democrats, and many other Americans have  praised him for--will be gone. I have publicly given the President  credit when he has taken on China.   As I said, Americans have lost millions--trillions--of dollars of  wealth and millions of jobs to Chinese IP theft. The President has been  right to challenge China on those issues. His tariffs have brought  China to the negotiating table, but now that China is at the table,  President Trump must not walk away without achieving what he set out to  achieve.   In short, to cut an unacceptable deal--a weak deal, a photo-op deal-- at this stage would be to squander the historic moment to put American  businesses, workers, and inventors on a level playing field at long  last, and it would be viewed as a capitulation by the President on one  of his signature issues. It would be the inverse of what he did on  North Korea.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 729         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO CHALLENGE                     SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE.         No amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to a       Federal agency (as defined in section 1004 of the Solid Waste       Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6903) and including the Executive       Office of the President) may be used to establish or operate       a panel, task force, other advisory committee, or other       effort intended to challenge the scientific consensus on       climate change, as presented in the assessment required under       section 106 of the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (15       U.S.C. 2936).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
