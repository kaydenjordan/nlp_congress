 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak on the ongoing  threat posed by COVID-19, particularly the delta variant, which is  highly contagious and is rapidly spreading throughout our country.   After 18 months of this pandemic we are all yearning for a return to  normalcy, but we must get vaccinated to prevent further spread of this  virus.   Recent data show that 99 percent of deaths due to COVID-19 are among  those who are unvaccinated.   In Ohio, fewer that 50 percent of residents have received their first  dose of the vaccine.   We have the tools to emerge from this crisis, but we must use them.  These vaccines are safe. They are effective. And we must all do our  part to get our loved ones, our friends, and ourselves vaccinated as  quickly as possible.   Finally, I want to thank our healthcare sheroes and heroes in  Cuyahoga, Erie, Lorain, Lucas, and Ottowa Counties. They are doing  courageous work saving lives every day.   Get vaccinated.                            ____________________
