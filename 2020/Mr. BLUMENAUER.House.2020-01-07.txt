 Mr. Speaker, President Trump has demonstrated the  limitation of his reality show, go-it-alone, incoherent approach, which  helped him eke out an electoral college victory while losing the  popular vote by 3 million votes, but is spectacularly ill-equipped to  govern, let alone respond to a crisis that he has made worse.   Maybe there was a reason that Bush and Obama didn't kill Soleimani  when they could. Evidently, his advisors put General Soleimani's  assassination on the list of options because they thought it was so  outrageous they didn't think he would choose it.   If you thought abandoning our Kurdish allies who helped us fight ISIS  was a heartless disaster, now Trump has managed to unite factions in  Iran against us, delaying reform for years, while pushing us to the  brink of war and making it more likely that Iran develops nuclear  weapons after Iran followed the nuclear agreement that the President  broke.   Reportedly, Iranian missiles are launched on Americans in bases that  the Iraqi Parliament said we should abandon.   Congress must act to rein in this reckless President.
