 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the ALLIES Act.   I believe, as my colleagues have stated so eloquently, that we have a  moral  [[Page H3811]]  obligation and a duty to take care of those who protected and  safeguarded American troops in Afghanistan.   Future allies will look at how we treated those who put themselves in  harm's way: the thousands of interpreters and others who aided our  mission when they are asked to help us in other times of need.   There is one particular group I would like to call special attention  to: the Afghan Female Tactical Platoon. This small group of elite  Afghan women sought a better future for their country. They were  trained by our country's Special Forces and supported our special  operation missions during the war. They gathered essential intelligence  and helped protect the lives of innocent civilians and American troops.  We owe these brave women more than our gratitude. We owe them what they  gave us: loyalty and protection.   Because of their gender, they are marked for especially heinous  retaliation and punishment by the Taliban. Without our help they will  almost certainly be raped, sold into sex trafficking, tortured, or  executed all because they helped the American people.   I want to thank Representative Crow for his steadfast leadership on  this critically important issue, and I urge my colleagues to approve  this essential bill.
