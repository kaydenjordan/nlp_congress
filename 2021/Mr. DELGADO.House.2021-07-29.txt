 Madam Speaker, throughout the appropriations process, I  have worked to secure investments for upstate families, farmers, small  businesses, and veterans.   I would like to highlight a few projects included in this year's  funding package that will improve and empower communities all across my  district.   In Columbia County, more than 300 homes and businesses in the towns  of Ghent, Canaan, New Lebanon, and Austerlitz will be connected to  high-speed broadband.   The village of Philmont Fire Department will be able to purchase 12  new air packs and replace an 81-year-old fire siren.   In Delaware County folks will soon have access to quality, safe, and  affordable childcare.   Northern Dutchess Hospital will add 18 beds to its family birth  center.   These are just a few of the projects that we were able to secure.  These are invaluable investments in New York-19.                            ____________________
