 Mr. President, the events of last week--the baffling,  inexplicable attacks on our closest allies by the administration one  day and the appalling praise for perhaps the most brutal dictator on  Earth the next--are not normal. This behavior is not normal. These  upside-down values are not normal.   These actions mistake disruption for dynamism. They are empty bravado  for bold displays of leadership. These actions are not serious or  sober. They represent the opposite of statecraft, and the implications  of such thoughtlessness for America, her allies, and the world could be  lasting and grave.   In many ways, the President is a steward of America's foreign  policy--shaping it during their time, yes, but also understanding it is  based on relationships and norms that have existed since long before  they took office and will continue to exist long after they exit the  political stage.   Over the past several months, I have spoken of our abandonment of the  international rules-based order that we took the lead in establishing.  I have spoken of the profound implications of this abandonment, what it  means to our economy, to national security, and to our relations  throughout the world.   This administration's dangerous dance with protectionism and its  unwarranted besmirching of our allies, such as Canada, are illustrative  of precisely the kind of harmful implications I feared would become  reality.   This is not a matter of one instance of a poor word choice or a  single moment of absentmindedness; this attitude of contempt for those  nations that share our values and respect for those who do not has been  a common thread throughout the administration's actions over the past  18 months.   It is disturbing when the American President and his administration  are going on about the ``great personality'' of the murderous dictator,  Kim Jong Un, or how Kim ``loves his country very much,'' while at the  same time calling the Canadian Prime Minister ``obnoxious, weak, and  dishonest'' for merely pushing back on imposed tariffs or declaring  that the European Union is ``solidly against'' the United States when  it comes to trade policy.   Consistently ridiculing our allies by suggesting they are somehow  abusing us, while voicing admiration for despots and dictators,  represents a fundamental departure in behavior for American  administrations. It represents a  [[Page S3882]]  fundamental misunderstanding of our relationship with our allies.   It is understandable that we will have disagreements with our allies,  but that does not justify upending the international framework and  foreign relations painstakingly constructed and cultivated by previous  generations of leaders.   Issues we have with allies ought to be addressed through constructive  dialogue, not bellicose taunts or bombastic tweets. Such behavior is  beneath the Presidency, and it is destructive to the position of global  leadership this Nation holds. It projects to the world not American  values but some sort of creep nihilism.   I am astonished to use that word, ``nihilism,'' to describe the  actions of any administration, of any party--much less my own--but it  is our obligation to call what is happening by its name.   When we read this week in The Atlantic, quoting a senior White House  official as saying that the ultimate goal of the administration is to  destroy the international order so America will, as a matter of policy,  have ``No Friends, No Enemies,'' then ``nihilism'' is the only word for  it.   If I may echo the sentiments of our absent colleague Senator McCain,  I would like to make clear to our allies from the Senate floor that a  bipartisan majority of Americans stand with you. We stand in favor of  the principles of free trade, which have brought about unprecedented  prosperity around the world. We stand in favor of preserving alliances  based on 70 years of shared values, which have helped secure equally  unprecedented peace and comity among nations. As Senator McCain plainly  stated, ``Americans stand with you.''   Attacking our friends is not who we are as a nation. It is not  responsible diplomacy. It is not helpful to our goals as a nation, and  it cannot become the norm, but I fear it is becoming the norm, and that  is devastating and it is a reality we must face in this Chamber.   We continue to act here as if all is normal, as if all parties are  observing norms, even as the executive branch shatters them, robustly  trafficking in conspiracy theories and attacking all institutions that  don't pay the President obeisance--our justice system, the free press.  The list is getting longer.   This institution--the article I branch of our government--is not an  accessory to the executive branch, and we demean ourselves and our  proper constitutional role when we act like we work for the President  and that we are only here to do his bidding, especially now.   With the time I have left in this Chamber, I will continue to speak  out, and I invite my colleagues who are disturbed by the recent  treatment of our allies to do the same, but as vital as I feel it is to  speak out, for the record and for history, it is clear that in the face  of such an unprecedented situation, words are not enough. Mr. Madison's  doctrine of the separation of powers tells us it is our obligation to  act.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as we consider this year's National Defense  Authorization Act, I rise today to honor my esteemed colleague and  friend Senator John McCain. As a member of the Armed Services Committee  for the past 32 years and as chairman for the past 4, Senator McCain  has worked tirelessly to steer this essential legislation through the  U.S. Senate.   Under Senator McCain's leadership, the NDAA has authorized pay raises  for troops, invested in modern equipment and advanced training, has  helped to restore military readiness, and provided America's allies the  support needed for security missions around the globe.   We all know Senator McCain has been a fixture in the Senate during  every NDAA debate. Wagging his finger and raising his voice, he  mustered the rest of us to support and defend our troops. He made it a  priority to reduce wasteful spending and crack down on waste, fraud,  and abuse.   Year after year under Senator McCain's leadership, the Senate Armed  Services Committee has identified billions of dollars in unnecessary  spending in the Department of Defense, and because of his efforts, we  have reinvested savings in providing critical military capabilities for  warfighters, meeting the unfunded priorities of our service chiefs and  our combatant commanders, and supporting critical national security  priorities.   The fact that Congress has approved the NDAA legislation every year  that he has been involved in this process speaks to his ability to  unite his colleagues around what matters most.   While Senator McCain is missed here--his physical presence is  missed--his influence and legacy will remain for years to come in this  body and, certainly, with this important legislation.               Nominations of Susan Brnovich and Dominic Lanza    Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a nominee who  was reported to the floor last week, Susan Brnovich. Judge Brnovich has  been nominated to be a district judge for the District of Arizona in  Phoenix, a seat that badly needs to be filled.   Judge Brnovich is absolutely the right person to fill this seat. She  has spent her entire legal career representing the people of Arizona  and Maricopa County, and for that, I thank her.   Upon confirmation, Judge Brnovich will join the district court bench  in Phoenix alongside another highly qualified Arizona nominee, Dominic  Lanza, whom the Judiciary Committee reported to the floor in April.   Mr. Lanza will fill another seat on the Arizona district court that  has remained vacant for far too long. He, too, is the right person for  the job.   Just 2 weeks before the committee considered Mr. Lanza's nomination,  he and his colleagues at the U.S. attorney's office coordinated with  Federal and local law enforcement in Phoenix to raid the homes of  backpage.com's owners. They seized the backpage.com website and  indicted those responsible for trafficking young girls online through  the company's website.   Thanks to Mr. Lanza's efforts, among others, backpage.com is no  longer operational, which means the largest online human trafficking  scheme in the country has been shut down.   Unfortunately, after being reported favorably to the floor 2 months  ago, Mr. Lanza's nomination has stalled on the Senate floor. I see no  reason that a man who helped shut down backpage should be languishing  on the floor for what should be a unanimous vote.   I see no reason that my friend, Judge Brnovich, who has dedicated her  career to representing her fellow Arizonans, should face the same fate.  I urge my colleagues to promptly confirm these two eminently qualified  individuals and allow them to take their seats on the Federal bench.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
