 Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight the  passage of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which I voted for today,  and this Chamber passed only minutes ago.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen record increases in energy prices  coupled with inflation cause countless hardships for families in my  district and across the country. In fact, gas prices have risen nearly  every single month of President Biden's term, long before Putin's  invasion of Ukraine. That is not to mention the fact that, in 2021,  U.S. imports of Russian oil nearly tripled.   Despite these facts, this administration has consistently opposed  American energy development.   Rather than restricting domestic energy and mineral production, we  need to unlock American resources to provide energy security here at  home and for our allies abroad.   H.R. 1 allows our domestic energy industry to flourish and puts us  back on the path to energy dominance by removing unnecessary,  complicated permitting regulations and modernizing outdated laws.   Many of the problems America's energy industry faces today stem from  burdensome permitting requirements, the outdated NEPA process, and  endless litigation over already leased lands and projects currently in  progress.   H.R. 1 tackles these challenges head-on, unleashing American energy,  reforming our broken permitting process, and imposing filing deadlines  on litigation concerning energy and mining projects.  [[Page H1683]]    By doing so, this bill not only helps us slash energy costs for  working families but also reduces our dependence on foreign fuel  sources, which, in turn, benefits our environment and bolsters our  national security.   America continues to be one of the cleanest energy producers in the  world. For example, Russian natural gas exported to Europe has a  lifecycle emissions profile 41 percent higher than U.S. liquefied  natural gas exported to Europe. In fact, if the European Union switched  all of their natural gas imports in 2021 from Russian to U.S., it is  estimated that global emissions would have been reduced by over 218  million tons.   That is not to mention that the U.S. is at least 50 percent import  reliant for 48 different mineral commodities, 24 of which come from  China and 6 of which come from Russia.   Our energy security is national security, and it allows our Nation to  deliver greater global emission reductions that substantially lower  energy prices.   Madam Speaker, I am glad to say that not only will this bill benefit  the people of my district at the pump and on their energy bills, but  thanks to my amendment, I have guaranteed that it also protects the  beautiful coastal waters that southeast Virginians call home by  ensuring the existing moratoriums on drilling off the coast of Virginia  are not affected.   We have worked very hard on the Natural Resources Committee to ensure  this bill will directly benefit the American people.   We must restore strength in our economy, and that starts with  restoring America's energy independence. Republicans are leading on  this issue, and it is my hope that this bill will make its way to the  President's desk and be signed into law so all Americans can benefit.                        Honoring the Gallaudet Eleven     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  Gallaudet Eleven and highlight their important yet seemingly unknown  contributions during the space race, contributions that led to  invaluable scientific knowledge and, eventually, the successful Apollo  11 Moon landing.   Before NASA could send humans to space, the agency needed to better  understand the effects of prolonged weightlessness on the human body.   So, in the late 1950s, NASA and the U.S. Naval School of Aviation  Medicine established a joint research program to study these effects.  They recruited 11 deaf men from Gallaudet University: Harold Domich,  Robert Greenmun, Barron Gulak, Raymond Harper, Jerald Jordan, Harry  Larson, David Myers, Donald Peterson, Raymond Piper, Alvin Steele, and  John Zakutney.   All but one of these men had lost their hearing early in their lives  due to spinal meningitis, which damaged the vestibular system of their  inner ear in a way that made them immune to motion sickness.   Now known as the Gallaudet Eleven, these men underwent extensive  testing over the course of 10 years, pushing their bodies to the limits  to advance our space program.   The testing and experiments included living 12 days straight inside a  20-foot slow rotation room, which remained in a constant motion of 10  revolutions per minute, a 200-mile journey on the choppy seas off the  coast of Nova Scotia, and a series of zero-G flights in the notorious  ``vomit comet'' aircraft.   The decade's worth of experimentation gave researchers critical  insight into how the body's sensory system works when gravitational  cues from the inner ear aren't available, as in the case of space  flight. This insight helped give researchers the information they  needed to safely send other men to space.   We cannot ignore that the space race played a significant part in the  Cold War. Americans and Soviets competed to prove their technological  and intellectual superiority by becoming the first nation to put a  human into space.   When we landed on the Moon, our astronauts were seen as the ultimate  American heroes, a distinction they would not have enjoyed without the  contributions of the Gallaudet Eleven.   The service of these 11 men to the United States embodies a legacy of  bravery, dedication, and love of country.   Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing gratitude to the  Gallaudet Eleven for their honorable service to our Nation.    I hope that by highlighting the critical contributions of these  unsung heroes, I have helped ignite an effort to provide them with the  recognition and credit that they are due.                  Problems Caused by Navy Dry Dock Closures     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address my  grave concerns with the recent closure of four Navy dry docks that are  responsible for maintaining our Navy fleet and sustaining our Naval  seapower and maritime strength.   Approximately 7 weeks ago, the U.S. Navy closed three dry docks at  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton and another at the nearby  Trident Refit Facility in Bangor, Washington.   One of these dry docks that was closed was the only dry dock on the  West Coast certified to repair a nuclear aircraft carrier.   Without this vital infrastructure in place, our aircraft carriers in  the Pacific are left completely vulnerable. We are now left with one  dry dock on the East Coast that has the capacity to repair an aircraft  carrier.   Combined, these shipyards used to have 22 dry docks. With 4 out of  commission, we are down to 18 and have lost 22 percent of our critical  Naval support infrastructure. We are now left with one dry dock on the  East Coast that has the capacity to repair an aircraft carrier.   As a result of significant divestment in the 1990s, our Nation has  only four public shipyards: Puget Sound and Pearl Harbor on the West  Coast and Norfolk and Portsmouth on the East Coast.   As you can see here in this graph, the U.S. now has the fewest public  shipyards than any other time since the end of World War II.  Additionally, we now have 36 percent of the Navy's attack submarine  fleet either in or waiting for maintenance.   This backlog is due to a multitude of factors, including workforce  challenges, but having fewer shipyards and dry docks is a significant  part of the problem.   This problem impacts the readiness of our submarines and aircraft  carriers and our entire Navy fleet, the men and women who crew them,  the defense industrial base, and our national defense as a whole.   Without the basic infrastructure needed to support our Navy, how can  we possibly provide adequate defense capabilities if called upon to  engage with our adversaries.   If we were to engage in conflict with a near-peer adversary such as  China, we need to have infrastructure at the ready to repair damaged  vessels in a timely manner and return them to their area of operation.                                time  1230    Increasing our maritime industrial base, including dry docks, is  absolutely critical for our Navy to be able to effectively defend the  United States and must be prioritized in our national defense budget.   I came to Congress to restore Americans' strength. I look forward to  working with my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee from  both sides of the aisle to ensure that we support and invest in our  public shipyards in order to protect and defend our great Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
