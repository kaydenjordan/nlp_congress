 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues today in  making some brief remarks on William Barr's nomination to serve as  Attorney General of the United States.   I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Barr one-on-one in my office.  We had a very good meeting, and we talked in some detail about securing  our elections from foreign interference, something that is a major  priority of mine, and we really are close in passing a bipartisan bill,  which Senator Lankford and I have, called the Secure Elections Act. We  just need a little help and support from the administration.   We also talked about modernizing our antitrust enforcement to fit the  challenges that we have today and to make our laws as sophisticated as  the trillion-dollar companies we are now seeing and the mergers we are  seeing all across the United States. So we had a good discussion about  that.   We also talked about his family and working in the Justice  Department. During the hearing, I gave an opportunity for him to talk  to those workers who were, through no fault of their own, furloughed or  not getting paid, and he clearly showed respect for the people in the  Justice Department. I appreciate all of that. I think that is important  to have in an Attorney General.   But I have some serious concerns about this nominee. I had already  announced I was opposing him during our Judiciary Committee vote, but I  have some serious concerns when you look at the context in which he has  come before us.   His nomination comes at a time when there are investigations by a  special counsel and multiple U.S. attorney's offices in New York into  campaign finance violations and an attempt, as we know, by a foreign  adversary to interfere in our elections. This special counsel's  investigation has led to indictments or guilty pleas from over 30  people and three companies, including seven former advisers to the  President.   These investigations, as we know, go to the heart of the integrity of  our elections, our government, and our institutions, and it is why it  is essential, first of all, that Special Counsel Mueller and the U.S.  attorney's offices be allowed to finish their work free of political  interference.   The President, as we know, has made past statements and sent out  tweets about Attorney General Sessions: I am critical of him for  allowing these investigations to go forward. This is the context we are  in. He has made it very clear as to what he is looking for in an  Attorney General. He wants someone who will be his lawyer. He wants  someone to use the Justice Department, in a way, to protect him.   I think this should worry us because, yes, the Attorney General works  for the President, but, more importantly, who the Attorney General  really works for are the people, the people of the United States.   The Attorney General of the United States is the people's lawyer and  pledges to uphold the rule of law and apply the law equally no matter  who you are.   Mr. Barr has made clear, one, that he respects Mr. Mueller, which I  truly appreciate. He said that both in my private meeting and on the  record at the hearing. But he has also said that he intends to take  over supervision of the special counsel's investigation.   He wouldn't commit, at his nomination hearing--despite having written  that 19-page memo, he wouldn't commit to following the advice of career  ethics lawyers at the Department about whether he should be recused.   Why did that concern me? Well, because he had actually commended the  Deputy Attorney General for following those rules, and he had commended  Senator and then-Attorney General Sessions for following these rules.  So that concerns me.   We know that if he is confirmed, he will be in a position to oversee  the special counsel's budget, the scope of the investigation, and he  will, ultimately--and this is key--receive the results of investigation  under law.    He will get to decide whether the results are released to the public  or, perhaps, as he suggested during the hearing, are not released at  all, and that is in addition to those related investigations he will  oversee. These U.S. Attorney's investigations don't have the special  counsel regulations to protect them, so he is in direct line to oversee  those.   Even though many of my colleagues asked him to pledge to make Special  Counsel Mueller's report public, he wouldn't commit to do so. He always  had a way to kind of dodge a commitment to do so, instead of, in my  mind, making a full-throated endorsement of releasing that report.   If he is confirmed, he will also have room to make his own  interpretation of what the law allows. In fact, as Attorney General, he  can make the Department's rules and regulations and issue guidance that  would make the difference between transparency and obscurity. That is  why we have to look at his judgment on this particular issue.   Maybe if we were in a different time, in a different moment, we would  be talking about things like the opioid epidemic and what the Attorney  General is doing, which is very important, and I know he does care  about that; or we would be devoting our moment, which I wish we could  be doing, to antitrust and upgrading the way those laws are enforced  and what we should do; or we would be talking, which we should be  doing, about the SECOND STEP Act and not just the FIRST STEP Act.   All of those questions were asked in the hearing--immigration reform,  very important issues--but we are where we are. We are where we are,  and we have to look at his judgment to see what kind of Attorney  General he would be at this time with respect to law and order, which,  to me, right now, is not just about law and order in our communities-- very important--but it is also about law and order when it comes to our  entire justice system.   Like many of the nominees from the President, Mr. Barr has  demonstrated, just as Justice Kavanaugh did, just as Justice Gorsuch  did, an expansive view--an unprecedentedly expansive view of  Presidential power. We don't have to look far to see how those views  would impact the special counsel's investigation.   Just a few months before he was nominated as a private citizen--I  don't have many constituents who would do this, but, for some reason,  Mr. Barr decided to send in this 19-page memo as a private citizen. It  was no ordinary memo. This memo was 19 pages, single-spaced, and  addressed to the leadership of the Justice Department, but it was sent  to all of these people--conservative activists and all kinds of people  all over the place, the lawyers at the White House Counsel's office,  and the President's personal lawyers. I don't think my constituents  would really have their addresses or emails, but it was sent to all of  these people.   It argued that a portion of the special counsel's obstruction of  justice inquiry was ``fatally misconceived.'' He  [[Page S1299]]  said that it was based on a legally insupportable reading of the law.   Now, that makes you pause. How can we be sure, how can we think he  can impartially evaluate the special counsel's investigation if, before  he has even seen its result, he writes extensively that part of it, not  all of it, was legally insupportable and fatally misconceived?   It is not just those statements that are troubling. He goes on to  state, not for the first time, his alarming views about the President's  powers. Here is one of them: ``[T]he President's law enforcement powers  extend to all matters, including those in which he had a personal  stake.''   Mr. Barr doesn't cite laws or cases from the Supreme Court or the  history of our Nation's founding or even the Federalist Papers when  making his claims. He just says it as if it is obvious.   Let me be clear about what he means by this. Mr. Barr believes that a  President gets to supervise an investigation into his or her own  conduct. As a former prosecutor, I know that it is a fundamental value  in our country that no one--no one--is above the law, and it is a  fundamental principle in our legal system that no one should be a judge  in their own case, not even the President of the United States.   I also have grave doubts about Mr. Barr's respect for Congress, a  coequal branch of government, and our duty to provide oversight of the  executive branch.   Mr. Barr is a proponent of the unitary executive theory, which is the  idea that the President has expansive powers, even in the face of  Congress's constitutional duties. His writings on the topic raise  serious questions about how Mr. Barr will approach congressional  oversight of the administration.   I am concerned that Mr. Barr will rely on the broad interpretation of  Executive power to support the White House's reported efforts to exert  Executive privilege to prevent the release of the special counsel  report, its findings, or its conclusions.   If that happens, Congress must be ready to assert our responsibility  to make sure the public and, especially, State election officials who  are working to secure our elections have the facts about what happened.   How are we going to fix this in the next election if we don't know  what happened? How are we going to have accountability for our  government if the public is shut out in viewing what happened?   This is not the time to install an Attorney General who has  repeatedly espoused a view of unfettered Executive power. Congress  cannot abdicate its responsibilities or shirk its duties--not when it  comes to national security, foreign relations, the budget, or, as is  key today, oversight into law and order.   A few years ago, I went to Atlanta to make a speech, and, of course,  I took a little trip over to the Carter Presidential Library. Of  course, I wanted to see this library--I had never seen it--to learn  more about President Carter, but as a Minnesotan, I really wanted to  look for all the Mondale memorabilia. I may have been the only one  there looking for Joan's dress and other things related to the Mondale  half of the Carter-Mondale team.   One of the things I noticed that to me was most prominent was a quote  of Walter Mondale's etched on the wall. At the time, I liked it. I  thought it was simple. I wrote it down, and I put it in my purse. But I  never knew how relevant it would be today. The quote came from  Mondale's reflections on his service with President Carter after they  had lost their reelection but had served their country for 4 years. He  said:         We told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace.    I believe that is the minimum standard we should expect of any  administration. We told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the  peace. Every President faces great challenges, many of which are  unforeseen and require difficult decisions, but at the minimum, an  administration should tell the truth, obey the law, and do all they can  to keep the peace.   That is where I will end. What concerns me about this nominee is not  the vast experience he has or the work he would do on a few of the  things that I mentioned; it is his views on Executive power, his views  on Congress's power to be a check and balance to the Executive, his  views on what the Executive can do right as we face this crucial time  in history, when coming right at us is this major report from the  special counsel. I want someone who will make sure that whoever is in  the White House obeys the law and tells the truth.   Sadly, I cannot support this nominee. I do hope that I am wrong in  some of my conclusions based on what I have read and heard. I would  like nothing more.   I appreciate so much the work of Rod Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney  General and many of the other people in the Justice Department who have  worked with him to allow this investigation to continue. I hope that  will be the case if this nominee does go through this Chamber, that he  will do the same.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
