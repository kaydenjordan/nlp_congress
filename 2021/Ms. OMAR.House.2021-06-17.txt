 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  thank the distinguished author of this legislation, Congresswoman Lee,  for bringing forth this legislation.   Madam Speaker, for the past 20 years, the 2002 Authorization has been  used to wage war and cause destruction around the world.   While many in this Congress have participated in war, I am someone  who has endured war and understands the impact it has on innocent  lives. The act of war does nothing to make us safer.   Engaging in endless wars has led us to undermining our most important  morals: peace, liberty, and justice.   Congress cannot sit idly by as we take more civilian lives and  decrease our ability to build prosperity at home.   The more we spend on endless wars, the less we are able to invest in  our own people with education, housing, and employment opportunities.   I am pleased that Congress is finally working on restoring its  authority over matters of peace and war.
