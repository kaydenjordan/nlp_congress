 Mr. Speaker, many families, including my own, have been  impacted by cancer. For more than 178,000 Americans diagnosed with a  blood cancer like leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma, the Be The Match  program represents hope.   Founded in Minnesota, Be The Match runs the world's largest registry  designed to connect patients in need of lifesaving blood or marrow  transplants with a donor. In 2019, Be The Match facilitated over 6,500  transplants, giving hope to countless families around the world.  Minnesota has long been a hub for this kind of medical innovation.   As a co-chair of the Personalized Medicine Caucus, I urge all of my  colleagues today to support the TRANSPLANT Act and reauthorize Federal  partnerships like Be The Match, which have impacted the lives of  millions. Connecting patients with donors and developing the next  generation of regenerative medicine truly represents the best of who we  are as a society.   I thank Representative Matsui and the other sponsors of this  legislation for their hard work. I encourage everyone to help keep hope  alive by supporting this bill.                            ____________________
