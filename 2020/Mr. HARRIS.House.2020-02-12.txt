 Mr. Speaker, no wonder Americans elected a President who  struck a chord with voters disappointed with business as usual in  Washington and with the fake news media.   This week, after the President released his budget plan, his  opponents here on the floor and in the media breathlessly are spouting  fake news, falsely claiming that the President's budget cuts Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. But just like seeing the impeachment  phone call transcript for themselves that exposed the impeachment as a  hoax, every American should look at the budget for themselves and see  how fake the claims are that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid  are cut.   In fact, what they would see is a budget that doesn't touch Social  Security and Medicare benefits, and they would see a Medicaid budget  that not only isn't cut but increases 3.1 percent per year.   By controlling other spending, the President's budget, like all of  his three previous budgets, actually sets us on a path to finally  balancing our budget.   That is much better than the last administration, which, in 8 years,  never, ever submitted a budget that would balance.                            ____________________
