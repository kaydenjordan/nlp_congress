 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the life of  James Bennett.   James was a loved, trusted, compassionate, and hardworking young man.  I had the pleasure and honor of knowing him his entire life.   James was as gifted athletically as he was academically, a wrestler  who notched 95 wins in high school and was also selected into the  prestigious National Honor Society and graduated from Rowan University  in south Jersey.   The positivity and the energy that he brought to this world will be  missed by everyone who had the pleasure of ever  [[Page H4878]]  knowing him. I know that I personally miss him very much.   We all wish we had more time on this Earth with you, James, but know  we know that you are looking down on your mom and your dad, your entire  family, and your friends, and you are in Heaven right now.   Rest in peace, my friend, and God bless you.                            ____________________
