 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of  the Reverend Darrell Darling.   The loss of Darrell Darling hits us hard in Santa Cruz but also  throughout the Central Coast, for Reverend Darling was that iconic  mentor to all of us based on his longtime fight for civil rights, for  equal rights, for peace, for justice, for nonviolence, and for his  never-ending work for a more perfect Union.   Reverend Darling's fight began when he almost got kicked out of  college for pressing its administration about its racist policies  toward African Americans. Reverend Darling then went on to attend the  Yale Seminary, where, in 1965, he marched with Martin Luther King from  Selma to Montgomery and crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge with our  former colleague, John Lewis.   In California, Reverend Darling served in five parishes for over 25  years. After that, Darrell and his wife, Karen, ran the Darling House  Bed and Breakfast, where they hosted numerous events for our community  and continued to mentor young activists and future public servants.   In fact, I will never forget the conversation that I had with  Darrell, seated in his backyard, that inspired me to stand here in  Congress, for it was that type of impression that the Reverend Darling  had on me, on Santa Cruz, and on the fight for equality in our American  democracy.   Madam Speaker, I not only recognize his legacy of service, but we, in  Santa Cruz, acknowledge and appreciate that Reverend Darling is why  many of us stand, fight, and serve today.                Mourning the Loss of Jorge David Alvarado, Jr.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the loss and  the service of Salinas Police Officer Jorge David Alvarado, Jr.   Officer Alvarado was shot and killed in the line of duty while  conducting a traffic stop on Friday night. Before I flew back here on  Sunday, I visited the growing memorial for Officer Alvarado at the  Salinas Police Department and joined in the mourning, the devastation,  and the disbelief of his fiance, his mother, his brethren in blue, and  our entire community in Salinas.   Although the investigation of the incident is ongoing, the chief of  police stated that Officer Alvarado stayed in the fight to the end and  paid the ultimate price. As a result, the suspected cop killer is  behind bars.   Jorge Alvarado understood what it means to give back to his community  [[Page H1181]]  and to his country with his time in the U.S. Army, as well as his 5  years as a police officer. Although we look back upon his commitment  and actions as we mourn his loss, let us also look to Officer  Alvarado's legacy of service as a way forward.   We must realize that our communities, no matter their makeup, rely on  men and women who make up our police departments for order, for safety,  and for our upward mobility.                                time  1015    Officer Alvarado did that by not only protecting and serving Salinas,  but also Officer Alvarado got up every day and left his home knowing  that his job was to run to the danger and not away from it.   Madam Speaker, Officer Jorge Alvarado ran to the danger on Friday  night. Let's make sure that his service, that his sacrifice, are not in  vain. Let's make sure that all of us support his family and support the  men and women in uniform who strive to serve and protect so that we can  make it home to our families and thrive in safe communities.                            ____________________
