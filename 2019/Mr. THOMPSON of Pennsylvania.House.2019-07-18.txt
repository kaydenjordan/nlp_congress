 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  this Saturday, July 20, as National Pennsylvania Day.   The Keystone State has played a historic role in our Nation's  founding and continues to shape our future. It is the birthplace of the  Declaration of Independence and home to our Nation's very first  capital, Philadelphia.   Pennsylvania is also the site of several historic battles, including  the Battle of Valley Forge during the Revolutionary War and the Battle  of Gettysburg during the Civil War. It is where Betsy Ross handcrafted  the first American flag and Colonel Edwin Drake drilled the first  commercial oil well, in 1859.   Pennsylvania has a proud history of American craftsmanship and work  ethic, from our steel mills and coal mines to our farmlands and  forests.   This great State's many contributions to our Nation are a strong  testament to the diverse, industrious citizens who make up this  Commonwealth.   Mr. Speaker, today and every day, I am proud to call Pennsylvania my  home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman  from North Carolina for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise in favor of upward mobility. I rise in  favor of greater opportunity. But this bill doesn't do that. I rise in  opposition to this underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, increasing the Federal minimum wage by 107 percent is an  extreme and unprecedented policy that will have a severe and negative  impact on many American families, our Nation's workforce, our economy,  and once again, most importantly, hardworking American families.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, if enacted,  this legislation would cause approximately 3.7 million workers--let's  extrapolate that to families--across this Nation to lose their jobs by  2025.                                time  0930    My home State of Pennsylvania has estimated that more than 120,000  individuals, thereby families, would be negatively impacted through the  loss of their jobs. That is not upward mobility. That is downward  mobility.   Mr. Speaker, the majority of Americans, 54 percent, think losing up  to 3.7 million jobs for a $15 minimum wage is not a good idea. And 42  percent of families with a minimum-wage earner would see a net  reduction in total family income under the $15 minimum wage. That is  according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Mr. Speaker, that is totally unacceptable.   Now, I have always been a proponent of Federal policies that aim to  lift individuals out of poverty and provide them with skills necessary  to gain good-paying, family-sustaining jobs. We have done that in this  body, and it is working.   We should be promoting bipartisan policies that are proven to enhance  workforce development. For example, last Congress we passed the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act,  restoring rungs on a ladder of opportunity.   The President has signed that bill into law, and we are working  diligently  [[Page H7098]]  with the States to ensure that they are doing everything possible to  fill the 7.5 million open jobs in this country, most of them good,  family-sustaining jobs.   We need to ensure that policies enhance job-training programs; so we  are not talking about a minimum wage but, rather, arming individuals  with skills to compete and to earn well above a minimum wage.    Mr. Speaker, 63 percent of Americans  support our leadership expanding pathways to greater opportunity  through CTE, the better way.   I want everyone who is willing to work in this country to succeed,  but this legislation is not the answer. I encourage my colleagues to  oppose the bill, and then we can talk after this debate so we can get  to work on legislation to make sure job seekers have the skills to  compete and succeed in the modern workforce.
