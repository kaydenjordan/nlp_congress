 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the life, career, and service of a fellow Nevadan and friend,  Mayor Robert Crowell. His leadership and love of the Silver State are  an example to all of us. As mayor of Carson City, he led the city  through some difficult times--the great recession and the current  coronavirus pandemic--and oversaw the redevelopment of the capital  city's downtown core with his unique mix of dedication, compassion,  good humor, and vision.   Mayor Crowell began his life of service as a young Navy sailor  serving in the Vietnam war. After retiring as a naval captain, he  earned his undergraduate degree in economics from Stanford University  in 1967 and his doctor of jurisprudence degree from Hastings College of  the Law in 1973. He was admitted to the State Bar of Nevada in 1973. He  was a member of the Bar Register of Preeminent Lawyers and had been  included in Best Lawyers in America in the fields of government  relations and energy law for the past 25 years.   Born in Tonopah and raised in Carson City, Mayor Crowell was always  active in his community, serving as a board member or leadership role  with the Carson City School Board, Nevada Association of Counties,  Nevada League of Cities, Carson Area Chamber of Commerce, Northern  Nevada Development Authority, Rotary Club of Carson City, and Nevada  Legal Services. In addition, he was past president of State Bar of  Nevada and chair of the Nevada Mandatory Continuing Legal Education  Board. He was appointed by the Governor to the Colorado River  Commission and twice held the position of chairman, overseeing Nevada's  allocation of water and power from the Colorado River. Mayor Crowell  also served as president of the Board of Indigent Defense Services, a  State agency to oversee the provision of indigent legal services in  Nevada. He was also a member of the Vietnam Veterans of America and was  selected to be part of the ``first in the country'' Honor Flight for  Vietnam Veterans in Nevada.   Mayor Crowell has numerous recognitions for his countless  contributions to the quality of life of his fellow Nevadans. He was  awarded the Participatory Democracy Award from the Nevada Association  of Counties and the State Bar of Nevada Presidential Award--the highest  honors awarded by those organizations--as well as being inducted in the  Nevada Lobbyist Hall of Fame.   Mayor Crowell had many titles--lawyer, lobbyist, veteran, community  leader--but it was clear he found great joy in serving the people of  Carson City as mayor. Among his accomplishments was leading the effort  to redevelop downtown Carson City, creating an entirely new dynamic  downtown that supported local businesses and our community. For his  leadership on this effort, he was recognized by the Nevada Chapter of  the American Planning Association with the De Boer Award as well as the  Robert Broadbent Distinguished Services Award from the Nevada Chapter  of the American Public Works Association.   What I will remember most about my friend Mayor Crowell are not his  numerous and distinguished professional achievements but the way he  conducted himself and how he led. Mayor Crowell was dedicated to his  fellow residents and the betterment of his community and our great  State. I can recall the many acts of kindness and friendship that he  showed me when I became Nevada's attorney general and in the years  since. And Mayor Crowell brought those same qualities to every person  he interacted with in both his professional and private life.   Nevada lost a true treasure when Mayor Crowell passed on September  12, 2020. His wife Susan and his family shared him with all Nevadans  during his life, and we share in their grief upon his passing.                            ____________________
