 Madam President, yesterday evening the Senate had an  opportunity to go on record and show our constituents that we supported  the most vulnerable among us. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act would require doctors to treat a baby, once it is born,  with ordinary medical assistance, something they would do under any  other circumstances, even though this entailed surviving an abortion.   If you ask the American people, they would say this is just common  sense. In a recent poll, more than three-fourths of Americans said they  support providing medical treatment for babies who survive abortions. I  can't imagine what the other 25 percent are thinking. But there are no  Federal laws requiring healthcare providers to care for these babies  just as they would any other infant in their care, and for some Members  of the opposing party, they are just fine with that.   We all know that a few weeks ago, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam  made disturbing comments about how to not care for certain newborns. He  was asked: What would you do with a child with birth defects?   He said: Well, the infant would be delivered. The infant would be  kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated, if that is what the  mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue  between the physicians and the mother.   Let me be clear. The Governor, who is a pediatrician, by the way,  essentially advocated for infanticide--killing a child who was born  alive. Instead of saying, ``well, it is my duty as a physician under  the Hippocratic Oath to provide care to save the child,'' he believes  the child ought to be made comfortable, and then the mother and doctor  sit down and decide whether the child should live or die.   That is not healthcare. That is murder. I believe the Senate has a  duty to act and ensure that no child born alive is subjected to the  treatment described by Governor Northam.   The bill we voted on last night would protect newborns who have  survived abortions and ensure that they receive the same level of care  that any other newborn baby would. It builds upon a previous law, which  the Senate passed unanimously, called the Born-Alive Infant Protection  Act. That bill passed unanimously in 2002, and it clarified that every  infant born alive at any stage of development is a person, regardless  of the manner in which they were born. Yet yesterday, 44 Senators voted  to allow that same person's life to be ended with impunity.   The legislation we voted on yesterday would simply clarify that the  infants who survive abortions are entitled to the same lifesaving care  that other babies should receive. That is why it is so shocking to me  that 44 of our colleagues chose to vote against even proceeding to a  debate and a vote on the matter.   I am trying to think of a historical counterpart to this. I was  reminded of a book I read not long ago called ``Eichmann in  Jerusalem.'' This is about the trial of Adolf Eichmann after the  atrocities of the holocaust, during which 5 million Jews were killed.  The author, Hannah Arendt, was trying to figure out what kind of  monster could basically provide for the machinery that ultimately would  take the lives of 5 million Jews.   What she saw when she looked at Eichmann was not some monster that  looked different from you or me. Unfortunately, what she saw was  somebody who looked exactly like you and me. She wrote about the moral  collapse associated with the holocaust. She noted that ``in the Third  Reich, evil lost its distinctive characteristic by which most people  had, until then, recognized it.'' She said that the problem is that at  that point it became a ``civil norm.''   She wrote:         Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought, for       as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and       examine the premises and principles from which it originates,       it is frustrated because it finds nothing there.    ``That,'' she said, ``is the banality of evil.''   She concluded by saying:         Nearly everybody who attended the trials of mass killers       after the war, some of them respected doctors and       pharmacists, came away with the disconcerting impression that       the killers looked pretty much like you and me.    So while Republicans and Democrats disagree on a range of issues,  this should not be one of them. If we have one shred of our humanity  left, we ought to agree that protecting human life is essential. This  should have been a simple vote for every single Member of this body. I  can't tell you how disappointed I am that 44 of our colleagues decided  to vote no. I was proud to vote yes on the bill, yes to protecting  these newborn babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and  yes to life.
