 Mr. Speaker, I am a strong supporter of career  and technical education. While this bipartisan bill makes needed  improvements to current law, during the committee markup I offered and  later withdrew an amendment to provide more Federal support for skill  development and training programs for ex-offenders who need a second  chance and opportunity.   Ex-offenders, who are disproportionately young men of color due to  the bias in the criminal justice system, face numerous hurdles when  they try to reintegrate into society after serving their time. Finding  a decent job is a necessary first step towards developing self-esteem  and self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, and too often, a prior criminal  history is a barrier to ex-offenders seeking employment.   I withdrew my amendment because of the important work. Nevertheless,  it is my view that my amendment should be considered as this bill  advances to future conference consideration. Let's help stop recidivism  for this special population.
