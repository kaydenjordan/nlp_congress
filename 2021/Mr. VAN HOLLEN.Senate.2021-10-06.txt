 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Foundation Fighting Blindness. This Maryland-based  nonprofit has become the world's leading private source of research  funding to save and restore vision for individuals affected by blinding  retinal diseases like macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and  Usher syndrome. These conditions currently affect more than 10 million  Americans--and millions more throughout the world.   Even though the foundation has a global reach, its origins are local.  In 1971, a Maryland family learned that two of their three daughters  were going blind. At the time, there was no treatment for blindness and  few resources for the blind; the family was only told to teach their  daughters Braille. Despite these challenging circumstances, this brave  family banded together with friends and community members to organize a  movement around those struggling with blindness. These early efforts  paved the way for the establishment of the foundation we know today.   Since its creation, the foundation has raised over $800 million to  support cutting-edge research at the vanguard of the fight to cure  blindness. Their efforts have identified more than 270 genes that cause  retinal diseases and led to more than 40 clinical trials for potential  sight-saving and sight-restoring therapies. The first-ever FDA-approved  gene therapy for inherited retinal research was made possible thanks to  $10 million in funding from the foundation. This innovative treatment  has enabled children and young adults born virtually blind to see the  faces of their parents and even gaze at stars in the sky.   The millions of dollars raised by this organization have already  helped make big strides in the area of blindness research, but the  foundation's work is far from over. Today, the foundation continues to  invest in new frontiers of discovery. Their funding is fueling efforts  by major biotech and pharmaceutical companies to move more therapies  from the lab bench to clinical trials and, hopefully, treatments. And  through its unwavering commitment and persistence, the foundation  raised the funds to establish the first ever interdisciplinary  laboratory dedicated to research for inherited retinal diseases, which  will serve as an engine of future discoveries and advancements.   The foundation's work inspires us all, and I ask my colleagues to  join me in commending the founders and leaders of the Foundation  Fighting Blindness on their 50 years of innovative work transforming  the lives of millions around the world.                            ____________________
