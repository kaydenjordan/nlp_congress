 Madam President, I have come to the floor to talk about a  different subject, but I want to commend my good friend, the Senator  from Oregon, for his comments. We all watched with horror this weekend  the images from his State and from those in Washington and California  that were literally like something out of Dante's ``Inferno.''   I have enormous respect for the Senator from Oregon, and he can count  on  [[Page S5568]]  me to be behind him on these proposals. I know they will be reasonable,  and I know they will be straightforward. Boy oh boy. If, when we see  those images, we are not able to step up with a commonsense,  bipartisan, and quick response, then shame on all of us. I commend the  Senator for his leadership, and I look forward to working with him.
