 Madam Speaker, I rise today as our national debt has  reached the $30 trillion marker for the first time in our Nation's  history. This enormous figure should scare us all.   Since 1990, our national debt has grown tenfold, and there is no  indication that $30 trillion is the ceiling.   In Iowa, I helped pass the State law that rightfully requires that we  spend no more than 99 percent of the money we take in, creating a  balanced budget each year.   This is exactly what we should be doing in our Federal Government. We  cannot continue to print money, increase our debt, and ask Iowans to  foot the bill.   As a strong fiscal hawk, I will continue to fight against the  wasteful pork-barrel spending that fuels inflation, raises taxes, and  increases the cost of living on every family.   This is exactly what Iowans expect from me, and I plan to deliver.                            ____________________
