 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  kindness, and I only have a minute to talk about kindness.   I vigorously oppose the underlying legislation dealing with our  beautiful children. Mr. Speaker, that is what it is, and I join with  the Utah Governor who indicates that this minute problem does not  deserve a sledgehammer.   This bill deals with girls and women in sports, and the Olympics and  the NCAA have spoken on transgender. I speak from the heart as a fellow  human being. I speak from loving children as the chair of the  Congressional Children's Caucus.   I cannot stand here and tolerate 53 percent of trans kids considering  suicide last year. They want to belong. They want to have friends. They  want to play sports.   If you are 5 years old, 12 years old, this Congress has no right in  interfering with a beautiful community. It is, in fact, a blessing to  have a world and a Nation that has people who are different.   I affirm their difference. I stand for their difference. I will fight  for their difference because they should be loved like anyone else.   The rules and regulations are already in place. Why are we here doing  that when guns are killing our children?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking  member for the time, and I also thank the managers who are on the floor  today.   Let me clarify the reason for my being present as a member of the  Homeland Security Committee, and one who has dealt with the issues by  way of national security issues of water chemical contamination.   I rise with great opposition to H.J. Res. 27.   Let me call the roll: Flint, Michigan; Jackson, Mississippi; East  Palestine, which it is known that the derailment also contaminated  water; and cancer clusters in Houston where runoffs were contaminating  the water.   Let me give you the basis of what this is about. The rule that we are  trying to oppose reestablishes critical protections for the Nation's  vital water resources by returning to the longstanding 1986 regulations  with appropriate updates, exclusions, and streamlining clarifications.   In fact, the plain statement is that H.J. Res. 27 would leave  Americans without a clear waters of the United States definition, which  deals with the overall question of clean water.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose it because it does clarify the categories of  water bodies and wetlands that would be subject to government  protection under the Clean Water Act. People are suffering across  America.   Mr. Speaker, to my good friend with the lawsuit by 24 States--we have  50 States. It is very clear that my good friends in the red States, the  AGs, thought that they would undermine the President's direction on  clean water.   H.J. Res. 27 would carelessly bind the hands of Federal agencies  working to protect our country's water supply and quality while  creating instability for farmers and developers. This does not work.   If H.J. Res. 27 was to become law, it may have a detrimental effect  on the Clean Water Act, a law that prohibits the discharge of  pollutants into our country's rivers and safeguards the quality of our  water resources.   We are a smart and big country. We can definitely find ways to help  our farmers. We are getting ready to do the farm bill. We definitely  can find ways to help those who engage in economic development.   It is important to prevent this joint resolution in order to maintain  the Clear Water Act because the CWA places restrictions on the number  of pollutants that can be emitted and mandates that any plant that  releases pollutants into U.S. waters acquire a permit.                                time  1430    Mr. Speaker, is that too onerous?   I heard someone use that term ``to save lives'' and to prevent babies  from having an impact by drinking this water and having distorted  growth.   The Clean Water Act also permits the use of Federal funding to  support the construction and maintenance of water treatment facilities  by local governments and other organizations. I can tell you, Mr.  Speaker, Houston, Texas, needs those resources, and so do other  [[Page H1785]]  cities. I would hate to undermine those resources.   The Clean Water Act has been an essential tool for preserving the  health of U.S. water resources and for ensuring that Americans have  access to clean, safe water.   By establishing standards, funding infrastructure projects, and  promoting monitoring research activities, the Clean Water Act has been  a significant factor in preserving and enhancing Houston's water  quality.   I have worked with the Army Corps of Engineers. They listen. If they  speak up and say that this is the framework which we need and the EPA,  as well, that has been on front lines of contamination, that seems to  be the call of the day because our good friends in corporate America,  trains, and otherwise, seemingly don't listen.   Believe me, Mr. Speaker, I just rode in on a train. I believe in that  mode of opportunity and transportation. Let's have everyone be fair and  responsible to what we have to do to protect the water of this Nation.   The Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972. According to the EPA, the  number of water bodies in the U.S. that were safe for fishing and  swimming has increased from 36 percent to over 60 percent.   When you have something that is working, Mr. Speaker, why are you  undermining it?   So I am clearly in the position to say that in 2019 the EPA awarded  $4.2 million to the city of Houston to fund projects aimed at improving  water quality and storm water management.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  additional time.   Mr. Speaker, we advocated for that management. We have hurricanes.  And when we have hurricanes, we are always subject to the system not  being able to hold the water and contamination is a possibility.   According to the Houston Public Works Department, the city's  wastewater treatment plant treats an average of 304 million gallons of  wastewater per day. These treatment plants are required to meet strict  standards.   I will say that all cities and counties we are all working to  maintain clean water. We have a situation that we are working on in my  local community of Houston, wastewater and sewage.   What do you think we would do, Mr. Speaker, without the Clean Water  Act?   Please don't undermine us. Don't undermine us and the local people.  Listen to the roll call: Flint; Jackson, Mississippi; East Palestine;  and many others.   Let us oppose this particular H.J. Res. and let us recognize that we  have the responsibility. If we are doing nothing else, we have got to  be responsible with H.J. Res. 27, opposing it, so that we can stand up  for the children of this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 27.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition of H.J. Res 27--Providing  for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States  Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of the Army, Corps of  Engineers, Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection  Agency relating to ``Revised Definition of `Waters of the United  States' ''.   H.J. Res. 27 is specifically intended to oppose the ``Revised  Definition of `Waters of the United States' '' rule, which clarifies  and broadens the categories of water bodies and wetlands that would be  subject to government protection under the Clean Water Act.   In 2019, the EPA awarded over $4.2 million to the city of Houston to  fund projects aimed at improving water quality and stormwater  management.   According to the Houston Public Works department, the city's  wastewater treatment plants treat an average of 304 million gallons of  wastewater per day.   These treatment plants are required to meet strict standards set by  the Clean Water Act, which helps ensure that the water discharged from  the plants is safe for the environment and public health.   The EPA has identified several bodies of water in the Houston area as  ``impaired'' due to pollution, including parts of the Buffalo Bayou and  Galveston Bay. However, thanks in part to the Clean Water Act, the  overall water quality in the area has improved over the past few  decades.   According to a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the  Clean Water Act has helped prevent an estimated 230,000 cases of  childhood gastrointestinal illness in Texas each year by reducing water  pollution.   It is important to oppose this resolution because H.J. Res. 27 will  be the sixth attempt at weakening the Clean Water Act.   Over many years, Republicans in Congress and industry groups argued  that the restrictions were overly broad and would have negatively  impacted farmers, ranchers, and other businesses by subjecting more  waters to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act.   H.J. Res 27 will carelessly bind the hands of federal agencies  working to protect our country's water supply and quality. We need to  help farmers have clean water with effective oversight.   If H.J. Res. 27 were to become law, it may have a detrimental effect  on the Clean Water Act (CWA), a law that prohibits the discharge of  pollutants into our country's rivers and safeguards the quality of our  water resources.   It's important to prevent this joint resolution in order to maintain  the Clean Water Act because the CWA places restrictions on the number  of pollutants that can be emitted and mandates that any plant that  releases pollutants into US waters acquire a permit.   The Clean Water Act also permits the use of federal funding to  support the construction and maintenance of water treatment facilities  by local governments and other organizations.   The Clean Water Act has been an essential tool for preserving the  health of US water resources and for ensuring that Americans have  access to clean, safe water.   By establishing standards, funding infrastructure projects, and  promoting monitoring and research activities, the Clean Water Act has  been a significant factor in preserving and enhancing Houston's water  quality.   According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), since the  Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972, the number of water bodies in the  U.S. that are safe for fishing and swimming has increased from 36  percent to over 60 percent.   However because to statutory exclusions for routine farming,  forestry, and ranching activities as well as for the building and  upkeep of farm and stock ponds and irrigation ditches, farmers are  mainly exempt from the Clean Water Act's regulatory requirements.   Less than 1 percent of all permits issued under Section 404 of the  Clean Water Act are for agricultural purposes.   Yet, this resolution will abolish elements of the Biden rule intended  to provide farmers further advantages, such as the recodification of  the previous converted cropland exclusion and new regulatory exclusions  for specific ditches, irrigated regions, such as rice fields and  erosional features.   Eliminating these agricultural exclusions will increase uncertainty  rather than decrease it.   In addition, The Biden regulation reinstates the same scientifically  based standards that have been used for decades by every presidential  administration, including originally the Trump administration.   I would like to thank Biden Administration for keeping those rules in  place that helps the resident of Houston to have a better water quality  and help farmers to maintain the productivity of their land and support  sustainable agricultural practices.   As a Senior member of the Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, I  urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res 27 so we may keep defending the  water's purity and the health of our citizens.
