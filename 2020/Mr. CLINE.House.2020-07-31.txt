 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Staunton Kiwanis Club  for their efforts to donate food and supplies to local families in  need.   Originally, the club had donated supplies for the Little League  Baseball opener, but when the season was abruptly canceled, club member  Michael Roman urged his group to live their motto ``to serve the kids''  in a new way.   Kiwanis members and Martin's Food then arranged for the repurposing  of donated items from the local store. Kiwanis members now pick up  items and drive to the concession stand in Gypsy Hill Park, where  supplies are sorted and redistributed to social service agencies to be  used by their clients. Since April, 15 loads of food, averaging 450  pounds each, have been donated, providing about 334 meals per load.   Quick thinking and dedicated action by Staunton Kiwanis turned the  disappointment of a lost baseball season into positive assistance for  local families to truly serve the kids.                            ____________________
