 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3170, the Small  Business Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2017. In today's  increasingly cyber world, information technology is vital for small  businesses. It equips them with the necessary tools and allows them to  remain competitive in the global economy.   However, the same tools that allow small businesses to stay on the  cutting edge of technology have also caused them to be increasingly  targeted by cybercriminals. And, unfortunately, a simple cyber attack  can destroy a small business.   According to the National Small Business Association, the average  cost of a cyber attack on a small business is $32,000. Many small  businesses fear such an attack but lack the resources or the technical  knowledge to prevent one. That is where H.R. 3170 comes into play.   This legislation would equip lead small business development centers  with a cyber counseling certification program to educate small  businesses and help them to implement a cybersecurity plan to protect  their business. Due to the high cost of hiring cyber experts, many  small businesses could not otherwise afford to take such precautions.   H.R. 3170 would offer cyber assistance at no or low cost to small  businesses. This bipartisan bill would help America's nearly 30 million  small businesses stay ahead of cyber attacks so that they are not  forced to react once it is too late. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the baptism of Dr.  Frank Gaskill and his two children, Olivia and Maddox, of Charlotte,  North Carolina, this past weekend. On May 6, at the Myers Park United  Methodist Church, I was able to celebrate a member joining the church  of faith.   Dr. Gaskill is a psychologist and author, who has dedicated his life  to helping children with Asperger's. After earning his bachelor of  arts, master's, and Ph.D. in psychology from the University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill, he went on to develop a practice that has been  recognized as one of the most creative, innovative, and best run  practices in the United States.   I look forward to the positive impact Dr. Gaskill will continue to  have, and I am overjoyed by his commitment to his faith.   Dr. Gaskill, as you begin this new part of your life, look to Psalm  37:3, which reminds us: ``Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the  land and cultivate faithfulness.''                            ____________________
