 Madam Speaker, I rise today to right a wrong. Shortly  after his passing, there was an op-ed written about Bob Moses which  characterized him as ``the most important civil rights hero most  Americans never heard of.'' I painfully agree.   Bob Moses has never been given the credit he deserved. Fortunately  for us, his ego was small, but his impact was giant.   Bob Moses was a relentless organizer and seeker of justice and  equitable access to the ballot box as a SNCC organizer and a  transformative educator as the founder of the Algebra Project.   He was a loving husband, father, and generous mentor.   Much like his iconic overalls, Bob Moses was unassuming and  resilient. Days before he transitioned, Moses was still fighting, this  time for critical COVID relief funds to be used to finally reinvent the  math classroom.   He said: ``The problem is not the willingness or ability of students  to succeed, rather the systemic inequities teachers and students of  color face.''   He once posed the question: ``What do you do when the country has a  sickness?''   I can say, the cure for our Nation's sickness of systemic racism and  inequality is to model that which Mr. Moses demonstrated throughout  this life. May we honor him now, in a way that matters most: Change.   Rest in power, Mr. Moses.                            ____________________
