 Mr. Speaker, the energy and water division of the omnibus  bill captures America's spirit of innovation and ingenuity.   To succeed in the 21st century, our Nation must be positioned to  unleash its full potential.   These energy and water investments will create good-paying jobs,  lower costs, and improve communities from the heartland to the coasts  as we intensify America's energy innovation, fortify water  infrastructure, and invigorate the essential work to sustain life on  Earth.   By advancing solar, hydrogen, and biofuel technologies, rebuilding  ports and waterways, conserving precious environmental ecosystems, we  are doing America's work, and we are reinvesting  [[Page H10061]]  in the forgotten corners of a deindustrialized Great Lakes region and  Appalachian coal fields that need new jobs and innovation.   Our bill responsibly delivers for America. In fact, we set our Nation  on a path toward a better, brighter, and more resilient future to be  energy, water, and nuclear secure.   Further, I am excited that our Great Lakes Authority legislation is  included in this omnibus. This new Federal instrumentality will unlock  our industrial heartland's full potential, and it is so much an honor  to be able to be a part of the team that passes this omnibus bill  today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro. I'd also like to  thank the staff who have dedicated superlative effort to this final  product, including Scott McKee, Brian Smith, Daniela Todesco, Nick  Montoni, and Steven Kappen on subcommittee and John Howes on my staff.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 23, 2022, on page H10522, in the first column, the  following appeared: DELAURO and LEAHY -- and Vice Chair SHELBY --  I urge a strong, bipartisan ``AYE'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair DELAURO. I'd also  like to thank the staff who    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Energy and Water funding of this bill captures America's spirit  of ingenuity and independence, especially energy security in  perpetuity. It provides $54.65 billion in critical investments in our  nation's water infrastructure and to combat climate change.   The bill provides $10.6 billion, $347 million over FY22, for water  infrastructure throughout the country through the Corps of Engineers  and Bureau of Reclamation. There is $2.374 billion in funding for  Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and Donor and Energy Transfer Ports.   The bill invests $15.3 billion, $1.2 billion over FY22, in clean  energy innovation to respond to the climate crisis. Notably, the  inclusion of $471 million for State and Community Energy Programs  allows DOE to more directly ``meet the streets,'' working with state,  local, and community-level partners to transform the high science of  our excellent national labs to communities where people live. Our goal  is to lower energy costs of hardworking American families and senior.   In addition, the Disaster supplemental includes $1.13 billion for the  Corps of Engineers to make necessary repairs to projects impacted by  hurricanes and other natural disasters and to construct projects that  will increase resiliency from future flooding and storms, including in  Puerto Rico. In addition, the Disaster Supplemental includes $1 billion  for the Department of Energy to strengthen Puerto Rico's electric grid  and assist vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in purchasing and  installing clean energy technologies.   The bill provides for a safe and secure nuclear deterrent while  addressing the threat of nuclear proliferation. Importantly our bill  protects our environment by funding legacy nuclear cleanup work. In  addition, the Ukraine supplemental provides $126 million to prepare for  and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine.  This funding is part of the omnibus' $45 billion in additional American  funding for Ukraine as she fights for Liberty.   Finally, the bill supports economic and community development, job  training, and critical infrastructure with $312 million directed to the  regional commissions. These Commissions and Authorities are vital  lifelines for places where economic and environmental revitalization  must be advanced.   Further, in far too many towns and cities, energy and water  innovation has languished and needs to be placed centerfold in regional  strategic plans to reboot economies where deindustrialization and  disinvestment are a major downdraft on economic growth. Innovation in  regional energy and water systems must serve as foundational to  economic growth.   Further, I am excited that our Great Lakes Authority legislation is  included in this omnibus. This new federal instrumentality will unlock  the Industrial and Freshwater Heartland's full potential for the  century ahead.   In sum, our bill invests in initiatives that will yield future  opportunities and new, good-paying jobs. Through innovative energy and  water investments, I am fully confident our nation will meet our  domestic challenges from coast to coast and propel our Nation into an  energy, waer, nuclear secure future.
