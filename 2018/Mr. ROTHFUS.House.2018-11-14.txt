 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of western  Pennsylvania native and war hero, Petty Officer Third Class Walter  ``Bert'' Mintus.   Hailing from Portage, Pennsylvania, in 1942, Bert enlisted in the  U.S. Navy and served as a radioman for Torpedo Squadron Fifty-One  during World War II. This was the same torpedo squadron in which our  41st President, George H.W. Bush, served during the war.   On July 27, 1944, during a mission over the Pacific, his aircraft  came under enemy fire from the Japanese and was shot down. Afterward,  Bert and his brothers in arms on the plane were listed as missing in  action and later presumed dead.   For nearly 74 years, the Mintus family was unsure of the fate that  befell their beloved family member. That changed this year. Thanks to  the diligent efforts of the U.S. Navy, this past June, Bert's remains  were identified; and last Thursday, Bert's family finally welcomed  their war hero home.   May God grant this son of western Pennsylvania eternal rest.                            ____________________
