 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the FIND Trafficking  Act.   Human trafficking is pervasive across the United States and the  world. My own home State of Michigan ranks in the top 10th of States  when it comes to this issue.   Sex and drug trafficking is a horrific experience for some of the  most vulnerable populations, including children and those who have  experienced trauma and violence in the past.   Human trafficking takes form in many ways, ways that we sometimes may  not even know exists. With virtual currency becoming more and more  common, along with the vast, unknown happenings on the dark web, it is  important for us to have access to information to stop this kind of  illegal trafficking.                                time  1730    We must find ways to limit financial options for those who seek to  exploit and harm others through trafficking. The FIND Trafficking Act  will allow us to understand virtual currencies and online marketplaces,  especially on the dark web, and how it has contributed to the rise of  sex and drug trafficking across this country.   With the popularity of virtual currency, it is important for us to  make sure that it is not being used for this in the fight against  trafficking. It is my hope that we all stand in support of this bill.   They can try to hide, Mr. Speaker, behind the dark web and these  faceless currencies, but under the leadership of Chairwoman Waters,  Member Vargas, and Member Wagner, we hope to find you and to stop you  from harming our residents.
