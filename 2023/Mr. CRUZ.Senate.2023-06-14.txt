 Reserving the right to object, I agree with the Senator  from New Hampshire that this position at the State Department is  important, and it should be filled by someone qualified and someone who  will use the position to stand up to the terrorists who target  Americans all across the world. Unfortunately, Ms. Richard--her record  makes her singularly unqualified for this post.    The Biden administration has put forward many troubling and radical  nominees during the past 2\1/2\ years. Indeed, the nominees who have  been put forth by this President are more extreme, are more radical  than any nominees I have ever seen in my lifetime.  [[Page S2083]]    I will say, unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues will rubberstamp  whatever radical is put on this floor, and they have demonstrated an  unwillingness to stand up and reject even the most extreme nominees  submitted.   If you look at Ms. Richard's record, and in particular her time as  Ambassador to Lebanon, her record, catastrophically, when it concerns  terrorists, is to downplay the threat of terrorists, to appease the  terrorists, and even, astonishingly, to fund the terrorists.   While in Lebanon, Ms. Richard established a clear record of  effectively boosting the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah. And for  all practical matters, her tenure as Ambassador demonstrates that she  aided and assisted Hezbollah rather than standing strong against them.   Let me give you three examples to demonstrate these points. Elizabeth  Richard shielded Hezbollah while we were fighting for Amer Fakhoury's  release. Ms. Richard consistently sought to downplay the threat posed  by Hezbollah.   Take the case of Amer Fakhoury, an American citizen who was held  hostage by the Hezbollah-controlled Lebanese Government while he was  dying of cancer. The Senator from New Hampshire knows this case well  because Mr. Fakhoury and his family are constituents of hers in the  State of New Hampshire. She and I worked together closely,  aggressively, fighting to secure his release from captivity. Amer  Fakhoury was an American citizen, a beloved family man, and a small  business owner who traveled to Lebanon in September of 2019. While he  was there, he was abducted; he was illegally detained; he was beaten;  and he was held hostage. He was suffering from stage IV cancer, and his  symptoms were exacerbated by the beatings that he received at the hands  of Lebanese security officials who were looking to extract a false  confession.   The Senator from New Hampshire and I came together to pressure the  Lebanese Government to free Mr. Fakhoury. Together, we introduced  legislation to impose sanctions that would have brought down the  Lebanese political class unless they immediately released him. When it  became public that Senator Shaheen and I, together, were advancing our  legislation toward passage in the Senate, Mr. Fakhoury was freed. Good  news. Success--a bipartisan success, freeing an American hostage in  captivity in Lebanon.   Unfortunately, Mr. Fakhoury passed away from cancer just 5 months  after he came home to the United States, but at least, together, we  were able to ensure that he did so surrounded by his family and not by  the Hezbollah-controlled Lebanese Government thugs who had held him  hostage.   Why did it take Senator Shaheen and me coming together on the floor  of the Senate to target the Lebanese Government and force them to  release an American hostage? Well, one of the significant reasons it  took action at the Senate level is because the U.S. Embassy in Beirut  and our Ambassador there were effectively running interference for the  Lebanese Government, were fighting against us and effectively running  interference for Hezbollah. And who was our Ambassador at the time?  Elizabeth Richard.   I want to read you what Mr. Fakhoury's family says about that and  what they say about President Biden's nomination of Ms. Richard. They  said:         As the family of the late U.S. hostage, Amer Fakhoury, we       are shocked by the news that Ambassador Richard is being       confirmed as the next counterterrorism [czar] in the State       Department. Our father would still be here today if the U.S.       embassy under Ambassador [Richard] prioritized an American       citizen's life first instead of catering to the Hezbollah       backed Lebanese government.    These are the words of the family of Amer Fakhoury, whom you see  here, constituents of the Senator from New Hampshire. And this is what  they say about the Senate and about the nominee whom the Senate is  being asked to confirm; that this is a nominee who is responsible for  accelerating the death of their father because she refused to stand up  to Hezbollah.   Second example. Ms. Richard did not just establish a record of  downplaying Hezbollah's terrorism. She also consistently sought to  appease the Iranian-controlled terror group. At the beginning of 2020,  the U.S. Armed Forces killed Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian regime arch- terrorist with blood on his hands of hundreds of American service men  and women whom he had murdered.   I will note that the Senate subsequently passed language that I  authored specifically praising President Trump and our Armed Forces for  the operation taking out Qasem Soleimani. The vote on the floor of the  Senate was 64 to 34. One of the ``yea'' votes was my colleague from New  Hampshire, Senator Shaheen. Meanwhile, the Trump administration sent a  quick response force to our Embassy in Lebanon to protect it from  retaliation by Iran and Hezbollah.   Yet again, American citizens' lives were in danger, and what did Ms.  Richard do? She secretly sent them away in defiance of the political  leadership of the State Department and behind the backs of Secretary  Pompeo and the State Department's No. 2 officer, both of whom had been  confirmed by this body. She secretly sent them away, directly  endangering lives of the men and women in our Embassy.   Now, why did she do that? Well, this deeply troubling incident was  first reported by Politico, and Politico explained her reasoning. First  and foremost, she said, she didn't want to antagonize Hezbollah.  Despite threats to the Embassy and despite an obligation to protect the  lives of the Americans who worked there, Ms. Richard left them exposed  and vulnerable because her policy over and over again was to appease  and avoid confronting Hezbollah.   Finally, Ms. Richard did not just downplay and appease terrorists; in  several cases during her tenure in Lebanon, she actively funded  Hezbollah allies.   One of the many corrupt branches of the Lebanese Government is the  Internal Security Forces or ISF. According to one Lebanon expert who  recently wrote about the group, they are ``the Hezbollah auxiliary  forces who run counterintelligence for the terror group.'' They do  Hezbollah's ``counterintelligence dirty work.''   What does that mean in plain language? It means that they break up  the Israeli spy networks and espionage rings that our allies use to  track Hezbollah's threats and Iran's threats. That is what they do. It  is what they have always done. Just recently, they announced that they  had broken up 17 Israeli networks. The damage was incalculable to the  safety and security of our friend and ally, the State of Israel, and  also to the safety and security of America. And in 2022, Hezbollah  publicly heaped praise on the ISF for all the work they do.   What did Ms. Richard do when she was in Lebanon? She pushed for  policies to fund and boost the ISF with American taxpayer dollars. She  even oversaw the building of the ISF academy, funded by American tax  dollars.   I wish we had a nominee for this post whom I could enthusiastically  support. I wish I were not obliged to come down and object to an  extreme nominee whose record demonstrates she is unfit and unqualified  to serve in this post, but unfortunately President Biden has not given  me that choice.   Having examined Ms. Richard's record, the only conclusion is that her  approach to counterterrorism consistently is to downplay terrorism, to  appease the terrorists, and even to fund terrorist groups and their  enablers. That approach is utterly disqualifying for a nominee for  Coordinator of Counterterrorism. It is a policy that has had terrible  consequences when she pursued it in the Middle East, and it would have  terrible consequences if she took it from Lebanon and applied it  globally, appeasing not just Hezbollah but every other terrorist on  Earth.   The Iranian regime right now--the Ayatollah right now--is pursuing  murderous terrorism, including against Americans, right now. The  Ayatollah right now has hired a hit team with the intention of  murdering the former Secretary of State of the United States, Mike  Pompeo. Secretary Blinken confirmed at the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, on my questioning, that the State Department is spending $2  million a month providing security to Secretary Pompeo because Iran is  actively trying to murder him.   We need a Coordinator of Counterterrorism who will stand up to Iran,  who will stand up to Hezbollah, who will stand up to Hamas, who will  stand up  [[Page S2084]]  to al-Qaida, who will stand up to al-Nusra, who will stand up to ISIS,  who will stand up to every terrorist in the world who seeks to murder  American citizens.   We need a Coordinator for Counterterrorism whose record is not so  extreme that the grieving family of a hostage is telling the Senate:         Our father would still be here today if the U.S. embassy       under Ambassador [Richard] prioritized an American citizen's       life first instead of catering to the Hezbollah backed       Lebanese government.    For these reasons, I object.    Mr. President, this week the Senate unanimously passed my  bipartisan legislation to rename the street in front of the Cuban  Embassy in Washington, DC, ``Oswaldo Paya Way.''   Oswaldo Paya was a dissident and a fighter for freedom in Cuba of  unrelenting passion and dedication. He was someone who stood up against  the Castro regime. He had incredible courage. He spoke up for human  rights. He spoke up for free speech. He spoke up for democracy. And 11  years ago, Oswaldo Paya was murdered by the Cuban communist government.   On July 22, 2012, Paya left his house with three other people,  including Harold Cepero, to go visit friends. From the start of the  journey, their car was followed. On the way, the Cuban security  services drove Paya's car off the road, killing both him and Cepero.   There has never been any doubt about who was responsible for these  murders. Indeed, just this week, the Inter-American Commission on Human  Rights released its long-awaited report on the case. The determination  was clear and conclusive in confirming what we have known all along.   Paya had long been a thorn in the side of the Castros and the regime,  even from a young age. He was the only person at school who refused to  join the Communist Youth. As a teenager, he publicly opposed the  communist crackdown on protesters in Czechoslovakia who were fighting  for freedom, and he was punished with 3 years in prison.   Paya went on to found the Varela Project, which sought a referendum  on Cuba's communist system. Their demands were simple: democratic  government, religious liberty, freedom of expression, and the economic  freedom to start businesses. Paya managed to get 11,000 signatures to  support the Valera Project to petition the regime to hold a referendum.  And, eventually, over 20,000 people supported the cause, but the Cuban  regime refused to hold it.   Paya's fight for freedom made him a target of the Communist Party in  Cuba. They harassed him. They tried to intimidate him. They arrested  him numerous times and, ultimately, they murdered him.   Paya's friend and the driver of the car said that when he awoke after  the crash, he was confronted at the hospital by a regime operative, and  the hospital was flooded with uniformed military personnel. Under  extreme duress, drugged, and threatened with death by regime officials,  he signed a document falsely exonerating the regime.   That is how important it was to the communists to immediately try to  hide their crimes and avoid accountability. It is imperative that they  fail in this task.   I am heartened that, yesterday, the Senate unanimously passed this  bipartisan legislation that I led to rename the street in front of the  Cuban Embassy here in Washington, DC, after Paya.   I want to thank Senator Durbin, who led this effort with me, along  with Senator Rubio, Senator Menendez, Senator Rick Scott, and Senator  Cardin--all who joined with me in this bipartisan effort. This week the  Senate spoke in one unanimous voice, and it was a voice speaking out  for freedom.   I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of Paya's daughter, Rosa  Maria, who has fought tenaciously and never wavered in pursuing and  advocating her father's legacy. She is an incredible, courageous,  powerful leader in her own right, and together we have sat down and  discussed ways of advancing the cause of justice in Cuba. We will  continue doing so.   This is the second time that the Senate has passed this bipartisan  legislation. In the previous Congress, the House of Representatives  declined to take it up. But I urge our colleagues in the House to take  it up and pass it this year, and I have a high level of confidence that  the House will do that. We need to make this a law, to put it on Joe  Biden's desk, and to rename the street outside of the Cuban Embassy.   Now, when we change the street name, we are not merely changing  signs. It can be a reminder--indeed, a forceful one--that shines a  light of truth on the regime. Changing the name of the street means  that anyone who wants to write to the Cuban Embassy will have to write  Oswaldo Paya's name, or, if you need to go there, you will have to look  up the address and see his name. Members of the Cuban regime who deal  with the embassy will have to acknowledge that Paya existed. Their  efforts to erase his existence and his legacy failed.   I have told this story before, but it is worth retelling because it  illustrates just how much of an impact renaming a street in front of an  embassy can be.   A few years ago, I introduced legislation to rename the street in  front of the Chinese Embassy ``Liu Xiaobo Plaza,'' after the famed  Nobel peace laureate and democracy activist in China who was wrongfully  imprisoned in China.   After multiple iterations on the Senate floor, my bill ended up  passing the Senate--a Democrat Senate with a Democrat majority. My bill  passed the Senate unanimously. Unfortunately, the House of  Representatives failed to take that bill up as well. It was  infuriating.   However, at the beginning of the Trump administration, in 2017, I was  having breakfast with Rex Tillerson, then the new Secretary of State,  at his office at Foggy Bottom. We were talking about the challenges  facing America, and he had recently just met with his counterpart, the  Chinese Foreign Minister.   Secretary Tillerson said that the Foreign Minister from China told  him that China had three critical foreign policies, at which point Rex  shook his head and said: Ted, it was the damndest thing. One of their  top three priorities was stopping you from renaming the street in front  of their Embassy in DC.   That is how concerned--that is how terrified--Xi and his communist  cronies were of the world being reminded on a daily basis about Liu  Xiaobo.   Ultimately, I told Secretary Tillerson the following, which is that  Liu Xiaobo had passed away at that point but that his widow, Liu Xia,  was  [[Page S2093]]  still in China. China would not let her leave. She had never gone to  collect the over $1 million that she was due for her husband winning  the Nobel Peace Prize.   So I told Secretary Tillerson: You tell the Chinese Government, if  they release Liu Xia--if they allow her to leave and escape to  freedom--I will stop pushing this particular bill, but if they don't, I  will keep pushing it, and we will pass it into law. You can let him  know it is not a bluff, because I have already passed it unanimously  through the Senate once and will do it again, and this time the House  will pass it as well.   Within a matter of weeks, the communist government in China released  Liu Xia and let her escape. That is how powerful shining a light of  truth on a despotic regime can be.   Renaming the street outside of the Cuban Embassy sends a powerful  message to the Cuban people that their struggle for freedom will not go  unnoticed or be forgotten; that the world is watching, and their heroic  efforts are not in vain. Their fight for freedom resonates deeply with  people across the globe.   By passing this legislation, the U.S. Senate has made a powerful  statement of solidarity with the people of Cuba and is a resolute  condemnation of the oppressive regime that silenced a brave voice for  freedom. The Senate has spoken with one voice, and that voice has  demanded ``Cuba libre''--a free Cuba--an end to the totalitarian and  despotic state.   I urge our colleagues in the House to take up this bill and pass this  bipartisan legislation swiftly.   Let us come together as one, as the U.S. Congress, and force the  communist regime to do what utterly terrifies them--to say Oswaldo  Paya's name--to say his name.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
