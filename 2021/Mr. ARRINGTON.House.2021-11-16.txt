 Mr. Speaker, I can't for the life of me understand why  my Democrat colleagues insist on passing this multitrillion-dollar  monstrosity of a tax-and-spend bill that not only I, but the American  people believe will be an economic and societal disaster on so many  levels.   Mr. Speaker, the American people have spoken in countless polls and  surveys and elections, not just in Virginia, New York, and New Jersey,  but in my State of Texas where House seats have flipped from Democrat  to Republican for the first time ever. As recent as last week, a  Democrat changed parties to Republican because they cannot explain the  current policies that are destructive to the ends of recovery and  support the American people's freedom and our way of life.   They said as clearly as they can: No more Big Government control over  our lives. That is what they said in Virginia. No more socialist  spending our country into bankruptcy. No more growing the government at  the expense of our freedoms and our children's future.   Mr. Speaker, Virginia, a blue State, one-third of the electorate said  the economy was their number one issue. Biden won that by 10 points.  They voted for a Republican Governor. Two-thirds of the American people  in recent polls have said that the Biden economic plans are bad and  they have no confidence in his policies. They connect his policies with  the current economic conditions. The majority of Americans attribute  the inflation to Biden's failed policies, just like they do the  disastrous border and the debacle in Afghanistan and in the generic  ballot. The generic ballot among registered voters, there is a 10-point  spread, if the elections were held today, between Democrats and  Republicans. That is the highest in 40 years ever recorded.   The American people are speaking and they are crying out to their  country's leaders: Relent. Relent. But they have made the connection  between the policies and the disastrous effects in their lives and in  the life of their country.   Enhanced employment benefits, in other words, paying people more to  be on unemployment than to be at work, coupled with wasteful partisan  multitrillion-dollar spending packages under the guise of COVID relief  have created an economic firestorm, runaway inflation.   Real wages, 7 of the 9 months this President has been in office, have  gone down. Real wages have gone down. There has been an inflation surge  to the point of double-digit inflation in the last month, which have  put us, over the year, at a 30-year high.   Gas prices are up 50 percent. We are almost a million jobs short of  what President Biden promised as a result of that blue State bailout  that he called COVID relief. This is the solution that the Democrats  are offering.   Let's raise prices even more and lower wages by taxing the American  people.   Let's further extend our recession by chasing jobs overseas and  putting the highest tax rates in the developed world on the job  creators of the United States of America.   Let's burden small businesses with higher taxes and less people  willing to work.   Let's drive labor participation further down by removing the work  requirement.   Let's trap more people in poverty and the cycle of dependency on  government by removing the incentives to work.   Let's wipe out 20 or 30 percent of the workforce by thrusting a Big  Government mandate that is unconstitutional, overreaching, and would  destroy any prospects for recovery.   Mr. Speaker, this was supposed to be about income inequality, but if  you read the tax bill--and I don't know how my progressive colleagues  can look the American people in the eyes with a straight face and say  that this is not a swampy, special-interest package of the century,  because they have tax breaks for the wealthy by raising the SALT  deductions. They give tax breaks to green industry, to unions, to  plaintiffs' attorneys, to media corporations. That is all legitimate.  That is all true.   If you look close enough, that is what this is about. Not to mention  they stuffed the stocking with early Christmas presents for  progressives and political allies of the Democratic Party--amnesty for  8 million people while our southern border is melting down;  unionization of every employee, every employer, every State in the  country; Obamacare subsidies for people making hundreds of thousands of  dollars.   Mr. Speaker, the list is too long. I implore my Democrat colleagues  to relent and stop this. Let's get back to work on behalf of the  American people.                            ____________________
