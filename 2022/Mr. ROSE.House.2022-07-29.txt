 Mr. Speaker, the United States has officially entered a  recession thanks to the out-of-touch economic policies of President  Biden and congressional Democrats.   Since the day Democrats gained control of our government, having  majorities in the House, Senate, and a Democratic President in the  White House, fiscally conservative Members of Congress like myself have  been sounding the alarms on this reckless deficit spending that got us  in this mess.   Now, it looks like it will be Republicans tasked with getting us out  of this recession, as the American people are fed up with Democrats'  economic policies that are causing record-breaking inflation and now a  recession.   If and when Republicans gain control of the House, I can assure you  the first thing we will do is stop the out-of-control and wasteful  spending enacted under a complete Democratic control of Washington.  Hopefully, by then, the President will come to his senses and work with  Republicans to get us back on track.                            ____________________
