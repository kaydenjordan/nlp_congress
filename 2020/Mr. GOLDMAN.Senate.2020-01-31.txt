 What did you understand him to mean by the       drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?        Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.         Did you go to see the lawyers?        Dr. HILL. I certainly did.        Mr. Manager SCHIFF. What I want to ask you about is, he       makes reference in that drug deal to a drug deal cooked up by       you and Mulvaney. It's the reference to Mulvaney that I want       to ask you about. You've testified that Mulvaney was aware of       this quid pro quo, of this condition that the Ukrainians had       to meet, that is, announcing these public investigations to       get the White House meeting. Is that right?        Ambassador SONDLAND. Yeah. A lot of people were aware of it       . . .        Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Including Mr. Mulvaney.        Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Remarkably, the President is still denying the  facts, even as they argue that if it is true, it is still not  impeachable. But if the President did nothing wrong, if he held up the  aid because of so-called corruption or burden-sharing reasons, he  should want his chief of staff to come testify under oath before this  distinguished body and say just that.   Why doesn't he want Mulvaney to appear before the United States  Senate? Well, we know the answer--because Mr. Mulvaney will confirm the  corrupt shakedown scheme because Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop.   Everyone was in the loop.   As Ambassador Sondland summarized in his testimony on July 19, he  emailed several top administration officials, including Mr. Mulvaney,  that President Zelensky was prepared to receive POTUS's call and would  ``assure'' President Trump that ``he intends to run a fully transparent  investigation and will `turn over every stone.'''   Mr. Mulvaney replied: ``I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.''   The above email seems clear. Ambassador Sondland testified that it  was clear; that he was confirming to Mr. Mulvaney that he had told  President Zelensky he had to tell President Trump on that July 25 call  that he would announce the investigation, which he explained was a  reference to one of the two phony political investigations that  President Trump wanted. And Mr. Mulvaney replies that he will set up  the meeting--consistent with the agreement that Sondland explained he  reached with Mr. Mulvaney to condition a meeting on the investigations.   But if there is any uncertainty, if there is any lingering questions  about what this means, let's just question Mick Mulvaney under oath.   Mr. Mulvaney also matters because we have heard several questions  from this distinguished body of Senators wanting to understand when or  why or how the President ordered the hold on the security aid. As the  head of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Mulvaney has unique  insights into all of these questions--your questions.   Remember that email exchange between Mr. Mulvaney and his Deputy, Rob  Blair, on June 27, when Mulvaney asked Blair about whether they could  implement the hold and Blair responded that it could be done but that  Congress would become ``unhinged''?   It wasn't just Congress. It was the independent Government  Accountability Office that determined that the President's hold  violated the law. But, if the President's counsel is going to argue-- without evidence--that he withheld the aid as part of U.S. foreign  policy, it seems to make sense that the Senate should hear directly  from Mr. Mulvaney, who has firsthand knowledge of exactly these facts.  He said so himself.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. MULVANEY: Again, I was involved with the process by       which the money was held up temporarily, okay?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Why doesn't President Trump want Mick Mulvaney  to testify? Why?   Perhaps here is why:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Answer. Did he also mention to me in the past that the       corruption related to the DNC server, absolutely. No question       about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the       money.        Question. So the demand for an investigation into the       Democrats was part of the reason that he wanted to withhold       funding to Ukraine.        Answer. The look back to what happened in 2016--        Question. The investigation into Democrats--        Answer.--certainly was part of the thing that he was       worried about in corruption with that nation. That is       absolutely appropriate.        Question. But to be clear, what you just described is a       quid pro quo. It is: Funding will not flow unless the       investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.        Answer. We do that all the time with foreign policy. We       were holding the money at the same time for--what was it? The       Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid to the       Northern Triangle countries so that they would change their       policies on immigration. By the way, and this speaks to an       important--I'm sorry? This speaks to an important point,       because I heard this yesterday and I can never remember the       gentleman whose testimony--Was it McKinney, the guy--was that       his name? I don't know him. He testified yesterday. And if       you go--and if you believe those reports--okay? Because we've       not seen any transcripts of this. The only transcript I've       seen was Sondland's testimony this morning. If you read the       news reports and you believe them--what did McKinney say       yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he was really       upset with the political influence in foreign policy. That       was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have       news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be       political influence in foreign policy.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Is that what the Constitution requires--``Get  over it''? Is that good enough for this body, the world's greatest  deliberative body--``Get over it''?   The President's counsel can try to emphasize Mr. Mulvaney and his  attorneys' efforts to walk back this statement, but, as you have seen  with your own eyes, the statement was unequivocal. And even when given  the chance in real time on that day, on October 17, to deny a quid pro  quo, he doubled down. ``Get over it,'' he said.   But if you have any questions about what the real answer is and where  the truth lies, there is only one way to find out: Let's all just  question Mr. Mulvaney under oath during the Senate trial. After all,  counsel said that cross-examination was the greatest vehicle in the  history of American jurisprudence ever invented to ascertain the  truth--your standard.   Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the importance of Mr. Blair  and Mr. Duffey to this case.   The President's lawyers have argued that withholding foreign aid is  entirely within his right as Commander in Chief; that this was a  normal, ordinary decision; and that this is all just one big policy  disagreement.   We have proven exactly the opposite. This can't be a policy  disagreement because the President's hold actually went against U.S.  policy. The hold was undertaken outside of the normal channels by a  President who, they admit, was not conducting policy. The hold was  concealed not only from Congress but from the President's own officials  responsible for Ukraine policy,  [[Page S759]]  and, most importantly, the hold violated the law.   The President has the right to make policy, but he does not have the  right to break the law and coerce an ally into helping him cheat in our  free and fair elections, and he doesn't have a right to use hundreds of  millions of dollars in taxpayer funds as leverage to get political dirt  on an American citizen who happens to be his political opponent.   But if you remain unsure about all of this, who better to ask than  Mr. Blair or Mr. Duffey? They oversaw and executed the process of  withholding the aid. They can tell us exactly how unrelated to business  as usual this whole shakedown scheme was when it was underway. They can  testify about why the aid was withheld and whether there was any  legitimate explanation for withholding it. Some of you have asked that  very question.   Multiple officials--including Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor,  David Holmes, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, Jennifer Williams, and Mark  Sandy--all testified that they were never given a credible explanation  for the hold. So let's ask Mr. Blair and let's ask Mr. Duffey if this  happens all the time, as Mick Mulvaney suggests. Why, at this time, in  connection with this scheme, were all of those witnesses left in the  dark?   Despite the President's refusal to produce a single document and to  produce a shred of information in this impeachment inquiry undertaken  in the House, his administration did produce 192 pages of Ukraine- related email records in Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, albeit in  heavily redacted form. These documents confirm Mr. Duffey's central  role in executing the hold. He is on nearly every single impeachment  release--nearly every single email.   Here is an important email from that production.   Just 90 minutes after the July 25 call, Mr. Duffey emailed officials  at the Department of Defense that they should ``hold off on any  additional DOD obligations of these funds.'' Mr. Duffey added that the  request was ``sensitive'' and that they should keep this information  ``closely held.'' The timing is important because if the aid wasn't  linked to the July 25 call and if it wasn't related, why the sensitive,  closely held request made within 2 hours of that call? Let's just ask  Mr. Duffey.   Mr. Duffey and Mr. Blair can testify about the concerns raised by DOD  to the Office of Management and Budget about the illegality of the hold  and why it remained in place even after DOD warned the administration  that it would violate the Impoundment Control Act.    Now, the President, of course, has disputed this fact, but we have  demonstrated that OMB was warned repeatedly by DOD officials of two  things: first, continuing to withhold the aid would prevent the  Department of Defense from spending the money before the end of the  fiscal year, and second, the hold was potentially illegal, as turned  out to be the case.   By August 9, DOD told Mr. Duffey directly that DOD--the Department of  Defense--could no longer support the Office of Management and Budget's  claims that the hold would ``not preclude timely execution'' of the aid  for Ukraine, our vulnerable ally at war with Russian-backed  separatists. Yet, as Mr. Duffey reportedly told Ms. McCusker at the  Department of Defense on August 30, there was a ``clear direction from  POTUS to continue to hold''--clear direction from the President of the  United States to continue the hold. So how did Mr. Duffey understand  the ``clear direction'' to continue the hold? Why is the President  claiming that this wasn't unlawful when DOD--the Department of  Defense--repeatedly warned his administration that it was? Wouldn't we  all like to ask Mr. Duffey these questions?   Finally, here is another reason why we know this was not business as  usual. On July 29, Mr. Duffey--a political appointee with zero relevant  experience--abruptly seized responsibility for withholding the aid from  Mark Sandy, a career Office of Management and Budget official--seized  the responsibility from a career official. Mr. Duffey provided no  credible explanation for that decision.   Mr. Sandy testified that nothing like that had ever happened in his  entire governmental career. Let's think about that. If this is as  routine as the President claims, why is a career official saying he has  never seen anything like this happen before? Mr. Duffey knows why.  Shouldn't we just take the time to ask him?   The American people deserve a fair trial. The Constitution deserves a  fair trial. The President deserves a fair trial. A fair trial means  witnesses. A fair trial means documents. A fair trial means evidence.  No one is above the law.   I yield to my distinguished colleague, Manager Lofgren.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, it is not just  about hearing from witnesses; you need documents. The documents don't  lie. There are specific documents relevant to this impeachment trial in  the custody of the White House, OMB, DOD, and the State Department, and  the President has hidden them from us.   I am not going to go through each category again in detail, but here  are some observations.   This is, of course, an impeachment case against the President of the  United States. Nothing could be more important. And the most important  documents--documents that go directly to who knew what when--are being  held by the executive branch.   Many of these records are at the White House. The White House has  records about the phone calls with President Zelensky, about scheduling  an Oval Office meeting with President Zelensky, about the President's  decision to hold security assistance, about communications among his  top aides, and about concerns raised by public officials with legal  counsel. We have heard about Ambassador Bolton's handwritten notes and  book manuscript and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's Presidential policy  memorandum. We know of reports about a number of emails in early August  trying to create after-the-fact justifications for the hold, but we  haven't seen any of them. They are at the White House being hidden by  the President. I think it is a coverup.   Documents are also at the State Department, records about the recall  of Ambassador Yovanovitch, about Giuliani's efforts for the President,  about concerns raised about the hold, about the Ukrainian reaction to  the hold and when exactly they learned about it, and about negotiations  with the Ukrainians for an Oval Office meeting. We know about  Ambassador Taylor's first-person cable and notes and Mr. Kent's memos  to file. We know about Mr. Sondland's emails with Pompeo and Brechbuhl  and Mulvaney and Perry, but we haven't seen them. They are sitting in  the State Department.   DOD and OMB also have records--records about President Trump's hold  on military aid to Ukraine, about the justification for the hold, about  hiding the hold from Congress and trying to justify the hold after the  fact, and about why the hold was lifted, but we haven't seen them. They  are at DOD and OMB. Why haven't we seen them? Because the President  directed all his agencies not to produce them.   This trial should not reward the President's really unprecedented  obstruction by allowing him to control what evidence you see and what  will remain hidden. You should ask for these documents on behalf of the  American people, and you should ask for these documents to get the  truth yourself.   Now, let's come back to the issue of delay, since the President's  lawyers have suggested that having witnesses and documents would make  this trial take too long. There will be lengthy court battles, they  say. The President might even invoke executive privilege for the very  first time in this entire impeachment process. It would be better, we  are told, to skip straight to the final verdict, to break from  centuries of precedent and end this trial without hearing from a single  witness and without reviewing a single document that the President  ordered hidden. Respectfully, that shouldn't happen.   House managers aren't interested in delaying these proceedings. We  are interested in the full truth; in a trial that is fair to the  parties and to the American people; in the facts that the President's  counsel agrees are so critical to this trial. It is why we said we  [[Page S760]]  won't go to court; we will follow all the rulings of the Chief Justice.  We can get the witness depositions done in a week. In fact, I know we  can because if you, the Senators, order it, that is the law. You have  the sole power to try impeachments.    If questions or objections come up, including objections based on  executive privilege, the Senate itself and the Chief Justice, in the  first instance, can resolve them. We aren't suggesting that the  President waive executive privilege. We simply suggest that the Chief  Justice can resolve issues related to any assertion of executive  privilege.   As the Supreme Court recognized in the case of Judge Walter Nixon,  judges will stay out of disputes over how the Senate exercises its sole  power to try impeachments. That ensures there will be no unnecessary  delay, and it is why we propose we suspend the trial for 1 week, and  that during that time, you go back to business as usual. While the  trial is suspended, we will take witness depositions and review the  documents that are provided at your direction.   The four witnesses you should hear from are readily available.  Ambassador Bolton has already said he will appear. We can and would  move quickly to depose these witnesses within a week of the issuance of  subpoenas. The documents, too, are ready to be produced. We are ready  to review them quickly and to present additional evidence. Meanwhile,  the Senate can continue going about its important legislative work, as  it did during the depositions in the Clinton impeachment trial.   The President's opposition to this suggestion says a lot. The  President is the architect of the very delay he warns against. He could  easily avoid it. He could move things along. He could stop trying to  silence witnesses and hide evidence. I think he is afraid the truth  will come out. He hopes his threats of continued delay, however  unjustified, will cause you to throw up your hands and give up on a  fair trial. Please don't give up. This is too important for our  democracy.   A decision to forgo witnesses and documents at this trial would be a  big departure from Senate precedent. When the Senate investigated  Watergate, it heard from the highest White House officials. That  happened because a bipartisan majority of the Senate insisted. We got  to the truth then because the Senate came together and put a fair  proceeding above party loyalty.   We should all want the truth, and so we ask you to do it again--that  you put aside any politics, party loyalty. Believe in your President,  which we understand and sympathize with, but subpoena the documents and  the witnesses necessary to make this a fair trial, to hear and see the  evidence you need to impartially administer justice.   Now, there has been a lot of discussion of executive privilege during  this trial. Even if the President asserts executive privilege-- something he has not yet done--it wouldn't harm the President's legal  rights or cause undue delay.   Here is why. Let's focus on John Bolton, since this week's  revelations confirm the importance of his testimony.   First, as a private citizen, John Bolton is fully protected by the  First Amendment if he wants to testify. There is no basis for imposing  prior restraint for censoring him just because some of his testimony  could include conversations with the President. That is commonplace. As  long as his testimony isn't classified, it is shielded by the free  speech clause of the First Amendment.   Ambassador Bolton has written a book. It is inconceivable that he is  forbidden from telling the U.S. Senate, sitting as a High Court of  Impeachment, information that shortly will be in print.   If the President did attempt to invoke executive privilege, he would  fail. It is true for separate reasons. First, claims of executive  privilege always involve a balancing of interests. The Supreme Court  confirmed in U.S. v. Nixon--the Nixon tapes case--that executive  privilege can be overcome by a need for evidence in a criminal trial.  That is even more true here in an impeachment trial of the President of  the United States, which is probably the most important interest under  the Constitution. It would certainly outweigh any claim of privilege.   Precedent confirms the point. To name just a few, National Security  Advisors for President Carter, Zbigniew Brzezinski; President Clinton,  Samuel Berger; President George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice; and  President Obama, Susan Rice, testified in congressional investigations.  These advisors discussed their communications with top government  officials, including the Presidents they served. There is no reason why  all of these officials could testify in the normal course of events and  hearings, but Ambassador Bolton, a former official, couldn't testify in  the most important trial there could possibly be.   The second reason is the President waived any claim of executive  privilege about Ambassador Bolton's testimony. All 17 witnesses  testified in the House about these matters without any assertion of  privilege by the President.   President Trump, as well as his lawyers and senior officials, have  publicly discussed and tweeted about these issues at some length. The  President has also directly denied reports about what Ambassador Bolton  will say in his forthcoming book. Under these circumstances, the  President cannot be allowed to tell his version of his story to the  public while using executive privilege to silence a key witness who  would contradict him. You shouldn't let the President escape  responsibility only to later see clearly what happened in Ambassador  Bolton's book.   There are no national security risks here. The President has  declassified the two phone calls with President Zelensky. All 17  witnesses testified about the President's conduct regarding Ukraine. We  aren't interested in asking about anything other than Ukraine. That is  simply a bogus argument.   The Constitution uses the words ``sole power'' only twice: first,  when it gives the House sole power to impeach; and, second, article 1,  section 3, where it gives the Senate sole power to try impeachments.    Here is what it says:         The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all       Impeachments. . . . When the President of the United States       is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.    Now, I think that provision in the Constitution means something. It  is up to the Senate to decide how to try this impeachment with  fairness, with witnesses, and documents.   Privileges asserted can be decided using the process that you devise.  That is not unconstitutional. It is what the Constitution provides.   You have the power. You decide. Please decide for a fair trial that  would yield the truth and serve our Constitution and the American  people.   I yield now to Manager Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, before we yield to counsel for the  President, I would like to take a moment by talking about what I think  is at stake here. A ``no'' vote on the question before you will have  long-lasting and harmful consequences long after this impeachment trial  is over.   We agree with the President's counsel on this much: This will set a  new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point  to the end of history. You can bet in every impeachment that follows,  whether it is a Presidential impeachment or the impeachment of a judge,  if that judge or President believes that it is to his or her advantage  that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case  of Donald J. Trump. They will make the argument that you can adjudicate  the guilt or innocence of the party who is accused without hearing from  a single witness, without reviewing a single document. And I would  submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we  will all have to live with.   President Trump's wholesale obstruction of Congress strikes at the  heart of our Constitution and democratic system of separation of  powers. Make no mistake. The President's actions in this impeachment  inquiry constitute an attack on congressional oversight on the coequal  nature of this branch of government, not just on the House but on the  Senate's ability, as well, to conduct its oversight, to serve as a  check and balance on this President and every President that follows.   If the Senate allows President Trump's obstruction to stand, it  effectively nullifies the impeachment power. It will allow future  Presidents to decide whether they want their misconduct to be  investigated or not,  [[Page S761]]  whether they would like to participate in an impeachment investigation  or not. That is a power of the Congress. That is not a power of the  President. By permitting a categorical obstruction, it turns the  impeachment power against itself.   How we respond to this unprecedented obstruction will shape future  debates between our branches of government and the executive forever.  And it is not just impeachment. The ability of Congress to conduct  meaningful and probing oversight--oversight that, by its nature, is  intended to be a check and balance on the awesome powers of the  executive branch--hinges on our willingness to call witnesses and  compel documents that President Trump is hiding with no valid  justification, no precedential support.   If we tell the President, effectively, ``You can act corruptly, you  can abuse the powers of your office to coerce a foreign government to  helping you cheat in an election by withholding military aid, and when  you are caught, you can further abuse your powers by concealing the  evidence of your wrongdoing,'' the President becomes unaccountable to  anyone. Our government is no longer a government with three coequal  branches. The President effectively, for all intents and purposes,  becomes above the law.   This is, of course, the opposite of what the Framers intended. They  purposely entrusted the power of impeachment to the legislative branch  so that it may protect the American people from a President who  believes that he can do whatever he wants.   So we must consider how our actions will reverberate for decades to  come and the impact they will have on the functioning of our democracy.  And as we consider this critical decision, it is important to remember  that no matter what you decide to do here, whether you decide to hear  witnesses and relevant testimony, the facts will come out in the end.  Even over the course of this trial, we have seen so many additional  facts come to light. The facts will come out. In all of their horror,  they will come out, and there are more court documents and deadlines  under the Freedom of Information Act. Witnesses will tell their stories  in future congressional hearings, in books, and in the media. This week  has made that abundantly clear.   The documents the President is hiding will come out. The witnesses  the President is concealing will tell their stories. And we will be  asked why we didn't want to hear that information when we had the  chance, when we could consider its relevance and importance in making  this most serious decision. What answer shall we give if we do not  pursue the truth now, if we allow it to remain hidden until it is too  late to consider on the profound issue of the President's innocence or  guilt?   What we are asking you to do on behalf of the American people is  simple: Use your sole power to try this impeachment by holding a fair  trial. Get the documents they refuse to provide to the House. Hear the  witnesses they refuse to make available to the House, just as this body  has done in every single impeachment trial until now.   Let the American people know that you understand they deserve the  truth. Let them know you still care about the truth, that the truth  still matters.   Though much divides us, on this we should agree: A trial, stripped of  all its trappings, should be a search for the truth, and that requires  witnesses and testimony.   Now, you may have seen just this afternoon, the President's former  Chief of Staff, General Kelly, said ``a Senate trial without witnesses  is a job only half done.'' A trial without witnesses is only half a  trial. Well, I have to say I can't agree. A trial without witnesses is  no trial at all. You either have a trial or you don't. And if you are  going to have a real trial, you need to hear from the people who have  firsthand information. Now, we have presented some of them to you, but  you know as well as we there are others that you should hear from.    Let me close this portion with words, I think, more powerful than  General Kelly's. They come from John Adams, who in 1776 wrote: Together  with the right to vote, those who wrote our Constitution considered the  right to trial by jury ``the heart and lungs, the mainspring and the  center wheel'' of our liberties, without which ``the body must die, the  watch must run down, the government must become arbitrary.''   Now, what does that mean? Without a fair trial, the government must  become arbitrary. Now, of course, he is talking about the right of an  average citizen to a trial by jury.   Well, if in courtrooms all across America, when someone is tried but  they are a person of influence and power, they can declare at the  beginning of the trial ``If the government's case is so good, let them  prove it without witnesses''; if people of power and influence can  insist to the judge that the House, that the prosecutors, that the  government, that the people must prove their case without witnesses or  documents, a right reserved only for the powerful--because, you know,  only Donald Trump--only Donald Trump, of any defendant in America can  insist on a trial with no witnesses--if that should be true in courts  throughout the land, then, as Adams wrote, the government becomes  arbitrary because whether you have a fair trial or no trial at all  depends on whether you are a person of power and influence like Donald  J. Trump.   The body will die. The clock will run down. And our government  becomes arbitrary. The importance of a fair trial here is not less than  in every courtroom in America; it is greater than in any courtroom in  America because we set the example for America.   I said at the outset, and I will repeat again: Your decision on guilt  or innocence is important, but it is not the most important decision.  If we have a fair trial, however that trial turns out, whatever your  verdict may be, at least we can agree we had a fair trial. At least we  can agree that the House had a fair opportunity to present its case. At  least we can agree that the President had a fair opportunity to present  their case--if we have a fair trial. And we can disagree about the  verdict, but we can all agree the system worked as it was intended. We  had a fair trial, and we reached a decision.   Rob this country of a fair trial, and there can be no representation  that the verdict has any meaning. How could it, if the result is baked  in by the process? Assure the American people, whatever the result may  be, that at least they got a fair shake.   There is a reason why the American people want to hear from  witnesses, and it is not just about curiosity. It is because they  recognize that in every courtroom in America that is just what happens.  And if it doesn't happen here, the government has become arbitrary;  there is one person who is entitled to a different standard, and that  is the President of the United States. And that is the last thing the  Founders intended.   Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the balance of our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
