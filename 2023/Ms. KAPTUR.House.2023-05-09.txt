 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a bipartisan  resolution introduced with my Ohio colleague,  Bob Latta, proclaiming  May 5 to May 14 as the National American Birding Week.   Birding in our abundant Great Lakes region's western basin of Lake  Erie draws environmental stewards from around the world during this  time of year.   Birding generates over $40 million in economic benefits annually, and  events such as the Biggest Week in American Birding sponsored by the  Black Swamp Bird Observatory in Oak Harbor, Ohio, leverage public- private partnerships to promote conservation of migratory bird  populations and economic development through nature tourism, research,  education, and outreach.   In fact, these little creatures can teach us a great deal about the  health of Mother Earth.   American Birding Week will send a strong endorsement from birders  around the world who flock to our region of northwest Ohio every year.  Birders worldwide who attend events such as the Biggest Week in  American Birding support efforts to preserve migratory bird populations  and what they teach us about our fragile ecosystem.                            ____________________
