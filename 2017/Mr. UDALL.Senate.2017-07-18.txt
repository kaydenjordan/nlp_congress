 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, thank you for your recognition.   Let me just say, at the beginning, I thank the Chair for the  bipartisanship with which we both work on the Indian Affairs Committee.  I very much appreciate that.   We are here with a few Members. I rise with my colleagues from the  Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. I think Senator Heitkamp, Senator  Franken, and, maybe, others will join us. I join them in reminding the  Congress of its duty to Tribes and in its standing up for the  healthcare of American Indians and Alaska Natives across Indian  Country.   Most of us are aware of the health disparities facing Native  communities. We have seen the news about the failings of the Indian  Health Service, and many of us have heard directly from Tribal leaders  and Native constituents about the barriers to healthcare access on  reservations, pueblos, and in villages, but the Members of the Senate  on the Indian Affairs Committee are uniquely aware of the complex ways  that the Tribal healthcare system works and how those systems will be  catastrophically disrupted by TrumpCare and the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act.   The U.S. Government has a trust responsibility to provide American  Indians and Alaska Natives with comprehensive, quality healthcare. The  U.S. Constitution, treaties, and long-settled legal precedents are the  basis for this responsibility. The Indian Health Service is the primary  agency for fulfilling this obligation, but our trust responsibilities  do not end there. The Medicaid and Medicare Program, Planned  Parenthood, and other public health services all play key roles in the  delivery of Native healthcare, and because the IHS is so consistently  and severely underfunded, the ACA has made a huge difference.   Each fiscal year, the IHS receives a finite allocation of  discretionary funding that it must stretch in order to meet the  healthcare needs of 2.2 million Native Americans. That leaves the IHS  with just over $3,500 per person--less than one-third of the national  average--for healthcare spending. As a result, without additional  resources, the IHS is forced to ration care, which limits Native  families to hospitals and clinics that can only provide ``life and  limb'' emergency medical services. Basic preventive care, like wellness  visits, prenatal exams, and mammograms, have frequently been  unavailable to most IHS patients.   ``Don't get sick after June,'' which is the unofficial motto given to  the Indian Health Service on many Indian reservations, has, tragically,  become  [[Page S4042]]  the epitaph of too many Tribal members whose cancers have grown  undetected, whose diabetes have gone untreated, and whose high-risk  pregnancies have gone unnoticed. In seeing this catastrophic need for  healthcare dollars, Congress enacted a series of laws that supplement  IHS's resources. The Affordable Care Act is the most recent and now is  the most significant.   Nearly 287,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives from 492 Tribes-- almost 90 percent--have benefited from the ACA's Medicaid expansion.  Another 30,000 individual Native Americans have private insurance,  thanks to the ACA's individual marketplace and the Native cost-sharing  subsidies. In my home State of New Mexico alone, Medicaid expansion has  insured an additional 45,600 Native Americans. Thanks to the Medicaid  expansion and increased access to the individual insurance market, 63  percent of IHS patients have healthcare coverage that allows them to  receive care above and beyond the level of life and limb. Because of  the ACA, the IHS now receives almost $1 billion to supplement its  healthcare delivery, and that is an increase of 21 percent.   We can see the results. Not only are people healthier, but they are  more productive. Health insurance has allowed Native Americans to  finish school, return to work, and lead productive lives instead of  worrying that their next illnesses could lead to an IHS referral denial  or ruin them financially.   It has also improved the economy in Indian Country. The ACA has  created new healthcare jobs, and it has led to the construction of new  medical facilities. It has meant dialysis clinics on New Mexico  pueblos, new hospitals for the Choctaw in Mississippi, and thousands of  jobs for Montana's Blackfeet Indian Reservation. These are just a few  examples of a nationwide trend.   TrumpCare will undo this progress. It will undo the newly expanded  access to care. It will shut down those new healthcare facilities. It  will freeze the economic progress of those areas. These are not just  numbers and statistics. We are talking about people's lives.  Individuals will be harmed by TrumpCare and the evisceration of  Medicaid.   Let me tell you about Rachel, Justin, and their two children--Adalie  and Jude. They are one Native family whose lives have been changed for  the better under the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion.  Rachel and Justin are from the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.   Here is a photo of them right after Jude was born in August 2015.   Before the ACA and Medicaid expansion, Rachel received hit-or-miss  care from the IHS, but when she enrolled at the University of New  Mexico, she was able to qualify for Medicaid because of the expansion.  This meant that when Rachel and Justin decided to start a family,  Rachel had access to preventive services, including prenatal and  maternity care. Rachel was able to get the care she needed when she  became pregnant with Adalie. Rachel's prenatal care became even more  important when they decided to add to their family when Rachel was in  graduate school at UNM. That pregnancy with Jude had serious  complications. The doctors figured out that Rachel did not have enough  amniotic fluid to support Jude, and she had to have a C-section.   Medicaid expansion allowed Rachel to complete her college education  and to get a master's in public administration without her worrying  about healthcare for her and her children. Medicaid expansion meant  that Rachel was able to get the preventive care she needed to make sure  that she and Jude were healthy.   Rachel recently got a job offer to work in her chosen field, but now  that she is able to get off Medicaid, she is worried that the  Republican healthcare proposals will make insurance coverage  ineffective or unaffordable. Even though she lives near her Tribe's IHS  facility in the Albuquerque area, she knows that she cannot depend on  the IHS to guarantee critical care if insurance premiums become  unaffordable. Once again, Rachel is worried about the future of her  family's healthcare.   Rachel is one of thousands of Native Americans whose lives have been  dramatically helped by the Affordable Care Act and who are scared that  TrumpCare will leave them unable to get the healthcare that their  families need in the future.   If this bill becomes law, Tribal communities will be forced back to a  system of healthcare rationing. If the President and the Republican  leadership eviscerate the Medicaid Program and Federal supports for  public health programs, Native American lives will be lost. There is no  doubt about it. Let me say this plain and simple: TrumpCare would  devastate Indian Country, and it must be stopped.   Just this morning, as vice chair of the Indian Affairs Committee, I  held a roundtable with Tribal leaders and Native health experts to hear  more about how the Republicans' healthcare proposals would impact  Tribes. I thank the leaders who came in to talk with me and my  colleagues on the committee. Senator Franken, Senator Heitkamp, Senator  Tester, and Senator Cantwell were there.   All came to hear these Native leaders, and their insight into the  damage this bill could do to Native communities was profound. The  Turtle Mountain chairman from North Dakota reported that ``don't get  sick after June'' is no longer true on his reservation because of the  ACA and Medicaid expansion. Panelists warned that the rollback of  Medicaid would be devastating to Tribal members, and a representative  from the San Felipe Pueblo reminded us that Indian health is not an  entitlement; it is an obligation.   Now the Republican leader and the President are moving in an even  more dangerous direction. They are pushing to repeal the ACA without  having any replacement, which would strip healthcare from over 30  million Americans. It would devastate anyone who is sick today, anyone  who relies on insurance one gets through the Medicaid expansion or the  Affordable Care Act, and it sets up a disaster for anyone who might get  sick after its repeal because it would destabilize insurance markets  and would throw our economy into turmoil, killing up to 50,000 jobs in  New Mexico alone. As often happens with policies that hurt the most  vulnerable, Indian Country would be hit the hardest.   Traditionally, the Senate has worked on a bipartisan basis to address  Native American issues. That tradition must continue now. We must work  together to find a sustainable solution so that Native Americans can  get affordable, quality healthcare when they need it.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter from  the National Congress of American Indians, National Indian Health  Board, National Council on Urban Indian Health, and the Self-Governance  Communication and Education Tribal Consortium sent to Republican  leadership on June 27, 2017, and shared with the Senate Committee on  Indian Affairs be printed in the Record. This is just one example of  the many such letters sent to the Senate over the last few months, and  I will submit those additional letters as part of the record at our  next Indian Affairs Committee Hearing.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      June 27, 2017.      Re Tribal priorities in Senate healthcare reform legislation.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      The Capitol,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National Indian       Health Board (NIHB), the National Congress of American       Indians (NCAI), National Council on Urban Indian Health       (NCUIH), Self-Governance Communication and Education (SGCE),       and the Tribal Nations of the United States we serve, we       write to convey and explain our strong and united opposition       to the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 (BCRA)       in its current form.        While the legislation mirrors several provisions of the       House bill that are of critical importance to Indian Country,       we have grave concerns about other aspects of the BCRA that       make it impossible for us to support the legislation in its       current form. Specifically, we cannot support legislation       that would gut the Medicaid program or eliminate cost-sharing       protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).       Most importantly, we request that the legislation:        1) Maintain Medicaid funding based on need, rather than       capping it according to a complicated per capita allocation       formula or through capped block grants.        2) Continue Medicaid Expansion, and at the very least,       continue Medicaid Expansion for AI/ANs        3) Protect AVANs from barriers to care that are       inconsistent with the federal trust responsibility, such as       work requirements under Medicaid  [[Page S4043]]         4) Retain cost-sharing protections at Section 1402 of the       Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA); and        5) Maintain funding for preventative services, including       the Prevention and Public Health Fund and women's health       services.        As you know, the federal government has a trust       responsibility, agreed to long ago and reaffirmed many times       by all three branches of government, to provide healthcare to       Tribes and their members. Both Medicaid and IHS funding are       part of the fulfillment of the trust responsibility.        However, the federal government has not done its part to       live up to the responsibility to provide adequate health       services to AI/ANs. IHS funding is discretionary and is       appropriated every year and distributed to IHS and Tribal       facilities across the country. But IHS appropriations have       been about 50% of need for decades, and Medicaid revenue is       essential to help fill the gap. When demand for services is       higher than the funds available, services must be prioritized       and rationed. As a result of this chronic underfunding,       historical trauma, and a federal-state centric public health       system, AI/ANs suffer from a wide array of health conditions       at levels shockingly higher than other Americans. Nationally,       AI/ANs live 4.5 years less than other Americans, but in some       states life expectancy is 20 years less. This is not       surprising given that in 2016, the IHS per capita       expenditures for patient health services were just $2,834,       compared to $9,990 per person for health care spending       nationally. The Senate should pass reform legislation only if       it does not reduce access to care for AI/ANs, or further       strain the already stretched resources of Indian Health       Service, Tribally-operated, and urban Indian health programs       (collectively called the ``I/T/U'').                                   Medicaid         Cuts to the Medicaid program outlined in the BCRA are       especially troubling. Under a block grant per-capita system,       States will experience a dramatic reduction in federal       funding for their Medicaid programs. Most will have to either       reduce eligibility for the program or reduce or eliminate       benefits that are essential to many AI/ANs. Medicaid is a       crucial program for the federal government in honoring its       trust responsibility to provide healthcare to AI/ANs. Because       health care services are guaranteed for AI/ANs, cuts in       Medicaid only shift cost over to the IHS, which is already       drastically underfunded. Put simply, without supplemental       Medicaid resources, the Indian health system will not       survive.        AI/ANs are a uniquely vulnerable population and uniquely       situated in the Medicaid program. Unlike other Medicaid       enrollees, because of the federal trust responsibility, AI/      ANs have access to limited IHS services to fall back on at no       cost to them. As a result, Medicaid enrollment and       utilization incentives are completely different for AI/ANs in       Medicaid. Medicaid conditions of eligibility designed to       ensure that beneficiaries have ``personal investment'' do not       work when mandatory in Indian country. Instead of       participating in these programs, many AI/ANs will simply       choose not to enroll in Medicaid and fall back on the       underfunded IHS instead. This will deprive Tribal and urban       programs of vital Medicaid revenue and strain limited IHS       resources to the breaking point.        Medicaid is a crucial program for the federal government to       fulfill the trust responsibility. Over 40 years ago, Congress       permanently authorized the IHS and Tribal facilities to bill       Medicaid for services provided to Medicaid-eligible AI/ANs to       supplement inadequate IHS funding and as part of the federal       trust responsibility. At the same time, because Congress       recognized that ``. . . it would be unfair and inequitable to       burden a State Medicaid program with costs which normally       would have been borne by the Indian Health Service,'' it       ensured that States would not have to bear any such costs, by       providing that States would be reimbursed at 100 percent       Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for services       received through IHS and Tribal facilities.        The Senate Finance Committee, which has primary legislative       responsibility for the Medicare and Medicaid programs,       adopted a similar reimbursement provision as a part of H.R.       3153, the Social Security Amendments of 1973. In its report       on the legislation, the Finance Committee justified the 100       percent FMAP by noting:        `` . . . that with respect to matters relating to Indians,       the Federal Government has traditionally assumed major       responsibility. The Committee wishes to assure that a State's       election to participate in the Medicaid program will not       result in a lessening of Federal support of health care       services for this population group, or that the effect of       Medicaid coverage be to shift to States a financial burden       previously borne by the Federal Government.''        In light of this legislative history, Tribes are pleased to       see the 100 percent FMAP preserved in the BCRA. As the Senate       considers this proposed legislation, please ensure that this       remains in place. In addition, because the federal trust       responsibility also follows AI/ANs off of reservations, 100       percent FMAP should also be extended to services provided       through urban Indian health programs (UHIPs).        With regard to Medicaid, we respectfully request that the       Senate:        1) Continue to Fund Medicaid Based on Need without Caps        Medicaid is an important tool through which the federal       government uses to fulfill its trust responsibility to       provide for Indian health care.        The cuts proposed by Sections 133 and 134 of the BCRA would       be devastating to Tribal and urban health programs. BCRA       would make cuts to Medicaid that are even higher than those       proposed by the House of Representatives. BCRA's caps are       tied to a lower inflation factor beginning in 2025 that would       result in even higher cuts to State Medicaid plans.        We were encouraged to see that BCRA contains provisions       that would prevent the cost of care provided to AI/ANs from       counting against either a per capita cap or a block grant.       However, we request that urban Indian health programs be       included in the exemption as well. Faced with the cuts       proposed in Sections 133 and 134 of the bill, most States       will be forced to make cuts to eligibility and/or services in       future years. This will affect all providers and recipients,       including Tribal/urban providers and AI/AN patients. This       will lead to significant cuts in Medicaid revenues for I/T/      Us, and will threaten our ability to provide healthcare       services to our people. The Indian healthcare delivery system       will not succeed if faced with the cuts proposed in BCRA.        To the extent that the Senate bill maintains such dramatic       caps, it should work with Tribes to develop a mechanism to       exempt reimbursements for services received through IHS/      Tribal/Urban facilities from any State-imposed limitations on       eligibility or services that may result from these caps. Such       reimbursements would be covered by 100 percent FMAP and       therefore will not affect State budgets.        We also request language be added to the bill that requires       States with one or more Indian Tribes or Tribal health       providers to engage in Tribal consultation on a regular and       ongoing basis, and prior to the submission of any Medicaid or       CHIP State Plan Amendment, waiver applications, demonstration       projects or extensions that may impact them as Medicaid       providers or their Tribal members as Medicaid recipients.        2) Preserve Medicaid Expansion        Medicaid Expansion has increased access to care and       provided critical third-party revenues to the Indian health       system. The uninsured rate for Native Americans has fallen       nationally from 24.2% to 15.7% since the enactment of the       Affordable Care Act, due in large part to Medicaid Expansion.       This has resulted in health care services to AI/AN people who       might not have normally received care. It has also resulted       in saved revenues to the Medicaid program through preventing       more complex and chronic health conditions and saved the       Medicaid program money. Medicaid Expansion has increased       Medicaid revenues at IHS/Tribal/Urban health programs that       are being reinvested back into both the Indian and the larger       national health care system.        The BCRA would roll back federal funding Medicaid Expansion       by 2024. The Senate should preserve Medicaid Expansion as an       option for States on a permanent basis. While BCRA contains       important provisions designed to equalize funding between       Expansion and non-Expansion States, we are concerned that the       funding made available to non-Expansion States is       insufficient to match that which has been provided to       Expansion States. At the very least, Expansion should be       retained for the AI/AN population under a special Medicaid       optional eligibility category for State Plans in recognition       of the federal trust responsibility.        3) Exempt AI/ANs from Work Requirements        The BCRA would allow the States to impose mandatory work       requirements as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, and       incentivize States that impose such requirements with a 5       percent increase in FMAP to reimburse them for the       administrative costs of implementing such a requirement.        As noted above, mandatory work requirements will not work       in Indian country because the incentive structures are       completely different. Unlike other Medicaid beneficiaries,       AI/ANs have access to IHS services. If work requirements are       imposed as a condition of eligibility, many AI/ANs will elect       not to enroll in Medicaid. As a result, rather than       encouraging job seeking or saving program costs, mandatory       work requirements will discourage AI/ANs from enrolling in       Medicaid and place pressure on the already underfunded INS.       Further, cash jobs are scarce or non-existent in much of       Indian country, making work requirements impossible to meet       and job training programs an exercise in futility.        Tribes fully support work programs and employment, but we       believe such programs should be voluntary so as not to       provide a barrier to access Medicaid for our members. Again,       this is consistent with over 40 years of Medicaid policy for       Indian Country. To the extent it considers imposing work       requirements, the Senate should exempt AI/ANs from any work       requirements.                                 Marketplace         We also ask that the Senate amend the BCRA to maintain cost       sharing protections for AI/ANs. These protections were       included for AI/ANs in fulfillment of Congress and the United       States federal trust responsibility to provide health care to       Indians. Section 208 of the BCRA would repeal the cost-      sharing subsidy program established by Section 1402 of the       ACA. However Section 1402(d) of the ACA also includes       important and critical cost sharing protections for AI/ANs       who have incomes at or below 300 percent of the federal  [[Page S4044]]       poverty level, or who are referred for care through the IHS       Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program. These cost-sharing       protections incentivize AI/ANs to sign up for health       insurance and also make it affordable. Eliminating them would       create a disincentive for AI/AN to sign up for insurance,       since they already have access to IHS services. This would       result in less third party reimbursements for the Indian       health system and have a destabilizing effect on the system's       ability to provide health care to AI/AN people. Dollar-for-      dollar, leveraging cost sharing protections for AI/ANs and       thereby encouraging insurance coverage is a very efficient       means of moving the needle forward in meeting the federal       trust responsibility for health care resources.                             Prevention Services         We are also deeply concerned by the proposed reduction of       prevention services in the legislation. The elimination of       the Prevention and Public Health Fund will cripple Tribes'       efforts to support public health initiatives. Many Tribal       health programs rely on PPHF directed funding to keep their       public health systems operational. Unlike states, Tribes must       piece together a patchwork of funds, some of which are       derived from the PPHF, to administer basic prevention       services. Additionally, the reduction in funding for women's       health services around the country will have major impacts on       Tribal members, especially those who do not have direct       access to services on or near their reservation. The Senate       should restore cuts to the preventative services in the       legislation.        Tribes support the inclusion of state funding to address       the opioid crisis. However, states do not often pass these       funds to Tribes. Drug-related deaths among AI/ANs is almost       twice that of the general population. To address this       problem, Tribes should either receive direct federal funding       to address the opioid crisis, or states should be required to       engage in state-Tribal consultation on the use of funds       appropriated for the states.        In conclusion, the undersigned organizations must oppose       the BCRA in its current form. We could support the       legislation only if needs-based finding for Medicaid is       preserved, Medicaid Expansion is continued, and the other       changes outlined above are made to the bill before passage.       In fulfillment of the trust responsibility, current       exemptions for AI/ANs from health insurance premiums, co-      pays, and cost sharing must be preserved, and Medicaid-      eligible AI/ANs must be allowed access to the program without       further requirements attached to ensure additional burden is       not placed on very limited IHS appropriations. Tribes across       the country are eager to come to the table to discuss how       shortcomings in the current healthcare system can be       addressed, without wreaking immeasurable harm on our health       programs and the people we serve.        If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact       NIHB's Executive Director Stacy A. Bohlen.            Sincerely,      Vinton Hawley,        Chairperson, National Indian Health Board.      Ashley Tuomi,        President, National Council on Urban Indian Health.      Brian Cladoosby,        President, National Congress of American Indians.      W. Ron Allen,        Board Chairman, Self-Governance Communication & Education       Tribal Consortium.     Thank you, Mr. President.   While this small effort cannot fully replace the necessary  government-to-government consultation we owe Tribes on this issue, I  hope it reminds us of our Federal obligations to Tribes and to all  Native Americans. TrumpCare would turn back the clock. It would violate  our trust responsibilities. It would endanger the lives of Native  families. We cannot let that happen.   Senator Franken has been such an advocate on the Indian Affairs  Committee for Tribes in his State and across the Nation. All of us have  worked extensively to try to improve a situation about which, many  times, we hear from Tribal members is despairing. I really appreciate  his effort and thank him for coming to the floor today and  participating in this discussion about Indian healthcare and what these  Medicaid expansions mean.   I yield the floor to my colleague and friend from the great State of  Minnesota, Senator Franken.    Mr. President, we have been joined by Senator Heitkamp of  North Dakota. I appreciate her work on the subcommittee, her incredibly  hard work and hard dedication that she has put in. She has been a  champion for her Tribes in North Dakota, a champion for Native children  and Native women, and a champion for Native Americans across the  country.   I yield to Senator Heitkamp.    Mr. President, I know Senator Durbin is on the floor so I  am going to wrap up very quickly. I first want to thank Senator  Franken, who came down here and advocated for his State and for Native  Americans across the country. I thank Senator Heitkamp for her  passionate speech about Native Americans and Native children. I have  known her almost 30 years, as the State attorney general, when she was  doing the same things, and she has made real progress.   You can see from this roundtable today--and I really appreciate  Senator Heitkamp coming and helping me chair that. I had to slip out to  Foreign Relations, but she spent a significant amount of time chairing  that roundtable. I think it really made a difference to all of the  Tribal leaders there.   I want to finish with what one of those Tribal leaders said to us.   Senator Heitkamp, you said something very similar.   This Tribal leader reminded us, he said: Decades ago, Tribes made a  downpayment on the healthcare they receive. We are not asking for a  handout. We made a downpayment.   What was he talking about?   We made a downpayment with our land, with our water, and with large  areas of what were then either territories or the United States--that  they considered their homelands. How sad it is to see that we are not  fulfilling the promises of these sacred treaties they entered into.   With that, I would conclude--as Senator Franken did and I believe it  was the same thrust of what Senator Heitkamp was saying--with this. We  have hit a wall on healthcare. We have come up to the point where you  don't know where to go. The best thing to do when you hit a wall is to  get back to the regular order, work on a bipartisan basis, go into  committee, let people put proposals forward, have amendments, open up  the process.   That is where we need to go at this point. I would urge the  Republican leadership to take a look at the regular order. That may  help us find our way out to improve the healthcare situation for not  only Native Americans but all Americans, which is what we face with  this TrumpCare, which is taking us in the wrong direction.   With that, I yield the floor.
