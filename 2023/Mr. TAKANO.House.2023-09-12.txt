 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 10th  anniversary of the University of California Riverside School of  Medicine.   Over the past 10 years, the UCR School of Medicine has become a  crucible of knowledge, a sanctuary of healing, and a force against  healthcare disparities.   It produces skilled physicians, fosters innovation, and engages our  community. With six clinics throughout the region, the UCR School of  Medicine brings medical attention to those in need across southern  California.   In celebrating the UCR School of Medicine, I applaud their growth and  progress over the last decade. As they turn the page to the next  chapter, we anticipate even more remarkable achievements, bolder  strides, and continued transformation of countless lives.   I congratulate the University of California Riverside School of  Medicine on their 10-year journey. May its impact shape a healthier,  brighter future for all.                            ____________________
