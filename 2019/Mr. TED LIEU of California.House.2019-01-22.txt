 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  [[Page H981]]  McCaul for his support of this legislation and I thank Chairman Engel  for his leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 328, which  will strengthen cybersecurity at the State Department. This legislation  is known as the Hack Your State Department Act. It is introduced with  my colleague, Ted Yoho of Florida, and has received strong bipartisan  support, and that is because there is no such thing as Republican  cybersecurity or Democratic cybersecurity; it is just cybersecurity,  and we are behind.   American institutions are under constant attack from criminals, from  foreign intelligence services, and from everyday hackers. That is why  last term, I was very honored to have introduced legislation known as  the Hack DHS Act, along with Senators Maggie Hassan, Rob Portman,  Kamala Harris, and Congressman Scott Taylor. That legislation was  signed into law last month.   This legislation focuses on the State Department. It is something  that we need to do, because we know that the State Department over the  years has faced mounting cybersecurity threats from both criminal  enterprises and state-sponsored hackers.   In 2014, for instance, the Department was infiltrated by Russian  hackers and had to temporarily shut down its email system.   Last year, the State Department suffered another breach of its email  system, exposing the personal information of a number of its employees.   As a recovering computer science major, I recognize there are  improvement tools at our disposal to improve cybersecurity that the  State Department has not yet adopted, and one such tool is exactly what  this bill will do.                                time  1730    This bill does primarily two things. The first is to establish what  is called a vulnerability disclosure process, which sets clear rules of  the road so, when people outside the Department discover  vulnerabilities on Department systems, they can report it in a safe,  secure, and legal manner, with the confidence that the State Department  will actually fix the problems. We cannot afford to allow  vulnerabilities discovered in the wild remain known to hackers but  unknown to the Department. This should be an easy fix.   The second step is to actually pay vetted, white hat hackers to find  vulnerabilities. The Department of Defense proved the success of the  bug bounty program back in 2016. Over a 24-day period, the Pentagon  learned of and fixed over 138 vulnerabilities in its systems. The DHS  is now also going to start this very same program. Hopefully, the State  Department will be able to do this, as well, when this legislation is  signed into law.   Let me conclude by saying that, today, with H.R. 328, the House of  Representatives is taking these recommendations to heart and helping to  improve cybersecurity at the Department of State.
