 Madam President and colleagues, this past week,  following the leaked Supreme Court opinion that threatens to overturn  Roe v. Wade, thousands of Californians have reached out to my office in  the form of phone calls, in the form of letters, and in the form of  emails, all to voice their support for the right to choose.   It is abundantly clear that Congress must pass the Women's Health  Protection Act and codify the right to an abortion into Federal law.   Countless Californians and other Americans have spoken up--many in  public, many in private--to share their own abortion stories.   Think about the students who want to finish high school before  starting a family. Think of survivors of sexual assault, whose abortion  reaffirmed their right to choose for their own bodies. Think of parents  who desperately wanted a child but, upon becoming pregnant, learned the  devastating news about dangerous health risks associated with that  pregnancy. Think of the women whose lives were saved by an abortion,  because abortion is often critical medical care. And think about women  who remember a time a half a century ago, before Roe v. Wade secured  this right, a time when--don't get me wrong--abortion still happened,  but they were unsafe secrets at the time, when women risked their lives  for the choice that they needed.   I believe that the right to an abortion is a fundamental right, and I  am proud to represent a State that fiercely defends abortion access.  California is committed to safe, respectful abortion care for all who  need it. That is why Californians have stepped up this year, with some  even traveling to aid women who were threatened by SB 8, the Texas law  that prohibits abortion at 6 weeks. This is the very law that Senator  Cortez Masto just referenced a few minutes ago, and it is why so many  Californians are speaking up now.   We know that your right to choose should not end at a State border,  and it certainly shouldn't rely on your income or your transportation  options or whether or not you can afford to take time off from work.   All across America, a strong majority support a woman's right to make  her own healthcare decisions. We can't stand by and watch while  rightwing politicians and judges seem to roll back the clock on women's  rights. That is why I am voting for the Women's Health Protection Act  and why I urge each and every one of you to do the same.   We must secure the right to abortion nationwide. We must protect the  fundamental rights of women across the country--not just in a few  States but across the country.   Congress can and must do this by passing the Women's Health  Protection Act.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at a time to be determined by the majority  leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed  to executive session to consider the following nominations en bloc:  Calendar Nos. 807 and 809; that there be 2 hours for debate equally  divided in the usual form on the nominations en bloc; that upon the use  or yielding back of time, the Senate vote without intervening action or  debate on the nominations in the order listed; that, if confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that any related statements be printed  in the Record; that the President be immediately notified  [[Page S2416]]  of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.

Madam President, for the information of Senators, there  will be two rollcall votes at 11 a.m., up to three rollcall votes at  2:30 p.m., with additional rollcall votes in the evening.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:47 p.m., recessed until  Wednesday, May 11, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
