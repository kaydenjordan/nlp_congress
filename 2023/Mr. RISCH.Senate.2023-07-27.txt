 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Grizzly  Bear Review and Resource Restart Act.   The grizzly bear was originally listed under the Endangered Species  Act, ESA, in 1975 with the worthy intent to recover the species. The  ESA has succeeded and grizzly bear populations have rebounded. However,  the overly-broad listing, which covers all of the lower 48 States, has  led courts to block the Fish and Wildlife Service from delisting  populations which by all measures are recovered and no longer require  strict ESA protections.   This has prevented the ESA from being what it is meant to be, a  temporary assistance for wildlife recovery. It was never intended to  provide a permanent designation for robust species. If enacted, the  Grizzly Bear Review and Resource Restart Act will remove the  unreachable recovery targets based on the erroneous first listing and  allow wildlife managers to focus on areas in the lower 48 which  actually host grizzly bears, not the 30 States currently listed where  bears never were in the first place.   Giving the opportunity to ``delist and relist'' based on scientific  and historic data rather than a panicked first plan from 1975 will help  mitigate human-bear interactions, protect rural communities, and  emphasize and recenter the role of science in grizzly bear recovery. It  will also allow funding and focus to be given where it is needed most:  to grizzly bear populations and other species actually at risk.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mr. Cassidy):   S. 2572. A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development  Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to make  predevelopment grants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Environment and Public Works.
