 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 877 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 877         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1140) to enhance the security operations of       the Transportation Security Administration and stability of       the transportation security workforce by applying the       personnel system under title 5, United States Code, to       employees of the Transportation Security Administration who       provide screening of all passengers and property, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Homeland Security. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Committee on Homeland Security now printed in  [[Page H1478]]       the bill shall be considered as adopted in the House and in       the Committee of the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as the original bill for the purpose of further       amendment under the five-minute rule and shall be considered       as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill,       as amended, are waived. No further amendment to the bill, as       amended, shall be in order except those printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each       such further amendment may be offered only in the order       printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill, as amended, to the House with such       further amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of March 5, 2020, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV, relating to a measure making       supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2020.        Sec. 3.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of March 5, 2020, relating to a measure       making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2020.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House  Resolution 877, providing for consideration of H.R. 1140, the Rights  for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020, under a structured  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Homeland Security and makes in order nine amendments.   Lastly, the rule provides suspension authority for Thursday and same- day authority for Wednesday and Thursday, both limited to the  consideration of a supplemental appropriations bill.   Madam Speaker, when the Transportation Security Administration was  established as a response to the September 11 terrorist attacks in  2001, its Administrator was given broad authority over its workforce  with respect to setting up pay and workplace conditions. As such,  Transportation Security officers, TSOs, have been unable to benefit  from Fair Labor Standards Act protections or fall under the general  schedule pay scale. This distinction puts TSOs in a different class  from other federal workers, preventing them from having the  representational rights afforded through the Civil Service Reform Act  of 1978.   Each day, TSOs screen more than 2 million passengers at over 440  airports nationwide. These workers are critical to helping Americans  travel safely and make up more than 70 percent of the Transportation  Security Administration's workforce. However, TSOs are among the lowest  paid Federal workers and routinely have among the lowest retention rate  of any Federal agency. TSO annual pay lags well behind industry  counterparts, and even the top performing TSOs with exceptional  performance find it difficult to advance within their pay bands.   This was not Congress' intention when it gave the Administrator broad  latitude to manage its own personnel system, nor was it Congress'  intention that this authority should be used to benefit management over  frontline TSOs, as is the case today.   As a result, in the past decade TSA has come to rank near the bottom  in Federal employee morale surveys. This has created a culture in which  last year the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector  General said that TSA must address its retention, hiring, and training  challenges.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts from that 2019 report  entitled ``TSA Needs to Improve Efforts to Retain, Hire, and Train Its  Transportation Security Officers.''        TSA Needs To Improve Efforts To Retain, Hire, and Train Its                      Transportation Security Officers                                What We Found         The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) needs to       continue to improve its retention, hiring, and training of       Transportation Security Officers (TSO). Specifically, TSA       needs to better address its retention challenges because it       currently does not share and leverage results of TSO exit       surveys and does not always convey job expectations to new-      hires. Prior to August 2018, TSA did not always focus on TSO       career growth. Thus, the agency may be missing opportunities       to prevent early attrition. By improving its retention       efforts, TSA could save funds otherwise spent to hire and       train new TSOs.        Furthermore, TSA does not fully evaluate applicants for       capability as well as compatibility when hiring new TSOs.       Thus, the agency may be making uninformed hiring decisions       due to inadequate applicant information and a lack of       formally documented guidance on ranking potential new-hires.       Without complete information, TSA may not be selecting the       most highly qualified individuals as TSOs.        Prior to July 2018, TSA had not standardized the approach       for training new TSOs before they attend basic training and       did not consistently send TSOs to basic training immediately       following onboarding. TSA also does not give all airports       complete visibility into its basic training curriculum as a       basis for training new-hires locally. Without an experienced       workforce or a consistent, robust training program, TSA is       missing opportunities to strengthen its workforce. Given the       importance of TSOs fulfilling the aviation security mission,       TSA must address its retention, hiring, and training       challenges, which could save millions in taxpayers' dollars.                                 TSA Response         TSA concurred with all nine recommendations and initiated       corrective actions to address the findings.                                   ____       Memorandum for: The Honorable David Pekoske, Administrator,           Transportation Security Administration.      From: John V. Kelly, Acting Inspector General.      Subject: TSA Needs to Improve Efforts to Retain, Hire, and           Train Its Transportation Security Officers.        Attached for your action is our final report, TSA Needs to       Improve Efforts to Retain, Hire, and Train Its Transportation       Security Officers. We incorporated the formal comments       provided by your office.        The report contains nine recommendations aimed at improving       TSA's retention, hiring, and training efforts for its       Transportation Security Officers. Your office concurred with       all nine recommendations. Based on information provided in       your response to the draft report, recommendations 4, 6, and       8 are closed while recommendations 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 are       resolved and open. Once your office has fully implemented the       recommendations, please submit a formal closeout letter to us       within 30 days so that we may close the recommendations. The       memorandum should be accompanied by evidence of completion of       agreed upon corrective actions and of the disposition of any       monetary amounts. Recommendation 3 remains unresolved and       open because we did not agree with TSA's proposed corrective       action plan. As prescribed by the Department of Homeland       Security Directive 077-01, Follow-Up and Resolutions for the       Office of Inspector General Report Recommendations, within 90       days of the date of this memorandum, please provide our       office with a written response that includes your (1)       agreement or disagreement, (2) corrective action plan, and       (3) target completion date. Also, please include responsible       parties and any other supporting documentation necessary to       inform us about the current status of the recommendations.       Until your response is received and evaluated, recommendation       #3 will be considered open and unresolved.        Consistent with our responsibility under the Inspector       General Act, we will provide copies of our report to       congressional committees with oversight and appropriation       responsibility over the Department of Homeland Security. We       will post the report on our website for public dissemination.                                   ____                                   Conclusion         TSOs are critical to airline passenger safety and the       security of the aviation transportation system. The Aviation       and Transportation Security Act charges TSA with developing       standards for retaining, hiring, and training security       screening personnel at all  [[Page H1479]]       U.S. airports. Passengers rely on TSOs to screen other       passengers and baggage properly at more than 400 airports       nationwide. In FY 2017, TSA hired more than 9,600 TSOs and       spent approximately $75 million to recruit, hire, and train       them. Improving retention, hiring, and training of TSOs would       save costs and provide a more stable, mature, and qualified       workforce to better secure the Nation's aviation       transportation system.                               Recommendations         Recommendation 1: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, continue to coordinate efforts with Security       Operations to implement actions that facilitate improvements       in the hiring process to ensure applicants are informed of       the Transportation Security Officer duties and that TSA       continues to hire qualified applicants. At a minimum, TSA       should:        a. require an applicant affirm whether he/ she has reviewed       the Transportation Security Officer Realistic Job Preview       video and understands duties include interacting with       passengers, passenger patdowns, shift work, weekend work, and       holidays. If the applicant has not, ensure the applicant       reviews the video as part of the application process; and        b. finalize the implementation of the agency's job       compatibility assessment tool for use during the hiring       process.        Recommendation 2: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, revise the exit survey process to:        a. ensure airports offer local exit interviews;        b. record results in a centralized system;        c. provide relevant stakeholders access to the results for       analysis and process improvements; and        d. address areas identified in the exit survey results that       would help retain a skilled and knowledgeable Transportation       Security Officer workforce.        Recommendation 3: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, continue to review and develop recruitment and       retention strategies for reducing attrition:        a. at smaller airports; and        b. among part-time Transportation Security Officers.        Recommendation 4: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, meet established timelines to implement the       first phase of Career Progression for newly appointed entry-      level Transportation Security Officers.        Recommendation 5: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, examine increases in pay based upon skill       level for Transportation Security Officers that could help       attract and retain a strong workforce.        Recommendation 6: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, compile a local hiring update message to       remind airports to follow TSA records retention policies for       Airport Assessment documentation.        Recommendation 7: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Human Capital, formally document system functional       requirements, such as the rating process criteria, for       quality assurance purposes to ensure proper system logic in       how applicants are ranked on the Certification Lists.        Recommendation 8: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Training and Development, coordinate with Security Operations       to enforce the pre-Basic Training Program requirements.        Recommendation 9: We recommend the Assistant Administrator,       Training and Development, provide all airports access to the       Basic Training Program curriculum in its entirety.                     Management Comments and OIG Analysis         TSA concurred with all of our recommendations and is taking       steps or has implemented actions to address them. Appendix B       contains TSA's management comments in their entirety. We also       received technical comments to the draft report and revised       the report as appropriate. We consider recommendations 1, 2,       5, 7, and 9 resolved and open. Recommendations 4, 6, and 8       are closed. Recommendation 3 remains unresolved and open       because we did not agree with TSA's proposed corrective       action plan. A summary of TSA's responses and our analysis       follows.        TSA Comments to Recommendation 1: TSA concurred with the       recommendation. TSA explained its efforts to make every TSO       applicant aware of the realities of the TSO position and       ensure the agency conveys job expectations to TSO applicants.       These efforts include participating in job fairs and career       events, hosting in-person and virtual information sessions,       attaching an airport-specific fact sheet to every TSO Job       Opportunity Announcement posted on the Federal Government's       official employment site, USAJobs, and creating and sharing       the TSO Realistic Job Preview video that is communicated       throughout the hiring process and accessible through various       avenues. TSA will mandate that personnel scheduling the       Airport Assessment review an airport's hours of operations,       typical shifts and days off, and typical duties of the       position. Additionally, TSA will modify the Airport       Assessment scheduling script to advise that each applicant is       required to watch the TSO Realistic Job Preview video prior       to attending the assessment. TSA expects these actions to       begin by March 31, 2019. Additionally, TSA plans to include a       compatibility assessment tool in the TSO hiring process,       which the Office of Personnel Management will validate. The       estimated completion date to pilot and fully deploy the       compatibility assessment tool is September 30, 2019.        OIG Analysis of TSA Comments: TSA has taken steps to       satisfy the intent of this recommendation. We consider this       recommendation resolved, but it will remain open until TSA       provides documentation to support that all planned corrective       actions are completed.     Fortunately, Madam Speaker, this bill before us today  will address each of those challenges. The Rights for Transportation  Security Officers Act will honor those who protect America's aviation  security by bringing the TSA personnel system within the bounds of the  rest of the Federal workforce.   H.R. 1140 will put an end to the current TSA personnel directives  that have allowed the TSA to be the judge and jury in workforce  disciplinary matters, and require TSA to follow the labor-management  employee relations statutes that provide workplace rights and  protections to most Federal employees under title 5 of the U.S. Code;  the provision that is most notable in efforts to increase employee  retention and morale by putting TSOs on the general schedule pay scale  and finally aligning pay with the vast majority of other Federal  employees.   This legislation has been a long time coming for the men and women  who protect our skies and keep millions of us safe on a daily basis.  During the 35-day partial government shutdown at the end of the last  Congress, TSOs were required to work for more than 5 weeks without pay.  At Philadelphia International Airport in my district, a typical entry- level salary for a TSO is about $29,000 per year, without including  additional locality pay.   Working without pay for over a month would be difficult if you made  three times that amount, Madam Speaker, but it is unconscionable that  the Federal Government would force the very people we trust to keep us  safe into having to turn to food banks, short-term loans, and donations  to make ends meet. Yet these Federal workers kept reporting for work  even when they couldn't afford gas and parking. These are not  hypotheticals. In my district alone we collected food, diapers, gas  cards, and other necessities for TSOs who were not being paid.   The Federal Government did not live up to its commitment to these  TSOs, but these civil servants did not waiver in their dedication to  keeping the flying public safe.   My colleagues across the aisle have objected to this bill which would  support our Federal workers by claiming that our national security is  at risk, that TSA would lose flexibility, and that the bill is too  expensive.   To the first point, I would say that a TSA staffed by underpaid and  overworked TSOs is a greater threat to national security than paying a  fair wage to keep Americans safe. Pay is one of the top reasons that  the TSA struggles with keeping good employees. We lose current and  potential TSOs every day because they can make more money in lower  pressure work environments elsewhere.   Whether in business, law, or government, you get what you pay for,  and I, for one, do not believe that the security of our airports and  skies or the lives of the traveling public are something we should be  looking to get a bargain on.   Further, granting the TSA workforce full collective bargaining rights  under title 5 would not deny TSA the ability to remove bad employees or  interfere with TSA's authority to direct security operations. Federal  agencies already under title 5 jurisdiction have the flexibility to  quickly deal with bad actors, but ensuring that proper protocols are  followed in termination proceedings is a right that must be afforded to  employees. This includes other Federal agencies with security and  enforcement operations such as Customs and Border Patrol, the  Department of Defense, and others.   The TSA has had years to address its issues of recruitment,  retention, and training, but has failed to do so. Now it is time for  Congress to bring TSA in line with other Federal agencies. The TSA is  not a new Federal agency, nor is it destined to go away. So, in that  sense we must make sure that these patriotic civil workers are properly  compensated and given the workplace rights that they deserve.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as expected, we have heard that eliminating the unique  personnel management tools that were initially afforded to the TSA is  somehow going to undermine the organization, but this ignores the  reality that those tools are no longer needed nor effective.   The record is replete with evidence that we need to reform the way  the TSA is managed in order to address very, very serious issues of  recruitment, retention, and training.   What is posited here is a false choice between workers' rights and  national security, and we reject that choice.   We were given an example of gross sexual misconduct as a reason why  workers shouldn't have organizational rights. But under title 5's rule,  which would apply under this bill, agencies can expedite personnel  actions against employees accused of criminal activity, and they also  can be removed from their duty post for potential harm to themselves or  to others.   Again, this is a false choice between workers' rights and national  security, or just plain old management.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 1140 is a pro-security and pro-Federal worker piece of  legislation.   The TSA is no longer a startup agency requiring maximum flexibility  during a period of national emergency, and Congress, in previous  administrations, has taken actions to reflect that.   Ten years after its creation, in 2011, TSA employees were given labor  union representation. This was a good step forward. However, the time  is now to provide the 60,000 TSA employees the same worker rights and  protections afforded to other Federal workers under the U.S. Code.   It is a sad and shameful day for the government when anyone is forced  to turn to food pantries to feed their family, employed or not, but it  is unacceptable that Federal workers who work to protect and serve all  Americans would be without a paycheck for weeks at a time--over the  holidays, no less.   Working people all over the United States are sacrificing more and  earning less. This is a systemic problem that will not be solved by  this bill. But, in order to rebuild the middle class that got so many  of us into this body where we are today, we need to value Federal  workers for the job they do and the services they provide to all of us.   There are times and places for cutting costs and reducing expenses,  but I do not believe that we as a body should do so in a way that  negatively impacts national security or does so to the detriment of the  men and women who keep us safe. I believe it is the responsibility of  the Federal Government to responsibly pay its Federal workers.   The hundreds of thousands of civil servants in this country do not  belong to one political party or all subscribe to the same political  beliefs. No, they do their jobs because they are in service to this  Nation, and, in return, they deserve reasonable wages and rights in the  workplace. I do not think that this is too much to ask.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 877    At the end of the resolution, add the following:          Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       5595) to impose additional prohibitions relating to foreign       boycotts under Export Control Reform Act of 2018, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 5595.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
