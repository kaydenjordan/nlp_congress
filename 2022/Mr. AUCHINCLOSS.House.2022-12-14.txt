 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 2607) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the former  hostages of the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979 1981, highlighting their  resilience throughout the unprecedented ordeal that they lived through  and the national unity it produced, marking four decades since their  444 days in captivity, and recognizing their sacrifice to the United  States.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2607         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Hostages Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On January 20, 1981, United States diplomats, military       personnel, and civilians were released after being held       hostage for 444 days by militant student supporters of Iran's       Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in a violation of international       law. The individuals were taken from the United States       Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and the ordeal came to be known as       the Iran Hostage Crisis.        (2) The hostages were subjected to intense physical and       psychological torture throughout their captivity, such as       mock executions, beatings, solitary confinement, and       inhospitable living conditions.        (3) Throughout their time held, the hostages were routinely       told to denounce the United States and, when they refused,       they were tortured, but remained strong in their spirit.        (4) One hostage wrote ``Viva la roja, blanco, y azul'',       which translates to ``Long live the red, white, and blue'',       on the wall of his cell as a reminder of the values he swore       to protect.        (5) The hostages showed extraordinary courage by       continually engaging in acts of resistance against their       captors, such as by refusing to sign condemnations of the       United States, in the face of gross violations of their human       rights.        (6) Many of the hostages still experience trauma as a       result of the events of the crisis and deserve to have their       suffering recognized.        (7) While, as of the date of enactment of this Act, 35 of       the hostages are living, it is important that the people of       the United States reflect on the resilience and strength of       the hostages, which serve as an example to current       generations.        (8) The people of the United States should--        (A) acknowledge the hostages as heroes who--        (i) experienced great tribulation; and        (ii) endured, so that the people of the United States may       know the blessing of living in the United States; and        (B) strive to demonstrate the values shown by the hostages.        (9) On January 22, 1981, President Jimmy Carter met with       the hostages in West Germany and stated the following: ``One       of the acts in my life which has been the most moving and       gratifying in meeting with and discussing the future and the       past with the now liberated Americans who were held hostage       in Iran for so long. I pointed out to them that, since their       capture by the Iranian terrorists and their being held in       this despicable act of savagery, that the American people's       hearts have gone out to them and the Nation has been united       as perhaps never before in history and that the prayers that       have gone up from the people throughout the world to God for       their safety have finally been answered.''.        (10) On January 28, 1981, when welcoming the hostages home,       President Ronald Reagan stated the following: ``You've come       home to a people who for 444 days suffered the pain of your       imprisonment, prayed for your safety, and most importantly,       shared your determination that the spirit of free men and       women is not a fit subject for barter. You've represented       under great stress the highest traditions of public service.       Your conduct is symbolic of the millions of professional       diplomats, military personnel, and others who have rendered       service to their country.''.        (11) During the 444 days the brave hostages were held, the       rest of the United States held its breath, waiting for news       of the hostages. The United States hoped and prayed together,       as one, for the hostages' safe return.        (12) Bruce Laingen, who served as United States Ambassador       to Iran from 1979 to 1980 and was the highest ranking       diplomat held hostage, summed up the experience by saying the       following: ``Fifty-three Americans who will always have a       love affair with this country and who join with you in a       prayer of thanksgiving for the way in which this crisis has       strengthened the spirit and resilience and strength that is       the mark of a truly free society.''. It is now the       responsibility of the people of the United States to honor       the spirit, resilience, and strength that the hostages       displayed during their 444 days of imprisonment.        (13) Now, more than 4 decades later, the United States       continues to honor the hostages. The recipients of the award       bestowed by this Act are heroes in every sense of the word.       They are role models who wore their pride in the United       States with esteem and have allowed for subsequent       generations to appreciate the blessing of living in the       United States. Today, as we mark 40 years since their       release, the people of the United States acknowledge their       endurance, strength, and contributions to seeing a more       peaceful world. The hostages suffered for the United States       and now it is the duty of the United States to recognize them       for it.       SEC. 3. DEFINITION.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to include extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2607, the Iran Hostages  Congressional Gold Medal Act, sponsored by Senator Padilla, which is a  companion to a House bill sponsored by Representative Suozzi.   I thank Representative Suozzi for sponsoring this bipartisan bill,  which would award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 53 hostages of the  Iran hostage crisis, which occurred from November 4, 1979, to January  21, 1981, in recognition of their bravery in the face of egregious  human rights violations. It has been more than 40 years since their  release.   Representative Suozzi has been a tireless advocate in honoring these  U.S. embassy employees who were taken hostage and uplifting their  humanity. Last week, Representative Suozzi said on the floor that he  was 17 years old when the hostages were taken and remembers the Iran  hostage crisis as a painful time in our history. I am so appreciative  of his dedication to this important issue and ensuring that these  hostages are properly recognized for the sacrifices they have made that  have had lasting effects until today.   I am pleased to be able to vote ``yes'' for this bill before his  retirement at the end of this term, and I congratulate him on this  important bill to celebrate the resilience and strength of the  hostages.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. As I am awaiting the arrival of the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Suozzi), who has performed able and faithful service in the House  over his career, I would like to reflect on the Iran hostage crisis and  its unfortunate foreshadowing of the behavior of the Ayatollah's regime  that we are witnessing now on our TV screens today as they persecute  brave men and women on the streets of Iran's major cities who are  protesting for basic human and civil rights.   I know that I speak on behalf of my constituents in Massachusetts'  4th District when I say that the American people stand with those who  are protesting the repression and the discrimination, particularly  against women, that have been the hallmark of the Ayatollah's regime  and that we feel that the values that they are fighting for are  universal values, core human rights, and certainly hope and expect that  they will be achieved.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to reflect on the great service of Mr.  Suozzi, who has been an able member of the Ways and Means Committee and  a wise counselor to those of us like myself who are new to this  business in how to best represent our constituents and advance their  priorities and reflect their values.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Suozzi), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   I appreciate Representative Suozzi's dedication to this important  issue. This bipartisan bill will honor the bravery of the 53 hostages  of the Iran hostage crisis, the U.S. Embassy employees, who were held  hostage for 444 days.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Representative Suozzi for championing this  issue and urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the  balance of my time.
