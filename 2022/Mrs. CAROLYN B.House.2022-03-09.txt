 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation banning Russian  oil and gas imports and imposing additional sanctions to punish Putin  and his cronies for their war of aggression in Ukraine, which has  caused more than 2 million Ukrainians to flee their country.   President Biden has already imposed swift and severe consequences,  including yesterday's executive action. However, it is the duty of  Congress to join the President, enact a congressional ban on Russian  oil and gas imports to the U.S., and send a strong message to the  Kremlin that none of our money will be used to bankroll shelling of  Ukrainian families.   Yesterday, the Oversight and Reform Committee held a bipartisan  briefing with U.S. and Ukrainian Government officials. The message was  clear: Putin's regime must be denied these crucial oil revenues while  we continue to provide urgently needed aid to Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation for the good of the  United States and the support of Ukraine.
