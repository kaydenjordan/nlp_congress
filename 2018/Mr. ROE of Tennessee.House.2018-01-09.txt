 Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I rise today to  raise awareness about the value of comprehensive training aimed at  preventing deaths after a traumatic injury occurs.   Last fall, I took part in a ``Stop the Bleeding'' training course  offered by the American College of Surgeons. This simple training  teaches individuals how to treat bleeding injuries and help save a  life.   Each year, more than 180,000 people die from traumatic injuries. The  most common and easily preventable cause of these deaths is too much  blood loss in the critical minutes before trained first responders  arrive. With an average response time of 8 to 12 minutes once 911 is  called, it is the responsibility for all of us to prepare to help  others in the event of a traumatic injury.   I look forward to working with my fellow Members of Congress and  advocates, such as my friends of the American College of Surgeons, to  raise awareness of the value of this lifesaving technique.                            ____________________
