 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Grijalva for taking the Women Who Worked  on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act through committee and  bringing it to the floor. I appreciate that he allowed me to sit in and  ask questions, and he conducted a hearing and pressed it forward  quickly.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would authorize the establishment  of a memorial on Federal land here in the District of Columbia  commemorating the efforts of 18 million American women who kept the  home front running during World War II. Women are dramatically  underrepresented in our memorials.   A 17-year-old constituent of mine, Raya Kenney, the founder of the  Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation--yes, her own  foundation--came up with the idea to honor the women on the home front  who supported the World War II effort. Raya wondered why the women on  the home front, whose efforts were so instrumental in maintaining the  stability of the country during World War II, have not received much  recognition for their contributions compared to the men who fought  bravely in World War II.   This bill would authorize the Women Who Worked on the Home Front  Foundation to establish a memorial to honor these women. The memorial  is designed to be interactive and to educate visitors on the important  roles women played during World War II. No Federal funds would be  required.   Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage of women in the workforce  increased from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent. And by 1945, one in  four married women worked outside the home. The work done by women on  the home front opened doors for women in the workplace generally and  had a profound effect on the job market going forward, and even up to  today.   As a result of their efforts, women on the home front redefined many  occupations that were especially considered men's work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Stop Sexual Assault  and Harassment in Transportation Act, which would institute reporting  requirements for incidents of sexual assault and harassment in  passenger transportation carriers including airlines, vessels, buses,  commuter and intercity passenger railroads, and transportation network  companies like Uber and Lyft.   I am pleased that this bill includes provisions that direct the  Department of Transportation to collect information on the number of  sexual assault and harassment incidents and to make that information  publicly available, which Representative Rick Crawford and I included  in our bipartisan AWARE Act. I believe that until we collect this  information, the full magnitude of the problem will not be understood.  We have heard some of it reported by my good friend just now from  Oregon just now.   In a 2018 survey of 2,000 flight attendants, one in five said they  had been harassed, witnessed a passenger being sexually assaulted, or  received a report of passenger-on-passenger sexual assault. Nearly 70  percent reported experiencing sexual harassment, and almost one in five  reported being sexually assaulted by passengers.   In fiscal year 2014, 38 instances of in-flight sexual assault were  reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This number increased  to 63 reported cases in 2017, but many instances of in-flight sexual  assault remain unreported, because victims are fearful of contacting  the authorities. FBI statistics indicate that as many as 75 percent of  incidents go unreported.   On cruise ships, sex crimes outweigh any other major offense. A 2013  congressional report found that minors were victims in one-third of  reported sexual assaults.   There was bipartisan support for a provision in the Federal Aviation  Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018 to establish a sexual  misconduct working group to develop best practices for addressing  sexual misconduct on flights, employee training, and law enforcement  notification.    This legislation builds upon that work, requiring  passenger transportation carriers to establish formal policies,  training, and reporting structures for sexual assault and harassment  and adds penalties for individuals who physically or sexually assault  or threaten to assault transportation personnel.   I support the passage of the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in  Transportation Act so that every person can feel safe from violence and  harassment while traveling.                                time  1600
