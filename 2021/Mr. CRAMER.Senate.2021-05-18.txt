 Mr. President, as another school year comes to a  close, I want to recognize the students at one North Dakota school for  their accomplishments in a remarkable program. Students in Linton  operate my State's first and only high school radio station. KLHS AM  1620 is a full-fledged AM station that went live in 2017. Since then,  it has given students hands-on experience in broadcasting,  interviewing, and news writing.   KLHS and now KLPS play rock, oldies, and country music and feature  local weather, news, and sports. It is all done by the students  enrolled in the Linton High School radio broadcasting classes who write  and produce all programs heard on the air. While mastering  broadcasting, they also learn to operate a console board and other  skills like speaking, articulation, production, script writing, and  interviewing.   These Linton students have also attended the annual national  conferences of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, and their  accomplishments have been recognized with many awards. At this year's  conference, the Linton students took home 20 Golden Microphone Awards,  in categories such as best promotional event, most creative show, best  station logo, best sports play-by-play, and best website.   I also want to salute the founder of the Linton High School program,  longtime State radio veteran Jay Schmaltz. The idea for a high school  broadcasting program originated after he became the supervisor of the  Emmons County alternative education programs. Today, it is the most  popoular elective class at the school and remains the only high school  radio station in North Dakota.   Mr. President, there are many good jobs in broadcasting in North  Dakota and around the world. These Linton High School students are  receiving a head start in the professional world of communications and  will be able to apply the valuable skills they learn in many directions  in their future professions. I commend Linton High School for offering  such a valuable program and Jay Schmaltz for his dedication to its  success, and I congratulate the Linton High School broadcasting  students for recognizing the value of learning a skill that will  benefit them the rest of their lives. I know we will be hearing much  more from these broadcasting entrepreneurs for many years to come.                            ____________________
