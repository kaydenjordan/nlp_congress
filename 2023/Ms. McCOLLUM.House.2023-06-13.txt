 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 44.   This resolution seeks to repeal reasonable restrictions on deadly  weapons, at a time when gun violence is the leading cause of death for  children and youth in the United States.   H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the Biden-Harris administration's  stabilizing arm brace rule, which keeps dangerous firearms out of  dangerous hands by requiring that guns equipped with stabilizing arm  braces are subject to the same requirements as weapons with the same  fire power. This rule makes it harder for individuals intending to  inflict carnage and take lives to obtain these weapons, and it should  remain in place in order to save more lives.   With this resolution, extreme Republicans continue their unpopular  and unconscionable quest to oppose any and all restrictions on  firearms, abolish the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives (ATF), and prioritize the gun industry over the safety of  our communities and the law enforcement officers who serve them.   House Democrats are determined to defend the sensible and effective  policies in place to protect Americans, and we will continue to work to  pass additional safeguards to end America's gun violence.
