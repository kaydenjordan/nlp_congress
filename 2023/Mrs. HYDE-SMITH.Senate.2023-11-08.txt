 Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute  to Mr. Jack Rutland, Jr., of Lincoln County, MS, who for more than 10  years has shown an inspiring dedication to sharing the stories and  memories of armed service veterans in Mississippi. By conducting radio  interviews with veterans, their experiences can be appreciated by  citizens all across Mississippi. Mr. Rutland has shown that his  appreciation and respect for the men and women who have served in our  armed forces goes beyond that of an average citizen, and America needs  more people like Jack.   Jack Rutland, Jr., was born on May 20, 1948, in Birmingham, AL, while  his father was stationed at an Air Force base there. His father, Jack  Rutland, Sr., enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps prior to World War  II, and he served during the war for 3 years in countries like England,  North Africa, and Italy. During his World War II service, the senior  Mr. Rutland earned five battle stars. Upon the completion of the war,  he remained in the Air Force for over 20 years. Once he retired, the  family returned to Lawrence County, MS. From experiencing his father's  patriotic dedication to our Nation, Jack grew up with a sincere  reverence for the veterans who served to defend the United States of  America.   In 2003, the Military Memorial Museum in Brookhaven, MS, opened to  inform the public of local veterans and the town's service history  through artifacts, newspaper clippings, and other memorabilia. The  museum is operated completely by volunteers, one of them  [[Page S5424]]  being Jack Rutland, Jr. On the 10-year anniversary of the Military  Memorial Museum's opening, Jack interviewed four veterans. His  interviews were captivating and respectfully executed, leading the  public to want more. Today, Jack has conducted more than 50 interviews  with veterans, some as recently as a few weeks ago. These interviews  can be heartbreaking, like the story of World War II veteran Mr. Howard  Britt who had to leave his beloved lieutenant in the field after he had  been wounded. While in enemy territory, there was no time to wait. A  story from Mr. Don Hemphill was similarly moving, detailing his arrival  on the beaches of Normandy on the evening of D-day and seeing the  wreckage of equipment left behind, as well as American soldiers who had  not made it. The scene was so harrowing that Mr. Hemphill still could  not talk about it when he was interviewed. In addition to these  poignant interviews were inspirational recollections, like Mr. Hoyte  Case who saw the iconic flag raised on Iwo Jima atop Mount Suribachi  from his ship as he left the battle. Mr. Herbert Savell recounted his  long journey home from the Pacific following the end of the war,  traveling by cattle car to return to his small hometown in the  Mississippi Delta. Walking down the aisle of the church and sitting in  the pew beside his mother was how he returned. Each interview shows  another side of the tragedies and triumphs faced by veterans.   The work that Jack has done is necessary to help younger generations  understand the commitments and sacrifices made by our Nation's  veterans. Preserving the oral histories of those who served helps us  better understand the challenging circumstances they underwent and the  emotional impacts they experienced during that time. These veterans had  immense influence on our country from their brave and selfless duty of  protecting our Nation's values and freedoms. Through the diligent work  of Jack Rutland, Jr., we can learn a bit more about the Nation we are  today from those who served in the armed forces for us.   My life has truly been enhanced by knowing Jack and his wife Shirley,  who reside in my corner of the world. They have an outstanding family  that includes their daughter Jamie, son-in-law Joshua Grosshans, and  three grandchildren: Avery Rose, Jack Seton, and Alice Faye.   In conclusion, I am incredibly grateful to Mr. Jack Rutland, Jr., for  dedicating his time to serving those who have served our country. I  commend him for his accomplishments, and I hope his story and the  veterans' stories he brings to light will inspire future  generations.                            ____________________
