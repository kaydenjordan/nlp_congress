 Mr. President, it is good to be with my colleagues and  the chair of the Senate Finance Committee. I am pleased to say a few  words about the President's nominee, Seema Verma, who, if confirmed,  will lead us at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She is  from Indiana, and folks I know in Indiana have said that she knows a  lot about Medicaid, but not nearly so much about Medicare, which is a  cause for some concern.   If confirmed, let me just say we certainly look forward to working  with her and with the team she will have around her in that  responsibility. It is a very tough job, as the Presiding Officer knows.
