 Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has been a disaster for Arizonans.  My home State of Arizona has been hit the hardest. Premiums in Arizona  for many have increased over 100 percent, and providers have fled the  State, leaving some counties with one provider and little options for  healthcare insurance.   ObamaCare must be repealed. In fact, there is no constitutional  authority given to the Federal Government to take over our healthcare  system. These issues are, in fact, best left to the States to manage.   I am advocating for a complete repeal of ObamaCare as soon as  possible, with a transition period of no longer than 24 months.   The approach I am suggesting will remove government from between  patients and their doctors. Our alternative will encourage competition,  which will in turn lead to lower costs to all Americans, but in  particular, Arizonans.   I remain committed to seeing this happen.                            ____________________
