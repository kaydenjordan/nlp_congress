 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true  public servant and an icon of the Tri-Cities community. Last month, my  good friend Karen McGinnis passed away. For 20 years, Karen served as  the founding director of a critically important worker training  facility, the Volpentest Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency  Response, HAMMER, Federal Training Center, at the Hanford site in my  home State of Washington.   Born in Nevada and raised in Oregon, Karen made her way to my alma  mater, Washington State University, where she received her master's  degree in agricultural economics in 1980. She went on to work at the  Hanford site for almost her entire career, serving various Hanford  contractors for 40 years,  [[Page S4941]]  including two decades as the director of the HAMMER training center.  This is where I had the great fortune to cross paths with Karen.   Karen and I worked together from the get-go, along with Sam  Volpentest, to plan, fund, and build HAMMER. I was so proud to stand  with Karen and Sam at the groundbreaking for HAMMER in 1995, and I  still have the shovel from that event in my office today. It serves as  a reminder of what just a few people with a real passion to make a  difference can accomplish--and if anyone had passion for this effort,  it was Karen. Her work was essential to getting HAMMER off the ground  and growing it into the world-class worker training center that it is  today.   Beyond founding HAMMER, one of Karen's crowning achievements was the  many, many partnerships she was able to forge. She brought Federal,  State, and local agencies together with organized labor, Tribal  governments, contractors and management, safety professionals, and  community leaders to form a coalition that made HAMMER flourish. Her  leadership earned HAMMER the Federal Government's top safety award  through the Star Program of the Voluntary Protection Program. Karen was  also honored with a Special Achievement Award for her role in getting  there, and she was later appointed to sit on the Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers, FLETC, Advisory Board. Her leadership and  coalition-building ensured that workers at the Hanford site and  emergency responders around the world continue to receive the training  they need to remain safe on the job today. Their work is dangerous--but  vital. Without HAMMER, the Hanford cleanup mission would not have the  trained workers necessary to continue making progress safely.   Ultimately, the entire safety culture at Hanford can be traced back  to Karen's leadership, her dedication and infectious optimism, and her  ability to bring people together. Former AFL-CIO president Richard  Trumka recognized her work as one of the most important partnerships  between labor and management in the country. I find it hard to  disagree. Her incredible leadership and dedication to protecting  workers' health and safety was essential in making HAMMER into a  globally recognized worker training facility.   Not only did Karen build HAMMER, she also established the  professional culture for worker safety, Tribal relationships, and  collaboration between labor, contractors, and Federal programs. And she  didn't stop there; she went on to develop the next generation of  workers so that the worker-trainers of the future could lead the way.  Now, there is an army of HAMMER champions ensuring that Congress, DOE,  contractors, and national labor leaders recognize just how important  this facility is.   I also have to say, as someone who knows a little about this: Karen  didn't take the easy road. She entered a profession dominated by men at  the time--and she didn't just get by, she thrived as a pioneer in the  field. Karen earned the respect of her colleagues, and importantly, she  opened doors and broke glass ceilings so that other women could follow  in her path.   Karen McGinnis was truly one-of-a-kind, a natural leader whose  dedication, boundless energy, and wisdom touched many lives. She helped  build something extraordinary at the Volpentest HAMMER Federal Training  Center. Karen had as strong of a moral compass as you can find, and  when she knew she was in the right, she did not take ``no'' for an  answer. As for me personally, I knew that any time Karen came to my  office--or anytime I visited her in the better Washington--she came  ready to work, ready to help people, and ready to solve problems.  Hanford workers and so many other people around the world are better  off today because of Karen's vision, her tireless work, and her  dedication to their safety and well-being.   Karen McGinnis has made a tremendous impact on the Tri-Cities  community, Washington State, and our entire Nation. Today, I join with  others in the State of Washington and across the world in recognizing  Karen for her many years of service. She is dearly missed.                            ____________________
