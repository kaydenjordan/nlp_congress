 Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle  should be embarrassed. This massive, $1.9 trillion spending spree is  nothing more than a fiscally irresponsible, liberal wish list. Less  than 10 percent of this bill actually responds to the pandemic in the  form of vaccine distribution and other public health needs. The vast  majority of this funding goes to misplaced priorities, such as bailing  out mismanaged State and local governments for pre-COVID liabilities,  paying people to not work, expanding ObamaCare, providing stimulus  checks to illegal immigrants, and allowing taxpayer funds to pay for  abortion.   It is true that the legislation appropriates $130 billion on top of  the $110 billion already provided to schools, but it does so without  any stipulation that schools actually reopen. This is despite  overwhelming evidence that it is safe for our children to go back to  in-person learning. And 95 percent of the money allocated to schools  will not be spent until after 2022, which means this bill does almost  nothing to get our kids back in the classroom. Meanwhile, approximately  $1 trillion in COVID relief already appropriated by Congress remains  unspent.   Mr. Speaker, I am voting ``no'' for my children, I am voting ``no''  to protect taxpayers, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
