 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4851) to establish the Kennedy-King National Historic Site  in the State of Indiana, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4851         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4851, introduced by Congressman Andre Carson and  cosponsored by Congresswoman Susan Brooks, would establish the Kennedy- King National Commemorative Site in Indianapolis, Indiana.   Additionally, the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to  include the site in the newly established African American Civil Rights  Network, and it authorizes a special resource study to evaluate the  national significance of the site and determine the suitability and  feasibility of including the site as a unit of the National Park  system.   On April 4, 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy had scheduled a speech in  Indianapolis during his campaign for the Presidency of the United  States. Just prior to giving his remarks, Mr. Kennedy was informed of  the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He then changed his  planned remarks to, instead, inform the large gathering of Dr. King's  death.   In this historic speech, he called upon Americans to embrace  nonviolence in reaction to the news of Dr. King's assassination.  Senator Kennedy stated: ``What we need in the United States is not  division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need  in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and  wisdom and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice  toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be White  or whether they be Black.''   The site where Senator Kennedy delivered the speech is currently  located in a city park established in 1961 and has since served as a  community gathering place. In 1994, the Landmark for Peace Memorial  sculpture was erected on the site of Senator Kennedy's speech. April 4,  2018, marks the 50th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's speech and Dr.  King's assassination.   I commend Representative Carson and Representative Brooks for working  across the aisle on this bipartisan and important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 835) to update the map of, and modify the maximum acreage  available for inclusion in, the Florissant Fossil Beds National  Monument.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 835         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MAP UPDATE; MAXIMUM ACREAGE AVAILABLE FOR                     INCLUSION IN THE FLORISSANT FOSSIL BEDS                     NATIONAL MONUMENT.         The first section of Public Law 91-60 (83 Stat. 101) is       amended--        (1) by striking ``entitled `Proposed Florissant Fossil Beds       National Monument', numbered NM-FFB-7100, and dated March       1967, and more particularly described by metes and bounds in       an attachment to that map,'' and inserting ``entitled       `Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument Proposed Boundary       Adjustment', numbered 171/132,544, and dated May 3, 2016,'';       and        (2) by striking ``six thousand acres'' and inserting       ``6,300 acres''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 835 is a bill that I am very pleased to have  introduced with bipartisan support from my friends, Congressman Scott  Tipton and Congressman Jared Polis, both of Colorado. Specifically,  H.R. 835 would increase the current 6,000 acres to 6,300 acres and  allow the National Park Service to accept the donation of 280 acres  currently being held by the Palmer Land Trust and Coalition for the  Upper South Platte into the monument's boundaries.   The Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument was designated by  Congress in 1969 to preserve and study one of the most diverse fossil  deposits in the world and to interpret its geologic significance.   Located in a high mountain valley just west of Pikes Peak in my  congressional district and 35 miles west of Colorado Springs, Colorado,  the monument features detailed fossils of insects, plants, and giant  petrified redwood stumps that teach visitors about prehistoric  Colorado.   The park also maintains a collection of over 12,000 fossil specimens,  conducts inventory and monitoring of the fossil sites, has ongoing  collaborations, and continues to be the subject of scientific  publications. Many of these extraordinary fossils from the monument can  be found in some of the most prominent natural history museums in the  world, with the largest exhibit of perhaps 10,000 specimens located  close by here in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.   The monument also offers a variety of recreational experiences,  including sightseeing, stargazing, interpretive visitor center  exhibits, hiking, picnicking, daily ranger-guided programs during the  summer, junior ranger programs, and curriculum-based education programs  for visiting school groups. It is truly an excellent addition to the  National Park Service.   Expanding the monument will provide critical access to the park's  western boundary for wildfire protection and opportunities for  completing future hazardous fuel mitigation projects, while also  providing additional wildlife habitat. In addition, the donated acreage  could, and will, provide visitors with more recreational opportunities,  including hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and wildlife  watching, all with no supplement funding or staff needed.   The proposed monument boundary expansion has received unanimous local  support from all stakeholders; including, the State of Colorado, the  Friends of the Florissant Fossil Beds, Sanborn Western Camps, Teller  Historic and Environmental Coalition, Colorado Parks and Wildlife,  Palmer Land Trust, Coalition for the Upper South Platte, the Pikes Peak  Historical Society, and the Teller County Board of Commissioners.   This bipartisan bill is a great example for how the Antiquities Act  should be applied, with strong local support, consensus, and engagement  to identify and conserve the ``smallest area compatible with proper  care and management of the objects to be protected.''   That language, Mr. Speaker, is from the original Antiquities Act  itself.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for her  support and great work in committee. This is something that has a lot  of bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask all Members to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
