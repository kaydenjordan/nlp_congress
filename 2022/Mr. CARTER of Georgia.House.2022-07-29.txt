 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of an incredible public servant, a veteran, and a great American:  Gene Anglin.   Born in 1924 in Wadley, Georgia, Gene was a Georgia native, who  served his community and was a defender of freedom.   At the onset of World War II, Gene felt the call to action but was  denied entry to the U.S. Army due to color blindness.   Gene went to work for Bell Aircraft Corporation building B-29  Superfortress bombers.   In 1944, Gene successfully enlisted and joined the U.S. Army in the  heavy weapons company of the 100th Infantry Division.   Gene deployed to the European theater where his division experienced  185 days of uninterrupted combat as they journeyed through France and  into Germany.   Gene was awarded the Bronze Star Medal Combat Infantryman Badge and  Presidential Unit Citation for heroism in battle.   After the war, Gene attended the Georgia Institute of Technology and  earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.   Gene spent 22 years at Robert and Company Association, among other  firms. He then retired to St. Simons Island in the First Congressional  District where he worked as a golf course starter at Sea Island Golf  Club and was an active member of St. Simons Presbyterian Church and the  Rotary Club of St. Simons.   Truly an example of America's Greatest Generation, Gene will be  dearly missed.                            ____________________
