 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 544) to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and  Accountability Act of 2014 to modify the termination date for the  Veterans Choice Program, and for other purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and add extraneous material into the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and add extraneous material into the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of S. 544. Congress created the Choice  Program in 2014 to ensure that veterans waiting in line at the  Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities across the country  had an option of seeking care in their communities. Though Choice is  far from perfect, 3 years later, more than a million veterans have used  it to get care they needed faster and closer to home.   Choice has also led to a nationwide conversation about the importance  of the VA healthcare system, the need for VA to be a better partner to  community providers and hospitals everywhere, and the actions we must  take to ensure that VA is well positioned to provide high-quality care  to veterans for generations to come. As chairman, I am wholeheartedly  committed to seeing that conversation through to a solution.   We are currently refining legislation that will provide a long-term  path to make the VA healthcare system and VA's care in the community  programs, including Choice, work better for veterans, for VA, for  community providers, and for taxpayers alike. Our goal is to have that  solution on the President's desk later this year.   However, Choice is expected to sunset just four short months from now  on August 7, 2017. And when it does, the VA expects to have anywhere  from $800 million to $1.2 billion left in the Choice fund.   Absent enactment of this bill or legislation like it, on August 8,  those funds will no longer be available to help veterans get the care  they need, with potentially tragic consequences.   During a full committee hearing last month, Secretary Shulkin  testified:   ``Without congressional action, veterans will have to face longer  wait times for care.''   He went on to say that allowing Choice to sunset would be ``a  disaster for American veterans.''   With the passage of this bill today, we can get one step closer to  avoiding that disaster.   In anticipation of the program's expiration, VA has already started  halting referrals to Choice for services, like maternity care and  oncology care that typically require lengthy episodes of care. That  means that veterans with cancer or veterans who are pregnant can no  longer choose to take advantage of Choice care if they live far away  from a VA medical facility or have to wait more than 30 days for the  next VA appointment.   As if that wasn't bad enough, if Choice is not extended by the end of  April, VA will have to stop sending referrals to Choice for many other  services that veterans are relying on.   To prevent this, S. 544 would remove the August 7, 2017, sunset date  from the Choice program. This will allow the program to continue  working for veteran patients until all the money remaining in the  veterans Choice fund--the money that Congress provided 3 years ago for  this exact purpose--is fully expended.   It would also ensure that, as we move forward with ongoing efforts to  create an enduring solution to the problems VA is facing, veterans are  not cut off from potentially lifesaving or life-preserving care.   The bill would also eliminate the requirement for VA to act as the  secondary payor for nonservice-connected care provided under Choice.  This would bring Choice in line with VA's other care in the community  programs and remove a pain point that, while well-intentioned, has  impeded the provision of care for certain patients and challenged VA's  ability to issue reimbursements to community providers in a timely  consistent manner.   In addition, the bill would authorize VA to share medical record  information with community providers who are jointly treating veteran  patients. This would ensure that the clinicians caring for veterans,  both in VA and community medical facilities, have all the information  that they need to make well-informed treatment plans and provide the  highest quality care.   Subsequent redisclosure of medical records information would be  prohibited, meaning that personal patient information would be  safeguarded from inappropriate disclosures.   As chairman, as a veteran, and as a doctor, I cannot think of  anything more important that we can do today to help our Nation's  veterans and pass this legislation out of the House of Representatives  and swiftly deliver it to the President's desk for his signature.  [[Page H2723]]    I urge all of my colleagues to join me in doing that by supporting  this bill today.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Ranking Member  Walz, for his kind words and his hard work on this legislation also.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the  vice chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), my good friend, a veteran of both the  Marine Corps and the Army, twice deployed to Iraq, and a very active  member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I look forward to working with Ranking Member Walz and our fellow  committee members to strike the appropriate balance between ensuring  protections that are in place to provide provider agreement authority  from being unfairly utilized and reducing administrative burdens on  small providers.   However, absent passage of this legislation today, veterans with  serious need will not be able to get the care they need. Already,  veterans who are pregnant or who have been diagnosed with cancer have  been unable to take advantage of the increased access to care that the  Choice Program provides.   I would also note that, since Choice granted VA provider agreement  authority in the Choice Act 3 years ago, the committee has not heard a  single instance where that authority has been improperly utilized or  resulted in unfair labor practices.   Furthermore, the exclusion afforded in the Choice Act is no more  generous than providers under Medicare or in TRICARE currently enjoy,  and there is no reason why providers accepting veteran patients should  have to deal with more administrative burdens than providers under  Medicare and TRICARE. I can assure you, as a Medicare provider and a  TRICARE provider, that is enough burden.  [[Page H2725]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Lance), my good friend and fellow classmate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a former member and a very active  member of our committee.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I want to thank the majority and the minority staff that worked on  this bill, and certainly the Senate, Senators Tester and Isakson, and  the committee on the Senate side for getting this over here in a timely  way. We needed to do this now so that we could continue care for  patients that would go past August 7. We have people right now who are  getting care that is going to be long term, and they would be cut off  or couldn't use the Choice program.   We have heard a lot of the problems with Choice here, but it has also  helped a lot of veterans. What we feel like we want the opportunity to  do now is be given a little bit of time, in a bipartisan way, to work  out the problems with this.   I think this goes for everyone on our committee: At the end of the  day, our purpose, our goal is to provide access and the best quality of  care for veterans that this country can deliver. That is the goal of  our committee in a bipartisan way.   With that, once again, I encourage all of my Members to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, S. 544.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Self-Insurance Protection Act, H.R. 1304.   Mr. Speaker, I find it hardly plausible you could make something  worse where one-third of the counties in my district have no option to  buy any insurance on the exchange, and the third largest county in the  State of Tennessee has no option. So I would beg to differ, Mr.  Speaker.   We all want to ensure workers have access to high-quality, affordable  health coverage. That is exactly what this legislation is all about.   Self-insured plans offer high-quality healthcare coverage at a  reasonable cost for workers. This popular option allows employers to  pay their employees' healthcare costs directly and, if costs are lower  than expected, those savings can be reserved for later years to help  cover their workers' future healthcare costs.   One of the benefits to self-insurance is that employers have more  flexibility to customize their healthcare plans as they see fit for the  unique needs of their employees. These plans are also free from many of  the restrictive requirements associated with traditional healthcare  plans, requirements that limit choices and force employees to purchase  specific benefits they may not want or need.   As healthcare costs have risen, many employers have turned to this  cost-effective model. In fact, in 2016, more than 60 percent of all  employers offering health insurance coverage were self-insured, of the  160 million or so people in this country that have insurance through  their job.   Even the labor unions have embraced this approach. However, employers  may also take greater financial risk when providing this popular option  to workers. To help mitigate that risk, many employers opt to purchase  stop-loss insurance.   Stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, nor has it ever been  considered health insurance under Federal law. It does not process  medical claims, and it does not perform any other traditional function  of health insurance. What it does instead is provide employers choosing  to provide self-insurance with a financial backstop, protecting the  benefits of workers and their families.   Unfortunately, the former administration threatened to regulate stop- loss insurance as traditional health insurance, a move that would put  workers and their families at risk of losing access to the self-insured  market. While we now have a new administration that understands the  importance of providing more pathways to affordable healthcare  coverage, Congress must also act to ensure that no future  administration will be able to restrict the self-insurance option. The  Self-Insurance Protection Act does just that.   This legislation reaffirms longstanding policies, prevents future  bureaucratic overreach, and clarifies once and for all that stop-loss  insurance is not health insurance. By supporting H.R. 1304, we will  promote more choices and protect access to affordable healthcare  coverage options for families.    Let me put this all in English. I was the mayor of Johnson City,  Tennessee, where we had a self-insured plan for the teachers and for  the workers there at the city. The city provided an opportunity for  people to have health insurance for their families. We would accept  risks up to $250,000, and then we bought policies to protect the  taxpayers and the city from any costs that went above that.   What this plan also allowed us to do is put in incredibly innovative  health prevention, things like wellness programs, smoking cessation,  weight loss, diabetes screening, lowering cholesterol. We put all those  things in that plan, which helped hold--even with insurance premiums  going up, we were able to level insurance costs going up and,  therefore, save the employees and the teachers money in that community.  That is all it is.   Everybody buys insurance in this country to mitigate risk. When you  by homeowners insurance, you say: I will have $1,000 deductible. So if  I have a roof blow off, I can stand to pay $1,000, but my insurance  covers the rest.   That is all this is. It just protects risk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1304.
