 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  anniversary of Highland Park, MI. Situated in Wayne County of southeast  Michigan, Highland Park is endowed with a rich history of innovation as  the ``birthplace of mass production.'' It is also the site of the  Nation's first urban highway, and was fondly referred to as the ``City  of Trees'' for its beautiful foliage.   In its infancy, the settlement that would eventually become Highland  Park underwent two name changes, Nabor and then Whitewood,  respectively, before it was incorporated as a village in 1889 and then  as a city in the early 20th century.   The small farming community experienced an economic boom in 1910,  when Henry Ford opened his first Model T factory, now recognized as a  historical site. The opening of the plant paved the way for new  infrastructure, which changed the rapidly growing Highland Park  Village's landscape from rural to urban. The news of abundant economic  opportunity in the village spread nationally and internationally.  Immigrants came to Highland Park aspiring to earn the impressive $5-a- day wage that Henry Ford's factories offered, while new residents  traveled from across the Nation to the village in hopes of becoming  newly minted members of the middle-class. The population grew from a  little under 500 residents at the top of the 20th century to over  50,000 in 1930.   The city of Detroit, Highland Park Village's southern neighbor, also  began to expand. From the early 1800s and into the early part of the  1900s, the city of Detroit's footprint increased as the city moved to  annex surrounding townships. To prevent annexation by the bustling city  of Detroit, Highland Park officially incorporated as a city in 1918.  Detroit continued to enlarge its boarders, ultimately encircling the  city of Highland Park, leading to the city within a city phenomenon  seen today.   Before Highland Park became the epicenter of production, with the  presence of Ford and later Chrysler, it was appropriately named the  City of Trees, for its abundance of elms, reminiscent of a forest.  Beautiful arrays of elm trees lined neighborhood streets as trees were  planted in front of every home. Unfortunately, the once striking  display of greenery diminished toward the 1970s, due to the spread of  Dutch elm disease, which impacted surrounding cities as well.   In another historic first, Highland Park was the site of the  country's first urban highway, the Davison Freeway. Construction began  in 1941 and was expeditiously completed in 1942 to ease transport for  Defense manufacturers assisting in the Nation's ``Arsenal of  Democracy'' during World War II. The Davison Freeway greatly improved  the flow of traffic to and from the city of Detroit.   The Highland Park community includes a diverse and hard-working  population, and many notable figures in government, sports, and popular  culture have called Highland Park home.  [[Page S7316]]  Some former residents include comedian Tim Meadows, singer Jackie  Wilson, animator Butch Hartman, football player and community leader  Reggie McKenzie, and the sixth-longest serving member of the U.S. House  of Representatives, Congressman John Conyers.   As the city of Highland Park celebrates its 100th anniversary, I am  honored to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing its residents,  businesses, and elected officials who continue grassroots efforts  toward revitalizing a community which has such significance to Michigan  history as well as to the Nation. I wish the city of Highland Park  continued growth and prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
