 Mr. Chairman, again, overall, I want to thank Chairman  Shuster and the ranking member for bringing the FAA bill in. But I also  support the Denham-Costa amendment because, again, it is a narrow fix  on this, and it is only dealing with the interstate itself.   Again, this is a bill that we want to provide some sort of uniformity  on. And that is all we are asking for is uniformity. If it crosses  State lines, we are asking for that type of uniformity. Again, in the  industry, those drivers cross State lines multiple times per day.   So I would ask that you support the Denham-Costa amendment.
