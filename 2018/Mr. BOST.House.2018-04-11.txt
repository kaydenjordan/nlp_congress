 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the patriotism and  generosity of Al Katzenberger, Jr., a true friend to southern Illinois  and its veterans.   After Memorial Day last year, a thunderstorm blew through Mound City  National Cemetery in Pulaski County.   The 50 cotton flags that make up the Avenue of Flags of the cemetery  were no match for the 70-mile-per-hour winds. Every flagpole was  destroyed at this center of pride for our local community.   Upon hearing the news, Alfred, who served in the U.S. Navy for over  40 years, decided to take action. He donated 50 new flagpoles worth  over $12,000.   It is selfless acts like this that help make our community stronger.   To Alfred, we say: Thank you for your decades of service to our  Nation and your continued dedication to honoring our Nation's veterans.                            ____________________
