 Amendment XXVI, section 1:   ``The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years  of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United  States or by any State on account of age.''   Section 2:   ``The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by  appropriate legislation.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue a series of 1-minute  speeches on cool science topics. Today I recognize the work of  scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica to develop  geological metal maps. Researchers developed a three-dimensional  electronic mapping system that is being used to detect large precious  metal deposits in the United States.   With funding from NSF, researchers mapped out the Nokomis deposit in  northern Minnesota, which is estimated to contain 10 billion pounds of  copper, 3.1 billion pounds of nickel, 4 million ounces of platinum, 9  million ounces of palladium, and 2 million ounces of gold. The value of  these metal deposits will more than pay for the science investment to  develop this technology.   Congress should support research that furthers the understanding of  our incredible universe, including the ground beneath our feet.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 10 as the  designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Mr. Chairman, recent pipeline incidents have raised  serious concerns about the condition of the Nation's pipelines that  threaten the safety and health of American citizens. This amendment  will ensure that any rule intended to guarantee the safety of natural  gas or hazardous material pipelines is not considered a major rule  under this bill and would, therefore, be easier to create.   Pipeline safety is a bipartisan issue. Congress has shown that  issuing regulations related to pipelines is a priority, as evident with  the enactment of the PIPES Act last year.   However, the bill before us today, H.R. 26, contradicts this historic  precedent and would have the effect of delaying or preventing any rule  on pipeline safety from going forward. Pipeline accidents cause major  property damage, serious injuries or deaths, and harms the environment.   There are approximately 2.9 million miles of pipeline in the United  States. They travel through rural and urban areas, Republican and  Democratic districts, coastlines, inland areas. Everyone is impacted.  Quality control measures, new infrastructure, and oversight are  paramount.   Unfortunately, we have seen the devastating impact of pipeline  incidents throughout the country, including several accidents and  spills in California in recent years, such as the spill in Santa  Barbara that released more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil.   We have also seen how liquid spills can devastate the people and  economies in places like Michigan, and the irreplaceable natural  resources like the Yellowstone River in Montana, or the precious  coastline of Santa Barbara. Additionally, these explosions and spills  cause shortages and price increases that impact Americans far from the  site of the accident.   A Colonial Pipeline accident this past September in Alabama leaked  roughly 8,000 barrels of gasoline and saw prices increase by up to 31  cents a gallon in metropolitan areas in the Southeastern States.   I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we  want effective and efficient government. But, in reality, pipeline  safety regulations are already subject to duplicative and time- consuming analyses, including a rigorous risk assessment and cost- benefit analysis required by the pipeline safety statute. These already  duplicative review requirements are among the top reasons why the  Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration increasingly  lags behind the congressional mandate to issue rules that protect  Americans from dangerous pipeline incidents.   In fact, this was the subject of a great deal of discussion when the  Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the pipeline safety  reauthorization bill last year. I worked with Chairman Upton and  Ranking Member Pallone to address this issue, as both sides of the  aisle agreed that the duplicative reviews currently required are  already slowing down these critical safety laws to a degree that is  frustrating and dangerous.   While we make progress in the PIPES Act, I believe we can and should  do more. The last thing we need is one more layer of bureaucracy to  further slow down implementation of these critical protections for  public health, safety, and the environment. We should work together to  prevent spills and work to minimize impacts when spills or other  incidents do occur. This includes automatic shut-off valves, leak  detection, and technologies to reduce clogging and rupture.   A vote for this amendment is a vote for the safety of the public and  the environment. It is a vote to protect the land and water that are  threatened by oil spills. It is a vote for industry that wants  certainty and clarity and doesn't want to--or benefit from--wait years  for rules to be finalized. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my opponent is right. It is the duty of  Congress to provide rules and to provide guidelines and for the  agencies to go into the details in creating these rules.   I know that the other side is opposed to the rules. They have been  touting about regulations, but poor regulations reduces jobs, too. It  creates monopolies. It creates pollution. But that is not what we are  talking about.   What we are talking about is public safety. I think what we need to  do is look at what is going to benefit the public safety and what is  going to protect people, lives, property, and the environment. That is  what this amendment does. It is simple. It exempts pipeline safety from  H.R. 26.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
