 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.    Mr. President, later tonight or in the early hours of  tomorrow morning, we will vote on final passage of the Republican tax  bill. I would like to make two main points about the Republican tax  bill in my speech this morning, first on process and second on  substance.   From the beginning, the Republican tax bill has made a mockery of the  legislative process. Republican leaders disappeared behind closed doors  and negotiated a framework for a tax bill without a shred of Democratic  input. Then Republican leaders wrote a bill, behind closed doors,  without a shred of Democratic input. Republicans brought that bill  through a markup in the Finance Committee, where it underwent the  scrutiny of one--I repeat, one--expert witness. That is it. Finance  Committee Democrats offered 60 amendments to the bill, but Republicans  rejected every single one. The Republicans on the committee made it  crystal clear that they were not interested in bipartisanship.   Now that bill is before us on the floor. Even further, significant  changes will likely be made by the majority leader today. We will get  huge changes in a bill today and try to vote on it tonight. This is  tax--one of the most complicated issues before us. These changes, and  the way the majority leader is handling this, make it impossible for  any independent analyst to get a good look at the bill and how it would  impact our country.   From the one-sidedness with which it was drafted to the reckless  haste with which it was considered, the Republican tax bill has failed  to go through anything resembling the normal legislative process.   Before the night is out, I hope my Republican friends will ask  themselves if this is the way they want history to remember how the  first major tax bill was passed in over 30 years. I hope they will ask  themselves if this process has lived up to the fine traditions of this  body, as they were so eloquently described by my friends, the Senators  from Arizona, both senior and junior.   The American people are clamoring for us to work together. They  believe our politics is broken. They think our politics is starved of  commonsense and compromise--and it is. The way this tax bill is being  rammed through is exactly why the American people believe our politics  is so broken.   Now let me address the substance of the bill. Without exaggeration, I  believe that if this bill passes, it will be remembered as one of the  worst pieces of public policy in decades. A vote for passage will be a  vote my Republican friends will regret.   At a time of immense inequality, the Republican tax bill makes life  easier on the well-off and eventually makes life more difficult on  working Americans, exacerbating one of the most pressing problems we  face as a nation--the yawning gap between the rich and everyone else.   Corporations enjoying record profits get a massive permanent tax  break while over 60 percent of the middle class will end up paying  higher taxes because their benefits expire. Healthcare premiums will go  up 10 percent, and 13 million fewer Americans will end up having health  insurance as a result of repealing the individual mandate. The CBO said  yesterday that even if we pass the Murray-Alexander bill into law, it  would have little or no impact on either of those two things.   When it is all said and done, the tax bill would balloon the deficit  by at least $1.5 trillion, adding to the debt burden borne by the next  generation and diminishing our ability to support the military and  invest in our schools, our roads, and in scientific research. Let me  just repeat that. The increased deficits caused by this bill will  cannibalize support from everything we know is essential to economic  growth and a strong middle class, including support for our men and  women in uniform.   Ultimately, this deficit-busting tax cut will endanger Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as my friend, the Republican Senator  from Florida, admitted yesterday when he said higher deficits will mean  ``instituting changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.''   So a win today for the GOP will be a very temporary one. It would be  enjoyed almost exclusively in the political media that measures who is  up today and down tomorrow but fails to grasp the bigger picture.   It will not be a long-term win politically. Recent polling has shown  this tax bill is less popular than previous tax hikes. Let me say that  again. Recent polling has shown that this tax bill is less popular than  previous tax hikes, but, more importantly, it will not win out in the  country. It will not be a win for 13 million middle-class families who  pay higher taxes in 2019, or the 87 million middle-class families who  pay higher taxes in 2027. It will not be a win for the single mom in  the suburbs who no longer is able to deduct State and local taxes and  will find it that much harder to send her daughter to college. It will  not be a win for the 13 million Americans who go without health  insurance and everyone else who will face 10 percent higher premiums  next year.    Those hard-working Americans have waited years for their Congress to  pass legislation to make things just a bit easier on them. They have  watched an economy that for decades rewarded hard work and fair play  turn against them, producing more wealth for the already wealthy but  less pay and less work for workers.   For so many, this rigged economy that benefits too few and leaves too  many behind is a source of frustration, anger, and despair. Donald  Trump, in his campaign for the Presidency, spoke to that anger, and yet  his tax bill--the Republican tax bill--is a betrayal of the working men  and women who feel that anger and would make worse all of the problems  that led to it in the first place. We can do a better job on tax  reform, but only if we work together.   The way this Congress has careened from partisan bill to partisan  bill, with no attempt even made at bipartisanship, has brought shame on  this body and reinforced the skepticism that so many Americans have  about our politics.   Today my Republican friends have an opportunity to turn back from  this partisan bill and this partisan process. If they do, I guarantee  they will find a Democratic leader, a Democratic Senate caucus, and a  Democratic Party that is eager to work with them on the kind of tax  reform our country deserves.   We will not sit in our corner and make unreasonable demands. As many  of my colleagues know, there is a lot of sincere intent on this side of  the aisle to do tax reform. I have worked with Senator Hatch, and I  have worked with Senator Portman. Many others of my caucus have worked  with Republicans on tax reform ideas for years. We can certainly put  together a bill acceptable to both parties that reduces burdens on the  middle class, makes our economy more competitive, and creates jobs here  at home, and do it in a deficit neutral way. The bill doesn't do those  things, but we can write a bill that does--together.   I say: Let's give it a shot. If my Republican friends close the door  on their partisan tax bill tonight, they will find  [[Page S7510]]  an open door for bipartisan tax reform tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
