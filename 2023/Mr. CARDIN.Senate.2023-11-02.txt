 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  dear constituent, Benson ``Buzz'' Roberts, in recognition of his  imminent retirement as president and chief executive officer of the  National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders--NAAHL--and his 45  years of dedicated service in the affordable housing and community  development field.   Throughout his career, Buzz has been an influential voice on housing  and community development policy and practices. He has been among the  most important leaders in helping to advance key legislation to support  the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, the New Markets Tax Credit, and more  recently my Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit. As the lead Senate sponsor  on legislation to expand New Markets Tax Credits and legislation to  create Neighborhood Homes credits, I have personally been witness to  Buzz's thoughtful leadership and relentless advocacy in support of  these critical initiatives. Buzz has also been a key champion of many  other key housing and community development initiatives over the years,  including HOME Investment Partnerships grants, the Capital Magnet Fund,  Treasury Department funding for Federal Housing Administration  multifamily risk-sharing loans, and regulatory changes to the Community  Reinvestment Act.   Buzz began his career as a community development organizer. He later  served at a national association of nonprofit neighborhood development  groups before serving for over 20 years as the senior vice president  for policy and program development at the Local Initiatives Support  Corporation--LISC--a leading nonprofit investor in affordable housing  and community revitalization. Buzz then went on to serve as the first  Director of the Office of Small Business, Community Development and  Housing Policy at the U.S. Treasury Department.   In 2015, Buzz joined NAAHL as its president and CEO. NAAHL is a  national association that brings together banks, Community Development  Financial Institutions, and other capital providers. During his time at  NAAHL, Buzz has helped further the mission of the organization, which  is to expand economic opportunity through responsible private financing  for affordable  [[Page S5337]]  housing and inclusive neighborhood revitalization. This includes  ensuring that policies continue to be in place to support the critical  work of NAAHL members and the millions of people in the Nation who need  affordable and sustainable housing. Buzz also serves as a board member  of several national and local nonprofit organizations and coalitions  and has written extensively about affordable housing and neighborhood  revitalization.   Buzz has spent his life advocating for affordable housing, community  revitalization, and lifting families out of poverty. What a wonderful  vocation for a truly special person. I know that NAAHL members, current  and former colleagues, and industry friends will miss him. I ask that  my fellow colleagues here in the U.S. Senate join me in thanking Buzz  Roberts for his lifelong commitment to serving families and communities  in need and congratulating him on his well-deserved retirement. I wish  him all the best.                            ____________________
