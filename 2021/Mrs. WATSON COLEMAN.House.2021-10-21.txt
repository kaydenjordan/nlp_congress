 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me to be able to address something that I think is so  critical and is such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.   There are so many elements of this Build Back Better agenda that  touch us from the very youngest to the oldest to the middle class to  the working class to those unable to work and those at greatest need.   I would like to speak on the aspects of the impact on our climate,  the decisions that we must make.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Congress has an opportunity to  address the climate crisis, yet some Members still refuse to take this  issue seriously. Climate catastrophe is no longer some distant threat.  It is here, and it is now. We are witnessing it firsthand, yet we  continue to ignore its very real and very deadly effects.   This year we saw the single largest wildfire in California history.  We saw temperatures surpass 100 degrees in the Pacific Northwest. And  we saw Hurricane Ida devastate my home State of New Jersey as well as  many others.   These tragedies were not inevitable. We could have avoided them had  our country made it clear decades ago that climate change is not a  political issue but a real issue that we need to respond to. We now  face the consequences of our past and present decisions. This could be  our last chance to take long overdue action and spare our children from  having to raise their children in an increasingly hostile world.   The Build Back Better Act includes crucial climate investments. But  these provisions are in jeopardy as some of our colleagues seek to  eliminate them.   The Build Back Better Act must include climate action. It is  nonnegotiable. We need to pass the President's entire agenda, and we  need to pass it now. We might never get another chance.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for this opportunity to speak on  such an important issue.
