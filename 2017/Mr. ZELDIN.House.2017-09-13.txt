 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of  Nicholas Lafond, a young man from Miller Place, in New York's First  Congressional District, who, just a couple weeks back, was taken from  us far too soon due to the disease of addiction.   A bright, intelligent, and talented young man, Nick was loved by all  who knew him. He was an honor student who was accepted to Stony Brook  University with the intention of pursuing a career in education.   However, from a young age, Nick struggled with anxiety, which, sadly,  led him down the path of heroin addiction as a teenager. He fought this  addiction tirelessly with the love and support of his family and  friends, and he sought several forms of treatment. Tragically, just  last month, Nick lost his battle with addiction at the age of 25.   On August 31, I attended a press conference in recognition of  International Overdose Awareness Day, where I met Nick's parents,  Francine and Leonard, and discussed their son, who had been laid to  rest only 2 days prior. The courage of these heartbroken parents, to  come to this event and talk about Nick so soon after his passing, is  absolutely incredible.   As a father, the thought of losing a child is unbearable. Through my  discussion with Mr. and Mrs. Lafond, you could feel their commitment to  fighting this terrible epidemic so that no other parent would have to  go through their experience.   Shortly after our discussion, I received a letter from the Lafonds  detailing Nick's story and outlining so many of the steps we can take  as a community to make drug addiction a thing of the past. From their  words, you can feel their passion for this cause.   Though it is too late to save their son, Francine and Leonard have  dedicated themselves to easing the grip of addiction upon our society.  Their selflessness and bravery in the face of unthinkable tragedy is  truly beyond compare.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here and share Nick's story with  you and the American people and to discuss this critical priority.  Every single day, Americans like this young man fall to drug addiction.  It is one of the absolute greatest threats we face as a nation, and it  will not subside unless we continue to act.   Here in my home county of Suffolk, heroin and opioid abuse is an  especially deadly and destructive scourge. There is no one solution to  ending the drug epidemic. This is a complex issue involving all levels  of government, our community leaders, law enforcement, schools,  churches, and everyday Americans.   We must form a collaborative effort to discuss and develop localized  community-based solutions to tackle this crisis by increasing  treatment, recovery services, and education. Simple incarceration is  not and will never be the lone answer to this crisis.   In the last Congress, I was proud to have cosponsored and help pass  into law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, which  provides a total of $8.33 billion in funding over 5 years to help  combat the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic and funds many initiatives  on the local level. While this is a step in the right direction, it is  not enough to truly end this plague upon our Nation.   As Francine wrote to me in her letter, ``To make headway against this  awful epidemic, the approach must be multifocal, swift, and forceful.  We not only need dollars to be put toward law enforcement and  treatment, both of which we know have limited effect, we also need to  concentrate on addressing the underlying psychological issues that lead  to opioid abuse. These are not drugs one uses to party. They are  extremely strong and effective painkillers one uses to escape life. The  world is a harsh place for kids today, so much different than when I or  even you were young.''   The complexity of this issue is unrivaled, and we cannot turn a blind  eye to any potential effort. This needs to be a highest priority to  resolve. We cannot rest until tragic incidents like what happened to  Nick Lafond become a thing of the past.   I would like to read a poem Nick wrote while in rehab, only weeks  before his passing, which describes his tragic struggle:   [[Page H7319]]              Anxiety is life to me. Mixed with some sobriety; throw in       notoriety, this is my anxiety.        Always looking over my shoulder. Will this get better as I       get older? Carrying it around like a boulder, this is my       anxiety.        Dark holes and deep depression, popping pill after pill in       rapid succession. How did I not see the progression? This is       my anxiety.        Days to weeks, weeks to months, and months to years, why is       my head constantly filled with tears?        Keep a straight face, don't shed any tears; this is my       anxiety.        Waking up to go to sleep, climbing this mountain seems so       steep. Close to the edge, I'll surely leap. This is my       anxiety.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the  Campaign for Decency, which was launched by Lisa Cholnoky, a part-time  resident of my district who is with us here today in the gallery.   Operating out of the First Congressional District of New York, in  Shelter Island, the Campaign for Decency is a nonpartisan organization  that seeks to bring civility back to our Nation.   Ms. Cholnoky was inspired to launch this campaign after witnessing  much of the bitter division in our country and the inability of many  Americans to engage in civil, productive discussion. As Americans, we  cherish our freedom to dissent, but must always bear in mind that these  debates must be productive and substantive.   In July, Ms. Cholnoky mailed out 535 Decency buttons to every single  Representative and Senator. She describes the campaign as ``a simple  reminder of the basic standards of decency that every American  deserves, regardless of their political views.''   I am proudly wearing this button here today to join in Ms. Cholnoky's  call for unity both here in Congress and together as citizens of the  greatest country on Earth.   This campaign sets an example for us all to abide by as we strive to  reach across the aisle in a bipartisan fashion.  [[Page H7324]]                                ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which I  am proud to cosponsor with my colleagues, Mr. Roskam and Mr. Lamborn.  [[Page H7342]]    When the U.S. entered into the JCPOA, we empowered Iran to advance  its bad activities. Iran Air was sanctioned in 2011, for using  commercial flights to transport missile and rocket components to Syria.  The Syrian war is far from over. We cannot allow Iran to establish a  permanent presence in Syria.   This amendment would block taxpayer funds from supporting a regime  that has killed too many people. I strongly support the passage of this  amendment. I am concerned, as I hear opposition to this amendment where  we are talking about the need to protect American jobs, where the  connection is being made to those American jobs being used to support  terrorism abroad. That is a stretch.   I would encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if  they are concerned about protecting American jobs, that we are pursuing  American jobs to help our great country, not supporting the bad  activities of a regime that is developing intercontinental ballistic  missiles in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions; calling  Israel the ``Little Satan'' and America the ``Great Satan;''  overthrowing foreign governments; financially awarding terror; the  largest state sponsor of terrorism. I say that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle should be sharing our concern and supporting  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Roskam for his leadership.
