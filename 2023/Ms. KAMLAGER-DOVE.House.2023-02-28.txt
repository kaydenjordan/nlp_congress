 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the last day of Black  History Month to celebrate the remarkable contributions of Black  businessowners.   Business ownership leads to higher incomes and more wealth, but  decades of systemic bias, redlining, lending discrimination, and  inequity in wages have created an ever-widening wealth gap for minority  communities.   According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, Black-owned  businesses are three to five times more likely to be labeled as a high  credit risk, which sets up barriers to affordable financing and slows  growth. During the height of the pandemic, minority-owned firms were  more likely to be completely shut out of credit and capital resources,  receiving none of the financing they sought out.   This Black History Month, I met with entrepreneurs in my district who  drive our economy forward, people like Malik Muhammad, owner of an  independent bookstore in Baldwin Hills. Malik is passionate about  investing in the community and does so by hosting bookfairs at local  schools because he knows that in order for his neighborhood to thrive,  more people of color need to start businesses in the community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in Congress to recognize the great  strength that is Black entrepreneurship and work with me to build a  more equitable economy for all.                            ____________________
