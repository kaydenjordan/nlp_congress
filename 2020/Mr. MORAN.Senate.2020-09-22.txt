 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, for  debate only, for 30 minutes, with Senators permitted to speak for up to  10 minutes each.    Madam President, I am pleased to share with my colleagues  in the Senate that we have reached an agreement with the House to pass  S. 785, the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health  Improvement Act, and we expect the bill to pass the House of  Representatives tomorrow.   This is a bill that passed--our most significant piece of  legislation--from the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs dealing  with mental health and suicide prevention. The bill came out  [[Page S5750]]  of the committee unanimously and was approved by the Senate  unanimously, and we have been negotiating with Chairman Takano and  Ranking Member Roe of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for its  passage by the House and with consideration by the Senate of other  bills that the House has and will send us.   I want to thank my colleague Senator Tester, the ranking member of  our committee, Chairman Takano, and Dr. Roe, the ranking member of the  House committee, for working expeditiously with me to reach an  agreement to pass this comprehensive mental health and suicide  prevention bill for America's veterans.   One veteran lost due to suicide is one too many, and it is a national  tragedy that we continue to lose 20 veterans each day to suicide.   I am glad that Congress has come together to do our part to ensure  this bill which will save lives. It needs to be passed without delay  and signed into law.   This bill will establish a grant program and require the VA to better  collaborate with community organizations across the country already  serving veterans. This provision was specifically championed by my  colleague Senator Boozman of Arkansas.   In addition, this legislation directs the VA to embark on  groundbreaking research in the form of a precision medicine initiative  that will improve how mental health conditions are diagnosed and  treated, expand VA telehealth capabilities to better serve rural and  Tribal veterans, bolster and expedite Federal research capabilities,  increase accountability over the Department's mental health and suicide  prevention programs, and make necessary improvements to the VA mental  health workforce.   While this legislation puts in place the critical care, services, and  support that will save veterans' lives, it is my hope that the bill  will also serve as a signal to our veterans, servicemembers, and their  families that they are never, never alone.   I want to extend my gratitude to the President for his support of  this bill, and I ask him to sign this legislation as soon as it arrives  on his desk.                            ____________________     Madam President, we must take our duty to America's  veterans seriously, which is why the circumstances we find ourselves in  today are extremely unfortunate. The extensions for important VA  programs for the upcoming fiscal year--just 8 days away--are currently  being held up from being considered and passed in the Senate.   This extension bill was negotiated in earnest and the four corners of  the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees agreed upon this  legislation. This was a collaborative effort, not a partisan one, but,  nonetheless, this bill has not yet been cleared by the Senate minority.   Let me be clear: Countless veterans rely on these programs. Let me be  clear: They expire at the end of the month.   From raising veterans out of homelessness to making certain that  COVID-19 doesn't disrupt a veteran's pursuit of higher education, to  helping rural veterans get their medical appointments, the fiscal year  2021 VA extenders bill contains a wide variety of extensions for  programs that support a multitude of veteran populations.   Additionally, we have requested consent for several House-passed  bills that will improve mental health care for veterans and increase  annual veteran benefit rates to keep up with inflation. These are  commonsense ideas that have broad support and will make meaningful  differences in the lives of our veterans. These are items that would  normally pass the Senate without difficulty.   Our veterans should not wait and should not need to wait. They can't  afford to wait for the Senate to act on these matters. The deadline is  quickly approaching. Our Nation's veterans did not serve their country  for partisan reasons, and we must not let any partisan differences  prevent us from authorizing the programs to support those veterans.   I ask my Senate colleagues to fulfill our collective duty regarding  veterans programs and that we do not allow other issues to distract  from that duty.   I yield the floor.
