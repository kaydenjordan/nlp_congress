 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Mental  Health Month and to acknowledge as I presided today on the floor the  number of mental health bills that were passed today ready to be  approved by the Senate and as well to be signed by the President.   Mr. Speaker, I worked closely with my constituents during COVID-19  and really worked with the city of Houston to use CARES money to  develop a call center for the stressed people in my community.   Mental health is real. Mental health issues are real, and it is  imperative that we continue on the Federal level to provide the  resources to help our families, to educate our families, to provide  counseling for our families, and, yes, to provide an opportunity for  them to call locally and nationally in a stressful situation. COVID-19  was stressful, and many, I believe, lives were saved by the lifeline  that we opened in the city of Houston that was on 7 days a week.   I want to thank all of those providers, including Dr. Janice Dill,  and again, the city of Houston who worked with us in Harris County to  save lives. We must know that mental health is a medical issue, and we  need to save lives, end the stigma, and recognize all of those who are  embracing those who are sick and need help with respect to mental  health.                            ____________________
