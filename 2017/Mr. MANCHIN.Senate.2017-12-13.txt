 Mr. President, all the nearly 50,000 children who are on  West Virginia CHIP want this Christmas is to have their healthcare.  That is not a lot to ask for from a child.   As a legislative body, we were elected to serve the needs of all of  our constituents, and that includes protecting our most vulnerable--our  children. How many times do you hear us give speeches, whether it is in  this body or whether it is back home--it is all about our children. The  future of our country is about our children. The future of our State is  about our children. Our future generation--whatever we do, the promise  of the world--is about our children. And all they are asking for is to  have their healthcare.   It seems as though we are so consumed with partisan gridlock and  posturing that we would allow the expiration of health insurance for  children. It is almost unconscionable for us to be in this situation,  and the children have no control of their own healthcare coverage, and  their parents can't really afford basic healthcare. They are the  working people who are above the poverty guidelines and doing  everything they can to put bread on the table and take care of their  families, and their children have no access to healthcare without CHIP.   On September 30, Congress not only failed to reauthorize a  bipartisan, noncontroversial program for children, we failed the 9  million children in this country who rely on the program to stay  healthy. There are 9 million children who are depending on CHIP, the  funding of CHIP, and the basic priorities we should have for our most  vulnerable, and we have done nothing. Our No. 1 job as Senators, as  parents, and as human beings is to care for and protect our children,  but this body cannot even find the humanity to do that.   In West Virginia alone, almost 50,000 children use CHIP over the  course of the year, and more than 20,000 children who are currently on  the program are going to lose it in February when the money runs out.  Through CHIP, these children have access to basic medical care, which  includes prescriptions, immunizations, dental coverage, vision, and  mental health coverage. For more than 2 months, their healthcare has  been hanging in the balance because of the negligence of the body, our  dysfunction, playing Democrat and Republican at a higher level of our  party than our purpose of being here, which is to do our job.   Millions of families are in a state of uncertainty, worrying about  how to pay for their child's basic healthcare needs or, for many  families, lifesaving services. I believe it is our duty to ensure that  our children are taken care of, for they are truly our country's future  and legacy. I believe that no matter how much your family makes or  where you come from, the most important thing you have is healthcare  for your children so that they have a healthy start.   There are five promises every adult should make to a child. This was  started under Colin Powell, the five promises.   The first one is, every child needs to have a loving, caring adult in  their life; someone who they know unconditionally loves them, right,  wrong, or indifferent. It is not always the biological parents or  biological family. It could be a neighbor. It could be someone reaching  out. It could be a church or service. It could be an afterschool  program.   Second, every child must have a safe place. A safe place might not  always be the home where they live.   Third, every child must have a healthy start. We talked about  nutrition. We talked about healthcare. That is part of it. If we can't  teach a child how to keep themselves healthy, how to take care of  themselves nutritionally in all different ways, they are not going to  grow up to be a productive adult. They will have health concerns. They  will have health challenges. It is up to us to make sure they have that  healthy start.  [[Page S8002]]    Fourth, every child should have a livable skill. That means  education. In this country, we make sure every child has free  education, K-12, and we make sure there is assistance so they can go  through a college program. If we can work with them and help them with  financial literacy, they wouldn't be bound with so much debt. I think  we can help in a lot of different ways.   The fifth promise is the hardest one to teach. It is the hardest one  because this promise is that every child should grow up to be a loving,  caring adult and give something back. If these children see that we  don't care and that our priority is not healthcare and that having a  healthy start in life is not one of our priorities, what are they going  to do when it is their turn, when they become the responsible adults?  What are they going to do? Are they going say: Well, you know, I don't  know, we didn't have too good of an example because we saw all the  bickering and fighting back and forth, politics trumping everything, so  I guess maybe that is not a big priority for us.   I hope they have more discipline than we have had here. I hope they  have more compassion, more empathy than we have shown. That is what I  hope. I hope that we change our ways now and make sure our failure to  come together stops and stops now and that we come together for the  CHIP program and the healthcare for every child who depends on this for  a healthy start in life.   That is why I stand before you today--to encourage my colleagues to  come together and find a solution and protect healthcare for over 9  million children across this country. I have talked to families and  children all across West Virginia who are at risk of losing their  healthcare coverage.   For many families, CHIP is a temporary helping hand while they are  down and out. It is a perfect example of how, in West Virginia and in  America, we put out a hand to help those people in need. There is a  difference between a handout and a hand-up. These people need a hand-up  when they hit hard times.   I have a letter from a mother in West Virginia.   I have encouraged the people of West Virginia to put a real family, a  real face behind the challenges they have so that it is not just  something we are speaking about in a political arena--it is basically  something that happens in real life, and it is affecting people.   This letter comes from Annetta:         My name is Annetta, and I am the mother of a now 18-year-      old son named Dalton. WVCHIP is important to me because when       Dalton was 15, it was discovered he had a pituitary brain       tumor as well as a condition known has Chiari malformation.       If you are not familiar, Chiari is a condition where the       brain protrudes out the back of the head, similar to a       herniated disc in the spine. Most times, Chiari requires       surgery to relieve pressure out of the head.        I had lost my health insurance at work and could not afford       to get a private insurance during this time. Thankfully I was       approved for CHIP. His neurosurgeon nor his endocrinologist       ever had any issues accepting CHIP; they didn't have any       issues with authorizations for MRIs or bone scans, which he       had every few months.        I am very thankful to have had insurance like CHIP, and I       feel there are so many children like my precious son that       will suffer if the program ends. I feel some could be       detrimental to not only the children but also the parents who       are not eligible for Medicaid services. We live in a state       where jobs are not so plentiful and the ones we have pay much       less than other States.        I hope WVCHIP is saved.    This is a mother reaching out, saying that her son was saved because  of CHIP. She couldn't afford it. She was above the poverty guidelines.  She was working and trying to make it, and someone told her it might be  more advantageous to go on welfare. There is still an awful lot of  pride and dignity in people's lives. They will fight for that dignity,  and we ought to fight to give them assistance during the toughest  times.   I am calling on my colleagues to right this wrong and to reauthorize  CHIP before we leave for Christmas. There are so many deadlines we are  trying to make. I know the speed the tax bill is moving through is  because it is a priority to get done before Christmas. Even though we  don't have a crisis, even though the stock market is doing greater than  ever, even though unemployment is lower than ever, there is a timetable  at warp speed that this is moving through. Yet we have not addressed  what we need most, which is healthcare for our children. I don't know  where the urgency is for tax reform that would trump the urgency and  the need for healthcare for children.   With that, I urge all of my colleagues to please take a look at this,  and let's correct this wrong and not go home for Christmas until all  these children have healthcare.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
