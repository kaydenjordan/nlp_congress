 Madam Speaker, as an original co-lead of this  legislation, I rise today in support of the bill that is near and dear  to my heart, H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act.   As the proud daughter of Jamaican immigrants, I understand the need  for the American Dream and Promise Act, and more importantly, we need a  humane and dignified 21st century immigration system. Comprehensive  immigration reform is what is required.   Let me be very clear, crystal clear: Our immigration system is  broken, and the time has come for the values of our Nation to be  reflected in our immigration policy.   However, this is not just a moral issue. It is an economic one, as  well. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, essential workers are the  lifeblood of our economy. They have risked their lives during a global  pandemic to serve, support, and protect American communities. We have  relied on them during this crisis, and it is time to give them a way  out of the shadows.   Let's pass H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act. Let's see it  through the Senate, and let's get it signed into law.
