 Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for America.   We know this impeachment is a sham. They know this impeachment is a  sham. They know we know this impeachment is a sham, and they know that  most of the American people know that this impeachment is a shameful  sham.   We know that it began the moment the President was elected, long  before he ever had a telephone call with any foreign leaders. We have  heard the numerous quotations from them that validate those very  points, yet they persist in trying to overturn the duly elected  President of the United States of America's election.    Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the articles of  impeachment which have been produced by this flawed process, which was  based on hearsay and testimony largely collected from a closed-door,  one-sided investigation.   In fact, the only witness we heard from who had direct knowledge of  the conversation in question, testified that President Trump did not  want a quid pro quo and confirmed that the aid to Ukraine was released  without the launching of any investigation that the President's  detractors say he was seeking.   The two articles of impeachment in the resolution--abuse of power and  obstruction of Congress--are broad and cite no specific crimes that the  President committed. The House Democrats are basing the entire  impeachment on hearsay testimonies grounded on absolutely no evidence  of a crime.   However, last week we had a look at some real wrongdoing. We found  out from the Justice Department's Inspector General that the  investigation into whether President Trump colluded with the Russians  was based on fraudulent information filed with the secret court. The  FBI was found to have withheld exculpatory evidence and senior FBI  leaders were found to have manipulated facts in order to support this  false collusion narrative, justify their investigation and expand it.  This happened on multiple occasions.   While the Mueller investigation found no collusion, some Members of  Congress, like House Impeachment Leader Adam Schiff, knowingly promoted  this falsehood and used similar tactics to engineer this impeachment  inquiry. This is unacceptable.   For the above reason, I voted to censor Chairman Adam Schiff and will  vote against these articles of impeachment.   We know this impeachment is a sham. They know this impeachment is a  sham. They know that we know it is a sham.   We all know this shameful impeachment began the moment the President  was elected, long before he ever had a single telephone call with any  foreign government. We've heard the numerous quotations by those on the  other side that validate that fact. And, yet the other side persists in  attempting to over-turn the results of the legitimate election of  President Donald J. Trump, because he dares to drain a swamp to which  they are beholden.   When the President calls for an investigation of corruption, the  other side calls it ``digging for dirt.'' When they dig for dirt, they  call it an ``investigation.''   This is a sad day for America. This impeachment is the worst case of  partisan politics in the history of our Republic.
