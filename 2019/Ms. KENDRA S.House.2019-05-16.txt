 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased today to offer an amendment that ensures that  rural areas are included in navigator outreach under H.R. 987, the  Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act.   This amendment ensures that the navigators who help people understand  their options under the Affordable Care Act also help our rural  communities.   The overall bill places federally funded grants in communities across  the country to pay navigators who play a vital role in helping  Americans understand their health coverage options in the marketplace.  It helps them know what they qualify for.   Without question, access to healthcare is one of our Nation's most  critical issues. This is true across the country, whether in major  metropolitan areas, big cities, small towns, on the coasts, or in the  heartland. But specific problems look different from place to place,  and our rural communities are undoubtedly struggling.   One of the worst outcomes in rural communities of lack of access to  healthcare is hospital closures.   Sadly, Oklahoma is no stranger to them. We have already lost six  hospitals since 2010, and many more are teetering on the edge.   Simply put, hospitals can't stay open when their patients don't have  coverage and the hospitals aren't able to pay their bills.   Right now, Oklahoma has the second highest uninsured rate in the  Nation, and our rural areas often bear the brunt of the coverage gap.  They simply don't have enough patients with coverage to offset the ones  without it.   The Washington Post just wrote a story about a 15-bed hospital in my  home State in a town called Fairfax. Fairfax Community Hospital is so  close to closing that their computer software won't operate because the  licensing fees haven't been paid.   Their air-conditioning is also shut down. Imagine that, as it gets  hotter and hotter in the Oklahoma summertime.   I want to share an excerpt of the story because these matters are  about real lives. It is not about numbers. These are about people who  are suffering because they don't have access to care.                                time  1815    It starts with CEO Tina Steele talking to the employees who are  crammed in a crowded office and sweating.   ``So how desperate are we?'' One employee asked. ``How much money do  we have in the bank?''   ``Somewhere around $12,000,'' Steele said.   ``And how long will that last us?''   ``Under normal circumstances?'' Steele asked. She looked down at a  chart on her desk and ran calculations in her head. ``Probably a few  hours. Maybe a day at most.''   The only reason the hospital had been able to stay open at all was  because about 30 employees continued showing up to work without pay.  There was no other hospital within 30 miles of the two-lane roads and  prairie in sprawling Osage County, which meant Fairfax Community was  the only lifeline in that part of the county that increasingly needed  rescuing.   ``If we aren't open, where do these people go?'' asked a physician  assistant, thinking about the dozens of patients he treated each month  in the ER, including some in critical condition after drug overdoses,  falls from horses, oil field disasters, and car crashes.   ``They'll go to the cemetery,'' another employee said. ``If we're not  here, these people don't have time. They'll die along with this  hospital.''   Like I said, there are similar stories in other hospitals that have  played out six times across Oklahoma, and in many other places.  According to some estimates, there are 102 hospitals that have closed  nationwide, and we, as Americans, can't let our neighbors die simply  because they live in small towns. We must solve this rural health  crisis.   Navigators are a part of this solution. This amendment makes sure  that we help people living in small towns across Oklahoma and the  country stay healthy and understand their options so that they can take  care of themselves and their families.   I reserve the balance of my time.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair, adding on to this, the  inclusion of rural communities with navigators serving them is  critical, because from 2016 to 2018, Oklahoma lost 78 percent of its  navigator funding. The very communities that are in the most need,  where people have the least access to services and understanding,  including broadband, so that they can access the services they need,  are the very ones that are suffering most.   These closures and the lack of access not only have an effect in the  communities that directly impact them, but ripple across my State and  this Nation.
