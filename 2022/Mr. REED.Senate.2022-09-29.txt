 Mr. President, literacy opens the door for lifelong  opportunity and economic success. But in the aftermath of the COVID-19  pandemic, we have a lot of work to do to help kids catch up. The  National Assessment of Education Progress results show the terrible  toll the pandemic has taken on students' literacy skills. Reading  scores for 9-year-olds, dropped by five points, the steepest decline  since 1990. We need urgent action to ensure that all children have the  means and the right to read. That is why I am pleased to join  Congressman Raul Grijalva in introducing the Right to Read Act.   The Right to Read Act will require States and school districts to  have policies protecting the right to read, which includes access to  evidence-based reading instruction, access to effective school  libraries, access to developmentally and linguistically appropriate  materials, reading materials at home, family literacy support, and the  freedom to choose reading materials.   The Right to Read Act will ensure that low-income, minority children,  English learners, and students with disabilities are not  disproportionately enrolled in schools that lack effective school  libraries. This is a matter of equity. Data shows that school libraries  make a big difference in giving kids the skills and inspiration to  become proficient and enthusiastic readers. Students who utilize school  libraries have 73 percent higher literacy rates than students who do  not, and the positive impact of effective school libraries is highest  for marginalized groups, including students experiencing poverty,  students of color, and students with disabilities. But not every  student has access to library services. The U.S. Department of  Education reports that 2.5 million students are enrolled in districts  where there are no school libraries. An estimated 1 out of 10 schools  in America does not have a school library, and 30 percent of U.S.  public schools do not have full time librarians. Students experiencing  the highest levels of poverty are 30 percent more likely to attend a  school without a school library. And while school libraries are most  effective when they offer resources that resonate, engage, and empower  students and that align with their first amendment rights, 32 States  have enacted bans on books that disproportionately limit access to  titles with LGBTQ+ characters and characters of color.   The Right to Read Act will address the disparities in access to  school library resources. It supports the development of effective  school libraries, including the recruitment, retention, and  professional development of State-certified school librarians. It will  also increase the Federal investment in literacy by reauthorizing  Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grants at $500 million and the  Innovative Approaches to Literacy program at $100 million, targeting  critical literacy resources in high need communities. Critically, the  bill protects access to quality reading materials and provides the  resources needed to create a foundation for learning and student  success.   In developing this legislation, Congressman Grijalva and I worked  closely with the library community, including the American Library  Association and the American Association of School Librarians. These  are the experts in helping kids become lifelong readers and learners. I  appreciate their insight and assistance on this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation to ensure that  all students have a right to read.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Durbin):   S. 5065. A bill to provide for institutional risk-sharing in the  Federal student loan programs; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, we all recognize that a postsecondary  education is often the key to a family-sustaining, middle-class job. We  also know that an educated workforce is essential to a modern,  productive economy. However, our system that relies on student loan  debt to finance that education is broken. At the end of fiscal year  2021, over 43 million Americans owed more than $1.6 trillion in Federal  student loan debt.   The pandemic has forced a long-overdue reckoning with the cost of  student loan debt to our society. But the warning signs have been clear  for some time. A National Center of Education Statistics Report found  that students who graduated in 2016 still owed 78 percent of the amount  they borrowed. Black graduates owed more than they had originally  borrowed. Thirty-four percent of graduates reported negative net worth.  As student loan debt has  [[Page S5554]]  grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a  family, saving for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have  literally mortgaged their economic future.   In response to the pandemic, Congress and two administrations took  unprecedented steps to ease the burden of student loan debt. While  those steps provided urgently needed relief to current borrowers, we  need to take steps now to reform the student loan system so future  graduates are not saddled with crushing debt. Part of the answer is  requiring institutions of higher education to have a greater stake in  the outcomes for student loan borrowers.   While institutions are largely shielded when student borrowers can't  repay their loans, students who fall into default face catastrophic  consequences with little opportunity for relief. Only in rare instances  can the debt be discharged in bankruptcy, and the Federal Government  has the power to withhold tax refunds, garnish wages, and even garnish  Social Security benefits to collect defaulted student loans.   We have seen the costs to students and taxpayers when institutions  are not held accountable. The Department of Education has forgiven over  $13 billion in student loans for students cheated by their colleges  since 2021 alone. Just recently, Stratford University announced it  would be shutting its doors leaving thousands of students in the lurch.   We cannot wait until an institution is catastrophically failing its  students before taking action. Institutions need greater financial  incentives to act before default rates rise. Simply put, we cannot  tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and institutions  stepping up and taking greater responsibility for college costs and  student borrowing.   That is why I am pleased to reintroduce the Protect Student Borrowers  Act with Senators Warren and Durbin. Our legislation seeks to ensure  that institutions have more ``skin in the game'' when it comes to  student loan debt. The bill will create stronger market incentives for  colleges and universities to provide better and more affordable  education to students, which should in turn help put the brakes on  rising student loan defaults.   The Protect Student Borrowers Act would hold colleges and  universities accountable for high student loan defaults by requiring  them to repay a percentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that  have one-third or more of their students borrow or have a repayment  rate after 3 years below 50 percent would be included in the bill's  risk-sharing requirements based on their cohort default rate. Risk- sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate exceeds five  percent. As the institution's default rate rises, so too will the  institution's risk-share payment.   The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for  institutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens  and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or  eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan  management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for  institutions whose mission is to serve low-income and minority  students, such as community colleges, historically Black institutions,  or Hispanic-serving institutions, if they are making progress in their  student loan management plans.   The risk-sharing payments would be invested in helping struggling  borrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and providing  additional grant aid to students receiving Pell grants at institutions  that enroll a high percentage of Pell grant recipients and have low  default rates.   With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair  that institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program.   We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from  multiple angles. All stakeholders in the system must do their part.  With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the incentives  and resources for institutions to take more responsibility to address  college affordability, reduce student loan debt, and improve student  outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward  to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the  upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, literacy opens the door for lifelong  opportunity and economic success.
