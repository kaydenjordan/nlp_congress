 What happens if we get this wrong is written in Lincoln's  second inaugural, when one party would ``make war rather than let the  Nation survive.''   On September 11, we came together against an enemy without. On  January 6, we were attacked by an enemy from within, the President who  would make war with malice for all and charity for none.   We must come together in unity today against that domestic threat to  our Constitution. The alternative is too unbearable to contemplate.   We must impeach bipartisanly, unanimously if you have the soul.
