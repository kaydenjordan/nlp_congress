 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled roll call vote.    Madam President, I come to the floor to urge action on  the fiscal year 2024 appropriations bills that fund critical programs,  programs that are so important to America and to American families,  programs ranging from biomedical research to our national defense.   On November 1, the Senate passed its first package of three  appropriations bills: the military construction and veterans affairs  legislation, the Agriculture and FDA bill, and the Transportation and  Housing bill. And due to the extraordinary work of the members of the  Appropriations Committee, they passed by overwhelming bipartisan vote  of 82 to 15.   Despite the Appropriations Committee working hard to report all 12 of  the funding bills by the end of July, additional full-year  appropriations bills have not been brought to the Senate floor.  Instead, the Federal Government has been operating under short-term  funding patches known as continuing resolutions since the start of the  fiscal year on October 1. These temporary funding patches lead to  harmful uncertainties, needless inefficiencies, and wasted taxpayer  dollars.   One of the bills that I hope will be brought to the floor soon is the  Department of Defense appropriations bill. This bill would provide  critical resources for our military at a time when we are facing many  complex threats from around the globe, including those posed by an  imperialistic Russia, a hegemonic China, and an increasingly  belligerent Iran and its proxies.   Earlier this summer, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved its  version of the defense funding bill by a strong bipartisan vote of 27  to 1. This bill contains funding for key national security priorities,  including providing our troops and their families with the pay and  benefits that they deserve, expanding our naval fleet, and modernizing  the nuclear triad, strengthening deterrence against China--our pacing  threat--rebuilding our munitions stockpiles, and addressing military  readiness and capability gaps.   Each day that the Department of Defense operates under a temporary  funding measure rather than its full-year appropriations bill,  important national security investments remain on hold. For example,  the Department has identified more than 330 new programs or production  increases that cannot proceed. This includes more than a dozen high- priority initiatives identified by the Air Force, 6 billion in Army  transformation efforts, and multiyear procurement authority for the  Virginia class submarines.   In a letter that was sent to the Appropriations Committee just today,  Chairman C.Q. Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff writes  that ``We cannot outpace our pacing challenge while under continuing  resolution.''   In other words, continuing resolutions give China the upper hand.  [[Page S5651]]    I ask unanimous consent that the text of General Brown's letter be  printed in the Record following my remarks.   Recently, some have called for simply passing a year-long continuing  resolution for fiscal year 2024, essentially locking in last year's  priorities, continuing to fund programs that should not be funded or  should be reduced, and preventing the funding of new programs. I would  like to take just a few moments to describe just how harmful that would  be to our national defense. A year-long continuing resolution would  simply fail to provide the resources needed to protect our Nation. For  fiscal year 2024, it would reduce defense spending by 26.6 billion  relative to the President's budget request and the Fiscal  Responsibility Act and by 34.6 billion compared to the funding levels  approved by the Appropriations Committee by that wide bipartisan vote.   So you can see the big difference that having a year-long CR would  lock in completely inadequate funding levels, given the threats that we  face. Many of the key national security priorities funded in the  Defense bill would suffer under a year-long continuing resolution.   Let me give some specific examples. To respond to military  recruitment challenges, the Senate committee-approved bill would invest  in our men and women in uniform. It includes funding for the 5.2  percent military pay raise. As General Brown points out, a year-long CR  would create a $5.8 billion shortfall in military personnel funding and  exacerbate recruiting and retention challenges.   To offset the cost of the pay raise for the military, DOD would be  forced to slow recruiting--the last thing we want to see happen--delay  servicemembers' moves, and take other detrimental actions.   So this chart compares our committee bill versus a year-long CR. And  as you can see, there are tremendous differences in quality-of-life  issues for our servicemembers and the actual funding for the pay raise  which will go into effect, but the Department would have to take money  out of other personnel accounts.   Other quality-of-life initiatives in the bill, such as expanding  prekindergarten for more than 4,000 children of servicemembers and  improving living conditions for sailors serving aboard ships would not  be able to proceed during a year-long CR. Our committee-passed bill  also invests in the overdue modernization of all three legs of the  nuclear triad. These efforts would be delayed under the yearlong CR  because of a nearly $3.4 billion funding shortfall.    At a time when China's Navy is already at least 80 ships larger than  our own, the committee-approved bill includes record investments--more  than $33 billion--in Navy shipbuilding. It includes funding for two  destroyers and advance procurement for a much needed third.   In recent days, the capabilities of these ships and the  professionalism and expertise of the sailors who serve aboard them have  been on full display as they have downed numerous drones and missiles  headed toward them and aimed also at Israel.   Two of these ships, I am proud to say, the USS Carney and the USS  Thomas Hudner, were built at Bath Iron Works in my State.   Since October 7, Iranian-backed proxies have launched at least 73  attacks on U.S. servicemembers and bases. Our fleet is essential to  protect those servicemembers and bases as well as Israel.   The Senate committee-approved bill also includes funding for two  Virginia-class submarines, two frigates, and a downpayment on an  amphibious ship, which is the Marine Corps' top unfunded priority. In  addition to contributing to cost increases and delays in the delivery  of ships to the Navy, a yearlong CR would result in only one Virginia- class submarine, one frigate, and potentially no funding for the  amphibious ship or the third destroyer.   General Brown points out in his letter that 30 percent of the funding  in the Navy shipbuilding request could not be spent.   The Defense bill also includes more than $65 billion for capabilities  or requirements related to the Indo-Pacific, including $857 million to  meet the highest priorities of the most senior U.S. military commander  in the region and an additional $981 million for other unfunded  requirements listed as priorities by our military services focused on  deterring China.   Our bill would authorize multiyear procurements for seven munitions  critical to the region, such as long-range precision missiles, Patriot  air defense missiles, and anti-ship missiles. Multiyear procurements  provide stability and predictability to our defense industrial base and  save taxpayer dollars. Neither the additional funding nor the authority  to award these contracts would be possible under a yearlong CR.   Our committee-passed bill would ramp up investments in the U.S.  defense industrial base. It would increase munitions procurement  funding by 31 percent compared to the last fiscal year and includes  $1.8 billion to modernize 23 Army depots, arsenals, and ammo plants  across 17 States. Under a yearlong CR, both of those initiatives would  be blocked or delayed.   Our committee-passed bill also includes readiness investments that  would be put at risk under a yearlong CR. Up to 75 Navy ship repair  availabilities would be delayed or canceled, which would degrade the  Navy's ability to deploy its fleet for operations, even as the Navy is  maintaining a greater presence and projecting power in the Middle East  since Hamas's terrorist attack against Israel.   There was just yesterday a news story talking about the Department of  Defense ordering an additional aircraft carrier strike group, air  defenses, fighter jets, and hundreds of troops to the Middle East since  the surprise terrorist attacks on Israel in an effort to prevent that  conflict from spiraling into a regional war. But the problem is that  the military, because it has not received its regular appropriations  bill, is having to scramble to find the funding for this. Because these  Middle East troop movements weren't planned, the Pentagon has had to  pull money from existing operations and maintenance accounts. That  means less money for training exercises and deployments that the  military had already planned for this year.   Our Nation's security and our service men and women deserve better  than a yearlong continuing resolution. In the letter sent today,  General Brown writes that besides passing a supplemental, ``the single  greatest thing that Congress can do to enable the Department to execute  our strategy is to enact a full-year appropriation.''   Let's get our work done and pass the full-year funding bills. I urge  my colleagues to work together. Let's meet the challenges our Nation  faces.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               Chairman of the Joint                                                 Chiefs of Staff,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Chair, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chair: Thank you for the opportunity to share my       view on the impact that a year-long Continuing Resolution       (CR) would have on the Department of Defense (DoD) and the       Joint Force. In addition to the critical need for Congress to       take action to support our allies and partners by passing the       President's national security supplemental funding request,       the single greatest thing that Congress can do to enable the       Department to execute our strategy is to enact a full-year       appropriation.        DoD has never operated under a year-long CR; it would be       historically costly to the Joint Force. In a CR, the DoD's       actual buying power is significantly impacted and degraded.       Failing to fully fund the DoD would disrupt important       progress made in fiscal year 2023. The National Defense       Strategy lays out evolving security challenges, which require       the Joint Force to modernize quickly or risk losing our       strategic advantage. As I have said previously, we cannot       outpace our pacing challenge while under a CR.        A year-long CR would prevent the DoD from executing       numerous multi-year procurement contracts that are critical       to meeting our requirements in the Indo-Pacific; delay or       deny investments in important modernization projects; and       create a significant shortfall in personnel funding.        Thousands of programs will be impacted with the most       devastating impacts to our national defense being to       personnel, nuclear triad modernization, shipbuilding and ship       maintenance, munitions production and replenishment, and U.S.       Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) priorities.        Personnel: A year-long CR would create a $5.8 billion       shortfall in military personnel funding and exacerbate       recruiting and retention challenges. DoD would be forced to       delay service member moves and slow recruiting to offset the       costs of the 5.2 percent pay raise for the military.  [[Page S5652]]         Nuclear triad modernization: A year-long CR would delay       nuclear triad modernization, including a delay in the       procurement of the B-21 Raider and could prevent the award of       the second Columbia class ballistic missile submarine.        Shipbuilding and ship maintenance: Under a year-long CR, 30       percent ($9.7B) of the funding in the Navy shipbuilding       budget request could not be spent and only one of two       requested Virginia class submarines could be awarded.       Additionally, a year-long CR would cancel or delay ship depot       maintenance availabilities, impacting readiness.        Munitions production and replenishment: Under a year-long       CR, DoD could not award multi-year procurement contracts to       increase production capacity or replenish inventories for       munitions critical to INDOPACOM, including long range anti-      ship missiles, GMLRs (precision rockets), Patriot air defense       missiles, the naval strike missile, and a long-range version       of the joint air to surface standoff missile.        Pacific Defense Initiatives: A year-long CR would       jeopardize $1.3 billion in investments critical to DoD's       INDO-PACIFIC posture including impacts to forward basing,       sensor-to-shooter capabilities, long range radars, hypersonic       defense, and investments in classified capabilities.        No new military construction projects: Military       construction projects are, by definition, new starts, so a       year-long CR could cause a year-long delay in construction       projects intended to modernize our installations and improve       quality of life.        Passing a full-year funding bill and the President's       national security supplemental request would prevent these       devastating impacts. It would also provide funding for       critical weapons and equipment for our allies and partners       while replenishing depleted DoD stocks and providing for       robust investments in the defense industrial base.        We owe our servicemembers the tools they need to be       successful. We have asked them to modernize and accelerate       the future capabilities they need to continue to deter and       project credible combat power. We need full appropriations to       stay ahead of pacing, acute, and unforeseen challenges.        I appreciate your continued support for our Joint Force and       look forward to our future engagements.            Sincerely,                                             Charles Q. Brown, Jr.,                                           General, U.S. Air Force.
