 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the motion to refer the resolution to expel George Santos to the House  Ethics Committee.   This is already an ongoing investigation in the Ethics Committee  based on a complaint that I filed in January. This resolution was  already referred to the Ethics Committee on February 9, but as is  customary and as my Republican colleagues know very well, that  investigation is on hold until the Federal criminal investigation and  prosecution is resolved. So despite my colleagues' statements to the  contrary, there will be nothing quick about the Ethics Committee's  process.   This motion today was, therefore, simply a way for Republicans to  continue to cover for Mr. Santos.   Many have called for his removal, especially freshman Republican  Members from New York, but when finally given an opportunity to walk  the talk, they instead sat with Mr. Santos.   Make no mistake about it: A vote in support of this motion today is a  vote in support of Mr. Santos.                            ____________________
