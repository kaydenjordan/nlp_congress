 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  finish my remarks prior to the scheduled vote at 11:30.    Mr. President, at the end of this month, the U.S. Supreme  Court is slated to hear oral arguments in the case of West Virginia v.  EPA, in which the Justices will consider the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The  stakes could not be higher. This case will have lasting impacts in  Maryland, the Nation, and the planet.   As we follow the science and work to mitigate the damaging impacts of  climate change, it is imperative that the Court respect EPA's  authority, which  [[Page S731]]  Congress granted, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to protect  public health and the environment.   I would like to take a moment to consider where we are and how we got  here.   At issue in the case is the question of whether EPA acted outside of  its statutory authority when it promulgated in 2015 the Clean Power  Plan, the CPP, which established guidelines for States to limit carbon  dioxide emissions from powerplants. The Trump administration repealed  the CPP and issued in its place the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which  eliminated or deferred the guidelines. The U.S. Court of Appeals for  the DC Circuit vacated the Affordable Clean Energy rule as arbitrary  and capricious.   One of the challengers, North American Coal Corporation, challenged  how broad the EPA's authority is to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.   Notably, the Clean Power Plan was never implemented. Yet several of  the parties challenging the plan are asking the Supreme Court to issue  a decision far beyond whether the CPP constitutes a reasonable  interpretation of section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The challengers  have put forth interpretations of two legal doctrines--the  nondelegation and major questions doctrines--that could, if adopted,  strip EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases entirely.   The Supreme Court has spoken on the Clean Air Act. In 2007, in  Massachusetts v. EPA, a Supreme Court decision ruled that EPA has the  authority to regulate heat-trapping gases in vehicle emissions. The  majority found that the Agency could not sidestep its authority to  regulate greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change  unless it could prove a scientific basis for its refusal. There is  none.   The same year, in Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy, the Court  ruled unanimously with regards to the EPA's authority to regulate  factories and powerplants that add capacity or make renovations that  increase emissions of air pollutants.   In the current case of West Virginia v. EPA, I joined Chairman  Carper's amicus brief with nearly 200 Members of Congress. The brief  illustrates EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act to protect the  public from harmful pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and  address the climate crisis. It also rejects arguments made by the  petitioners challenging the EPA's authority to address carbon  pollution. It is among a notable number of briefs filed in this case,  many citing my home State of Maryland.   In their brief in support of the respondents, climate scientists  observe that heavy rain and snowstorms across most of the United States  have increased in both intensity and frequency since 2001. The  Northeast region also faces flooding, particularly in the historic  districts of cities like Annapolis, MD--home to the U.S. Naval  Academy--and Newport, RI, as well as portions of Washington, DC, near  the Tidal Basin. For example, human-caused climate change made the  exceptionally heavy precipitation and flooding events that occurred in  2018 in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Washington, DC, up to  2.3 times more likely.   The Washington Post reported that more than 40 percent of Americans  live in counties hit by climate-related disasters in 2021, including  three in Maryland: St. Mary's County and Calvert County in Southern  Maryland and Dorchester County along Maryland's Eastern Shore.  According to FEMA data, each suffered declared disasters spawned by  hurricanes.   Because of the vulnerability in my home State, I took direct action  in 2019. I was proud to lead an effort with over 20 of my colleagues in  a joint resolution providing for the congressional disapproval of the  Trump administration's repeal of the Clean Power Plan.   Maryland is at risk not only to extreme weather events but also to  slow-onset climate impacts that are equally damaging.   The National Parks Conservation Association in its brief remarks on  Maryland's cultural history:         The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical       Park is located in . . . Maryland. The approximate elevation       of the park is a mere three feet above sea level and is       surrounded by the inlets of the Chesapeake Bay. Viewed       another way, 3 feet is half the depth of one-quarter of       the bay.        As water levels continue to rise, this national historic       park may be permanently lost.    The National Park Conservation Association's brief discusses the  obligations Congress conferred on EPA to protect public lands and their  resources.   On February 15, NOAA announced the interagency ``Sea Level Rise  Technical Report,'' which provides the most up-to-date sea level rise  scenarios, available for all U.S. States and territories. The report  projects sea levels along the coastline will rise an additional 10 to  12 inches by 2050, with specific amounts varying regionally, mainly due  to land height changes.   This effort is a product of the interagency Sea Level Rise and  Coastal Flood Hazard and Tool Task Force, comprised of NOAA, NASA, EPA,  USGS, Department of Defense, FEMA, and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, as well as several academic institutions. The report  leverages methods and insights from both the United Nations  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ``Sixth Assessment Report''  and supporting research from the U.S. Department of Defense regional  sea level database. The report tells us that the United States is  expected to experience as much sea level rise by the year 2050 as it  witnessed in the previous 100 years, and it must serve as a wake-up  call.   Maryland's urban and suburban centers, in addition to our rural  communities and coasts, are in danger. The National League of Cities  and the U.S. Conference of Mayors in their brief state that Baltimore,  MD, as well as other major cities, including Washington, DC,  Philadelphia, and Boston, have all experienced significant increases in  exposure to wildfire smoke that prevailing winds carry across the  country.   State and local governments are taking action. In their brief, the  National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors cite that  in 2013, ``Baltimore developed comprehensive responses--touching  infrastructure, building codes, natural coastal barriers, and public  services--to threats from rising seas, heat waves, and storms. [In  central Maryland], Annapolis developed a first-in-the-nation Cultural  Resources Hazard Mitigation Plan in 2018 to mitigate climate impacts on  important cultural and historical landmarks, and the Eastern Shore  Climate Adaptation Partnership has brought together local governments  from across the Eastern Shore to prepare for climate impacts.''   Private companies, too, are among subnational actors that are all-in  on climate. Maryland's McCormick & Company has set a new, more  ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 42 percent by  2030, after achieving its prior target of 20 percent by 2025--4 years  earlier than expected. The spice manufacturer and Fortune 500 company  has also announced a new commitment to achieve net zero emissions by  2050, in line with the enhanced U.S. National Determined Contribution  Secretary Kerry delivered ahead of the COP26 meeting that occurred last  year. But the company cannot mitigate climate change alone. The Federal  Government must support it. The Clean Air Act is an essential tool by  which we do so.   Through the Build Back Better agenda and elsewhere, Congress is  taking an all-of-the-above strategy to combat climate change,  complemented by the Biden administration's whole-of-government  approach.   I am proud that the draft Senate Environment and Public Works  Committee title to fulfill reconciliation instructions includes funding  legislation to make Federal buildings greener. But more is needed. The  legislation also includes funding for water utilities to enhance their  resilience to natural hazards as authorized by the bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   The Supreme Court must tread carefully in curtailing any specific  tool, including the Clean Air Act, and must not intercede where  legislative efforts to curb EPA's authority have failed. Conversely, we  must continue to pursue as many avenues as possible to deal with the  climate crisis.   I yield the floor.
