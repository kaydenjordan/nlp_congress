 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. Mark Covall, who,  after 34 years with the National Association for Behavioral Healthcare,  is retiring.   For the past 24 years, as the president and CEO of the association,  Mark has been a steadfast partner to me and others in Congress in the  fight to improve our Nation's behavioral health system.   Under Marks's leadership, NABH was the leader in the fight to secure  mental health parity, paving the way for the Paul Wellstone and  Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.   More recently, Mark's advocacy was critical in the passage of CARA,  the 21st Century Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act.   Mark's leadership in coalition building as well as his work to  develop strong relationships, both in the field and in Congress,  explain why he has been so effective during his time at NABH.   Today, I join others in the mental health community in thanking Mark  Covall for his decades of leadership, dedication, and passion for  ensuring that millions of Americans have access to quality mental  health and addiction treatment services.   We will certainly miss Mark's contributions and wish him well in his  next phase of life.                            ____________________
