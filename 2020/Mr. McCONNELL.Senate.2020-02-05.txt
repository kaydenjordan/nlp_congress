 Mr. President, the U.S. Senate was made for moments  like this. The Framers predicted that factional fever might dominate  House majorities from time to time. They knew the country would need a  firewall  [[Page S910]]  to keep partisan flames from scorching our Republic. So they created  the Senate--out of ``necessity,'' James Madison wrote, ``of some stable  institution in the government.''   Today, we will fulfill this founding purpose. We will reject this  incoherent case that comes nowhere near--nowhere near--justifying the  first Presidential removal in history. This partisan impeachment will  end today, but I fear the threat to our institutions may not because  this episode is one symptom of something much deeper.   In the last 3 years, the opposition to this President has come to  revolve around a truly dangerous concept. Leaders in the opposite party  increasingly argue that, if our institutions don't produce the outcomes  they like, our institutions themselves must be broken. One side has  decided that defeat simply means the whole system is broken, that we  must literally tear up the rules and write new ones.   Normally, when a party loses an election, it accepts defeat. It  reflects and retools--but not this time.   Within months, Secretary Clinton was suggesting her defeat was  invalid. She called our President ``illegitimate.'' A former President  falsely claimed: ``[President] Trump didn't actually win.'' ``He lost  the election,'' a former President said. Members of Congress have used  similar rhetoric--a disinformation campaign, weakening confidence in  our democracy.   The very real issue of foreign election interference was abused to  fuel conspiracy theories. For years, prominent voices said there had  been a secret conspiracy between the President's campaign and a foreign  government, but when the Mueller investigation and the Senate  Intelligence Committee debunked that, the delegitimizing endeavor  didn't stop. It didn't stop.   Remember what Chairman Schiff said here on the floor? He suggested  that if the American people reelect President Trump in November that  the election will be presumptively invalid as well. That was Chairman  Schiff, on this floor, saying, if the American people reelect President  Trump this November, the election will be presumptively invalid as  well.   So they still don't accept the American voters' last decision, and  now they are preparing to reject the voters' next decision if they  don't like the outcome--not only the last decision but the next  decision. Heads, we win. Tails, you cheated. And who can trust our  democracy anyway, they say?   This kind of talk creates more fear and division than our foreign  adversaries could achieve in their wildest dreams. As Dr. Hill  testified, our adversaries seek to ``divide us against each other,  degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people  in our democracy.'' As she noted, if Americans become ``consumed by  partisan rancor,'' we can easily do that work for them.   The architects of this impeachment claimed they were defending norms  and traditions. In reality, it was an assault on both.   First, the House attacked its own precedents on fairness and due  process and by rushing to use the impeachment power as a political  weapon of first resort. Then their articles attacked the Office of the  Presidency. Then they attacked the Senate and called us  ``treacherous.'' Then the far left tried to impugn the Chief Justice  for remaining neutral during the trial.   Now, for the final act, the Speaker of the House is trying to steal  the Senate's sole power to render a verdict. The Speaker says she will  just refuse to accept this acquittal. The Speaker of the House of  Representatives says she refuses to accept this acquittal--whatever  that means. Perhaps she will tear up the verdict like she tore up the  State of the Union Address.   So I would ask my distinguished colleagues across the aisle: Is this  really--really--where you want to go? The President isn't the  President? An acquittal isn't an acquittal? Attack institutions until  they get their way? Even my colleagues who may not agree with this  President must see the insanity of this logic. It is like saying you  are so worried about a bull in a china shop that you want to bulldoze  the china shop to chase it out.   Here is the most troubling part. There is no sign this attack on our  institutions will end here. In recent months, Democratic Presidential  candidates and Senate leaders have toyed with killing the filibuster so  that the Senate could approve radical changes with less deliberation  and less persuasion.   Several of our colleagues sent an extraordinary brief to the Supreme  Court, threatening political retribution if the Justices did not decide  a case the way they wanted.   We have seen proposals to turn the FEC--the regulator of elections  and political speech--into a partisan body for the first time ever.   All of these things signal a toxic temptation to stop debating policy  within our great American governing traditions and, instead, declare  war on the traditions themselves--a war on the traditions themselves.   So, colleagues, with whatever policy differences we may have, we  should all agree this is precisely the kind of recklessness the Senate  was created to stop. The response to losing one election cannot be to  attack the Office of the Presidency. The response to losing several  elections cannot be to threaten the electoral college. The response to  losing a court case cannot be to threaten the judiciary. The response  to losing a vote cannot be to threaten the Senate.   We simply cannot let factional fever break our institutions. It must  work the other way, as Madison and Hamilton intended. The institutions  must break the fever rather than the other way around.   The Framers built the Senate to keep temporary rage from doing  permanent damage to our Republic.   The Framers built the Senate to keep temporary rage from doing  permanent damage to our Republic. That is what we will do when we end  this precedent-breaking impeachment.   I hope we will look back on this vote and say this was the day the  fever began to break.   I hope we will not say this was just the beginning.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.    Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate is now ready to vote on  the Articles of Impeachment, and after that is done, we will adjourn  the Court of Impeachment.                                  Article I    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will now read the first Article of  Impeachment.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:                          article i: abuse of power          The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives       ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and that the       President ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for,       and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors''. In his conduct of the office of President of       the United States--and in violation of his constitutional       oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the       United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve,       protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,       and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that       the laws be faithfully executed--Donald J. Trump has abused       the powers of the Presidency, in that:        Using the powers of his high office, President Trump       solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine,       in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so       through a scheme or course of conduct that included       soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce       investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the       election prospects of a political opponent, and influence the       2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage.       President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of       Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United       States Government  [[Page S937]]       acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public       announcement of the investigations. President Trump engaged       in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in       pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President       Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that       compromised the national security of the United States and       undermined the integrity of the United States democratic       process. He thus ignored and injured the interests of the       Nation.        President Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct       through the following means:        (1) President Trump--acting both directly and through his       agents within and outside the United States Government--      corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly       announce investigations into--        (A) a political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R.       Biden, Jr.; and        (B) a discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that       Ukraine--rather than Russia--interfered in the 2016 United       States Presidential election.        (2) With the same corrupt motives, President Trump--acting       both directly and through his agents within and outside the       United States Government--conditioned two official acts on       the public announcements that he had requested--        (A) the release of $391 million of United States taxpayer       funds that Congress had appropriated on a bipartisan basis       for the purpose of providing vital military and security       assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and which       President Trump had ordered suspended; and        (B) a head of state meeting at the White House, which the       President of Ukraine sought to demonstrate continued United       States support for the Government of Ukraine in the face of       Russian aggression.        (3) Faced with the public revelation of his actions,       President Trump ultimately released the military and security       assistance to the Government of Ukraine, but has persisted in       openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to       undertake investigations for his personal political benefit.        These actions were consistent with President Trump's       previous invitations of foreign interference in United States       elections.        In all of this, President Trump abused the powers of the       Presidency by ignoring and injuring national security and       other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal       political benefit. He has also betrayed the Nation by abusing       his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting       democratic elections.        Wherefore President Trump, by such conduct, has       demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national       security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,       and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-      governance and the rule of law. President Trump thus warrants       impeachment and trial, removal from office, and       disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor,       trust, or profit under the United States.                              Vote on Article I    The CHIEF JUSTICE. Each Senator, when his or her name is called, will  stand at his or her place and vote guilty or not guilty, as required by  rule XXIII of the Senate Rules on Impeachment.   Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the Constitution regarding the vote  required for conviction on impeachment provides that no person shall be  convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.   The question is on the first Article of Impeachment. Senators, how  say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, guilty or not guilty?   A rollcall vote is required.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--guilty 48, not guilty 52, as follows:                           [Rollcall Vote No. 33]                                 GUILTY--48       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Peters      Reed      Romney      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT GUILTY--52       Alexander      Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Loeffler      McConnell      McSally      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young   The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this Article of Impeachment, 48 Senators have  pronounced Donald John Trump, President of the United States, guilty as  charged; 52 Senators have pronounced him not guilty as charged.   Two-thirds of the Senators present not having pronounced him guilty,  the Senate adjudges that the Respondent, Donald John Trump, President  of the United States, is not guilty as charged on the first Article of  Impeachment.                                  Article II    The clerk will read the second Article of Impeachment.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                     article ii: obstruction of congress          The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives       ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and that the       President ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for,       and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors''. In his conduct of the office of President of       the United States--and in violation of his constitutional       oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the       United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve,       protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,       and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that       the laws be faithfully executed--Donald J. Trump has directed       the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance       of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant       to its ``sole Power of Impeachment''. President Trump has       abused the powers of the Presidency in a manner offensive to,       and subversive of, the Constitution, in that:        The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment       inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of       the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United       States Presidential election. As part of this impeachment       inquiry, the Committees undertaking the investigation served       subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the       inquiry from various Executive Branch agencies and offices,       and current and former officials.        In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President       Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and       officials not to comply with those subpoenas. President Trump       thus interposed the powers of the Presidency against the       lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, and assumed       to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise       of the ``sole Power of Impeachment'' vested by the       Constitution in the House of Representatives.        President Trump abused the powers of his high office       through the following means:        (1) Directing the White House to defy a lawful subpoena by       withholding the production of documents sought therein by the       Committees.        (2) Directing other Executive Branch agencies and offices       to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of       documents and records from the Committees--in response to       which the Department of State, Office of Management and       Budget, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense       refused to produce a single document or record.        (3) Directing current and former Executive Branch officials       not to cooperate with the Committees--in response to which       nine Administration officials defied subpoenas for testimony,       namely John Michael ``Mick'' Mulvaney, Robert B. Blair, John       A. Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Griffith, Russell       T. Vought, Michael Duffey, Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich       Brechbuhl.        These actions were consistent with President Trump's       previous efforts to undermine United States Government       investigations into foreign interference in United States       elections.        Through these actions, President Trump sought to arrogate       to himself the right to determine the propriety, scope, and       nature of an impeachment inquiry into his own conduct, as       well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and all       information to the House of Representatives in the exercise       of its ``sole Power of Impeachment''. In the history of the       Republic, no President has ever ordered the complete defiance       of an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct and impede so       comprehensively the ability of the House of Representatives       to investigate ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''. This abuse       of office served to cover up the President's own repeated       misconduct and to seize and control the power of       impeachment--and thus to nullify a vital constitutional       safeguard vested solely in the House of Representatives.        In all of this, President Trump has acted in a manner       contrary to his trust as President and subversive of       constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the       cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the       people of the United States.        Wherefore, President Trump, by such conduct, has       demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the Constitution       if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner       grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of       law. President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial,       removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy       any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United       States.                              Vote on Article II    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is on the second Article of  Impeachment.  [[Page S938]]  Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, guilty or  not guilty?   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--guilty 47, not guilty 53, as follows:                           [Rollcall Vote No. 34]                                 GUILTY--47       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT GUILTY--53       Alexander      Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Loeffler      McConnell      McSally      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young   The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this Article of Impeachment, 47 Senators have  pronounced Donald John Trump, President of the United States, guilty as  charged; 53 Senators have pronounced him not guilty as charged; two- thirds of the Senators present not having pronounced him guilty, the  Senate adjudges that respondent, Donald John Trump, President of the  United States, is not guilty as charged in the second Article of  Impeachment.   The Presiding Officer directs judgment to be entered in accordance  with the judgment of the Senate as follows:         The Senate, having tried Donald John Trump, President of       the United States, upon two articles of impeachment exhibited       against him by the House of Representatives, and two-thirds       of the Senators present not having found him guilty of the       charges contained therein, it is, therefore, ordered and       adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is       hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles.    The Chair recognizes the majority leader.         Communication To The Secretary Of State And To The House Of                              Representatives     Mr. Chief Justice, I send an order to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will report the order.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Ordered, that the Secretary be directed to communicate to       the Secretary of State, as provided by Rule XXII of the Rules       of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when sitting on       impeachment trials, and also to the House of Representatives,       the judgment of the Senate in the case of Donald John Trump,       and transmit a certified copy of the judgment to each.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, the order will be entered.   The majority leader is recognized.      Expression Of Gratitude To The Chief Justice Of The United States     Mr. Chief Justice, before this process fully  concludes, I want to very quickly acknowledge a few of the people who  helped the Senate fulfill our duty these past weeks.   First and foremost, I know my colleagues join me in thanking Chief  Justice Roberts for presiding over the Senate trial with a clear head,  steady hand, and the forbearance that this rare occasion demands.   (Applause.)   We know full well that his presence as our Presiding Officer came in  addition to, not instead of, his day job across the street, so the  Senate thanks the Chief Justice and his staff who helped him perform  this unique role.   Like his predecessor, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Senate will be  awarding Chief Justice Roberts the golden gavel to commemorate his time  presiding over this body. We typically award this to new Senators after  about 100 hours in the chair, but I think we can agree that the Chief  Justice has put in his due and then some.   The page is delivering the gavel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you very much.    Of course, there are countless Senate professionals  whose efforts were essential, and I will have more thorough facts to  offer next week to all of those teams, from the Secretary of the  Senate's office, to the Parliamentarian, to the Sergeant at Arms team,  and beyond.   But there are two more groups I would like to single out now. First,  the two different classes of Senate pages who participated in this  trial, their footwork and cool under pressure literally kept the floor  running. Our current class came on board right in the middle of the  third Presidential impeachment trial in American history and quickly  found themselves hand-delivering 180 question cards from Senators'  desks to the dais.   No pressure, right, guys?   So thank you all very much for your good work.   (Applause.)   Second, the fine men and women of the Capitol Police, we know that  the safety of our democracy literally rests in their hands every single  day, but the heightened measures surrounding the trial meant even more  hours and even more work and even more vigilance.   Thank you all very much for your service to this body and to the  country.   (Applause.)   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Democratic leader.    Mr. Chief Justice, I move that the Senate, sitting as  a Court of Impeachment on the Articles against Donald John Trump  adjourn sine die.   The motion was agreed to, and at 4:41 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned sine die.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 562.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 563.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 565.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 461.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to move to  legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  for the consideration of Calendar No. 535.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls for these cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session and be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony, documents, and  representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for evidence in a  criminal action pending in California Federal district court. In this  action, the defendant is charged with making threatening telephone  calls last year to the Washington, D.C. offices of Senator Sherrod  Brown and Senator Shelley Moore Capito. Trial is scheduled to commence  on February 11, 2020.   The prosecution is seeking testimony at trial from three Senate  witnesses who received the telephone calls at issue: current employees  of Senator Brown's and Senator Capito's offices and a former employee  of Senator Brown's office. Senators Brown and Capito would like to  cooperate with this request by providing relevant employee testimony  and, if necessary, documents from their offices.
