 Madam Speaker, I rise today urging the administration  to delay a harmful rule that would be catastrophic to rural hospitals  and healthcare providers in the 25th District of Texas.   The coronavirus pandemic has presented challenges unseen before in  American history. While all businesses have been forced to operate in a  new environment, healthcare providers have overcome tremendous hurdles  to meet the needs of their patients, despite historical financial  losses.   Implementation of the Medicaid Fiscal Accountability Rule, or MFAR,  would lead to devastating hospital closures in Texas and restrict  access to crucial health services.   The financial impact alone would cost our State nearly $11 billion  and cause local governments to increase taxes, resulting in less care  and more red tape.   That is why I am leading the fight on behalf of all Texans. I am  proud to introduce the bipartisan MFAR Transparency Act to analyze the  impact of the rule before blindly moving forward so that our health  systems can continue to serve patients during the most dynamic health  crisis of our generation.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, for  joining me in this effort.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
