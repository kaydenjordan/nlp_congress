 Mr. Speaker, one year ago tomorrow, the Supreme Court  overturned a half century of precedent by ending the nationwide  guarantee that women be allowed to make choices over their bodies.   Since then, we have seen the devastating result: Numerous States  enacting bans that deny a woman's ability to make decisions over her  body, oftentimes without any exception.   In the face of this new wave of attacks on reproductive freedom, I  have fought with many of my colleagues to preserve access to abortions  and to restore a nationwide right to abortion access.   House Democrats produced and passed legislation to ensure women can  travel safely and freely to States in which abortion is still legal,  have access to contraception, and cover abortions regardless of income  or health status.   We will not stop there.   We will continue to push for legislation that will once again allow  women everywhere in America to be in charge of their own health  decisions.                            ____________________
