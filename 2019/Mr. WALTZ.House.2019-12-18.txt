 Madam Speaker, I am a Green Beret and a proud veteran, but  this process does not make me proud. I fought all over the world, from  Africa to Afghanistan, and I have seen fair and more transparent  processes than this.   Since the Democrats lost the election in 2016, they have been focused  on impeaching this President. Meanwhile, we have not solved the  problems America entrusted us to solve: immigration, healthcare, and  infrastructure.   Nothing in President Trump's call rises to the level of high crimes  and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment. For that reason, I will be  voting against impeachment today.
