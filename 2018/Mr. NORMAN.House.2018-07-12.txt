 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring your attention to yet  another success story from tax reform.   A constituent of mine who is the founder and owner of All Pro  Solutions, a small business in South Carolina, has benefited greatly  from tax reform.   Tibi contacted my office with his recent success story, and he cannot  downplay the positive impact he has seen.   All Pro Solutions is a digital archiving company of 10 employees, so  they are in no way a big corporation. As a result of tax reform being  signed into law, All Pro Solutions has been able to buy extra and newer  equipment. They have already seen an increase in sales. They are now  expanding their archiving work, and they will soon be hiring two more  employees due to these wonderful circumstances.   His story proves that these tax cuts were for everyone. They are  working on a local level, and these tax cuts are beneficial to all and  working on a national level.                            ____________________
