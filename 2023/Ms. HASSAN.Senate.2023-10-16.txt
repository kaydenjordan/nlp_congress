 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Barbara  Hays of Bow as September's Granite Stater of the Month. Barbara leads a  group of women at her senior living center who make fidget and lap  quilts to donate to local hospital patients and veterans.   When Barbara retired after decades of working at a telephone and  communications company, she found herself with a desire to make a  positive difference in her community during her new free time. With a  friend, she began sewing small lap quilts and donating them to Concord  Hospital. During one dropoff, the nurses at the hospital asked if she  had ever considered making fidget quilts. These quilts have zippers,  elastics, and different fabric textures sewed on to provide sensory  stimulation for patients with Alzheimer's and other health challenges.   Barbara wasn't familiar with this type of quilt, but she was eager to  try a new way to help people. She watched videos on YouTube to learn  how to make them, and earlier this year, she helped start a workshop  for the women at her senior living center in Bow to start making them  together. They began to meet twice a month in the community room, each  putting together different parts of the quilts.   This past June, Barbara put together a Fidget Quilt Showcase at her  White Rock Senior Living Community in order to showcase 40 quilts that  the ``Happy Quilters of White Rock'' had made. In addition, she invited  some nurses to join to explain how these quilts can help keep patients'  minds busy and prevent them from picking at an IV, for example.  Afterward, the group donated a total of 70 fidget quilts to the  Visiting Nurse Association, Concord Hospital, the Tilton Veterans Home,  and the Manchester VA Medical Center.   Barbara's initiative is emblematic of the Granite State spirit of  generosity in many ways. Not only do the fidget blankets make a  tremendous difference in the lives of patients with Alzheimer's or  dementia, but her quilting group also brings people together at her  senior living center. Barbara made sure that even those who had no  experience quilting could participate, creating a sense of belonging  for everyone. I commend Barbara for making a positive difference in her  community, and I am sending the ``Happy Quilters of White Rock'' my  well wishes as they start another round of quilt-making this  year.                            ____________________
