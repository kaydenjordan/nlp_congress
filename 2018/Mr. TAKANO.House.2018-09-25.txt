 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3479, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018.   S. 3479 makes sure that some of the vital programs we have in place  to take care of our veterans continue past the end of the fiscal year  and continue to help our veterans. Included in this bill are provisions  related to healthcare, benefits, homeless veterans, and other related  issues.   I am pleased to support extending programs related to support  services for caregivers, childcare for certain veterans receiving  healthcare, and a pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for  women veterans newly separated from service.   It also has provisions to extend the authority related to  rehabilitation and vocational benefits to members of the Armed Forces  with severe injuries or illnesses, homeless veterans reintegration  programs, homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children,  and providing housing assistance and counseling to homeless and at-risk  veterans.   Also included are several extensions of authority for programs to  help our disabled veterans, as well as the authority to enter into  agreements with the National Academy of Sciences to review the research  on links between diseases and dioxin exposure, a critical step in  creating new Agent Orange presumptions. These provisions are crucial in  helping our aging Vietnam-era veteran population.   The package also contains several technical corrections to the  MISSION Act that we passed earlier this year.                                time  1500    These corrections will help VA implement the law correctly, and all  sides agree that they must become law quickly.   In short, this is a bill that both the majority and the minority  support, and we all agree that it must be signed into law as soon as  possible. I urge all my fellow Members to support its passage. I thank  the chairman and his staff for working with the minority on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, likewise, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  friendship and for the work that we have done together in a bipartisan  fashion on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I am also proud of the  bipartisan work that we have accomplished together on behalf of our  veterans. I say God bless our veterans as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing S. 3479, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
