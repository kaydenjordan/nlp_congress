 Madam Chair, I would like to thank Mr. Smith and Mr.  Khanna for their leadership on this amendment and just express my  disappointment at the statements made by my friend, Mr. McCaul.   I never imagined that an amendment that essentially restated  congressional authority as detailed in the Constitution would ever get  characterized as a propaganda win for Iran, as a pro-Iran thing; and I  would remind my friend, Mr. McCaul, that, yes, the President stepped  away from a military conflict that might have been justified as an act  of self-defense.   I am not in the practice of praising the President on this floor, but  he took a prudent course a few weeks ago. There is absolutely no  guarantee he will do so again.   This amendment does one simple thing. It is not unprecedented. Its  precedent is the United States Constitution, which vests war-making  authority when it is not in self-defense, as Mr. Smith points out,  exclusively in the Congress. Now, we may or may not like that idea, but  it is the principle that we swore to uphold.   And I would just remind the Chamber that, every time we allow a  Democratic or a Republican President to go to war without an  authorization in this Chamber, we shirk our constitutional duty. We  fail to back our warfighters with the full and robust voice of the  United States Government.
