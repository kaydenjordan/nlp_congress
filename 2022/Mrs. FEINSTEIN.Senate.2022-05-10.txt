 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Space National Guard Establishment Act of 2021, which Senator Rubio and  I introduced today. I thank Senator Rubio along with our 10 bipartisan  cosponsors for joining me on this important bill.   When the Space Force was established in 2019, Active-Duty space units  were moved out of the Air Force and into the new Space Force, but  National Guard space units were left behind in the Air National Guard  under the Air Force.   Active-Duty and Guard units performing space missions are supposed to  work together seamlessly, but they cannot do so if we leave them in  separate services. Today, we have 16 Air National Guard units with  1,000 members performing space missions in a different service than  their Active-Duty counterparts.   This misalignment creates a number of problems. It inhibits the  efficient and consistent provision of funding, equipment, talent,  education, and training to our space units.   This disconnect makes mobilization more complicated and separates  them with different service processes and cultures. This is not how to  construct a cohesive force, and if Congress is going to create a Space  Force, then Congress should complete the job.   The current misalignment is unsustainable. If it is not repaired,  then National Guard units performing the space mission will wither on  the vine. Those Air National Guard units will eventually be forced to  give up the space mission and undertake a costly transition to another  mission, or those units will be dissolved.   This bill would shift our National Guard units performing space  missions from the Air National Guard, which is part of the Air Force,  to a Space National Guard, which would fall under the Space Force. This  bill does not authorize new construction, bases, or personnel. It is a  realignment, not an expansion. Future growth will be determined by  mission needs as determined by the Pentagon, the administration, and  Congress.   This bill, which already has a companion in the House, is the best  way to preserve the talent and resources found in the National Guard's  space enterprise. We have invested a great deal in the training and  experience held by the Guard's space professionals. Many of them hold  civilian jobs with leading-edge companies in relevant industries, and  they put their experience to work for the Nation and their States every  time they put on their uniform. We must not leave a bureaucratic wall  between the Space Force and the National Guard that will degrade our  space capabilities.   Just as important, the loss of these units would rob our Governors of  critical National Guard personnel and resources they need to respond to  disasters at home.   In sum, this bill will fix a major disconnect in our Nation's space  enterprise by putting our National Guard space units in the same  service as their Active-Duty counterparts. This is important for our  Nation and for those that rely on the National Guard in our States.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Space National Guard Establishment Act of 2021, which Senator Rubio and  I introduced today.
