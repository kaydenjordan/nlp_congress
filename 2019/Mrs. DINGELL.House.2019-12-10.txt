 Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 729, the Coastal  and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act. This strong, bipartisan  package is a combination of months of work in the Natural Resources  Committee. It includes many key priorities for the Great Lakes region,  including Representative Quigley's Great Lakes Fishery Research  Authorization Act.   This bipartisan legislation will strengthen our understanding of  Great Lakes fisheries and provide additional resources for research  into the Great Lakes Basin's fisheries and biology.   Cutting-edge technologies authorized by the Great Lakes Fishery  Research Reauthorization Act will enable scientists to deliver near- real-time data on quickly emerging crises, such as potential fisheries  crashes or new and very unwelcome invasive species like the Asian carp.   Additionally, the package includes key sportsmen's priorities like  the National Fish Habitat Conservation Through Partnerships Act, which  builds off State- and locally led joint ventures to better conserve  wildlife and fish habitats.   As one of the co-chairs of the Great Lakes Task Force here in  Congress, I urge all of my colleagues to support these important  provisions and vote in favor of the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities  Enhancement Act.
