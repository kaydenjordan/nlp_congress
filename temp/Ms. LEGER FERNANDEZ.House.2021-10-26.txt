 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand in support  of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act. I want  to start by, of course, thanking Congresswoman McBath for her work to  reauthorize this bill and wisely using this moment to strengthen  protections for our communities with bipartisan support.   Domestic violence, unfortunately, impacts every community in the  United States. It impacts every community in New Mexico. In fact, over  540,000 New Mexicans experience intimate partner violence in their  lifetimes. It is so sad that children witness  [[Page H5879]]  this violence in too many cases and are, themselves, victims.   Our Native American and Latino communities are the most impacted.  While Native people, especially Native women, have the highest need for  medical and legal services, the current law does not provide them with  equitable funding or resources.   This bill takes the steps to fix these inequities. It authorizes a  Tribal domestic violence hotline, discretionary resource centers on  Alaska Native populations, and direct funding for Tribal coalitions.   These changes will provide much-needed help to our communities so  that we may properly respond to their needs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                           Build Back Better Agenda     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Build Back Better agenda. I would note that it is a women's agenda,  Build Back Better. It is because we will be investing in those things  that all women need to succeed in life because we began with our  children.   The Build Back Better bill would expand and continue the child tax  credit, which began under the American Rescue Plan. We cannot tell  those families who finally received the child tax credit that the clock  has struck midnight and they can no longer receive it. We must continue  this tax credit so that all children in all families receive that  benefit.   The Build Back Better agenda also makes sure that we provide pre-K so  that there is universal pre-K. We know the biggest benefit we can  provide our children is ensuring that everybody has quality pre-K  education. When doing so, we must ensure that we pay the teachers of  our children what they deserve and give them the respect they need.   In that sense, we will also be investing in our workforce development  so that we can have the qualified workers who will be able to care for  our children, who will be able to teach our children. The workforce  development and workforce innovation investments in this bill are very  needed.   I come from a State where we will need to transition away from oil  and gas. In order to ensure a just transition for energy communities,  we must ensure that there are new jobs for those workers.   Build Back Better will allow the creation of new jobs, both for  plugging abandoned wells and for addressing the legacy pollution that  we have seen that needs to be cleaned up.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the Build Back  Better agenda. It is good for our families. It is good for our women.  It is good for our planet.                            ____________________
