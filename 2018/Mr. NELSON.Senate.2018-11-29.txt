 Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, this  Senator has had too many opportunities to give the same kind of speech  in remembrance of fallen Floridians just like her constituent who gave  the ultimate sacrifice in protection of his country, and I thank the  Senator from Nebraska.    Mr. President, 30 years ago, a gentleman by the name of  Dr. James Hansen was the Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for  Space  [[Page S7218]]  Studies. He testified to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee that he was 99 percent certain that the year's record  temperatures were not the result of natural variation. That was 30  years ago. It was the first time a lead scientist drew a connection  between human activities, the growing concentration of atmosphere  pollutants, and a warming climate.   This Senator was a young congressman at the time representing East  Central Florida and Florida's Space Coast. Just 2 years prior, I had  flown for 6 days on the 24th mission of the space shuttle. In this  case, our orbiter was the Space Shuttle Columbia.   Growing up on the Indian River on Florida's Atlantic coast, it is  easy to think that nature's bounty is endless, that the sand beaches,  the crystal clear water, the blue sky, and the warm Sun will continue  forever. It would be like Camelot. But peering out the window back at  the planet from the window of a spacecraft, when I looked, all of the  Earth suddenly took on a new meaning. I realized how thin the line was  between our protected shared home--the planet--and uninhabitable space.   When Dr. Hansen testified about the greenhouse effect and how that  thin layer of atmosphere was becoming polluted, it got my attention  because I remembered looking at the rim of the Earth and seeing that  thin film as we orbited the Earth every 90 minutes. Since his 1988  warning, the evidence has unfortunately confirmed Dr. Hansen's 1988  prediction.   Extreme events in 2017 and 2018 alone included back-to-back, record  Atlantic and gulf hurricanes and unprecedented and devastating  wildfires. Global temperatures are rising, and so are the seas. Why?  The extra heat is absorbed by the oceans, which cover two-thirds of the  Earth. That extra heat, when absorbed in water, causes water to expand.  Also, 2016 and 2017 had two of the highest global temperatures ever  recorded since we began measuring in 1880, and 2018 is on track to be  the fourth hottest year on record.   Warmer air and water make the environment more hospitable to toxic  algae blooms, mosquitos that carry deadly diseases, and things like  poison ivy. These are three things that I think we can all agree that  we need less of, not more.   The oceans are warming, and they are fueling the intensification of  hurricanes--as we saw recently with Irma and Michael--and that warming  water is creating the conditions that bleach coral reefs and feed toxic  algae blooms.   My beautiful home State of Florida, which I have had the great  privilege of serving, is ground zero for these impacts. According to  the fourth National Climate Assessment report released by the  administration just last week--the day after Thanksgiving--climate  change is expected to make South Florida more vulnerable to diseases  like the Zika virus. Florida could see more than $346 billion in lost  property value over the course of this century. But this stretches  beyond property values. A Florida Department of Health assessment  determined that almost 600,000 people in South Florida are going to  face extreme or high risk from sea level rise. Warming water, nutrient  enrichment, overfishing, and coastal development are all contributing  to the dire situation of one of our Nation's crown jewels--the coral  reefs of the Florida Keys.   The real question is, What are we going to do about it? I think there  are three things we ought to consider.   First, we truly cannot afford to politicize the air we breathe. The  science is not up for debate. The greenhouse gas emissions are heating  the atmosphere, which in turn heat our oceans, supercharging the  hurricanes, leaving us vulnerable to drought and threatening the water  we drink and the food we eat. Reports of political censorship or  political interference with science--that is unacceptable and foolish.  If we ignore the science, we do so at our peril.   Second, I think we are going to have to stop putting so many  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere so fast. This is called climate  mitigation. It means that we must invest in new technology, in the  economy of the future, things like wind and solar, electric vehicles,  and more efficient buildings. Each one of them would have a huge impact  in lessening the amount of derivatives of carbon that we put into the  atmosphere.   Third, I think we should consider that we are going to have to make  our communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change-- climate change that is already upon us and climate change that, in the  future, we are not going to be able to avoid. You can't just cut off  the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere and the warming that  results therefrom that is already in the system.   You talk to the scientists. There is something just beyond about 4  degrees Fahrenheit more than the average annual global temperature-- that if it rises beyond that, there is no return.   We have a chance, but time is of the essence. We ought to consider  climate change adaptation. You don't have to agree with climate science  to know that it makes sense to do that.   I want to urge our colleagues on both sides of this aisle that  separates Republicans from Democrats. You need to take this seriously.  For the sake of your States and mine, for the good of our planet, for  the good of our children, for the good of future generations, take  climate change seriously. Listen to the experts, and come together to  work on solutions. Instead of saying ``I am not a scientist,'' listen  to the scientists. Don't try to censor their warnings or hide from the  truth. Instead of saying that making changes could cost money, think  about the cost to our economy and our society if we don't act.   Coastal communities inundated with catastrophic flooding, midwestern  droughts that raise food prices, and soaring health costs--these are  some of the costs that are coming to our country--indeed, to our  society--indeed, to the civilization of planet Earth. We must act, and  we must do it now.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to talk about trickle-down  economics and give my colleagues an example of why it doesn't work,  particularly in parts of the country that have long been neglected by  the power structures in those communities.   Let's take, for example, South St. Petersburg, FL. St. Petersburg is  a part of Pinellas County. It is one of our major cities in Florida. It  is at the tip of a peninsula that wraps around Tampa Bay. South St.  Pete is riddled with poverty. According to the Census Bureau, 16.4  percent of the people who live there live below the Federal poverty  line, 6.7 percent of which have jobs, but they still live in poverty.  Now, there is something wrong with that. If you have a job, you  shouldn't be living in poverty.   What we know, as a result of a survey by the United Way, is that 44  percent of people in Florida, according to this survey taken in 2016-- 44 percent of the people in Florida, almost half--do not earn enough  money to make ends meet. That means they don't have enough money for  food, for housing, for healthcare, for transportation, and for child  care--essentials for someone who is working to be able to have enough  to live day to day. So there is something wrong with this.   We find people living in pockets of poverty all across this country,  but I want to give an example of it in South St. Petersburg, FL. Many  people there don't make enough to make ends meet and, of course, that  means that you have to have both spouses working. Forty-four percent of  the people do not have an economic situation that enables them to make  ends meet. So what do they do to compensate? They work two, three jobs  in order to compensate.   So in South St. Petersburg there are a lot of people who don't even  have a job. It is not because they don't want jobs. It is because a lot  of the established financial power--including banks, corporations, and  big investors--in areas that are depressed like this one see it as a  lost cause. They don't believe it has the economic potential to support  new business.   I want to tell you a great success story about what a husband and  wife team, Elihu and Carolyn Brayboy, found out when they tried to open  a restaurant on 22nd Street in South St. Pete, an economically  depressed part of the town that was long overlooked by those at the top  of the economic ladder. I want to show my colleagues a picture of them.  This is the Brayboys.   In fact, the building the Brayboys wanted to use for their restaurant  sat idle for the previous 35 years. It was basically wasting away. When  the Brayboys went looking for a loan to buy the building, every lender  they went to said: No, it is too depressed. It sat vacant for 35 years.   Everywhere they went, they heard the same thing: The community will  not be able to bring in enough business, and you will not be able to  get enough customers from outside the community to visit that area.   Most people would have given up after receiving so many noes or given  [[Page S7229]]  in to the pressure to put the restaurant in a more acceptable part of  town, but like most people in South St. Pete, the Brayboys are a  different cut because they are not easily deterred. If there is one  thing my colleagues should know about the people of South St. Pete, it  is this: Don't test their resolve, because you are in for a surprise.   Undeterred, Mr. and Mrs. Brayboys took money out of their 401(k)  accounts and poured all of their life savings into buying that hulk of  a building on 22nd Street. After gutting the inside and pouring in  their blood, sweat, and tears into remodeling the property, Chief's  Creole Cafe opened in November of 2014 and has been going strong ever  since, creating jobs and changing the way people think about South St.  Pete. This is a picture of how the restaurant looks today.   Despite the warnings of all of those doubtful lenders, they have been  able to sustain the business by attracting both locals and customers  from outside of the area of South St. Pete. Does that not look like  something that is a well-run, growing, successful business?   So the old saying stands: If you build it, and if you really try,  they will come.   Now, this is a great story of stubborn determination triumphing over  fear and adversity and rejection after rejection, but this type of  story is few and far between in too many parts of Florida and across  the country.   So let me show you another picture. This is the Three Oaks Plaza. The  Three Oaks Plaza used to be the location of a Dollar Tree store, but  the store closed last year. This is how it used to look, and this is  how it looks now. The closing of the Dollar Tree store came on the  heels of the closing of the local Walmart nearby.   Unfortunately, this is all too common in South St. Pete and too many  other parts of Florida. The problem isn't new, but we need a new way to  think about it. We need economic policies that rely less on outside  investors and outside companies to come in and remake the image of the  area and rely more, instead, on empowering local residents to create  their own businesses. They are more likely to keep profits in the  community, creating a more sustainable loop of economic activity.   That is what I want to recommend that this Senate and future Senates  do with legislation. Consider the example of legislation that I  introduced earlier this year called the Economic Modernization Act.  That bill does a lot of things, but one key thing it does is to create  a new tax break for local businesses that move into buildings that have  long sat idle and vacant. Under a piece of legislation such as that, if  a business moves into a building that has been vacant for 2 or more  years and renovates the property, the business would be able to get a  tax deduction worth many more times than what it put into it. Any  profits earned at the property, for the first 3 years in that building,  would be a tax deduction. The deduction would be capped. It could be,  in legislation, at 50 percent of the business's wages to make sure that  the employees are also getting a benefit, and the more the business  pays its employees, the more the business saves with that tax deduction  and, therefore, saves in taxes.   Simply put, the bill, or legislation like it, will make it easier for  local entrepreneurs to rebuild their community, helping to turn more  places like this first photo into places like Chief's Creole Cafe.   Now, that is what we ought to be doing, not digging out old policies  from the 1980s and calling it something new like our colleagues here in  the Congress did last year with the tax bill. The tax bill added  trillions to the national debt and made it easier for big corporations  to game the tax system and put Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, our  infrastructure, and all other sorts of priorities at risk because the  entire national debt is run up $2 trillion over a 10-year period.   Where is the money to do all of these other priorities--Medicaid,  Medicare, infrastructure, Social Security?   When big corporations see places like South St. Pete, they don't  necessarily see the financial opportunity that Mr. and Mrs. Brayboy saw  and turn it into a going concern. They don't necessarily want to  empower places. Sometimes it just goes over their heads, and they miss  the opportunity.   We need to incentivize local people to revitalize a community and, in  the process, to be economically successful. We need to create more  stories like the successful story of the Brayboys. We need to make it  easier for locals to take old, abandoned buildings and turn them into  new, thriving businesses that value their people and employ local  residents. We need to encourage local communities, which understand  their own needs, to be financially successful and have an opportunity  to do that.   Despite what others say, instead of a tax bill that raises the  national debt by $2 trillion, wouldn't you believe that if we could do  this all over America, it would help so much of the economic  underpinnings of our country?   Let's think of a way that it should be, and this is one way. We need  to do more to lift up those at the bottom and help them help  themselves. I hope our colleagues will agree, and I hope our colleagues  will consider legislation like this in the future.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
