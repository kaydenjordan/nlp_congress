 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the combined rule and  the underlying fuel prices legislation in this package as it seeks to  cast blame on hardworking Americans in the energy industry and offers  no real solutions.   The underlying bill, H.R. 7688, establishes de facto price control on  fuels, a dangerous step that has the potential to create fuel  shortages. Many Americans remember the long lines of cars waiting at  gas stations in the mid-1970s, and they do not want to return to that  scenario.   But don't take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned  Congress last night that this bill has the potential to cause, `` . . .  rationing, gas lines, and a much greater dependence on imported energy.  . . . ''   Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues that the price of gasoline is  determined on a global market based on supply and demand. The way to  lower prices is to increase supply, and we can do that by unleashing  American production.   Sadly, the administration has been doing the exact opposite, delaying  permit approvals, denying access to public lands, and gaslighting the  energy industry.   What is worse, just today, the administration announced that they are  removing sanctions on Venezuela in order to import foreign oil from a  hostile socialist country.   In my home State of Oklahoma, nearly a quarter of all jobs are  connected to the energy industry. Frankly, this legislation is  insulting to hardworking Oklahomans throughout the Fifth Congressional  District whose efforts power this great Nation.   Instead of legislation that blames American energy producers, we  should roll back the onerous energy policies of the Biden  administration and unleash American energy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the rule and to reject  the underlying bill.
