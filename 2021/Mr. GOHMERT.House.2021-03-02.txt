 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member. This bill that  is supposed to be for the people, one of the things it is really  supposed to do, we have been told, you know, this is going to eliminate  foreign interference with our bill. They have been preaching on it for  years. There was the whole Russia hoax, all these other things. It  turns out there hasn't been foreign interference, but the friends  across the aisle were not serious, and are not serious with this bill  about eliminating all foreign interference.   In fact, that is why I filed an amendment that would have addressed  that. They got loopholes big enough to drive several trucks through. So  we took care of it in my amendment. My amendment says, ``Each State  shall ensure that no foreign entity carries out any role in the  administration of elections for Federal office in the State, including  providing, maintaining, programming, operating, storing, or compiling  any of the equipment, software, supplies, or information used in the  administration of the election.   ``A nonprofit organization may not carry out any activities related  to voting or elections for public office in a State if the organization  accepts any funds from a foreign entity.''   And then it defines foreign entity, where it covers everybody and  everything that is not American.                                time  1400    So we have got this amendment that would completely plug the  loopholes that the Democrats have so that foreigners can't continue to  influence the election.   And what do they do?   They say:   Your amendment, we don't want it. It is not in order. We are not even  going to give you a vote on it.   They are not serious about eliminating foreign interference, and that  is a shame.
