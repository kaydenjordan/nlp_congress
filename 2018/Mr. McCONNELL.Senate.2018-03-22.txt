 Mr. President, yesterday evening, the House filed a  landmark appropriations bill for the remainder of fiscal year 2018.  Months of in-depth, bicameral, bipartisan negotiations and committee  work have led us to this point. The result is legislation that neither  side sees as perfect but which contains a host of significant victories  and important achievements on behalf of the American people.   First and foremost, in my view, this bill will mark the end of  disproportionate and harmful cuts to the Department of Defense. It  delivers the largest year-on-year increase in defense spending in 15  years. These new funding levels will ensure that the training and tools  available to our servicemembers remain on the cutting edge, and at long  last, veterans will receive more transparent and more accessible care.  This has been a top priority, on our side of the aisle especially, to  deliver for our men and women in uniform, to deliver for the future of  national security. This bill will get it done.   Of course, our Armed Forces aren't the only vital priority this  measure will address. It is a victory for families caught in the grip  of the opioid epidemic. This bill scales up research, treatment, and  prevention funding and provides for grants to first responders. It will  confront the scourge of addiction head-on and help save lives. For  rural communities, like many in my home State of Kentucky, this is a  big deal.   The measure is also a victory for safe, reliable, 21st century  infrastructure. It will fund long overdue improvements to roads, rails,  airports, and inland waterways to ensure that our growing economy has  the support system that it needs.   Importantly, the bill will also contain a number of provisions to  provide more safety for American families. It expands funding for  Federal law enforcement. It allocates new resources to border security  and immigration enforcement, including an important step forward for  President Trump's proposed wall. The total miles of new and upgraded  walls and barriers funded by this bill exceeds even the  administration's initial request for this fiscal year, and it also  provides the necessary funds to keep Guantanamo Bay open and operating.   The legislation also delivers for students and teachers across our  Nation, who deserve to learn and work without fear of violence.   At the insistence of the Speaker and me, this bill will include two  important bipartisan, commonsense measures to address real issues  facing the Nation: the Fix NICS bill and the STOP School Violence Act.  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Hatch, this bill represents a major  step forward for school safety. It provides millions of dollars in new  funding for early intervention and prevention programs to stop school  violence before it happens. These grants will include funding for  training of students and school personnel for identifying and  responding to safety threats, as well as for implementing enhanced  technology and equipment to improve school safety. Thanks to the dogged  efforts of Senator Cornyn, the Fix NICS  [[Page S1886]]  provision to repair and improve firearm background checks is also  included. Both of these bipartisan accomplishments are the direct  result of tireless work by those who have been most tragically affected  by violence in America's schools.   Here is how Mark Barden, a cofounder of Sandy Hook Promise, described  the school safety provision: ``This legislation will save lives.''   Likewise, the Parkland, FL, families recently wrote all four  congressional leaders to ask that we include these two particular  measures in this piece of legislation. I am proud that we could deliver  for them and for the safety of schools around our country.   Let's take one more look at just a few of the good things this bill  will accomplish: No. 1, the largest year-on-year funding increase for  our warfighters in 15 years; new resources for the fight against  opioids and for border security and the President's wall; major  enhancements for law enforcement and school safety. These provisions  and the entirety of this omnibus represent months of bipartisan work. I  look forward to considering it very soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the good news about  tax reform continues to sweep across the Nation. But recently, as  special bonuses, wage increases, and expanded employee benefits  continue to make headlines, they have had to share the front page with  a series of late winter storms. This prolonged cold weather can mean  high heating costs for working families. Fortunately, tax reform has an  answer for that as well.   Ratepayers in many States are looking forward to smaller utility  bills, thanks to our country's new Tax Code. In my home State, the  public service commission announced early this week that Kentucky  Utilities and Louisville Gas & Electric will be passing along savings  to customers to the tune of a 6-percent decrease in monthly bills. That  means real savings for the middle-class families I represent.   We have heard a similar story from our neighbors in Indiana. The  Northern Indiana Public Service Company reports that thanks to tax  reform, it will be able to pass $26 million in new savings on to its  customers. That is just one of a long list of ways that tax reform is  helping Hoosiers.   Pat Williams, who lives in Southern Indiana, recently shared another  tax reform success story with my friend, Senator Young. Pat's husband,  Jim, works part-time in the U-Haul service center across the river in  Louisville. He received a $500 tax reform bonus.   Over in Converse, IN, tax reform enabled the First Farmers Bank &  Trust to raise its starting wage for hourly workers, guarantee a year- end bonus for all full-time employees, and announce a big investment in  employee development and community programs.   My friend, the junior Senator from Indiana, knows the folks at First  Farmers. In fact, he was so impressed by their proactive response to  the new Tax Code that he invited them to the President's State of the  Union back in January. There aren't enough seats in the House Gallery  for all the American families that tax reform is already helping--not  even close. But if there were, I would bet the working families and  small businesses from Indiana would come with questions. Why did only  one of their Senators vote for these tax savings? Why did their senior  Senator vote in lockstep with Democrats to block their tax cuts,  bonuses, raises, and benefits? Those would be tough questions to  answer. Fortunately, Republicans stayed focused on empowering the  American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 165,  S. 1519.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, when I learned that our distinguished  colleague from Mississippi would be retiring this month, I found it  difficult to imagine the Senate without him.   That is for good reason. Thad Cochran arrived here in 1978. Two  hundred and fifty-four Senators have since followed in his footsteps.  Of those currently serving, 97 of us are newer at this than Thad is,  and every single one of us has been treated to a first-rate example of  honorable service, a master class in the art of legislation, and living  proof that unwavering principle  [[Page S1894]]  and unflappable collegiality can and should coexist.   We all know Thad has a knack for making things look easy. So many  graces and talents seem second nature to him, but appearances can be  deceiving.   Take the start of his political career. When we think about it, it is  only natural that Senator Cochran liked to work on conservation issues.  I expect his adventures as a Mississippi Republican in the early 1970s  helped him understand just what it feels like to be an endangered  species.   In 1972, Thad was a rising-star attorney when he was asked to try and  become just the second GOP Congressman from his State since  Reconstruction. The possibility seemed so remote that when he asked  Rose how she would like being married to a Congressman, she replied,  ``I don't know--which one?''   Long odds, indeed.   But true to form, Thad won in the end--and again and again--and then  he became the first Republican Senator from Mississippi in a century.   It is safe to say service is in Thad's DNA. Both his parents were  devoted educators. His father, W.H., served as superintendent of a  large, rural public school district. His mother Emma was a pioneering  mathematics teacher who wrote new curricula.   In Pontotoc, MS, their two boys grew up with a healthy appreciation  for the power of good schooling.   Thad graduated as high school valedictorian, then came a naval  commission, and then law school, where he graduated at the top of his  class, but no amount of success can take the kindness and courtesy out  of this quintessentially southern gentleman. A deep respect for others  is Thad's calling card.   Just a few weeks after he arrived in Washington, he brought his staff  together and he said:         We're going to treat everyone the same. We're here to find       answers for everyone, even if they disagree with us. We're       here to serve the people of Mississippi.    Even at a time when the wounds of segregation were still raw, he made  it clear this meant all--all--Mississippians. In fact, he hired the  first African-American congressional staffer to work in a Mississippi  office since reconstruction--Nehemiah Flowers. And for all his staff,  Thad took the time to pen a detailed memo laying out high expectations  for serving constituents and treating everyone with dignity. That  temperament led to a litany of accomplishments.    Mississippians knew that in Thad they had a quiet persuader, a steady  workhorse, and a dogged advocate who almost never made a fuss but  almost always made a difference. Indeed, the policy achievements of  this mighty Appropriations chairman are so numerous as to defy easy  summary.   I know this schoolteacher's son is particularly proud of his work on  education. Senator Cochran carried the banner for research partnerships  that raised the profile of historically Black colleges and  universities. He delivered critical funding to expand scholarship  access. He spearheaded the Delta Education Initiative. He inspired the  Cochran Fellowship Program, which has changed the lives of more than  17,000 agriculture professionals from around the world.   It is no exaggeration to say that Thad Cochran's work has broadened  the horizons of millions, but it didn't stop there. There were the  landmark bipartisan bills, like the Cochran-Inouye National Missile  Defense Act. There is his partnership with his dear friend, Senator  Leahy, on the Farm to School Program. The list just keeps growing.   When he first ran for the Senate in 1978, Thad's stump speech  included a line that Mississippians deserved a Senator who would work  full-time for them. They certainly got one. Thad didn't come to  Washington to curry favor, win praise, or hog the limelight. When I say  he preferred making a difference to making a fuss, I really mean it.  This man served in the Senate for seven terms and only appeared on Meet  the Press twice.   No, Thad had other business to attend to. He spent his 39 years in  this body working full-time for students and educators, full-time for  farmers and ranchers, full-time to deliver funding for our brave  servicemembers and our veterans who returned home.   It is rare, even in the halls of Government, to meet someone as  influential as Senator Thad Cochran. It is even rarer to meet someone  as kind, as even tempered, and as concerned for the welfare of others.  It is almost unheard of that this same man would be both. That is just  who Thad is.   He wrote the book on composure under pressure. He served as the  careful custodian of billions of taxpayer dollars without losing an  ounce of humility. On the Senate floor and in committee, he tackled  heated debates and complicated legislative challenges with true servant  leadership. On the tennis court, by all accounts, he offered his  colleagues a different and altogether less hospitable sort of service.  But true to form, I hear Thad always combined winning and graciousness.  He has certainly had enough practice at both.   From Pontotoc, MS, to the Senate floor, Thad Cochran's story has  grown but it hasn't changed. It is a story about putting others first.  It is about doing the right thing every step of the way. It is a story  that will continue to teach and inspire those of us who now must carry  on our work without him.   I know that Thad's devoted staff are sorry to see him go. Their  allegiance to him, famous throughout the Senate, is further testimony  to his own principled professionalism. This is exemplified by nobody  quite so well as Doris Wagley, Senator Cochran's personal secretary,  who has served Thad ever since 1973, when he was first sworn in as a  Congressman. She planned to take the job for just a year or so and then  reassess--enough said. She, along with all of Senator Cochran's  excellent staff, has our admiration and our gratitude.   I would particularly like to thank two men who have led teams in  service to Mississippi and Senator Cochran so well--Brad White, his  chief of staff, and Bruce Evans, his longtime staff director on the  Appropriations Committee. I am grateful for their hard work on behalf  of the Senate. I know the early mornings and late nights were many,  including just these last few weeks.   Thad's friends know that retirement will allow him more happy times  with his wife Kay, his beloved children, Clayton and Kate, and the  three grandchildren he adores. He departs with our warmest wishes.   We will miss our great persuader. We will miss our loyal friend. We  stand with Mississippians and a grateful nation in honoring the service  of Senator Thad Cochran.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 619, the nomination of Richard  Grenell to be Ambassador to Germany. I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    I object.    Mr. President, this has been a very disappointing  moment. Senator Collins is asking to pass an amendment that would not  seem to be terribly controversial. As we have heard my colleagues state  this afternoon, the Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson proposal would  lower health insurance premiums--dramatically, in some cases--for  American individuals and families. This assistance would be especially  helpful to the middle-class families whom ObamaCare has hit the  hardest.   How do my colleagues propose accomplishing this worthy goal? Through  another top-down, one-size-fits-all scheme cooked up here in  Washington? No, their legislation is designed to encourage new thinking  and creative policymaking at the State level, through the expansion of  section 1332 State innovation waivers and high-risk pools. It would end  the practice of silver-loading, which unnecessarily costs the taxpayers  tens of billions of dollars. It includes Hyde amendment language that  has been commonplace for decades, going back to the 1970s, preventing  taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. Apparently, that commonsense  provision is suddenly just a bridge too far for some of our friends  across the aisle.   For months, my colleague from Maine has led a bipartisan effort to  bring common sense back to Americans' healthcare. Along with Senator  Alexander, she has brought together Senators with different viewpoints  and made real progress toward fixing the glaring failures of the  current system. It is especially disappointing that their efforts are  being blocked precisely when they stand the greatest chance of helping  millions of Americans. It is not entirely surprising that my colleagues  across the aisle are happy to talk the talk about lowering premiums for  working families, but they refuse to actually walk the walk when given  a golden opportunity. But it sure is disappointing.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor  to the Collins-Alexander amendment.    Mr. President, I understand that the Senate has  received a message from the House to accompany H.R. 1625.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany H.R. 1625.

I would say to my good friend from Tennessee--by the  way, I am very sorry he has decided to leave the Senate, given how much  he has obviously enjoyed it today.    Well, my good friend from Tennessee knows that my  principal responsibility is begging, pleading, and cajoling. I have  been in continuous discussions, shall I say, with several of our  Members who were legitimately unhappy about one aspect or another, and  they spent a lot of time thinking over whether or not they wanted to  expedite the process. I must say, after a long and intense day of such  discussions with several of our Members who have legitimate concerns, I  am relieved, rather than depressed, that we might be able to actually  finish tonight.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  motion to concur with further amendment and the Senate now vote on the  motion to concur.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 539.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.
