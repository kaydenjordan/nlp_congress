 Mr. President, as we bring to an end this debate about  the accession treaty for Sweden and Finland, I have been listening in  my office to my colleagues' comments, and I think it has all been very  constructive. But I do have a different view--a view on some points  that have been made that I think are wrong--and before this body casts  a vote, I think they should understand why.   I appreciate Senator Paul's focus on Congress's prerogatives with  respect to war powers. Like Senator Paul, I have a deep respect for the  critical role that the Constitution assigns to Congress in this area,  and I believe our democracy is stronger for it. But I rise to convey  that Senator Paul's amendment is unnecessary, unprecedented, and, if  adopted, will be deeply damaging to NATO and our relationship with NATO  allies.   That is why the Foreign Relations Committee, in marking up these  treaties, overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan vote, voted down a  substantively identical amendment offered by Senator Paul.   The amendment before us today is not necessary. There is no question  that the North Atlantic Treaty and the Finland and Sweden protocols do  not and cannot supersede the Constitution. No treaty can. This is a  well-established and well-understood point that the Supreme Court has  reaffirmed.   The amendment, however, would be deeply damaging to our core national  security interests. Neither the United States nor any other NATO ally  has ever insisted on a reservation--a statement that would limit and  call into question our adherence to NATO obligations. But that is  exactly what this amendment does.   If adopted, it would be shared with all NATO members and would signal  to them that we are limiting our obligations to NATO with regard to  article 5 of the NATO treaty. If we go down this road, we can expect  that other countries will do so, as well, gutting the core commitment  that NATO members make to each other.   Particularly at this time, with Putin's rampage in Ukraine, his  energy war against Europe, and his constant saber-rattling, it would be  self-defeating to do anything that casts doubt on our rock-solid  commitment to NATO and our NATO allies.   So let me reiterate: There is no question that neither the treaties  we are voting on today nor any treaty can supersede the Constitution.  That position is clear in law and clear in logic: The Constitution is  supreme.   From there, we have one task before us: providing advice and consent  to Finland and Sweden's accession in a manner that strengthens the NATO  alliance and strengthens our allies. The amendment before us would do  the opposite.   And for those reasons, I oppose that amendment and urge all my  colleagues to do so as well.   Finally, let me address some of the other critics of Sweden and  Finland's accession to the NATO alliance. Each day we fail to act we  send a message of indecision and division. Some Republican critics  oppose Sweden and Finland joining NATO because they are worried about  the cost to the United States, but that is simply untrue. Sweden and  Finland will reduce these costs.   Instead, we should be asking: What is the cost of delaying NATO  expansion? What is the cost of debating protection for Europe's  democracies? What is the cost of denying security to Sweden and  Finland?   I will tell you, these eleventh-hour concerns standing in the way of  this process only serve Putin's interest. Other critics want an  amendment undermining article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an  attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. But as I said before,  this was overwhelmingly rejected by both sides of the aisle in the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   And then there are still others who say we shouldn't accept Sweden  and Finland into NATO because China, not Russia, is our greatest  foreign policy threat. Let me just say one thing, if you want to make  sure you defeat the China challenge, the first thing you want to do is  defeat Russia in Ukraine.   Xi Jinping is looking at what is happening in Ukraine. He is looking  at what the West is doing in Ukraine. And he is making calculations as  it relates to Taiwan and elsewhere in the world. You want to make sure  that you defeat Russia in Ukraine.   And let me also say, as someone who has worked on foreign policy for  three decades and who is intimately aware of the danger and risk that  China poses, we have to be able to meet that challenge in multiple  dimensions. Sometimes we face more than one threat at the same time.  Sometimes our values and commitments compel us to stand up for what we  believe in, and this is one of those times. Putin's regime continues to  push and probe for weakness, and NATO is the best institution we have  to check his push for power across the continent.   Over the course of the last 70 years that NATO has existed, it has  used an open-door policy when it comes to accepting new member  countries. These countries must be functioning democracies. They must  treat minorities fairly. They must resolve conflicts peacefully and be  able to contribute to the NATO alliance. And this criteria describes  Sweden and Finland to a tee.   So I urge my colleagues to vote yes to accept these prosperous  democracies into NATO. Vote yes to reduce the cost on the United States  and the entire military alliance. Vote yes to embracing the values and  modern militaries of Sweden and Finland. Vote yes to having these two  democracies join us. Vote yes to strengthening the North American  Treaty Organization today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The       estimated total cost is $162.07 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a NATO ally, which is an important       partner for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Greece's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing an effective       combatant deterrent capability to protect maritime interests       and infrastructure in support of its strategic location on       NATO's southern flank. Follow-on support and sustainment of       Greece's existing fleet of S-70 helicopters enhances       stability and maritime security in the Eastern Mediterranean       region and contribute to security and strategic objectives of       NATO and the United States. Greece contributes to NATO       operations, as well as to counterterrorism and counter-piracy       maritime efforts and performs invaluable Search and Rescue       (SAR) functions in the region. Greece will have no difficulty       absorbing this equipment and services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Bethesda,       MD. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION     United Arab Emirates--Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)     System Missiles and THAAD Fire Control and Communication Stations         The Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has       requested to buy ninety-six (96) Terminal High Altitude Area       Defense (THAAD) missile rounds; two (2) THAAD Launch Control       Stations (LCS); and two (2) THAAD Tactical Operations       Stations (TOS). Also included are repair and return, system       integration and checkout, and spare and repair parts; support       and testing equipment; publications and technical       documentation; construction activities; encryption devices;       secure communication equipment; other required COMSEC       equipment; and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The total estimated program cost is $2.245       billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of an important regional partner. The UAE is a       vital U.S. partner for political stability and economic       progress in the Middle East.        The proposed sale will improve the UAE's ability to meet       current and future ballistic missile threats in the region,       and reduce dependence on U.S. forces. The UAE will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces, as       it currently employs the THAAD system.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Space       Systems Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA. It is anticipated the       purchaser will request offsets. Any offset agreement will be       defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the       contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the UAE.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system       is the first weapons system with both endo- and exo-      atmospheric capability specifically developed to defend       against ballistic missiles. The higher altitude and theater-      wide protection offered by THAAD provides more protection of       larger areas than lower-tier systems alone. THAAD is designed       to defend against short, medium and intermediate range       ballistic missiles. The THAAD system consists of four major       components: Fire Control/Communications System (comprised of       the Tactical Operations Station, Launch Control Station, and       System Support Group), Radar, Launchers and Interceptors.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the UAE can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of the United Arab Emirates.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may       also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,       aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 43.5 pounds and       has a maximum range in excess of 4,500 meters. The system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Light Weight       Command Launch Unit (LWCLU) and a round contained in a       disposable launch tube assembly. The LWCLU incorporates an       integrated day-night sight that provides a target engagement       capability in adverse weather and countermeasure       environments. The LWCLU may also be used in a stand-alone       mode for battlefield surveillance and target detection. The       LWCLU's thermal sight is a 3rd generation Forward Looking       Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial loading and       subsequent updating of software, all on-board missile       software is uploaded via the LWCLU after mating and prior to       launch.        4. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       UNCLASSIFIED.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that the United Kingdom       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of the United Kingdom.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
