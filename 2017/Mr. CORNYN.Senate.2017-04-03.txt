 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor to talk  about the important work for the Senate this week, now that the  Judiciary Committee has voted on the Judge Neil Gorsuch nomination and  he is available for floor consideration. But I wanted, first, to extend  my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those tragically  killed in an automobile crash near New Valley, TX, last week.   A bus carrying a group of 14 members of the First Baptist Church in  New  [[Page S2165]]  Braunfels collided with a pickup truck on Highway 83. Thirteen people  were killed and two others, including the driver of the other vehicle,  were injured. You can imagine how heartbreaking this has been to  everyone involved. I can't begin to imagine the pain and the grief felt  by their loved ones, their church family, and their entire close-knit  community of New Braunfels, TX, just north of San Antonio.   I had the opportunity to speak with the pastor of First Baptist of  New Braunfels, Pastor McLean, the day after the accident. He is leading  his congregation and that community during this very difficult time. He  is shepherding his flock, though, with grace and strength. There is a  phrase I am reminded off in times like this. After the terrible  explosion in West Texas, I had a county commissioner from that area  tell me: Being a Texan doesn't describe where you are from, it  describes who your family is.   Today, our family is mourning. But I know Pastor McLean and all of my  fellow Texans and all Americans really lift up this community in  prayer, along with the families and friends of those we lost.   I am grateful to the first responders and medical professionals who  were first to arrive at the scene of the accident and lent a hand to  those in need.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Separately, Madam President, as I have indicated, this is an  important week for the American people. Earlier today, the Judiciary  Committee voted to send Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Senate floor  for full consideration. Later this week, he will be confirmed as the  next Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. For the past several  weeks and through 20 grueling hours of questioning before the Judiciary  Committee, Judge Gorsuch has proven to be one of the most qualified  nominees to the Court in modern history.   Republicans in the Senate said we would give the American people a  voice in who would select the next Supreme Court Justice. In a sense,  we had a referendum of whether it would be a nominee selected by Donald  Trump or by Hillary Clinton. On November 8, we saw the outcome of that  election. This week, that referendum will be answered when the country  will have its ninth Justice on the Supreme Court.   Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are doing their very best to  decide that they should mount the first partisan filibuster of a  Supreme Court nominee in American history. This is truly unprecedented.  I know sometimes people want to talk about 1968 and the Abe Fortas  nomination, but not even then was there a partisan filibuster that  successfully blocked the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice.   What I am talking about is blocking the ability to have an up-or-down  vote. I am not talking about how people vote on the confirmation vote.  I am talking about allowing us to have a vote--that up-or-down vote--or  denying it by virtue of the filibuster. I, for one, have been  encouraged to see people from across the country speaking out and  urging our colleagues to drop their obstruction and to allow such an  up-or-down vote on an incredibly qualified, upstanding, and brilliant  judge.    Editorials from all over the country have registered their opposition  to the idea of a filibuster and have done so rather bluntly. The  Chicago Tribune, for example, said: ``Neil Gorsuch earns his Supreme  Court seat.'' The Boston Herald says: ``Shame on Senate Dems.'' The  Boston Herald specifically said that those going along with the  strategy were ``blindly partisan for whom any nomination made by  President Trump would never be qualified.''   The Denver Post, in the home State of Judge Gorsuch, urged Senators  to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and specifically urged  the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Bennet, not to cooperate with  this blind partisanship and this filibuster but rather to allow the  judge an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.   Their editorial title made that much clearer. They said: ``Michael  Bennet should buck Democrats and speak up for Neil Gorsuch.''   The Billings Gazette in Montana had this to say: ``Democrats refuse  to rise above petty partisan politics.''   The Richmond Times-Dispatch took the junior Senator from Virginia to  task and said: His opposition to Judge Gorsuch, ``suggests he can't  come up with a defensible reason to oppose the nomination.''   Finally in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Union Leader editorial  last week was titled: ``Confirm Gorsuch: Dems plan pointless  filibuster.'' ``Pointless'' about sums it up. There is no doubt that  Judge Gorsuch is qualified. He has received the highest rating from the  American Bar Association, which reportedly interviewed 500 leading  lawyers and practitioners in the country, and the ratings system of the  American Bar Association has been called by many of our Senate  Democratic colleagues the ``gold standard'' when it comes to  confirmations.   Among the legal and local communities, Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad  bipartisan support, but that seems to make no difference to our friends  across the aisle who voted on a party-line vote not to send his  nomination from the Judiciary Committee. Of course, their minority  position lost when the majority of the committee voted today to send  that nomination to the floor.   I can't help but think that they are in an unenviable position, torn  by their desire to do what they know is the right thing when it comes  to confirming a good judge, and, on the other hand, being attacked by  their own party's political base, telling them that if they vote to  confirm this judge, they are somehow going to suffer some political  damage.   Of these newspapers I mentioned, not one of them endorsed Donald  Trump for President--not one. But unlike some of our Senate colleagues,  they are able to distinguish between President Trump and Judge Neil  Gorsuch, instead of using Donald Trump as a proxy not to vote to  confirm Neil Gorsuch.   These newspapers are urging Senate Democrats to drop this pointless  filibuster because they understand that it will not be President Trump  we will be voting on next week. It is Judge Neil Gorsuch. Now, after  repeatedly moving the goalposts for this nominee, my Democratic friends  are saying that he has to pass the ``traditional'' threshold of 60  votes. Well, that is a made-up standard.   Throughout our Nation's history, the Senate has not had a tradition  of filibustering judges. It was a strategy cooked up by Senator  Schumer, Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School, and other liberal  activists to try to block President George W. Bush's judges when he was  President of the United States. So there is no 60-vote threshold in  Senate tradition. Actually, there have only been four cloture votes for  a Supreme Court nominee--only four--and none of them for a partisan  filibuster that actually succeeded in blocking an up-or-down vote for a  nominee.   One of the newspaper fact checks concluded with this. They said:  ``There is no traditional 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme  Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim  otherwise.'' This should be a time when the Senate should come together  in a bipartisan fashion and do what it is supposed to do when we  receive the nomination of such a highly qualified person.   Judge Gorsuch has won bipartisan approval. People across the country  understand that, as do a number of independent Democrats here in the  Senate, and they understand the dangerous path the minority leader is  setting us and them on. Unfortunately, the Democratic leader wants to  mount the first successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  nominee in our history.   But I would point out that no Republican Senator in the Senate has  ever voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, including those  nominated by Democratic Presidents. As a matter of fact, Justice  Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52 votes. If the threshold were  really 60, then he would not currently be serving on the Supreme Court  of the United States. Even such polar opposites as Justice Scalia and  Justice Ginsburg were confirmed by virtually unanimous votes because  people understood that once the President was elected, that the  President's choice should matter, and the Senate should not  artificially try to lift up a 60-vote threshold in order to block,  effectively, the will of the voters in choosing the president.   A few years ago, when we considered the nominations of Justice  Sotomayor  [[Page S2166]]  and Justice Kagan, we gave both nominees a simple up-or-down vote. So  our friends across the aisle have a simple but very important decision  to make. They can listen to the extremist groups on the left that are  urging them to resist at all costs or they can assert some of their  independence.   As of today, several of our Democratic colleagues have done exactly  that. I congratulate them. I am glad Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin,  and Senator Donnelly have said they will assert their prerogative, as  Senators, to allow an up-or-down vote for this nominee and actually  vote for them. I hope they stand firm, but I hope, more importantly,  more of their colleagues will demonstrate the same sort of independence  from the radical base of the Democratic Party that says no to  everything this President does. I hope they at least afford Judge  Gorsuch an up-or-down vote because, if the Democrats successfully block  Judge Gorsuch, there is literally no nominee from this President who  they will not block--plain and simple.    So as we have been saying, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed at the end  of this week, but it is up to the Democrats as to how that happens.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
