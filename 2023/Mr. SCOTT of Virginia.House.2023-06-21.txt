 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, the proposals in H.R. 3799 are yet another recycled,  futile attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and actually make it  harder for workers and families to find affordable, high-quality health  insurance.   This legislative package includes two bills that were marked up by  the Committee on Education and the Workforce.   The first is the Association Health Plans Act. This act undermines a  core promise of the ACA, access to affordable healthcare for all. This  faulty legislation may provide lower costs for some enrollees, but it  would do so by skimping on benefits and increasing costs for everybody  else.   Specifically, the bill would allow association health plans to  cherry-pick low-risk, young individuals for a pool separate from the  ACA marketplace. You may hear my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle tout the bill's nominal protections against discrimination based  on preexisting conditions, but they omit the details regarding the  other large loopholes that leave consumers vulnerable in this bill,  such as charging higher risk groups more so that the plan will not be  attractive to them and charging low-risk groups less so that they will  be the ones that come in.   In fact, this legislation explicitly authorizes AHPs to set premiums  based on the ``specific risk profile'' of employer members, enabling  them to charge higher premiums to groups based on their age, gender,  and other factors. AHPs could also exclude certain categories of  coverage, such as maternity care, mental health, or substance abuse  disorder, to dissuade certain groups or individuals from enrolling.  Under the bill, association health plans could also evade essential  health benefits and other consumer protections under State and Federal  law.   It is a bad idea because of simple arithmetic. If healthy, low-risk  individuals can leave the Affordable Care Act marketplace risk pool and  join a separate association and pay lower rates on average, those that  did not get into these plans will, on average, pay higher premiums.   Let's be clear. Only low-cost groups will be in these plans because  if you are a high-risk group, the cost will be too much and will not be  attractive. If they are high-risk groups with preexisting conditions,  older groups, and whatnot, they will not be able to form groups that  charge less than the ACA marketplace, and nobody will want to join.   Under the ACA, everybody pays an average. If you have a preexisting  condition or do not have a preexisting condition, everybody pays the  same, and everybody gets insurance at an affordable cost.   Everybody enjoys all the essential benefits under the ACA.  Association plans, for example, do not have to provide coverage for  essential benefits like maternity benefits. All the costs of maternity  care will be borne by fewer and fewer people.   The average cost of insurance for those not in the plans will slowly  grow as the number of association plans grows.                                time  1615    Various versions of this legislation have been pushed by Republicans  for decades, but all iterations suffer from the same fundamental flaw,  they shift costs to the most vulnerable. That is why more than 30  leading consumer and patient groups have expressed serious concerns  with this harmful legislation.   The other bill marked up in the Education and the Workforce Committee  was the Self-Insurance Protection Act, legislation that further erodes  the ACA by exempting stop-loss insurance from key consumer protections.   The bill would prevent the Secretaries of Health and Human Services,  Labor, and the Treasury from regulating stop-loss insurance coverage.  Even more troubling, the bill makes it virtually impossible for States  to protect consumers from abusive practices by invalidating State laws  that regulate stop-loss.   Stop-loss insurance usually covers costs above a catastrophic level,  over a million dollars or something like that. They can be written to  cover everything over a thousand dollars when they become essentially  regular insurance except that they are not regulated. There are no  solvency regulations, no benefit regulations, no nothing.   We can all agree that small businesses and self-insured people  deserve access to affordable healthcare, and that is what you get under  the Affordable Care Act. We should also agree that people deserve basic  consumer protections to ensure that they have insurance with quality,  solvency, an agency to call if something goes wrong, and coverage for  essential benefits. That is why we passed the Affordable Care Act in  the first place. It is also why, when Democrats were in charge in the  last Congress, we passed the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation  Reduction Act to make coverage even more affordable.   The question before us is: Do we want to make sure that every  individual can continue to find affordable and quality healthcare  coverage, or do we want to pass H.R. 3799 and create roadblocks for  Americans seeking care?   Madam Chair, I would hope that we would oppose this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), the ranking member  of the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Chair, I would inquire as to how much  time is remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, the gentleman from Michigan talked about the motive of  employers. I think the employers want to give good coverage. The  problem with this bill is it enables one company to find loopholes to  get a good deal for that company even if it results in higher costs for  everybody else. That is the problem with this legislation.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter of opposition written  by the AFL-CIO.   Among other things, the letter states that this bill undermines  comprehensive coverage and subjects workers to financial risk.                                                            AFL-CIO                                               Legislative Alert,                                                      June 20, 2023.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I urge you       to oppose the CHOICE Arrangement Act (H.R. 3799). This       package would make two substantial changes in  [[Page H3029]]       health coverage policy--both harmful to workers.        First, H.R. 3799 will loosen the definition of association       health plans (AHPs), opening the door for more employers to       establish plans that evade Affordable Care Act (ACA)       requirements to cover essential health benefits and       participate in market-wide risk pools. Despite what their       name suggests, association health plans are not a form of       niche coverage for professional associations. Under current       rules, AHPs may be established by multiple employers and draw       broadly from insurance markets to enroll self-employed       individuals. With the ability to set rates based on a limited       pool of enrollees, AHPs have been able to offer coverage with       lower premiums, but their track record is poor. Too often,       these plans misjudged the risks involved and have gone       insolvent, leaving enrollees in the lurch. In other cases,       enrollees have been defrauded by scammers who exploited the       AHP regulatory loopholes.        Second, under the guise of ``protecting'' stop-loss       insurance for self-funded group health plans, H.R. 3799 would       allow employer health plans to avoid the ACA requirement that       insured plans cover essential health benefits. The policy is       intended to allow plans that are unable to actually self-fund       with adequate reserves to instead purchase a high level of       stop-loss insurance. Lack of adequate reserves leave many of       these plans, and their enrollees, at risk since stop-loss       insurers often retain the right to drop the insurance if       medical costs for the group begin to climb. This is not a       stable form of coverage.        By allowing plans to offer coverage that does not comply       with ACA essential health benefits requirements, both of       these policies would allow plans to cherry pick healthier,       less-costly enrollees from the small group and individual       markets. This will increase premiums for good comprehensive       coverage because risks cannot be spread widely to reduce       costs for all.        We urge you to protect working people by opposing this       legislation that undermines comprehensive coverage and       subjects workers to financial risk.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.    Madam Chair, I include in the Record a broad  post written by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.   Among other things, the post states that the bill will undermine  consumer protections, segment insurance markets, and impose new burdens  on individuals to navigate an already complex system.      [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, June 20, 2023]      Health Bills Headed for a Vote in the House Undermine Consumer                        Protections and Market Rules                              (By Sarah Lueck)         The House is moving toward a vote on legislation that would       weaken Affordable Care Act (ACA) consumer protections and       private market rules. Proponents of these changes claim they       will increase choices and reduce red tape for employers, but       a closer look shows the problems they would create. The       legislation would:        Expand association health plans (AHPs). The legislation       would allow AHPs, a type of health plan that trade       associations, professional groups, and other organizations       may offer their members, to cover self-employed individuals       and small businesses as if they were large employers. This       would exempt them from ACA standards that otherwise apply to       health plans in the individual and small group markets.       Similar to a Trump-era rule a court struck down in 2019, the       bill would segment insurance risk pools: some individuals who       are younger and healthier, or small businesses whose       employees have that profile, could get plans with lower       premiums because they would be priced separately from ACA-      compliant coverage and would not have to meet ACA standards,       such as a requirement to cover a set of essential health       benefits. As a result, other individuals and small businesses       remaining in ACA-regulated markets would see higher premiums.        Expand Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement       Arrangements (ICHRAs). The legislation would codify       provisions similar to a Trump-era rule currently in place       that allows employers to forgo offering a regular group       health insurance plan and instead offer an HRA (a tax-      favored, employer-funded account) that workers could use to       buy their own individual insurance coverage. Increasing such       arrangements could raise ACA marketplace premiums; they are       likely to attract sicker-than-average firms that can spend       less to fund an ICHRA than they must pay for a group health       plan. And firms may find strategies to shift sicker workers       to HRAs, even with guardrails in the legislation meant to       prevent this.        Plus, these arrangements require employees to do       considerable work compared with signing up for an employer       plan--they must apply for and select a plan, set up premium       payments, and understand what expenses the ICHRA covers.       Also, workers offered an ICHRA could be confused about       whether the offer renders them ineligible for a marketplace       premium tax credit--that is, whether it constitutes an       ``affordable'' employer offer that precludes credit       eligibility. And while employers must give workers a notice       of HRA rules, they needn't personalize them to tell       individual workers whether their plan is affordable. These       complications for employees could drive down coverage.        Increase self-insured employer plans. Another provision       would encourage more small employers with healthier workers       to self-insure (meaning that the employer bears the financial       risk), rather than offering a fully insured health plan (for       which an insurer bears the risk). Specifically, the bill       would protect a complex self-insurance arrangement known as       level funding from tighter regulation. Similar to AHPs, this       scheme allows small firms with healthier workers to provide       plans that avoid ACA small-group market premium and benefit       standards without being a large employer or taking on the       risk of self-insurance. This provision would make level       funding an even more common way for smaller firms to avoid       having to offer plans that meet ACA market rules--this would       raise premiums for small businesses that remain in the fully       insured, small-group market if small firms with younger and       healthier workers move to self-insure.        House committees recently approved other health bills that       raise concerns. The Ways and Means Committee moved to expand       health savings accounts (HSAs), which overwhelmingly benefit       high income people and exacerbate racial and ethnic       inequities in coverage access and wealth accumulation. HSA       tax benefits currently are only available when someone has a       high-deductible health plan that meets certain federal rules.       But the committee approved a bill that would allow high-      deductible plans to cover telehealth services pre-deductible,       while still qualifying for HSA tax benefits. It is estimated       to cost $5 billion from 2025 through 2033.        Another bill, approved by the House Education and Workforce       Committee, would let employers offer workers stand-alone       telehealth-only plans and exempt the plans from providing ACA       consumer protections or meeting other federal laws that       otherwise apply to employer coverage. The bill would exempt       telehealth plans from, for example, covering mental health       care at parity with other care and providing preventive       services at no cost to enrollees. The plans could also impose       annual and lifetime limits on coverage and sharply limit the       types of conditions they would address.        Additional policy changes are needed to make health       coverage and care more affordable for many people, despite       the ACA's significant benefits for individuals and small       businesses. But the legislation heading to the House floor is       misguided. It would undermine consumer protections, segment       insurance markets, and impose new burdens on individuals to       navigate an already complex system.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I regret that my Republican colleagues continue to  relitigate the Affordable Care Act. However, what we have seen is not  new. It is what we have seen time and time again over the last 13  years. They continue using every tool they can to undermine the ACA and  limit access to quality healthcare, weaken consumer protections, and  increase average costs.   The provisions of this package do nothing to lower overall healthcare  costs for workers and their families. In fact, for most consumers, the  result of this legislation is that while some may save a little bit,  most consumers will end up paying more.   Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. Association health  plans have a long, well-documented history of cutting costs for  themselves by cherry-picking the cheapest people to cover and leaving  the more expensive behind. This raises costs for everybody else and  causes premiums to go up in the rest of the market. Republicans have  been pushing this idea for decades, and experts have consistently found  it to be harmful.   The Affordable Care Act made a number of reforms to commercial  insurance markets, including a requirement that plans in the individual  and small group markets cover essential health benefits such as  maternity care and prescription drugs. The ACA also prevented these  plans from charging higher rates based on health status and limited the  premium amount that older people could be charged compared to younger  people. This was a vital protection that ensured that an age tax would  not make coverage unaffordable for older individuals.                                time  1645    This legislation has no protection without this amendment. The bill  is entirely silent on discriminatory pricing against older people. In  fact, by explicitly allowing associations to base premiums on risk  factors of each employer within the group, it actually invites them to  charge older Americans much more.   This amendment would ensure that older workers are protected by  providing in this bill that it would not take effect until the  Secretary of Labor certifies that it would not have the impact of  raising premiums for older workers.   I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for her leadership on the  Education and the Workforce Committee.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res.  45, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 43 million Americans are eligible for President Biden's  student loan relief. That is about 100,000 people, on average, in each  of our districts.   Nearly 26 million borrowers in congressional districts all over the  country have already applied for relief, including 16 million who had  already been approved for relief prior to litigation stopping the  process. H.J. Res. 45 seeks to deny these borrowers the relief that  they were promised.   To be clear, the people who would be impacted are not the wealthy and  well-connected. Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of the relief would go to  borrowers earning less than $75,000 a year, and you are not even  eligible if you are making more than $125,000. That is in stark  contrast to the Trump tax scam where 80 percent of the benefits went to  the  [[Page H3037]]  top 1 percent and corporations. For the top 1 percent, that is about  half a million dollars.   Moreover, my Republican colleagues refuse to acknowledge the serious  questions that have been raised about how the resolution would actually  be implemented, because under a Congressional Review Act resolution,  you don't pick and choose which parts of the rule you are overturning,  you have to overturn the whole rule, including the pause in student  payments and the deferral of interest.   Now, how do you unpause a payment that you were supposed to make many  months ago? What is going to happen to all those interest payments that  now have to be added back to those loans?   What happens to the credits that participants in the Public Service  Loan Forgiveness program were promised during those months?   Are the firefighters and teachers and police officers and other  public servants who may have already had their loans forgiven based on  those credits, now back on the hook for additional payments?   The reality is that H.J. Res. 45 would trigger a wave of  delinquencies and defaults for most of our vulnerable borrowers.  Intentionally or not, this resolution would create chaos for borrowers  and their families, as well as loan servicers. The Congressional  Research Service has confirmed that this chaos would be triggered by  the retroactive application of this rule.   Mr. Speaker, anyone in this country who wants to take advantage of  the benefits of a college education should be able to do so, not just  the wealthy few. That is the way it used to be.   Just several decades ago, the Pell grant covered 80 percent of the  cost of attending a State college. Now it is less than 30 percent, and  States are paying a much lower portion of the costs of State colleges  than they used to.   This proposal does nothing to help students, so I strongly urge my  colleagues to oppose the resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  from approximately 200 different organizations in opposition to this  resolution.                                                        May 8, 2023.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Democratic Leader, U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, Speaker       McCarthy, and Minority Leader Jeffries: The undersigned 261       organizations representing millions of students, workers,       people of color, veterans, people with disabilities,       consumers, and people of faith write in strong opposition to       bicameral efforts to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA)       to overturn President Biden's actions to pause student loan       payments and provide student debt relief for low-income and       working-class Americans continuing to recover from the deadly       COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating economic fallout.        In March, policymakers in the House and Senate unveiled a       CRA resolution to retroactively overturn the pause of federal       student loan payments and interest accrual, and President       Biden's debt relief plan. If successful, these CRA efforts       would immediately force tens of millions of borrowers into       abrupt and unplanned repayment with devastating effects,       including adding thousands of dollars of payments and       interest onto their loan balances. It will also force the       Department of Education to unwind loans forgiven under Public       Service Loan Forgiveness for first responders, nurses,       educators, servicemembers, and hundreds of thousands of other       public service workers across the country. These actions are       a clear attack on millions of the most vulnerable workers and       families who are still reeling from the devastating impact of       COVID-19.        The President's student debt relief program and extension       of the pause on student loan payments are both plainly legal       and desperately needed by the more than 43 million borrowers       drowning in nearly $1.76 trillion in student loan debt. While       they await the Supreme Court's decision regarding the fate of       debt relief, tens of millions of borrowers and their families       are relying on the federal student loan payment pause as they       continue to face the economic aftershocks of the pandemic,       including high inflation. Data show that the payment pause       has been of greatest help to student loan borrowers who were       in financial distress even before the pandemic and has       successfully provided relief for those borrowers more than       other COVID-19 assistance programs. The payment pause is       broadly supported among individuals with and without student       loan debt and has been recognized as necessary by the Trump       and Biden Administrations alike. Further, the U.S. Secretary       of Education's use of the HEROES Act of 2003 to pause student       loan repayment falls within a long line of waiver and       modification authority exercised by prior administrations       without the invocation of the CRA, including by his immediate       predecessor for precisely the same purpose.        Overturning the payment pause and forcing borrowers into       immediate repayment would have a devastating effect on       borrowers in every community. U.S. Department of Education       (ED) analysis demonstrates that a resumption of loan payments       without cancellation will spike delinquency and default rates       for the most financially vulnerable. Further, more than 26       million Americans applied for student debt cancellation in       the few weeks before it was shut down by partisan attacks in       the federal courts. This extraordinary engagement with       President Biden's cancellation plan is further evidence of       both the crushing burden this debt places on workers and       families from all walks of life and the promise of hope debt       cancellation offers for millions seeking an economic fresh       start.        Recent polling illustrates that cancellation enjoys broad       popular support, underscoring the massive impact of student       debt across families, communities, and entire generations of       Americans, and the reasons for the program's popularity are       clear. Cancellation will also benefit many Americans who have       suffered the most throughout the pandemic--with 90 percent of       relief dollars going to borrowers earning below $75,000 a       year. These are student loan borrowers who are low- and       middle-income, borrowers with disabilities, public servants       who face high educational costs and low wages, women and       Black and Latino/a borrowers who come from low-wealth       families unable to foot the bill for higher education       upfront, and many more. Cancellation will help prevent a wave  [[Page H3038]]       of defaults and delinquencies when repayment resumes and       ensure that these borrowers will be able to afford basics       like food, housing, and other necessities that pandemic-      related financial hardship would otherwise put out of reach.        The American people, the law, and the economic instability       of the present moment all emphasize the necessity of debt       cancellation and the continuation of the payment pause until       cancellation is realized. Policymakers now seeking to reverse       such critical relief through the CRA are ignoring the       economic needs of their own constituents and threatening our       nation's financial security. Congress should be acting to       improve the circumstances of the American people, not       attempting to thwart the President's efforts to ease the       financial pressure that so many are feeling.        For these reasons, we strongly oppose the efforts to       overturn this relief through the Congressional Review Act       (H.J. Res. 45/S.J. Res. 22) and we urge you to consider the       harmful impact they would have on the millions of American       people and families who are in need of student loan debt       relief.

First, I include in the Record letters from the American Federation  of Teachers, another letter from multiple unions including the National  Education Association, the AFL-CIO and AFSCME, a letter from Minority  Vets, a letter from UnidosUS and the National Urban League, a letter  from Third Way, a letter from the National Council of Nonprofits, and a  letter from 23 various medical organizations, all in opposition to the  legislation.                                American Federation of Teachers,                                                       May 22, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I strongly urge you       to reject H.J. Res. 45/S.J. Res. 22, a joint resolution       providing for congressional disapproval of the Biden       administration actions to support student loan borrowers that       were announced in August of last year.        This resolution would immediately force tens of millions of       borrowers into abrupt and unplanned repayment with       devastating effects, including adding thousands of dollars of       interest onto their loan balances. Proponents of the       resolution want you to believe that it is simply a method to       stop President Joe Biden's student debt cancellation of up to       $20,000 that would benefit 43 million borrowers, but the       implications are more severe. Passage of this resolution       would be particularly destructive for teachers, nurses,       servicemembers and firefighters eligible for Public Service       Loan Forgiveness.        This resolution would force the U.S. Department of       Education to unwind loans forgiven under Public Service Loan       Forgiveness for nurses, educators, servicemembers and       hundreds of thousands of other public service workers across       the country. Retroactively repealing months of the payment       pause initially authorized by the Trump administration would       have far greater implications than thwarting Biden's       cancellation plan. It would force teachers, veterans and       nurses who finally received Public Service Loan Forgiveness       to write a check back to the Department of Education. This       resolution would reinstate the debt of more than 150,000       public service workers. On the heels of the pandemic, forcing       a nurse to pay back debt that was legally forgiven under a       bipartisan law is cruel.        And the harm wouldn't stop there: More than 400,000       borrowers have received PSLF-qualifying payments under the       last payment pause of 2022, but this resolution would claw       back those benefits, setting back firefighters and educators'       eligibility for PSLF for many months.        The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on American       workers, many of whom were already struggling to make ends       meet.  [[Page H3040]]       Those workers' precarity and risk of delinquency on their       debt has severely worsened during the pandemic. Given the       long-term economic impacts of the pandemic, which continue to       drive workers out of public service, a permanent solution,       rather than a temporary deferment, is necessary.        And the law is clear: Student debt cancellation falls       squarely within the statutory authority Congress granted the       secretaIy in the HEROES Act. Cancellation will help ensure       that millions of people are not left in a ``worse position''       as to their loan payments due to the devastating COVID-19       pandemic.        Tens of millions of families are struggling under the yoke       of $1.7 trillion in student debt. They eagerly await the       breathing room that student debt relief would bring, and       those struggling to get by will benefit the most. The extra       consideration in debt cancellation for Pell recipients       focuses like a laser on people in need. Taking away relief       that has already been granted to borrowers--the moratorium on       payments and interest--while the legal challenge wends its       way through the courts, and retroactively making them pay       what they cannot afford, is cruel. These borrowers are       teachers, firefighters, nurses and so many other dedicated       workers. Their current student debt is a far greater burden       than the debt carried by those of us who went to college long       ago. This means they have little or no wealth to start a       family, buy a car or a house, or make other major life       decisions, and it undermines plans they responsibly made       based on the situation at the time.        Congress should be building on the Biden administration       actions, not undermining those actions. Throwing tens of       millions of student loan borrowers into chaos by       retroactively adding interest and missed payments to their       loan balances, while extending their student debt sentence,       would upend lives. That's the wrong decision. Congress must       oppose H.J. Res. 45/S.J. Res. 22.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,      President, American Federation of Teachers.                                   ____                                                       May 19, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our members, who       strengthen, restore, and sustain communities across the       nation, we urge you to vote against the Congressional Review       Act resolution (H.J. Res. 45/S.J. Res. 22) to overturn       President Biden's student-debt relief program.        For decades, our nation has strained under a student debt       crisis that holds our economy back and steals the dreams of       millions of Americans. This debt burden causes loan defaults       and drives up balances, delays marriages and the start of       families, and makes saving for the future impossible. Just as       significant as the financial fallout is how crushing student       loan debt is to the spirit. Nothing is quite as disheartening       as looking at a loan balance month after month that never       seems to diminish. For those who are closer than ever to a       life free from the albatross of student loan debt, the CRA       amounts to a direct attack on their hopes and dreams.        Overturning President Biden's debt relief program will lead       to a dramatic spike in economic hardship--particularly for       the most vulnerable borrowers. It would throw 43 million       borrowers across every state and congressional district back       into a fundamentally broken and chaotic student loan system       when they can least afford it. The CRA is especially       concerning because unwinding the payment pause--a pause which       previously garnered bipartisan support--could force borrowers       to repay tens of billions of dollars in payments and       interest. It would even reinstate nearly 157,000 loans       forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program,       because the payment pause provides accrual toward PSLF       without borrowers having to pay.        The U.S. Department of Education's analysis indicates that       resuming student loan payments without cancellation will lead       to an unprecedented increase in delinquency and default for       those who are most vulnerable. These include the borrowers       that President Biden's plan targets: those who earn less than       $75,000 a year. These borrowers make up 90 percent of the       would-be beneficiaries of the President's cancellation       program.        In the weeks before the debt relief plan was challenged in       court, nearly 26 million borrowers applied or were deemed       automatically eligible for the chance at debt relief and 16       million had their applications formally approved by the       Department of Education. Using the CRA to overturn this life-      changing debt relief is a cruel affront to everyone who was       anticipating an economic fresh start; this tactic also adds       another layer of worry just as borrowers await the U.S.       Supreme Court's decision.        CRA efforts to overturn the payment pause and the       President's debt relief plan are only the most recent attacks       on student loan borrowers. They seem to be a convenient       political pawn, in the midst of economic uncertainty and the       expiration of other critical benefit expansions for families       that were tied to the pandemic. At this difficult time,       Congress should be improving families' circumstances, not       thwarting the President's efforts to ease their financial       pressures.        The millions of workers our unions represent are grateful       for the difference that student loan relief has made in their       lives. Because their work in education, health care, public       safety, the Armed Forces, and every other public and private       sector field reaches a broad swath of Americans, our members       also know how much it has impacted everyday citizens. It has       allowed hard-working people to finally start saving up for       their first home or for the inevitable emergency they will       face. It has given parents the breathing room for their first       home or for the inevitable emergency they will face. It has       given parents the breathing room to begin squirreling away a       little money each month for retirement, or for their       children's college fund. It has enabled retirees who are       still repaying student loans to start planning the once-in-a-      lifetime trip or family reunion they have dreamed of for       years.        We know that most Americans understand the severity of the       student debt crisis and how it affects the people they love.       Even those without student debt do not want their children,       grandchildren, or other loved ones to struggle with it.       Please vote against the CRA to invigorate our economy,       increase families' financial security, and restore their       hope.            Sincerely,      Elizabeth H. Shuler,        President, American Federation of Labor and Congress of       Industrial Organizations.

Res. 45, a resolution under the Congressional Review       Act (CRA), would reverse the actions of the Department of       Education (ED) related to student loan debt. If enacted, it       would: (a) block President Biden's debt cancelation plan, (b)       retroactively undo the 7th extension of the loan payment       pause (Sept. 2022-Dec. 2022), causing millions of borrowers       to fall behind on their student loans, and (c) also likely       undo the 8th extension of the payment pause (which began in       Jan. 2023). Service members and veterans would suffer       adversely if the CRA were to pass.        Service members and veterans are disproportionately       affected by student debt and related financial crises:        1. Due to ineligibility, structural administrative burdens,       and awards inadequate to cover the full cost of education,       millions of veterans have student-loan debt despite the GI       Bill.        2. With regards to student loan debt, veterans are       struggling significantly more than others:        Veterans borrow more, so have more student debt.        The proportion of veterans with student debt has grown       while the overall proportion of borrowers in other       demographic groups has decreased.        Veterans default at a higher rate than non-veterans: 46       percent, (compared to 29 percent) before the pandemic.       According to the ED, default and delinquency rates increase       after periods of forbearance, so that rate will likely be       higher after the payment pause ends, leaving veterans       particularly vulnerable.        3. For-profit institutions (FPIs) have aggressively       targeted veterans, such that veterans attend FPIs at a higher       rate than non-veterans. Higher costs and lower quality has       left many veterans with debt and no degree.        4. Veterans have fared worse as a result of the pandemic       (e.g., 11.8 percent unemployment rate at its peak, compared       to an historic low of 3.1 percent before the pandemic).        5. Service members are laden by student loan debt too--      entering service not just with loan debt but because of it,       hoping for cancelation under the Public Service Loan       Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Using GAO data, in 2017 the       Consumer Finance Protection Board estimated that over 200,000       service members collectively owe more than $2.9 billion in       student loan debt.        Passage of the student loan CRA would harm service members       and veterans:        Under the CRA, progress toward debt cancelation under PSLF,       including  [[Page H3041]]       cancelation itself that borrowers achieved during the pause,       would be reversed. This outcome would be particularly       devastating for service members and veterans.        An estimated 46,320 service members would have $4.1 billion       of debt that was canceled through PSLF restored.        As many as 320,000 veterans could lose progress toward more       than $28 billion in cancelation toward PSLF.        A GAO report found that over 94 percent of service members       and Department of Defense employees who pursued PSLF were       denied relief. The CRA would magnify that institutional       failure.        Nearly 40 percent of veteran borrowers are Pell Grant       recipients, almost all of whom would be eligible for $20,000       in cancelation.        Student-debt relief has widespread support among veteran's       service organizations:        A broad coalition of veteran's advocacy groups submitted an       amicus brief in support of the Administration's debt relief       actions.                                   ____                                            National Urban League,                                                       May 15, 2023.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National Urban       League and UnidosUS (formerly known as the National Council       of La Raza), two historic civil rights organizations fighting       for economic security for Black and Latino communities and       other historically and systemically oppressed populations, we       write to share our opposition to the Congressional Review Act       resolutions H.J.Res. 45 and S.J.Res. 22, which would overturn       President Biden's actions to pause student loan payments and       provide student debt relief for low-income and working-class       people in America. As the people in our country continue to       recover from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating       economic fallout, it is vital that relief in the form of       student debt cancellation be enacted.        Communities of color were hit hardest by both the COVID-19       virus and its associated economic challenges due to systemic       barriers. Compared to their white counterparts, people of       color are 1.5 times more likely to get the virus and 2 times       more likely to require hospitalization. Economically, Black       and Latino workers are overrepresented in front-line jobs       that remained in person during shutdowns and that lacked       adequate paid time off to recover from illness and care for       sick family members. They continue to be overrepresented in       the individuals without access to affordable healthcare and       childcare. Following the start of the pandemic, 43 percent of       Black adults experienced a pay cut due to reduced hours or       work demand or were laid off either permanently or       temporarily. The most impacted group, 1 in 5 Latinas were       unemployed at the peak of shutdowns, not counting those who       exited the workforce altogether to become caretakers out of       necessity. Additionally, Black and Latino households were       also more likely to have food and housing insecurity, face       more adverse health issues related to COVID, and secure more       debt in conjunction with already accrued student loan debt       due to financial burden.        Meanwhile, at every level of educational attainment, Black       students are more likely to borrow--and borrow at higher       levels--than their white counterparts. Black college       graduates owe an average of $52,000 in student loan debt,       about $25,000 more debt than White college graduates.       Cancellation provides substantial relief to those unable to       repay debts because of inequalities in wealth and income that       particularly impact Black borrowers. 66 percent of Black       borrowers and 37 percent of Latinos owe more than originally       borrowed 12 years after starting college, compared to 30       percent white borrowers.        72 percent of Latino students take out loans to attend       college, and 67 percent carry educational debt. In a survey       of Latino students who began but did not complete college,       UnidosUS and the University of North Carolina's School of Law       found that those Latino students who grew up in economically       vulnerable communities see college debt as a financial burden       that can affect their family's financial security and       stability. Interviews with students revealed that the student       loan debt burden is causing worry and stress, impacting sleep       and quality of life.        The CRA Resolution introduced in March would overturn the       pause of federal student loan payments and interest accrual,       and President Biden's debt relief plan. This action would       abruptly force tens of millions of borrowers into repayment       and add thousands of dollars of interest onto their loan       balances, causing perilous financial consequences. It would       also require the Department of Education to unwind loans       forgiven under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for       nurses, educators, servicemembers, and public service workers       across the country. This is a direct attack on millions of       workers and families who are still reeling from the       devastating impacts of COVID-19, and would most brutally harm       communities of color, who not only have the highest amounts       of student debt, but are also over indexed in careers in       public service.        For these reasons, we strongly oppose the efforts to       overturn this relief through the Congressional Review Act       (H.J.Res. 45/S.J.Res. 22) and we urge you to consider the       damage they would have on the millions of people and families       in America who need student loan debt relief.            Sincerely,      National Urban League,      UnidosUS.                                   ____                Third Way Statement on Student Loan Pause CRA                            (By Lanae Erickson)         Washington, May 22, 2023.--Third Way released the following       statement from Lanae Erickson, Senior Vice President for       Social Policy, Education & Politics:        ``This week, the House will vote on a Congressional Review       Act (CRA) measure that would overturn the pause on student       loan repayment and interest accrual dating back to October       2022. Regardless of your stance on the Administration's debt       cancellation actions, voting in favor of this resolution       would be a slap in the face to borrowers--blindsiding them by       immediately rolling back eight months of interest benefits       they've already received and sticking them with higher       balances owed.        ``There's plenty Congress can do to fix the system and       prepare for a smooth return to repayment. This CRA does the       exact opposite, increasing debt and setting borrowers up to       fail. Members of the House should do right by borrowers and       vote against it.''                                   ____                                   National Council of Nonprofits,                                                       May 12, 2023.      Re Adverse impacts on government and charitable nonprofits           employees by using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to           roll back student loan payment pause.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy, and Leaders Schumer, Jeffries, and       McConnell: The National Council of Nonprofits (NCN) writes to       alert you to the unintended consequences to the Public       Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program of using the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) to roll back the Department of       Education's (Department) action to pause student loan       payments and force the Department to immediately reinstate       the monthly payment requirements for borrowers. While we take       no position on the student debt cancellation program, NCN       opposes S.J. Res. 22 and H.J. Res. 45 as currently written       because the measures would abruptly and retroactively deprive       PSLF participants of the benefits they have earned under the       program.        The presumed intended target of the CRA, as introduced, may       be President Biden's student debt cancellation plan; however,       the effort to disapprove the debt cancellation plan is also       coupled with the extended federal student loan payment pause.        Our concerns with the CRA as currently written can be       summarized in three points:        1. By disapproving the debt cancellation plan, Congress       effectively would be ending the payment pause retroactively       to the end of last year as well.        2. Such a retroactive cancellation of the ongoing federal       loan payment pause would automatically render all borrowers       90 days or more in arrears and render all borrowers out of       compliance concerning payment obligations, including for PSLF       purposes.        3. In passing the CRA, Congress would renege on its       bipartisan promise since 2007 to public servants working at       501(c)3) charitable nonprofits and in government.                            Clarifying Terminology         Confusion surrounds the current debates about ending       federal student loan debt because of the use of similar words       with distinct meanings. Permit us to provide some clarity:        Debt cancellation. In August 2022, President Biden       announced a one-time debt cancellation plan to cancel up to       $10,000 of qualifying federal student loan debt per borrower       with an additional $10,000 for Pell Grant recipients.       Litigation ensued to block the plan, and a final decision in       the case, now in the U.S. Supreme Court, is expected before       the end of June. No debt has been cancelled yet under the       plan.        Loan forgiveness. In 2007, Congress enacted the Public       Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF provides an       opportunity for borrowers to earn forgiveness after working       for 10 years in public service as an employee of a federal,       state, or local government or at a 501(c)(3) charitable       nonprofit and making 120 qualifying payments on their loans.       Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers       have shown strong support over the years to continue the       program, which was enacted under President Bush and       administered under Presidents Obama, Trump, and Biden.  [[Page H3042]]           Bipartisan pauses on federal student loan payments count towards                  eligibility for forgiveness under PSLF.         At the start of the pandemic, President Trump instituted a       payment pause on all federal student loan payments to provide       financial relief to borrowers. After President Trump renewed       the pause several times, President Biden continued the       practice. The last payment pause was set to expire on       December 31, 2022. Because of the pending litigation, the       student loan payment pause has been extended until either the       Department is permitted to implement the debt cancellation       program, or the litigation is resolved bt if the debt relief       program has not been implemented and the litigation has not       been resolved by June 30, 2023, then payments will resume 60       days after that.        Since President Trump first instituted the payment pause,       borrowers who work in public service have continued to       receive credit towards forgiveness for PSLF purposes,       provided they remained employed at an eligible employer.       President Biden has continued that policy and announced       before the last payment pause was set to expire on December       31 that borrowers are receiving credit toward forgiveness       under PSLF.        A retroactive cancellation of the payment pause would impose         significant hardship on nonprofit employees and employers.         Ongoing economic uncertainty and natural disasters plaguing       the country exacerbate additional stresses on and demand for       services by nonprofit staff. The student loan payment pause       has provided critical relief for nonprofit workers who are       often paid lower salaries and wages than for-profit       businesses due to a variety of factors, including government       grants and contracting restraints, the inability to increase       prices or charges for services despite increased costs, and       diminishing fund raising and private grant opportunities.       Competition for qualified workers is acutely felt by       nonprofits that cannot adjust salaries and wages as easily or       as quickly as the for-profit sector. An estimated four out of       five (79 percent) nonprofits identified salary competition as       a factor preventing them from filling job openings. Relief       from student loan payments and the promise of loan       forgiveness for continued public service have served to keep       many workers on the job in the face of these other       challenges.   The CRA would roll back the pause in student loan payments and have the     unintended consequence of disrupting the accumulation of credits                         towards PSLF forgiveness.         The CRA states that Congress ``disapproves'' the debt       cancellation plan. Because the current payment pause is an       extension of one that was previously set to expire and is now       tied to the ongoing lawsuit regarding the debt cancellation       plan, what happens under the CRA affects the ongoing payment       pause and, therefore, the accumulation of credits towards       PSLF forgiveness. Passage of the CRA would automatically       trigger payments that were paused beginning January 1, 2023,       and would force the Department to begin demanding payments       from millions of borrowers, including PSLF participants.       Consequently, borrowers could be on the hook for payments due       since December 31, 2022, possibly including interest. As a       result, more than 37 million borrowers could see unexpected       bills adding up to hundreds or thousands of dollars, plus       interest. Further, the CRA could operate to vitiate credits       towards forgiveness and any borrower who has earned       forgiveness since the beginning of the year could see that       forgiveness rescinded.        While NCN takes no position on the student debt       cancellation plan, the unintended consequences of rolling       back the student loan payment pause would have grave effects       on nonprofit workers and others earning forgiveness under       PSLF. At a time when nonprofits are facing a workforce       shortage, increased demands on services, and added burdens       caused by economic uncertainty and natural disasters, workers       must receive every benefit possible under the PSLF program.        The payment pause has provided essential financial relief       and reduced stress while allowing workers to continue to earn       forgiveness. Any rollback, unexpected financial load, and       confusion on PSLF status must be prevented.        We urge you to oppose the Senate Joint Resolution 22 and       House Joint Resolution 45 in their current form and to insist       that nonprofit workers and public servants receive the relief       they have diligently earned.        We stand ready to work with Members of Congress to ensure       that congressional promises to governmental and nonprofit       workers under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program are       respected and fulfilled.            Sincerely,                                         Tiffany Gourley Carter,                                                     Policy Counsel,      National Council of Nonprofits.                                   ____                                                      June 21, 2023.      Re: Patient community concerns about the detrimental impact           of policies included in HR 2868, the Association Health           Plans Act; HR 2813, the Self-Insurance Protection Act,           and HR 3799, the CHOICE Arrangement Act.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy and Leader Jeffries: On behalf of the       millions of patients and consumers across the country with       serious, acute and chronic health conditions, our       organizations urge you to oppose HR 2868, HR 2813, and HR       3799, which threaten access to quality, affordable healthcare       coverage.        The 23 undersigned organizations represent more than 120       million people living with a pre-existing condition in the       US. Collectively, we have a unique perspective on what       individuals and families need to prevent disease, cure       illness, and manage chronic health conditions. The diversity       of our organizations and the populations we serve enable us       to draw upon a wealth of knowledge and expertise that are       critical components of any discussion aimed at improving or       reforming our healthcare system.        Our organizations share three principles that we use to       help guide our work on healthcare to continue to develop,       improve upon, or defend the programs and services our       communities need to live longer, healthier lives. These       principles state that healthcare must be adequate,       affordable, and accessible.        With these principles at the forefront, we write to convey       our concerns about three bills that have recently been moved       out of the Rules Committee and will soon be considered on the       House floor: HR 2868, the Association Health Plans Act; HR       2813, the Self-Insurance Protection Act, and HR 3799, the       CHOICE Arrangement Act. In the report ``Under-covered: How       `Insurance-Like' Products Are Leaving Patients Exposed,''       many of our organizations documented our concerns with health       insurance products that are not required to comply with the       patient protections enacted in the Affordable Care Act. We       are concerned that policies included in the legislation       considered today would decrease the number of consumers       enrolled in comprehensive health insurance plans and threaten       access to quality, affordable healthcare for the patients and       consumers we represent.                 H.R. 2868, the Association Health Plans Act         Current law allows employers to work together to form a       multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) to provide       certain benefits to their employees. An Association Health       Plan (AHP)--a health benefit plan sponsored by an employer-      based association--is one type of MEWA.        Some AHPs can be classified as large employers and are       therefore not subject to critical patient protections and       state insurance regulations. This can pose risks to employers       and their employees. The track record of AHPs and MEWAs in       reliably providing comprehensive coverage for consumers is       quite poor. According to state insurance regulators, these       entities have a long history of fraud and ``[making] money at       the expense of their participants.'' State insurance       regulators also say AHPs ``have been notoriously prone to       insolvencies.''        AHPs are not required to provide comprehensive coverage or       cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB). AHPs may also       charge higher premiums based on occupation (a loophole that       allows discrimination based on gender and other factors) or       even health status in some cases. As a result, these plans       expose enrollees to high financial and health risks and       exacerbate rural and/or regional health disparities.       Meanwhile, marketing these products can be confusing or       misleading and can cause individuals to enroll in plans that       do not align with their medical needs or expectations.        AHPs also pose risks to the many consumers who do not       enroll in them. AHPs can siphon away healthy individuals from       state individual and small-group markets by leveraging the       regulatory advantages they enjoy. This leaves the individual       and small group markets smaller and with a larger proportion       of individuals with pre-existing conditions, leading to       higher premiums and fewer plan choices for those who depend       on those markets to access comprehensive coverage.        Despite the harm AHPs can pose to those who enroll in them       as well as those who remain in comprehensive insurance plans,       the Association Health Plans Act would promote additional       enrollment in AHPs for groups that cannot use them today. We       believe additional enrollment in AHPs by small employers and       the self-employed will weaken patient and consumer       protections and lead to higher costs for consumers who rely       on comprehensive insurance.                 H.R. 2813, the Self-Insurance Protection Act         Stop-loss insurance is intended to be used as a tool to       protect a health plan sponsor--typically an employer--from       unpredictably high losses due to unexpected claims. As such,       it can be an important tool to promote stability for sponsors       of health insurance plans, particularly sponsors providing       coverage for small numbers of insured individuals, whose       unique health needs sometimes necessitate very expensive       health services.        We are concerned that H.R. 2813 would remove an important       level of consumer and patient protection by eliminating the       ability of states to exercise oversight of stop-loss plans.       State insurance commissioners play an important role in the       health insurance marketplace. Removing states' ability to       regulate stop-loss coverage would lead to less oversight of       these plans, which would increase the likelihood of       misleading marketing and other fraudulent practices that       would prove harmful to employers purchasing stop-loss       coverage as well as their employees.  [[Page H3043]]                         H.R. 3799, the CHOICE Arrangement Act         In lieu of offering a traditional group health plan,       employers may provide contributions, on a pre-tax basis, to       their employees to subsidize the direct purchase of       individual market health coverage.        The choice to offer these individual coverage health       reimbursement arrangements (ICHRAs) is available to employers       right now, and has been for several years. Yet interest       appears to be modest. It is possible take-up has been limited       simply because the arrangement is still relatively new, and       enrollment may expand with time. It is also possible that,       for employers, the value proposition of ICHRAs is less than       some anticipated. We note that commonly cited benefits of       ICHRAs--including predictable costs for employers and       multiple plan options for employees--can be achieved through       traditional employer coverage mechanisms and benefit designs.        Troublingly, however, ICHRAs have introduced new risks,       both for workers with employer coverage and for consumers who       rely on the individual market. ICHRAs provide employers an       opportunity to reduce their costs by moving older and sicker       workers off of job-based coverage and into the individual       market. These shifts potentially disrupt access to care for       employees and make the individual market risk pool more       expensive to insure, raising premiums.        The regulatory framework governing ICHRAs recognizes these       dangers and includes provisions to mitigate them. For       example, to reduce the ability of employers to offer ICHRAs       selectively to only their sicker employees, federal rules       require employers to treat all members of a particular class       of workers the same for purposes of ICHRA eligibility. Still,       the leeway given to employers to tailor these classifications       is substantial, and it allows employers to create subgroups       of workers based on characteristics that are proxies for       health status. The rules also lack safeguards that would       prevent an employer from using administrative loopholes to       segment its workforce for ICHRA purposes based on otherwise       impermissible factors. For these reasons, we have encouraged       federal regulators to collect and publish data that would       shed light on how employers are using these arrangements and       the effectiveness of the nondiscrimination guardrails.        Against this backdrop, H.R. 3799 would create ``custom       health option and individual care expense'' (CHOICE)       arrangements, a new tax-advantaged arrangement similar to but       apparently legally distinct from ICHRAs. To the extent H.R.       3799 is intended merely to codify the established regulatory       framework for ICHRAs, we believe doing so is unwarranted at       this time. Moreover, the bill's convoluted approach is likely       to increase confusion and uncertainty.        Of additional concern, it appears H.R. 3799 incorporates       the ICHRA rules selectively, in a manner that could intensify       the risks posed by these arrangements. As we observed above,       the nondiscrimination provisions in the existing regulatory       framework are essential but insufficient to prevent employers       from using ICHRAs to shift higher-cost workers to the       individual market. H.R. 3799 does nothing to address these       shortcomings. On the contrary, it would omit from statute key       protections designed to safeguard consumers and the       individual insurance market from the downsides of these       arrangements.                                  Conclusion         We urge lawmakers to reject the three bills referenced       above and, instead, partner with organizations like ours to       identify opportunities to expand affordable, accessible, and       adequate healthcare coverage for patients.

Komen, The       AIDS Institute, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, there are many challenges we have  in higher education that demand our attention: the rising cost of  college, student debt crisis, the eroded value of the Pell grant,  student mental health issues, and the list goes on.   Instead, we are addressing this resolution which will hurt millions  of student borrowers and their families; an average of about 100,000 in  each of our districts.   Many of our colleagues on the other side have justified the  resolution by arguing that we cannot afford the plan, yet ignoring that  we were willing to charge taxpayers $1.9 trillion for a tax package a  few years ago that overwhelmingly benefited the top 1 percent and  corporations. Now they are unwilling to spend much less than that to  help students pay for their education.   We should be passing proposals that meaningfully support borrowers  and make college more affordable for current and future students. The  bottom line is that we have a responsibility to strengthen support for  those seeking college degrees. Those who want a degree should be able  to access that opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the proposal, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
