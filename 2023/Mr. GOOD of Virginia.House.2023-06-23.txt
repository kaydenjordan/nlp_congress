 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  100th birthday of Mrs. Ruth Yarbrough of Dry Fork, Virginia.   Mrs. Yarbrough was born on July Fourth, 1923, in Dry Fork, where she  continues to be an active member of her Pittsylvania County community.   She is the mother of four sons and has been blessed with an abundance  of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   While raising her four sons, Mrs. Yarbrough accompanied her children  to their school, Stony Mill Elementary School, so frequently that the  principal offered her a job as a dietician. She held that position for  over 30 years.   Mrs. Yarbrough lives a vigorous life, still living independently and  hosting many visitors in her home. She is steadfast in her faith in God  and is currently serving as a deaconess at Guildfield Baptist Church.   We can all learn from the wisdom that Mrs. Yarbrough graciously  shares, often stating that the secret to longevity is to ``love the  Lord, be nice to others, and smile.''   I am honored to represent such outstanding constituents like Mrs.  Yarbrough. Please join me in celebrating Mrs. Yarbrough's birthday and  the long-lasting legacy that she continues to hold.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Davidson for his  leadership on trying to correct this egregious policy coming from the  Biden administration.   The American people are suffering today. They are suffering from  Bidenflation, 40-year high inflation. They are suffering under higher  grocery prices. They are suffering under high gas prices, higher  utility energy prices, all as a result of this President's policies.   They are suffering under the massive inflation that has caused  housing prices to rise, and then we have complicated that with raising  interest rates to make homeownership out of reach for most Americans.   Here comes the Biden administration to the rescue. They are going to  charge most Americans higher mortgage fees when they go to borrow to  buy a home as a result of having good credit.   I worked in the lending industry for 17 years. Lending prices and  fees are based on credit. They are based on stability. They are based  on ability. They are based on the loan to value, the amount of loan  that you take relative to the value of the home.   The lending industry knows what they are doing. They want to make  every possible loan they can make, and they want to price it  appropriately, according to the risk.   However, what this does, what we are trying to overturn here, what  the Biden administration wants to do, is reward or incentivize bad  behavior.  [[Page H3119]]    Credit is a reflection of good behavior. There is not even really a  correlation between income and credit. There are many high-income  individuals who borrow more than they can afford or have bad character  demonstrated in their credit. There are many low-income individuals who  have outstanding character, outstanding credit history because they do  the right thing.   Now, what the Biden administration wants to do is to penalize them  and to subsidize that bad credit on the backs of folks who have good  credit, of course.   I thank my friend from Ohio, Mr. Davidson, for his leadership on  this, his efforts to overturn this terrible policy. It is socialist and  un-American, and it is simply wrong. I thank him for his leadership.
