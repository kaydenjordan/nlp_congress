 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 51, the Washington,  D.C. Admission Act, which would end centuries of taxation without  representation and make Washington, D.C., the 51st State.    And nobody is giving back anything. Washington, D.C., is the home to  more Americans than two States, and more than 46 percent of its 700,000  residents are Black.   Make no mistake, race underlies every argument against D.C.  statehood, and denying its citizens equal participation and  representation is a racial, democratic, and economic injustice we  cannot tolerate.   It must be acknowledged that the chance to right these wrongs with  today's vote would not be possible without my good friend, Eleanor  Holmes Norton. We were both elected at the same time, and she has been  dogged and consistent every single year since then in her fight for  this bill and D.C. statehood.   I am so pleased to join my friend in today's milestone vote, and I am  hopeful that Eleanor's long effort will finally give D.C. the rights  they deserve.  [[Page H2540]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding to me on  this important issue.   I rise to override the President's veto of H.J. Res. 76, which undoes  a Secretary DeVos rule that would make it nearly impossible for  veterans and student borrowers defrauded by their schools to obtain  financial relief.   Congress voted, on a bipartisan basis, to reject Secretary DeVos'  borrower defense rule, which only cancels 3 percent of the student  loans resulting from school misconduct, keeping 97 percent of our  veterans and student borrowers drowning in debt they only incurred due  to fraud and from which they may never recover.   If Secretary DeVos' efforts to prioritize profit over education are  allowed to stand, then the for-profit industry will continue to do what  it always has: exploit veterans, student borrowers, and those trying to  better their lives and support their families by obtaining an  education.   This is a fight with which I am deeply familiar. This Congress, the  House Financial Services Committee held two hearings examining the  student loan crisis and approved three bills that will provide strong  student borrower protections, including for those harmed by for-profit  colleges. And during this COVID-19 crisis, I have fought to provide up  to $10,000 of relief for private student loan borrowers, and I continue  to fight to protect student loan borrowers who should not have to deal  with debt collections, negative credit reporting, late fees, and  penalties while dealing with this pandemic.   With over 200,000 pending borrower defense applications for loan  relief, these students desperately need and deserve our help.   I urge my colleagues to support veterans and student borrowers by  overriding the President's veto of H.J. Res. 76.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call  up the bill (H.R. 5332) to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to  ensure that consumer reporting agencies are providing fair and accurate  information reporting in consumer reports, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on H.R. 5332 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your  Credit Score Act of 2020.   I would like the thank Representative Gottheimer, the bill's sponsor,  for all of his hard work and leadership on this important and  bipartisan legislation. He worked extensively for most of last year to  seek the input and support of our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, making improvements along the way.  [[Page H2562]]    Our credit reporting system is badly broken, and consumers have  little recourse. It should be no surprise that consumer complaints  regarding credit reporting errors and failed attempts to fix these  errors are consistently a top complaint submitted to the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission. This  demonstrates that millions of consumers are frustrated with the current  system and need our help.   H.R. 5332 would direct the nationwide consumer reporting agencies to  create a streamlined, single online portal for consumers to have easy  access to free credit reports, credit scores, dispute errors, and place  security freezes.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), author of this bill and  a member of the Committee on Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I would inquire through the Chair if my  [[Page H2567]]  colleague has any remaining speakers on his side.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 17 years since major reform  legislation to address common problems with credit reporting has been  enacted into law. To that end, I am pleased that, earlier this year,  the House passed H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting  Enhancement, Disclosure, Innovation, and Transparency Act.   Representative Gottheimer's bipartisan bill complements those efforts  to ensure we have a well-functioning credit reporting system that is  streamlined and easy to use and that better protects the data of all  consumers.   Republicans were in charge when Equifax exposed sensitive data of 150  million Americans. What was their response? Nothing.   Earlier this year, the House passed the Comprehensive CREDIT Act to  overhaul our broken credit reporting system and enhance cybersecurity  of the credit reporting bureaus. Republicans voted no.   Representative Gottheimer offered this bill that would strengthen  cybersecurity of Equifax and other credit bureaus, and now Republicans  are saying no.   We have some Republicans who oppose giving the CFPB expanded  authority, although I would note Ranking Member McHenry introduced H.R.  3821 that would do just that, giving the CFPB authority of  cybersecurity for the credit bureaus. The bill before us would do the  same.   I would urge Republicans to reconsider their opposition to the bill.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this commonsense bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record support for this bill from the  Americans for Financial Reform, the National Consumer Law Center,  Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Reports,  National Association of Consumer Advocates, World Privacy Forum, and  also the National Association of Realtors.                                                     June 23, 2020.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: The undersigned consumer       organizations write to support H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your       Credit Score Act of 2019 (Gottheimer). This bill will address       serious problems in the credit reporting system and empower       consumers by providing them with much greater access to and       control over their own information.        Credit reports and credit scores play a huge role in       determining a consumer's financial health. Not only do they       determine a consumer's ability to obtain credit at a fair       price, but they are used by many other sectors--insurance       companies, landlords and even employers. Despite their       importance, credit reports are also full of errors, which can       cost a consumer thousands of dollars in higher-priced credit,       or worse yet, result in the denial of a job, insurance       coverage, an apartment rental, or the ability to open a small       business or buy a house. The Federal Trade Commission's       definitive study showed that 21% of consumers had verified       errors in their credit reports, 13% had errors that affected       their credit scores, and 5% had errors serious enough to       cause them to be denied or pay more for credit.        Trying to fix these errors can be a Kafka-esque nightmare       in which the Big Three nationwide consumer reporting agencies       (CRAs)--Equifax, Experian and TransUnion--consistently favor       the side of the creditor or debt collector (``the       furnisher'') over the consumer. As documented in NCLC's       report Automated lniustice Redux (2019), some of the most       serious problems include consumers having their credit files       ``mixed'' with the wrong person, being unable to remove       negative information even after court judgments in their       favor, the after-effects of identity theft when CRAs don't       believe the victim, and being labeled as dead when they are       alive and breathing. The report also documents the massive       number of credit and consumer reporting complaints to the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), over 380,000       since July 2011, which is often the top category of       complaints to the CFPB.        The irony of these problems is that credit reports consist       of our information. Yet consumers are only entitled to free       access to this information once a year and in certain other       limited situations, despite the fact that the Big Three       nationwide CRAs are making tens of millions selling our       financial data. Also, consumers are not entitled to our own       credit scores for free, while these same scores are being       sold to creditors and others for hefty profits.        Last, but not least, there are serious issues with data       security at the nationwide CRAs, of the type that led to the       massive Equifax data breach in 2017. These data security       issues have not yet been adequately addressed.        The Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2019 would address       these issues by:        Fixing the broken system for credit reporting disputes by       (1) creating a CFPB ombudsperson that will have the power to       resolve persistent errors when CRAs don't fix them properly,       and to make referrels to the Office of Supervision or the       Office of Enforcement for supevisory or enforcement action       when CRAs don't comply with their disput investigation       reponsibilities and (2) requiring CRAs to dedicate sufficient       resources and provide proper training to personnel who handle       disputes.        Giving consumers the tools they need to access their       rights, understand their creditworthiness, and control their       financial destinies by (1) giving consumers the right to       unlimited free credit reports and free credit scores online;       (2) requiring the Big Three nationwide CRAs to create a       simple, easy-to-use portal tool to access online credit       reports and credit scores, as well to exercise other       important rights such as placing a security freeze,       initiating a dispute, and opting out of prescreening (i.e.,       the use of credit report information to generate offers of       credit).        Improving credit reporting accuracy by (2) requiring CRAs       to conduct periodic audits to check for accuracy and (2)       mandating that Big Three nationwide CRAs use all 9 digits of       the consumer's Social Security number when matching       information from a lender to a consumer's file, thus       preventing mixed files, which are one of the worst types of       errors.        Improving data security for credit reports by giving the       CFPB the authority to write rules under the Gramm-Leach-      Bliley Act to govern the Big Three nationwide CRAs.        Give consumers a tool to compel CRAs to fix a credit report       by providing them with a right to seek injunctive relief so       that a court could order a CRA to correct an error or       otherwise follow the law.        There are a number of other important reforms in the bill,       such as giving consumers the right to opt out of the selling       or sharing of information about them that does not fall into       the FCRA's current definition of ``consumer report'' and       creating a comprehensive registry of all consumer reporting       agencies.        The above reforms are urgently needed in order to ensure       that consumers are treated fairly by the credit reporting       system and that they have the access and control that they       should be entitled to. Thus, we support the Protecting Your       Credit Score Act of 2019 an look forward to working with you       to swiftly enact it into law.        Thank you for your attention. If you have any questions       about this letter, please contact Chi Chi Wu ([email protected])       at (617) 542-8010.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform,      National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income       clients),      Consumer Action,      Consumer Federation of America,      Consumer Reports,      National Association of Consumer Advocates,      USPIRG,      World Privacy Forum.                                   ____                                 National Association of Realtors,                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2020.      Hon. Josh Gottheimer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Gottheimer: On behalf of the 1.4       million members of the National Association of       REALTORS (NAR), I am pleased to support several       provisions of H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score Act       of 2020.        NAR has a long history of involvement in issues concerning       the use and disclosure of consumer credit data. Nearly 90       percent of home sales are financed, and a borrower's credit       report and credit score form a critical gateway to obtaining       a mortgage. Unfortunately, inaccurate credit reports and       unfair credit reporting methods raise the cost to borrow and/      or limit access to mortgage credit for many prospective       borrowers.        REALTORS believe that access to free credit       scores, transparency in the reporting process and use of       consumer credit information, high standards for vetting       credit information, and a reliable method for contesting and       correcting inaccurate information are critical to a vibrant       housing market and economy. To this end, NAR applauds your       efforts in H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of       2020. We are particularly supportive of sections two through       six, which reflect NAR's principles on credit reporting.       While NAR has no position on the primary regulator of the       CRAs, we appreciate your efforts in clarifying that important       point.        Creditor and consumer confidence are critical in the home       financing process, and our nation's housing market and       overall economy benefit tremendously from balanced financial       regulation and appropriate consumer protection.       REALTORS thank you for your diligent work to       improve the accuracy and accountability of consumer credit       information.            Sincerely,                                                    Vince Malta,                                2020 President, National Association                                             of REALTORS.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 90) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency relating to  ``Community Reinvestment Act Regulations'', and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on H.J. Res. 90 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapproval to nullify the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency's rule undermining the Community  Reinvestment Act.   I introduced this resolution with our Consumer Protection and  Financial Institutions Subcommittee chair, Representative Meeks, and I  am proud we are joined by 70 other Members who have cosponsored the  resolution.   The Community Reinvestment Act is a civil rights act. It is a law  enacted in 1977 to prevent the discriminatory practice of redlining, in  which banks discriminate against prospective customers in nearby  neighborhoods, often based on their racial or ethnic background. The  law requires banks to invest and lend responsibly in low- and moderate- income communities where they are chartered.   Unfortunately, implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act has  not been robust. Today, 98 percent of the banks routinely pass their  Community Reinvestment Act exams. However, research has shown that more  than 60 metro areas across the country are now experiencing modern-day  redlining today. These findings clearly demonstrate the need to  strengthen the implementation of the law. Unfortunately, the OCC's rule  would do the opposite.   Despite the warnings of a wide range of stakeholders, former  Comptroller Otting rushed to finalize this rule in his final days on  the job. So, without the support--without the support--of the Federal  Reserve or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the other banking  regulators were responsible for enforcing the law.   Mr. Otting appears to have been determined to undermine the Community  Reinvestment Act ever since the law complicated his efforts to quickly  obtain regulatory approval for OneWest Bank, a bank that he ran with  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, to merge with another bank in 2015.   I am deeply concerned that the OCC's final rule will harm low-income  and minority communities that are disproportionately suffering during  this crisis, effectively turning the Community Reinvestment Act into  the community disinvestment act.   If this resolution is not adopted, we will have different rules for  different banks, leading to regulatory arbitrage and a race to the  bottom of weaker standards that will only hurt the people the law is  intended to help.   Notably, the OCC rule was adopted with insufficient and incomplete  data, and it incentivizes large deals at the expense of smaller and  more continuous financial transactions that truly benefit LMI  communities.   For example, the OCC final rule allows CRA credit to be given for  activities in LMI-qualified opportunity zones, but the rule does not  ensure that these activities promote community development that  includes affordable housing or small business economic development.  This can lead to the unacceptable result of banks receiving CRA funding  for building luxury housing in opportunity zones, providing no direct  benefit to LMI communities.   Additionally, the OCC concedes it does not have all the data it needs  to properly implement its new CRA framework, with the rules stating  that the OCC will need to issue yet another notice of proposed  rulemaking in the future to help set specific benchmarks, thresholds,  and minimums. It doesn't speak highly of a rule when the office says it  is half baked.   A wide range of stakeholders have criticized OCC's efforts. For  example, a group of civil rights and consumer groups issued a statement  noting: ``The new OCC rules stick with an overly simplistic metrics  system that creates a loophole for banks to exploit, allowing them to  get a passing CRA rating by making investments in communities where  they can reap the largest rewards, while leaving too many credit needs  unmet for underserved consumers and neighbors.''   During these difficult times, communities across the country have  taken to the streets to demand justice and to tell their elected  officials that they can no longer ignore the needs of communities of  color. In a letter supporting this resolution from various  organizations led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights and National Community Reinvestment Coalition, they wrote: ``In  the weeks since the OCC finalized its rule, our Nation has been facing  a long overdue reckoning with our troubled legacy of racial and ethnic  discrimination. . . . Now is certainly not the time to weaken the most  important civil rights laws we have at our disposal to correct those  disparities.''   Congress must block any effort by the Trump administration to weaken  our civil rights laws and send a strong message to Federal regulators  that they should be doing all they can during this pandemic to help,  not hurt, low- and moderate-income communities, and especially  communities of color.   By passing this resolution, Congress will block the OCC's harmful  rule so that, once the pandemic passes, banking regulators can renew  efforts to collaborate, modernize, and strengthen the Community  Reinvestment Act with a new joint rulemaking that truly benefits the  community the law was intended to help.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to vote ``yes'' on  H.J. Res. 90.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions and the coauthor of this  bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez), who is also a member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), a member of the Financial Services Committee.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, I have additional speakers.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, if Mr. McHenry has no more speakers, I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, before I move into my closing, I would  like to correct Mr. McHenry, who said the FDIC approved the OCC CRA  rule this week. That is not correct. My staff just called the FDIC to  confirm that they did not approve the rule.    I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record multiple letters from dozens  of consumers, community and civil rights groups in support of H.J. Res.  90.          Chief Counsel's Office, Office of the Comptroller of the             Currency,                                                    Washington, DC.      Attention: Comment Processing         We are writing to oppose the Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of Comptroller of the       Currency's (OCC) proposed changes that would seriously weaken       the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) The U.S. Conference of       Mayors has strong policy supporting the CRA. The law was       passed in 1977 to end redlining, and to meet the credit needs       of communities where banks do business. Discrimination in       lending still exists.        But the FDIC and OCC proposed changes would make the banks       less accountable to their communities through complex and       confusing performance measures on CRA exams while       oversimplifying how bank's performances to local needs are       measured. Moreover, public input into the process will be       difficult and limited. This will result in significantly       fewer loans, investments and services to communities most in       need of more credit and capital.        The CRA has been of enormous benefit to low- and -moderate       income Americans. For example, since 1996, CRA-covered banks       issued more than 27 million small business loans in low-and       moderate-income tracts, totaling $1.093 trillion, and $1.076       trillion in community development loans that support       affordable housing and economic development projects       benefitting low-and moderate-income communities.        While such results are very good, the proposed rule will       make it all but impossible to continue such impressive       results. Moreover, much more can be achieved by regulations       that modernize the CRA to take into account changes in the       banking industry and the economy. For example, independent       mortgage companies not covered by CRA make more than 50       percent of the home mortgages in our nation. If anything, the       CRA should be strengthened to reflect changing demographics       and changes in the financial industry, and not weaken the CRA       as the proposed rule would do. We strongly encourage you to       reconsider a proposed rule, and look to modernizing CRA that       will truly benefit low and moderate income citizens.

CRC and CA Groups Support H.J. Res. 90         Dear Speaker Pelosi, The California Reinvestment Coalition       (CRC) and our member organizations and allies write in strong       support of H.J. Res. 90, the Congressional Review Act       Resolution to reverse the harmful rule recently finalized by       the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which       would gut the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Please find       following a letter from over sixty (60) California based and       California servicing organizations in support of the       Resolution.        The California Reinvestment Coalition builds an inclusive       and fair economy that meets the needs of communities of color       and low-income communities by ensuring that banks and other       corporations invest and conduct business in our communities       in a just and equitable manner.        The CRA is a critical piece of civil rights legislation       that has worked to fight historic and continuing redlining       practices, and to bring much needed lending and investment       into low-income communities of color. The CRA encourages       banks to help meet local community credit needs by creating       opportunities for homeownership, small business ownership,       job creation, financial capability, and affordable housing       and community development in neighborhoods that have been       otherwise excluded from the financial mainstream and the       American dream.        The OCC's harmful rule will reverse these gains by       substantially lowering the bar and enabling banks to get       passing grades through activities that are further and       further removed from low-income communities, homeowners,       tenants and small businesses. The OCC takes this damaging       action during a pandemic that has had a disproportionate       impact on the very communities meant to benefit from CRA.        We urge all members of Congress to co-sponsor and vote in       favor of this important resolution. Defending civil rights       and protecting communities ravaged by redlining and systemic       racism has never been more important.        Thank you for your concern regarding these issues and your       consideration of our views.            Very Truly Yours,                                                       Kevin Stein,                                                   Deputy Director.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: We, the undersigned organizations,       write to express our strong support for H.J. Res. 90, a       Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that will       nullify a rulemaking by the Office of the Comptroller of the       Currency (OCC) that, if allowed to stand, would drastically       undermine one of our nation's most important civil rights       laws, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA).        Enacted in 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has       been vital in fighting redlining, a practice that       systematically--and for decades, as a matter of federal       policy--shut neighborhoods of color and lower-income       communities out from home loans and other essential financial       services. The CRA requires banks to undertake reasonable       efforts to lend to and invest in all of the neighborhoods in       areas where they do business. The law has helped to spur       increased investments in formerly-redlined communities. It       did not, however, prevent non-bank lenders (who are not       subject to the CRA) from flooding communities of color with       toxic subprime mortgages in the years before the 2008 crisis;       and research shows that racial disparities in lending--which       cannot be explained away by differences in credit scores--      persist to this day.        It is clear that the CRA needs to be modernized and       strengthened in order to fulfill its original purpose. But in       January, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation (FDIC) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking       (NPRM) that would instead significantly weaken the CRA. The       agencies proposed new overly simplistic metrics system that       would make it far easier for banks to pass their CRA exams by       making large investments in communities where they can reap       the largest rewards, rather than carefully-targeted, smaller       investments in underserved consumers and neighborhoods.        Even before the NPRM was published, a wide range of       stakeholders weighed in with both the OCC and FDIC to raise       concerns and to ask for more data justifying the changes.       Those concerns were not addressed, and the data was never       released. By the time the NPRM was published, the United       States and the world were just beginning to learn about the       growing threat posed by a dangerous new respiratory virus. In       the coming weeks, it became clear that the virus had not been       contained, and it spread rapidly to multiple countries       including the United States. As stakeholders and the public       began devoting more and more resources and attention to the       health, social, and economic fallout of the growing pandemic,       and many urged the OCC and FDIC to temporarily suspend       rulemaking not related to COVID-19, the agencies continued       plowing ahead, only agreeing to a one-month extension for       comments.        In the days before the deadline for comments on the rule,       it had become clear that COVID-19 was proving fatal to       communities  [[Page H2578]]       of color--the very communities the CRA was intended to help--      at a rate several times higher than the population at large;       the U.S. Surgeon General warned the public to prepare for       ``our 9/11 moment,'' and models predicted 100,000 or more       deaths in the United States alone. Only 41 days after the       comment period ended, and even though only a minority of       commenters voiced support for the new framework, the OCC       rushed through a final rule that left it largely intact. The       FDIC, to its credit, declined to finalize its version of the       rule at this time.        In the weeks since the OCC finalized its rule, our nation       has been facing a long-overdue reckoning with our troubled       legacy of racial and ethnic discrimination. While much of the       conversation has rightly been focused on police brutality and       the impact of over-policing in communities of color, this       conversation is inexorably tied to the lasting economic,       social, and legal legacy of redlining and other forms of       racial discrimination.        We will not succeed in addressing issues surrounding law       enforcement in communities of color without also addressing       decades of underinvestment in housing, employment, education,       health care, transportation, and other factors that, to this       day, have contributed to the longstanding disparities that       are once again coming to light. Now is certainly not the time       to weaken the most important civil rights laws we have at our       disposal to correct those disparities.        As such, we urge Congress to support H.J. Res. 90, to       overturn the OCC's regulatory attack on the Community       Reinvestment Act. Thank you for your consideration.

House of Representatives,       U.S. Capitol,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The Center for Responsible Lending       writes to express our strong support for H.J. Res. 90, a       Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that will       invalidate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency       (OCC) final rule on the Community Reinvestment Act.        The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) was one in a       series of landmark civil rights legislation and is a critical       tool to help our nation work toward overcoming the legacy of       redlining. Today's racial wealth gap and lending disparities       are in large part the result of decades of government       policies and practices that enabled the redlining of       communities of color for most of the 20th century. In the       post-Depression era, federal policies that created housing       opportunities for returning veterans and their families       explicitly excluded people of color from the benefits of       government-supported housing programs. Among these programs       were public housing, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation       (HOLC), and mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing       Administration (FHA). Not only did this redlining segregate       residential neighborhoods across the United States, but it       granted whites the ability to build wealth through       homeownership while denying equal opportunities for families       of color to build similar home equity over the same period.       The inequities that result from these discriminatory programs       are part of the injustices that today's people led protests       are demanding are addressed.        The CRA imposes continuing and affirmative obligations on       banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities       in which they are chartered and continues to be an important       tool for fostering access to credit for these communities       today. The law has urged banks to more actively lend in LMI       areas; it has also played a key role in ensuring bank       participation in community revitalization efforts across the       country.        Despite the importance of CRA and the community investment       it has spurred, CRA rules must be strengthened. The CRA as       applied has not done nearly enough to revitalize previously       redlined areas and has not made a substantial dent in the       lagging homeownership rate for people of color. The white       homeownership rate is 73.7% while the rate is 44% and 48.9%       for Black and Latino borrowers respectively. Additionally,       bank lending in LMI communities and communities of color has       declined dramatically since the Great Recession. And existing       disparities will be further perpetuated in the face of the       COVID-19 global public health and economic crisis.        Unfortunately, the OCC decided to act unilaterally--without       the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation--to issue a structurally flawed final rule that       weakens the CRA and will harm low- and moderate-communities       and communities of color. Rather than postpone rulemaking to       focus on the devastating economic crisis caused by the COVID-      19 health pandemic, the OCC issued the rule a mere six weeks       after the closing of the comment period on its proposed rule       despite broad requests for delay from community groups, civil       rights and consumer organizations, and industry. The OCC       acknowledged in the preamble to the final rule that most of       the comments disagreed with the proposal's approach. Yet, the       OCC decided to side with the minority of comments in support       of the proposed rule. The OCC's rule will harm the       communities most adversely affected by the current crisis,       including many families that were hardest hit by the Great       Recession and have yet to recover.        The final rule imposes an overly simplistic evaluation       measure that fails to ensure that local banking needs are       met, and sanctions bank redlining. The rule overvalues the       dollar amount of CRA activities in comparison to the quality       of such activities and allows banks to earn more credit for       easier and larger investments in communities from which they       can get the highest return. Indeed, the rule permits banks to       ignore 20% of their assessment areas and still pass,       resulting in unchecked neighborhood disinvestment and       redlining. The rule also disincentives investment in LMI       neighborhoods and communities of color. It incentivizes       activities and investments that do not ``primarily'' benefit       LMI communities, such as large-scale infrastructure projects.       Estimating such projects' impact on LMI neighborhoods is       difficult and thus will likely divest funds away from smaller       scale, yet impactful community development activities.       Furthermore, the rule reduces the importance of retail       lending and retail services, resulting in less lending and       investments in communities that are already credit starved.       The rule is opposite to the CRA's statutory mission and will       cause deep harm to communities.        We urge support for H.J. Res. 90 to reverse the OCC's       regulatory attack on the Community Reinvestment Act. Thank       you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                    Center for Responsible Lending.    Madam Speaker, I would like to close by thanking  Representative Meeks for his leadership on this issue. I appreciate the  support we have received from our colleagues in this effort.   Make no mistake, unchecked, the OCC's final rule will harm low-  income and minority communities that are disproportionately suffering  during this COVID-19 crisis, and it will turn the Community  Reinvestment Act into the community disinvestment act.   In passing this Congressional Review Act resolution, we are not only  nullifying the OCC rule, but we are sending two clear messages:  regulators should be focused on protecting the economy from the  pandemic and not on removing safeguards, and that after the pandemic,  the OCC should go back to the drawing board and work with the Federal  Reserve and FDIC to jointly issue a new rule that strengthens the  Community Reinvestment Act and helps low-and moderate-income  communities, including communities of color.   For over a month now, by the thousands, Americans have been marching  in the streets for justice. They are standing up against racism and  fighting for justice for all. Just yesterday, this House passed  historic legislation to reform our Nation's police forces and the  unfair treatment so many people of color have experienced at the hands  of those meant to serve and protect.   As we unite to fight against discrimination in our criminal justice  system, we must also fight against discrimination, disinvestment, and  injustice in our financial system and economic injustice in our  communities. The OCC's rule would encourage disinvestment in  communities of color and lead to redlining on a massive scale. We must  stand up against this blatant effort to economically disenfranchise  hundreds of low-income and minority communities nationwide.   So I want to say to my Members on the opposite side of the aisle: I  have heard this theme that you support the Community Reinvestment Act  but you don't support my bill.   I would say to the Members: You can't have it both ways.   Madam Speaker, I ask for an ``aye'' vote on H.J. Res. 90, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
