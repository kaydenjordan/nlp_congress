 Madam Speaker, for years I have heard that  tired argument that gun violence prevention legislation won't work.  ``Just look at Chicago,'' they say, ``where residents have some of the  strictest gun laws but the highest rates of gun violence.''   The reason for that is simple--gun trafficking. More than 60 percent  of guns used in crimes in Chicago come from out of State, and we are  not the only city where this happens.   According to the ATF, from just 2016 to 2020, one-third of the more  than 1.3 million crime guns recovered and traced by law enforcement  were brought in across State lines. These guns are purchased in States  with lax laws, trafficked across State lines, and then sold to people  in our State who we know should not have a gun.   In Illinois, we are doing everything we can to protect our residents.  Our neighbors are failing us. That is why I introduced the Prevent Gun  Trafficking Act, and why I am so glad this solution is included in the  Protecting Our Kids Act. This is a simple, commonsense solution. Making  straw purchasing a Federal crime will help stop the flow of guns into  our communities from out of State. Most importantly, it will save  lives.   Stopping gun trafficking and straw purchasing is just one step we can  take to eliminate gun violence. The Protecting Our Kids Act is a smart,  broad approach to a complex issue. Passing this bill is the next step  forward in saving children, and we cannot wait.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
