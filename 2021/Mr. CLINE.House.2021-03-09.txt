 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Parry McCluer High  School boys indoor track and field team for once again winning the  Virginia Class 1 State championship last week.   This victory marks back-to-back State titles for this incredibly  talented squad led by Coach Poluikis.   After the Fighting Blues graduated a number of their starters last  year, Poluikis wasn't sure if his team could go the distance.   With only five Blues competing at the State tournament he said: ``I  knew we could win, but everything had to go perfect.'' And everything  did go perfectly.   Trevor Tomlin swept the 1600 and 3200. Brenden Plogger won the 1000,  and Zavery Wallace took the shot put.   Kedryn Chandler contributed points with a second-place finish in the  3200 and a third-place finish in the 1600, while Omar Massenberg added  points in the shot put.   When all was said and done, Parry McCluer had come out with a two- point lead over runners-up Altavista.   This win was made all the more impressive by the fact that all of the  team's 58 points were scored in just four events.   Congratulations to this Fighting Blues team on a remarkable season.  You have earned it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back into the classroom.
