 Mr. Speaker, Marco Rubio's Florida State Senate got  shocked enough by the Parkland shooting to pass a token gun safety  bill. The Florida House has yet to act. Whatever Florida does, Rubio's  token gun bill in Washington is belied by his pending bill to eliminate  virtually all of the District of Columbia's gun safety laws. Worse,  Rubio has put his D.C. bill in the Congress to raise his NRA rating for  the last two Congresses. It did raise his NRA rating from B plus to A.   I have managed to save D.C.'s gun safety laws, but Rubio's shamefully  token responses in the Senate to the Parkland tragedy will be seen as  one more act of hypocrisy until he stops meddling in the District of  Columbia's affairs and withdraws his D.C. gun bill.
