 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue to honor September  as Hawaiian History Month in my home State of Hawaii.   Today, in ``olelo Hawaii'', ``Hawaiian language'', I will honor  Joseph Kaho'oluhi Nawahi.   Joseph Kaho`oluhi Nawahiokalani`opu`u was born on January 13, 1842 in  Kaimu, Puna on the Island of Hawai`i.   Keaweolalo was his true mother. Nawahiokalani`opu`u was his true  father. Joseph Pa`akaula was his foster father. Joseph Pa`akaula was a  teacher at Ke Kula `Aiakala.   Nawahi attended 4 schools, Ke Kula`Aiakala, Ke Kula Hanai O Hilo, Ke  Kulanui O Lahainaluna and ke Kula Ali`i O Kahehuna.   Ua hanau `ia `o Iosepa Kaho`oluhi Nawahiokalani`opu`u ma ka la  `umikumuakolu o Ianuali makahiki `umikamawalu kanahakumalua ma Kaimu,  Puna, Moku o Keawe.   `O Keaweolalo kona luau`i makuahine. `O Nawahiokalani`opu`u kona  luau`i makua kane. `O Iosepa Pa`akaula kona makua hanai. He kumu `o  Iosepa Pa`akaula ma ke Kula `Aiakala.   `Eha kula a Nawahi i komo ai. `O Ke Kula `Aiakala, Ke Kula Hanai O  Hilo. Ke Kulanui O Lahainaluna a me Kula Ali`i O Kahehuna.   Mr. Speaker, these words that I just shared are a simple recitation  of biographical facts regarding Joseph Kaho'oluhi Nawahiokalani'opu'u,  who was a Native Hawaiian nationalist leader, legislator, lawyer,  newspaper publisher, and painter.   This speech has been memorized by hundreds of elementary school  students--my own keiki included--who attend the Hawaiian language  immersion school, Ke Kula `o Nawahiokalani'opu'u. These keiki not only  honor these Native Hawaiian heroes but ensure that their names are  heard, and their work lives on through them for generations to come.  ``E ola kou inoa e Nawahi.''    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7321) to amend title 49, United States Code, to require  certain air carriers to provide reports with respect to maintenance,  preventive maintenance, or alterations, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7321         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Aircraft Maintenance       Safety Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the safety of the global aviation system requires the       highest standards for aircraft maintenance, repair, and       overhaul work;        (2) the safety of aircraft operated by United States air       carriers should not be dependent on the location where       maintenance, repair, and overhaul work is performed; and        (3) the Federal Aviation Administration must fully enforce,       in a manner consistent with United States obligations under       international agreements, Federal Aviation Administration       standards for maintenance, repair, and overhaul work at every       facility, whether in the United States or abroad, where such       work is performed on aircraft operated by United States air       carriers.

(a) Foreign Repair Station Working Group.--Not later than       60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the       Administrator shall convene a foreign repair station working       group with other civil aviation authorities (hereinafter       referred to as ``repair station working group'') to conduct a       review of the certification and oversight of foreign repair       stations and to identify any future enhancements that might       be appropriate to strengthen oversight of such repair       stations.        (b) Composition of the Repair Station Working Group.--The       repair station working group shall consist of--        (1) technical representatives from the FAA; and        (2) such other civil aviation authorities or international       intergovernmental aviation safety organizations as the       Administrator shall invite that are willing to participate,       including--        (A) civil aviation authorities responsible for       certificating foreign repair stations; and        (B) civil aviation authorities of countries in which       foreign repair stations are located.        (c) Consultation.--In conducting the review under this       section, the repair station working group shall, as       appropriate, consult with relevant experts and stakeholders.        (d) Recommendations.--The repair station working group       shall make recommendations with respect to any future       enhancements that might be appropriate to--        (1) strengthen oversight of foreign repair stations; and        (2) better leverage the resources of other civil aviation       authorities to conduct such oversight.        (e) Reports.--        (1) Repair station working group report.--Not later than 1       year after the date of the first meeting of the repair       station working group, the repair station working group shall       submit to the Administrator a report containing the findings       of the review and each recommendation made under subsection       (d).        (2) FAA reports.--        (A) Transmission of repair station working group report.--      The Administrator shall submit to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate the report required under       paragraph (1) as soon as is practicable after the receipt of       such report.        (B) FAA report to congress.--Not later than 45 days after       receipt of the Report under paragraph (1), the Administrator       shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate a report containing--        (i) a statement of whether the Administrator concurs or       does not concur with each recommendation contained in the       report required under paragraph (1);        (ii) for any recommendation with which the Administrator       does not concur, a detailed explanation as to why the       Administrator does not concur;        (iii) a plan to implement each recommendation related to       FAA oversight of foreign repair stations contained in such       report with which the Administrator concurs; and        (iv) a plan to work with the international community to       implement the recommendations applicable to both the FAA as       well as other civil aviation authorities.

(g) Definition of Foreign Repair Station.--In this section,       the term ``foreign repair station'' means a repair station       that performs heavy maintenance work on an aircraft       (including on-wing engines) and that is located outside of       the territory of the country of the civil aviation authority       which certificated the repair station, including repair       stations certified under part 145 of title 14, Code of       Federal Regulations, which are located outside the United       States and the territories of the United States.       SEC. 5. ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING AND BACKGROUND CHECKS.         (a) In General.--Beginning on the date that is 24 months       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator       may not approve or authorize international travel for any       employee of the Federal Aviation Administration until a final       rule carrying out the requirements of subsection (b) of       section 2112 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act       of 2016 (49 U.S.C. 44733 note) has been published in the       Federal Register.        (b) Rulemaking on Assessment Requirement.--With respect to       any employee not covered under the requirements of section       1554.101 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, the       Administrator shall initiate a rulemaking that requires a       covered repair station to confirm that any such employee has       successfully completed an assessment commensurate with a       security threat assessment described in subpart C of part       1540 of such title.

SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the FAA.        (2) Covered repair station.--The term ``covered repair       station'' means a facility that--        (A) is located outside the United States;        (B) is certificated under part 145 of title 14, Code of       Federal Regulations; and        (C) performs heavy maintenance work on aircraft (including       on-wing aircraft engines), operated under part 121 of title       14, Code of Federal Regulations.        (3) Faa.--The term ``FAA'' means the Federal Aviation       Administration.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7321, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7321, the Global Aircraft  Maintenance Safety Improvement Act, introduced by Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee Chair, Peter DeFazio.   One level of safety. For over a decade, that has been the single- minded goal of Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration in  setting aviation policy. But until domestic and FAA-certificated  foreign repair stations are subject to the same oversight and safety  standards, there is no hope we can achieve one level of safety.   In fact, existing safety rules make clear that there is not truly one  level of safety. Under current FAA regulations, domestic repair station  workers are subject to mandatory drug and alcohol testing. Workers at  foreign repair stations are not. Domestic repair station workers are  subject to comprehensive background investigations; foreign repair  station workers are not.  [[Page H8164]]    Unfortunately, more and more maintenance work for U.S. air carriers  is being sent overseas. The number of these facilities has grown by  nearly 40 percent in the past 6 years. The global pandemic has only  exacerbated this trend, as more than 8,200 aircraft maintenance jobs  left the United States in just the past few years.   The Department of Transportation inspector general has also been  ringing the alarm bell in five audit reports containing 41  recommendations since 2002 to improve the FAA's dangerously weak  oversight of repair stations overseas.   How many more inspector general reports will it take for the FAA to  be brave enough to take a leadership role in the international  community and apply strong standards to foreign repair stations?   This bill will require the FAA to take a number of specific and  decisive steps to improve oversight of foreign repair stations. These  include, among other things: requiring all foreign repair stations to  be subject to at least one unannounced inspection each year; requiring  supervisors and individuals who authorize aircraft for return to  service to meet minimum requirements and hold FAA mechanic or repairman  certificates; and requiring the FAA to, one, comply with the 2016  mandate for a final rule on drug and alcohol testing of employees at  foreign repair stations, and, two, initiate a rulemaking mandating  background checks of such employees.   I thank the stakeholders for their support and the tireless efforts  in working toward an agreeable solution as well as Ranking Member  Graves and his staff.   Madam Speaker, this bill is a giant step in the right direction, I  urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.
