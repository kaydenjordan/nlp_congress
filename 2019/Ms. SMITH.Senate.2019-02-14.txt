 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the government  funding agreement announced last night. I greatly appreciate the work  of Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy, and the Appropriations Committee in  their efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement. I appreciate the efforts  of Senator McConnell, Senator Schumer, and our House counterparts, as  well, to reach an agreement.   I am glad we will avert another government shutdown and also make  critical investments in several areas that are important to my home  State of Minnesota; however, there is an important piece of unfinished  business that wasn't included in the agreement, and that is to provide  backpay for the employees of Federal contractors who were forced out of  work for more than a month during the shutdown.   During the longest Federal shutdown in history, thousands of  Americans who serve as contractors to the Federal Government lost over  a month's pay through no fault of their own, and these are people who  work as security guards and clean office buildings, and they work  shoulder to shoulder with Federal employees for all of us.  Unfortunately, and this is important, while Federal employees have  received backpay--a bill this Chamber passed unanimously--their  contractor counterparts have been left out in the cold with no backpay.   I have introduced legislation, which has bipartisan support, which  would right this wrong, and it should have been included in the final  budget deal, but it appears that the White House blocked it.   I have talked with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  here in the Senate Chamber, and I have not found a single person who  says contractors don't deserve backpay. We all agree on this, and that  is why every Democrat in this Chamber has cosponsored my bill, and that  is why several of my Republican colleagues and many others in this room  have not only cosponsored but have also expressed support for finding a  solution to this challenge.   So why not provide backpay to contractors in the funding bill before  us today? Because it appears the White House apparently has said not to  do it. But I have talked to the White House just in the last week. I  didn't hear any fundamental reasons why our plan couldn't go forward  and why challenges couldn't be resolved.   While I don't claim to know the White House's motivation in opposing  this bill, I do know there are several misconceptions about this  legislation that I would like to address today.   First, some have claimed that the problem is just too complicated to  solve or that it would involve an untested process, but that is not  right.   My bill would allow Agencies to make what is called equitable  adjustment to contract prices to compensate contractors who provide  backpay to their furloughed employees. This equitable adjustment  process is used regularly by contracting officers and contractors. It  has already been used to address other shutdown-related claims,  including hundreds of claims for shutdown-related compensation this  year alone. This process has already been used to pay contractors, just  not for backpay. So my bill would build on the existing processes  already in place. These processes are established, and it is just not  that complicated.   Second, some have claimed that the administrative costs of the bill  would just be too large, and that is simply false.   It is true that Agencies would need to take administrative steps to  implement the bill, just as they do with the passage of any  legislation. But, again, my bill builds on an existing administrative  process that is used regularly and efficiently without large  administrative costs.   Let me be clear. If the White House or anyone has suggestions on ways  to improve this legislation to make it easier to implement, we are all  ears. We would be happy to accommodate any reasonable suggestion; we  just haven't seen any. We haven't received any specific suggestions.   Too often, contractors are invisible to the public, but they suffered  greatly during this recent shutdown. Representative Ayanna Pressley and  I recently authored an op-ed about this, and it included a story about  a woman named Tamela, whom we both met. We wrote in our op-ed:         Tamela was worried that she would fall behind on her       mortgage and car payments, ruining the good credit she'd       worked so long and so hard to build. And as she spoke, beads       of sweat rolled down her face. Was she nervous about speaking       in front of a crowd? No. As Tamela explained, she's diabetic       and has high blood pressure. Without her regular paycheck,       she hadn't been able to afford the co-pay for a doctor's       appointment to have her blood pressure tested and her       prescription renewed. So she was going without her medicine.    I recently received a letter from Annie, a Federal contractor in  Duluth. Annie wrote to me:         I am losing wages that I count on each month to make       significant payments towards my student loans and       contributions to my savings, (including my retirement       savings). I can honestly say I never thought I'd be applying       for unemployment, especially as a 31-year-old, but today I       did just that.    These employees deserve backpay. They had nothing to do with creating  this crisis, and we should all be able to come together in a bipartisan  way to make sure these Federal contract employees receive backpay. So I  stand here today to say I am going to continue working to get this bill  passed, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to find a path forward.   I yield the floor.
