Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4369.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce  Committee have been working on legislation to invest in and support  American pharmaceutical manufacturing to reduce our dependence on items  produced abroad, such as active ingredients and raw materials. As the  COVID-19 pandemic has made clear, domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing  is critical to our Nation's public health and global economic  competitiveness.   The bill before us now, H.R. 4369, would leverage the expertise and  ingenuity of academic institutions in the United States to help support  and develop advanced manufacturing technologies right here at home. The  legislation will improve the quality of our pharmaceuticals, reduce  drug shortages, and help to produce more nimble and efficient  manufacturing processes that could be replicated throughout the Nation.   Specifically, H.R. 4369 would direct the Food and Drug Administration  to designate a number of American academic institutions as national  centers of excellence. It then provides funding to these centers to  develop advanced and continuous manufacturing.   Now, continuous manufacturing is an emerging technology whereby a  finished product is produced in a continuous stream, making it more  efficient than the current so-called batch model that can be slow and  may be subject to the risk of defects or errors during the  manufacturing process.   The centers would be required to work closely with the FDA and  industry to support regulatory guidance and expertise, catalyze  research and development in advanced and continuous manufacturing  technologies, and cultivate an advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing  workforce here in the United States.   The legislation requires that the majority of the $100 million in  funding be awarded directly to the designated centers of excellence,  while also providing resources for FDA technical assistance, guidance,  or training.   H.R. 4369 sets us on the right track for advanced manufacturing here  at home.   This legislation passed the House last Congress but was not taken up  in the Senate. If we are to meet the goal and demand for uninterrupted  access and supply of critical drugs and active pharmaceutical  ingredients, the time to act is now.   I want to thank our Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Guthrie for  working with me on this legislation, as well as full committee Ranking  Member Rodgers and Health Subcommittee Chairwoman Anna Eshoo.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4369, and I hope the Senate will  follow suit so that we can finally expand advanced and continuous  manufacturing technology here in the United States.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, would say this is an important  bill, both from the point of view of moving toward more domestic  manufacturing and addressing the supply chain shortages that we saw  during COVID-19 for drugs.   Madam Speaker, I ask for Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2379) to amend the 21st Century Cures Act to reauthorize and  expand a grant program for State response to the opioid use disorders  crisis, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2379         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H5648]]            SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in  [[Page H5649]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous  material on H.R. 2379.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2379, the State Opioid  Response Grant Authorization Act of 2021.   The substance use and opioid crisis continues to be a public health  emergency and has evolved into a devastating dual threat when combined  with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Opioids are the leading cause of drug overdose deaths in the United  States. Tragically, last year, more than 93,000 Americans died from an  opioid overdose. That is the highest 12-month death toll since the  beginning of the opioid epidemic.   Now, experts suspect that the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated this  terrible record last year. Overall, it is estimated that more than 20  million Americans have a substance use disorder. While treatment and  services are available, many do not have access to or are not aware of  the care in their communities.   H.R. 2379 basically supports our ongoing work to combat the opioid  crisis, and the legislation enhances our efforts in the 21st Century  Cures Act and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. It does  this by authorizing the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration State Opioid Response grant program, better known as  SAMHSA's SOR grant program.   The bill also aligns the authorization with authorities included in  the 21st Century Cures Act.   Although the SAMHSA grant program has been funded through the  appropriations process since 2018, it does not have a statutory  authorization. This legislation provides that important authorization  and ensures future funding.   Today, the SOR grants are used to enhance prevention and recovery  activities across the States, including support services to address  stimulant misuse and use disorders. These grants also reduce barriers  to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, which is  critical to addressing the treatment gap and reducing the number of  overdose deaths.   This bill also provides Congress more information and transparency  about existing funding, including the formula used to make allocations  to States. This information will allow us to examine how changes to  these allocations impact the progress States are making to address the  opioid crisis.   It is important for this program to direct resources to communities  most in need or where surges in opioid or stimulant use are occurring,  and this information will help us make sure that resources are getting  to where they are needed the most.   I want to thank the sponsor of the bill, the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Trone), for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank my  Republican committee colleagues for their support on this legislation,  as we continue our work to address the substance use crisis in this  country.   Madam Speaker, the bill unanimously passed the House last year. I  urge my colleagues to support it once again today. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone), the author of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, again, this is a very important bill  addressing the opioid epidemic with these various grant programs.   Madam Speaker, I would ask for support on a bipartisan basis, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 654) to provide the Administrator of the Drug-Free  Communities Support Program the authority to waive the Federal fund  limitation for the Drug-Free Communities Support Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 654         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Free Communities       Pandemic Relief Act''.       SEC. 2. WAIVER OF FEDERAL FUND LIMITATION FOR THE DRUG-FREE                     COMMUNITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), if the       Administrator of the Drug-Free Communities Support Program       determines that, as a result of the public health emergency       declared pursuant to section 319 of the Public Health Service       Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) as a result of COVID-19, an eligible       coalition is unable to raise the amount of non-Federal funds,       including in-kind contributions, agreed to be raised by the       coalition for a fiscal year under an agreement entered into       with the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) or (3) of       section 1032(b) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (21 U.S.C.       1532(b)), the Administrator may, notwithstanding such       paragraphs, provide to the eligible coalition the grant or       renewal grant, as applicable, for that fiscal year in an       amount--        (1) with respect to an initial grant or renewal grant       described under paragraph (1)(A) or (3)(A) of such section,       that exceeds the amount of non-Federal funds raised by the       eligible coalition, including in-kind contributions, for that       fiscal year;        (2) with respect to a renewal grant described under       paragraph (3)(D)(i) of such section, that exceeds 125 percent       of the amount of non-Federal funds raised by the eligible       coalition, including in-kind contributions, for that fiscal       year; and        (3) with respect to a renewal grant described under       paragraph (3)(D)(ii) of such section, that exceeds 150       percent of the amount of non-Federal funds raised by the       eligible coalition, including in-kind contributions, for that       fiscal year.        (b) Limitation.--The Administrator may not provide a grant       or renewal grant to an eligible coalition in an amount       exceeding the amount of funds initially agreed to be provided       by the Administrator under the applicable agreement.       SEC. 3. RAISING CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES UNDER ANTI-                    DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1988.         Section 1024(b) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (21       U.S.C. 1524(b)) is amended by striking ``8 percent'' and       inserting ``12 percent''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 654.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 654, the Drug-Free  Communities Pandemic Relief Act.   Since 1998, the Drug-Free Communities Program has been a pillar of  our Nation's drug, alcohol, and tobacco prevention efforts.   The program is designed with community-based approaches in mind to  reach at-risk communities, including racial and ethnic minorities and  the LGBTQ community. It is estimated that one in five Americans live in  a community with a Drug-Free Communities Coalition, and over 300,000  partners are engaged in prevention efforts.   Like many mission-driven, community-service organizations, Drug-Free  Communities Coalitions have faced unprecedented challenges during the  COVID-19 pandemic. Many have had trouble sustaining their programming  amid increasing rates of substance use. This is in part due to an  inability to meet the matching fund requirements required of those  receiving Drug-Free Communities grants.   H.R. 654 would allow the Drug-Free Communities Coalitions to seek  [[Page H5651]]  matching fund waivers and resume their work to enhance drug, alcohol,  and tobacco prevention efforts. The legislation also allows additional  funds to be made available for expanded technical assistance by the  Drug-Free Communities Program, as requested in the administration's  fiscal year 2022 budget. This additional support would provide critical  resources to the Drug-Free Communities Coalitions facing the greatest  challenges posed by the pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 654, a bipartisan bill that will  allow important work to continue in our communities.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill. It is very  important in terms of trying to promote these coalitions at a local  community level to prevent drug overuse.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3635) to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to  the Strategic National Stockpile, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3635         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         Section 319F-2(f)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 247d-6b(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``$610,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023'' and inserting       ``$705,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3635.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3635, the  Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile Act of 2021.   This bill makes long-overdue improvements to the Strategic National  Stockpile to ensure we have access to critical lifesaving medical  supplies during public health emergencies. Since the beginning of the  COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a lot of attention around the  Strategic National Stockpile and our preparedness for this pandemic.   The stockpile was not stocked as it should have been and this bill  makes important improvements to correct that for the future. The bill  will ensure that the Strategic National Stockpile, also known as SNS,  is operating at its highest potential moving forward in order to  continue to respond to COVID-19, and also to prepare for the next  public health emergency.   This bipartisan bill seeks to reduce America's dependence on foreign  sources of critical medical supplies, including personal protective  equipment. It does this by boosting domestic manufacturing to make  those supplies in the United States and promoting private-public  partnerships to ensure a coordinated response. The legislation also  makes needed improvements to the Strategic National Stockpile to ensure  it is fully equipped with medical supplies that are safe and in working  order.   Importantly, the bill also improves transparency around the readiness  of the Strategic National Stockpile and how requests from States and  Tribes are being managed. It also directs the Department of Health and  Human Services to develop and implement improved, transparent processes  for these types of requests moving forward. This will be critical for  ensuring adequate supplies within the Strategic National Stockpile, as  well as informing readiness efforts in the States and also at Tribal  levels.   As healthcare systems all across our Nation continue to be stretched  to the limit combating the COVID-19 Delta variant, we need to continue  to push solutions that support our public health and national security  response capability. The improvements to the Strategic National  Stockpile put forward in this bill are critical to protecting our  frontline workers and patients with the supplies that they need to stay  safe.   Madam Speaker, I commend the bipartisan leadership of Representatives  Slotkin and Hudson in preparing this bill. This bipartisan bill was  passed out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and by this House  unanimously last Congress.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to once again join me in  strong support of this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague that what this  bill does is basically take the lessons that we learned from the  pandemic about what can be done to improve the Strategic National  Stockpile for the future.   Madam Speaker, I ask everyone to support the bill on a bipartisan  basis, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3919) to ensure that the Federal Communications Commission  does not approve radio frequency devices that pose a national security  risk, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3919         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Equipment Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. UPDATES TO EQUIPMENT AUTHORIZATION PROCESS OF FEDERAL                     COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION.         (a) Rulemaking.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall adopt rules       in the proceeding initiated in the Notice of Proposed       Rulemaking in the matter of Protecting Against National       Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain through       the Equipment Authorization Program (ET Docket No. 21-232;       FCC 21-73; adopted June 17, 2021), in accordance with       paragraph (2), to update the equipment authorization       procedures of the Commission.        (2) Updates required.--In the rules adopted under paragraph       (1), the Commission shall clarify that the Commission will no       longer review or approve any application for equipment       authorization for equipment that is on the list of covered       communications equipment or services published by the       Commission under section 2(a) of the Secure and Trusted       Communications Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 1601(a)).        (3) Applicability.--        (A) In general.--In the rules adopted under paragraph (1),       the Commission may not provide for review or revocation of       any equipment authorization granted before the date on which       such rules are adopted on the basis of the equipment being on       the list described in paragraph (2).        (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed to prohibit the Commission, other than in the rules       adopted under paragraph (1), from--        (i) examining the necessity of review or revocation of any       equipment authorization on the basis of the equipment being       on the list described in paragraph (2); or  [[Page H5655]]         (ii) adopting rules providing for any such review or       revocation.        (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Commission''       means the Federal Communications Commission.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3919.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3919, the Secure Equipment  Act of 2021.   Two years ago, we came together on a bipartisan basis to enact the  Secure and Trusted Communications Act, legislation that I proudly  authored. That bill was an important first step toward securing  commercial communications networks in the United States from untrusted  foreign adversaries. Among other things, it prohibits certain funds  provided by the Federal Communications Commission from being used to  purchase or obtain network equipment and services from certain  untrusted vendors.   While that legislation established an important foundation and has  made great strides in helping secure our communications networks, we  have the opportunity today to take the next step by applying those same  principles to the FCC's equipment authorization process. We know our  adversaries will use any and all potential avenues to weaken our  networks, and therefore, we must remain vigilant and prevent it before  they can do so.   H.R. 3919 simply requires the FCC to update its equipment  authorization rules so that, going forward, the agency will no longer  review or approve any application for equipment from vendors that have  been determined to be a threat to our national security.   Importantly, while this bill focuses only on the applications that  the agency is in the process of reviewing or will receive in the  future, it does not prevent the FCC from later studying whether it  should review equipment previously authorized but which is now known to  pose a threat.   Over the past several years, the Energy and Commerce Committee has  worked, on a bipartisan basis, on important security issues, and I  commend Representatives Eshoo and Scalise for continuing in that  tradition through their leadership and bipartisan work on this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Secure Equipment  Act of 2021, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, does the whip have any additional  speakers?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would urge, again, bipartisan support.  This is an important next step in our effort to try to secure our  equipment and prevent foreign actors, such as the Chinese, from  interfering with our national security, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4032) to provide outreach and technical assistance to small  providers regarding the benefits of Open RAN networks, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4032         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Open RAN Outreach Act''.       SEC. 2. OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL PROVIDERS                     REGARDING OPEN RAN NETWORKS.         (a) In General.--The Assistant Secretary shall conduct       outreach and provide technical assistance to small       communications network providers--        (1) to raise awareness regarding the uses, benefits, and       challenges of Open RAN networks and other open network       architectures; and        (2) regarding participation in the Wireless Supply Chain       Innovation Grant Program established under section 9202(a)(1)       of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283).        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary''       means the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications       and Information, acting through the head of the Office of       Internet Connectivity and Growth.        (2) Open network architecture.--The term ``open network       architecture'' means Open RAN networks and other network       elements that follow a set of published open standards for       multi-vendor network equipment interoperability, including       open core and open transport.        (3) Open ran network.--The term ``Open RAN network'' means       a wireless network that follows the Open Radio Access Network       approach to standardization adopted by the O-RAN Alliance,       Telecom Infra Project, or Third Generation Partnership       Project (3GPP), or any similar set of published open       standards for multi-vendor network equipment       interoperability.        Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to provide outreach       and technical assistance to small providers regarding Open       RAN networks, and for other purposes.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4032.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4032, the Open RAN  Outreach Act.   Open RAN, or Open Radio Access Network, technology is an emerging  wireless network architecture that has the potential to drive 5G  innovation forward. But like any new technology, we still have much to  learn about the possibilities, complexities, and challenges of Open  RAN. This is especially true for smaller communications providers.   This bill steps up to the challenge by providing small communications  providers with the support they need to  [[Page H5657]]  determine whether Open RAN is an appropriate network solution for them.  Under the bill, the Assistant Secretary of the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, will be  required to engage in outreach and provide technical assistance to  small communications providers concerning the uses, benefits, and  challenges of Open RAN and other open network architectures.   NTIA will also inquire about the providers' participation in the  Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Grant Program, which was established  in the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.   Madam Speaker, I commend Representatives Allred, O'Halleran, Guthrie,  and Hudson for their bipartisan work on this bill. This is a good bill,  as it ensures that our country's small communications providers have  the necessary help to make informed decisions about the need for new  technology in their wireless networks.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill in a  bipartisan manner, and I look forward to its consideration in the  Senate. I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred).    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I would ask that Members  support this bill that helps our small communications providers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4067) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to  establish a council to make recommendations on ways to increase the  security, reliability, and interoperability of communications networks,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4067         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Communications Security,       Reliability, and Interoperability Council Act''.       SEC. 2. COUNCIL ON COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY, RELIABILITY, AND                     INTEROPERABILITY.

(B) Criteria for determination.--In making a determination       under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Chair shall use the criteria       described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 2(c) of       the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019       (47 U.S.C. 1601(c)), as appropriate.        (5) State.--The term ``State'' has the meaning given such       term in section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47       U.S.C. 153).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4067.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4067, the  Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council Act.   As we have seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our Nation's  communications networks play an important role in our daily lives.  Indeed, these networks have helped us remain connected when we were not  able to see family and friends in person. It is vital that we continue  to do all we can to protect this critical infrastructure and ensure it  is reliable and available to all Americans.   The Federal Communications Commission's Communications Security,  Reliability, and Interoperability Council, or CSRIC, is meant to do  just that. It is made up of government leaders at the Federal, State,  and local levels, and includes thought leaders from industry and public  interest organizations. The council provides the FCC with  recommendations on the best practices and actions the agency could take  so that our communications networks are secure, reliable, and  compatible with each other.   CSRIC has been in existence since 2009 and was recently rechartered  by acting FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel for another 5 years.   CSRIC has served the FCC well by operating in a collaborative manner  with representatives from private industry, government, and other key  stakeholders. This year the council will be cochaired by the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and will include even  greater participation from the public interest community.   But given the important objectives of CSRIC, we should not leave it  to the FCC's discretion on whether to recharter this council or not  every 2 years. Instead, CSRIC must become a permanent fixture at the  FCC.   H.R. 4067 requires the Federal Communications Commission to do just  that. Under this bill, the FCC would be required to establish a  permanent council to advise the agency on the security, reliability,  and interoperability of communications networks within 90 days. This  council would include representatives from trusted communications  companies, public interest organizations, academic institutions, as  well as Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments for a term of 2  years.   This bill also requires the council and its working groups to submit  reports offering their recommendations to the chair of the FCC every 2  years. In turn, the FCC must make these reports publicly available on  its website.   I want to thank Representatives Schrader and Slotkin for their  leadership on this bill, as well as Representative Walberg for working  with us to move this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee.  This bill is an important step in protecting our communications  networks from bad actors and foreign adversaries.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, I look  forward to its consideration by the Senate, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I ask the  gentleman from Ohio if he has any additional speakers.    Madam Speaker, again, I ask Members to support this bill  as another step in helping us with our communications security as well  as reliability.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4028) to require the Secretary of Commerce to report on and  develop a whole-of-Government strategy with respect to the economic  competitiveness of the information and communication technology supply  chain, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4028         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Information and       Communication Technology Strategy Act''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4028.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4028, the Information and  Communication Technology Strategy Act.   This bill would help ensure the United States remains a global  economic power by providing Congress with valuable insights on the  information and communication technology supply chain and a strategic  roadmap for the entire Federal Government to strengthen the  competitiveness of trusted information and communication technology  vendors.   The bill accomplishes these important objectives by requiring the  Secretary of Commerce to report to Congress on the technology most  critical to ensuring the continued economic success of the United  States. It is also supposed to examine the ability and capacity of  American manufacturers and other trusted vendors to produce this  technology.   The report will be completed through the Department's National  Telecommunications and Information Administration. It will also  identify how many of our country's communications providers depend upon  untrusted vendors of this technology, and then it will outline actions  the Federal Government can take to increase the support of trusted  vendors and eliminate the support of untrusted vendors.   Finally, the legislation calls for the Secretary of Commerce to  develop a whole-of-government strategy, along with recommendations  based on the report. The strategy is meant to enhance the economic  growth of trusted information and communication technology vendors,  both in the United States and abroad.   Madam Speaker, the bill requires that the Secretary of Commerce  consult with a wide variety of trusted information and communication  technology vendors. It also requires the Secretary to consult with the  heads of several government agencies, including the Secretary of State,  the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Director  of National Intelligence, and the Chair of the FCC.   By enhancing the global supply chain for trusted information and  communication technology vendors, this bill would help strengthen the  American economy and protect our country from nontrusted parties  seeking to disrupt America's competitiveness in the information and  communication technology industry.   Madam Speaker, I want to commend Representatives Spanberger,  McNerney, Long, and Carter for their bipartisan efforts on this  legislation. I hope we can come together to move the bill forward. I  urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I ask if the gentleman is prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, this is part of our effort to  enhance economic growth with regard to trusted communications vendors  both here and abroad. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
