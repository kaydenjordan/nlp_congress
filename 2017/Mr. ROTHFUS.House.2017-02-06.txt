 Mr. Speaker, I rise here tonight to raise a very serious  and consequential issue that is taking place in our Nation's capital.  Washington, D.C., our Federal city, the second hometown of every  American, is just weeks away from implementing a deadly assisted  suicide program.   The D.C. City Council recently passed a so-called Death With Dignity  Act, which would allow adults who have been diagnosed with a terminal  disease and who have been told they have 6 months or less to live to  receive a prescription from their doctor to end their life. Six States,  including California, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Montana, and  Colorado, have already headed down this dangerous path.   I raise this issue tonight, Mr. Speaker, because our Founders gave  Congress the power in the Constitution to ``exercise exclusive  Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District'' that would  become the seat of the Government of the United States.   As a result, this Congress has the opportunity to stop this law. I am  grateful that my colleagues are here tonight to join me: Dr. Wenstrup,  Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia, Dr. Harris, Dr. Hartzler, Dr. Marshall.  They are joining me tonight to speak in defense of patients who deserve  protection, especially when dealing with the unimaginable difficulty of  a terminal disease.   Like me, they are deeply troubled that in Washington, D.C., an  alabaster city that gleams as a beacon for the principles on which we  were founded, this policy is about to be put in place, jeopardizing the  lives of the most vulnerable among us.   Mr. Speaker, Washington, D.C., is, indeed, a remarkable city. I still  remember coming to this special place as a 10-year-old child with my  parents, coming down the George Washington Parkway in Virginia, as  millions of other tourists have, with excitement to see our national  monuments and the Capitol in which I now speak.   We Americans approach this city with awe, as we know how Washington  is intertwined with our Nation's history and that this city both guards  our Nation's founding documents--the Declaration of Independence and  the Constitution--and hosts the very government that our Constitution  envisioned. Those founding documents frame a Republic grounded in the  principles of sovereignty in the people, subject to the protection of  God-given inalienable rights, among them the right to life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   Nowhere, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, is the view of this city more  beautiful than from the hills of Arlington Cemetery in Virginia and,  specifically, the resting place of our 35th President, John F. Kennedy.  One cannot think of President Kennedy without thinking also of his  inaugural address, which is a call to action for a new generation of  Americans. That call was grounded in the exceptional nature of our  land.                                time  1930    ``And yet,'' President Kennedy said, ``the same revolutionary beliefs  for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the  belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state  but from the hand of God.''   D.C.'s assisted suicide law, Mr. Speaker, threatens the inalienable  rights of vulnerable citizens. Not only does the new D.C. statute tear  at the tapestry of our Nation's founding, it directly contradicts the  Hippocratic oath every physician takes, to do no harm.   I shudder to think of the lives that will be lost because our society  tells the weak, the despairing, the suffering, or the hopeless that  suicide is the best option for them. Laws similar to the D.C. Death  with Dignity Act in the U.S. and Europe have resulted in individuals  being pressured to end their lives, and insurance companies covering  the reimbursements for suicide treatment but not for other care.   If patients find themselves unable to pay for expensive treatments  out-of-pocket, they may find their options severely limited when facing  a new diagnosis, facing a disability, or struggling with mental  illness. In some cases, death may become the only affordable option.   Proponents of physician-assisted suicide point to real and tragic  stories of suffering individuals at the end of their lives. However,  according to a report by the National Institutes of Health, pain is not  the primary factor motivating patients to seek a lethal dose of  medication. More commonly cited motivations include depression,  hopelessness, and the loss of control or autonomy. Allowing physicians  to prescribe lethal medications to these patients would mean we are  abandoning our Nation's most vulnerable citizens and, instead,  succumbing to a culture that is worse than the disease.   Instead of death and despair that are the underlying principles of  assisted suicide, our laws should reflect a culture that promotes life  and hope, even in our suffering, even in our illness, and even in our  weakness.   Jeanette Hall of Oregon was diagnosed with cancer in the year 2000.  She was a supporter of her State's assisted suicide program, and she  even voted for it. She considered taking her own life with the help of  her physician when she learned she only had 6 months to live.  Thankfully, she had a life-affirming doctor who simply asked her how  her son, who was attending the police academy at the time, would feel  about it. This made her stop and think.   His question inspired her to opt for radiation and chemotherapy,  instead of suicide, and, over a decade later, she is still sharing her  testimony. She is extremely happy to still be alive.   I have no doubt that Americans like Jeanette with chronic illnesses,  disabilities, or struggling with mental illness will be exploited under  this law, and perhaps even encouraged to pursue suicide rather than  continue living until natural death. This dangerous trend is already  taking shape in the six States that have legalized physician-assisted  suicide. Precious lives have already met a premature end.   Mr. Speaker, there is dignity in all human life, and the root meaning  of dignity is worth. Nothing--not illness, not weakness, or despair-- can decrease the worth of a human life. I cannot stand idly by and  watch our laws corrupt our culture.   I am thankful to be joined by several of my colleagues who refuse to  let this dark policy move forward unchecked. With that, I would like to  yield to my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup). Dr. Wenstrup is a  physician. He has served our country in the Army Reserves having  deployed to Iraq to treat our wounded servicemembers. Dr. Wenstrup, is  the prime sponsor of H.J. Res. 27, which will overturn this misguided  legislation.    Dr. Wenstrup, I thank you for introducing this  legislation and for having the courage to live the life you have lived  in serving our Armed Forces overseas.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) who co- chairs our Values Action Team.    I thank Representative Hice.   Mr. Speaker, this law, the point about what is going to go on the  death certificate, we have had a debate lately in our country about  alternative facts, and here we have a law that says you can't say on  the death certificate what the cause of death was. It's going to be  poison. It's going to be some administered drug that is not supposed to  be used as it was intended, as it was authorized by the FDA to be used,  but for a whole other purpose--to end the life of somebody. I think  that is a very serious concern. I think, again, this is at war with  truth and at war with logic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler). Vicky co-chairs our values action team with Mr. Hice.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Hartzler for coming  to the floor tonight and speaking on this bill. It is interesting that  legalizing assisted suicide can lead to an increase in suicide. We  spend hundreds of millions of dollars in our country on suicide  prevention. It would seem that laws such as the one that the District  of Columbia has passed really go against that fundamental public policy  that we have in this country of saying no to suicide.   With that, it is a real privilege for me to yield to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Harris). Andy Harris is another physician whom I  serve with who has served in our Nation's military.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for taking a long, hard  look at what is going to happen here in the District of Columbia if we  do not bring H.J. Res. 27 to the floor to block this misguided  legislation.   Dr. Harris talked about compassion. Certainly, we all have family  members, we all have friends who have had very difficult illnesses, and  we have been at bedsides when people have passed.                                time  2000    It is good to know that we have palliative care that is available to  help people in pain, to make sure that they are getting everything they  can without having a doctor violate his or her Hippocratic oath to do  no harm.   I really thank Dr. Harris for his words and for reminding us how he  was called to the healing arts. He has got family members engaged in  the healing arts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall),  another Representative that we are joined by this evening, a newer  member from the Big One, I think it is called, also having served in  the Army Reserve. He did not do his physician's work in the Army  Reserve, because I don't know what the rules are with women  servicemembers and giving birth, but certainly we have women  servicemembers giving birth. I don't think they are overseas, although  they may be in Germany and other places. I don't think they are going  to be in a war zone.   Certainly, he has got plenty of experience. He has delivered over  5,000 babies. He certainly has seen his share of difficult cases with  patients. It is good to have him here this evening to talk about this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, it is simple: this Congress has a  responsibility. The Founders made us, this Congress--the House and the  Senate--the stewards of this city, this beautiful Federal alabaster  city. The Founders vested in us the exclusive legislative power over  the District of Columbia.   H.J. Res. 27, which will block the so-called D.C. Death With Dignity  Act, is a bill that goes to the character of this Congress, to the  character of the District, to the character of this country.   Will this Congress allow this law to go into effect?   For the vulnerable, I hope not. For the physicians who are supposed  to heal, I hope not.   Earlier in my remarks, I talked about how beautiful it is to look at  this city from Arlington and to recollect our 35th President and the  inspiring words he spoke on January 20, 1961. He ended that address  with these words: ``With a good conscience our only sure reward, with  history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land  we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on  earth God's work must truly be our own.''   Mr. Speaker, let's lead the land we love. Let this House move ahead  with H.J. Res. 27 and prevent this legislation, the D.C. Death With  Dignity Act, from staining our Nation's capital.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
