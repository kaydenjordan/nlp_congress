 Mr. Speaker, I thank those watching and my colleagues  who will join me in the next half hour to talk about journalism, the  importance of journalism in the United States and the importance of  journalism to democracy.   Abraham Lincoln once said: Let the people know the facts, and the  country will be safe.   The challenge is, how do we get them those facts?   For professional journalists, there is nothing more important. They  don't always make us who hold office happy. Sometimes, we disagree with  them. Sometimes, we think they are not being fair. But they are  extremely important to the success or failure of American democracy.                                time  1745    Neil Postman, in 1985, in his book, ``Amusing Ourselves to Death,''  wrote about his own belief in 1985 that how people got information in  journalism was changing too dramatically, and he was just talking about  the media in terms of television news. Think about how much that has  changed since 1985.   Mr. Postman talked about the Lincoln-Douglas debates and that  thousands of people would go and listen to those debates because  Douglas and Lincoln took the time to write out what they would say and  how they anticipated answering questions. People would listen without  speakers and without any kind of amplification of what they were  saying--thousands of people--for as long as 6 or 7 hours, with a break  for dinner.   Mr. Postman's whole argument was this was cognitively different, that  when you read something that was prepared over and over again by people  who were really good writers, people responded differently and they  accepted factual information in a different way than we were learning  to accept facts.   Now, in 2019, with this administration and with social media and 24/7  news, I think Mr. Postman would be horrified about how Americans get  their facts, how they cognitively process them, and how they engage as  American citizens.   There is nothing more important than, as Lincoln said and I would  opine, that Americans get journalism with factual content, with the  professional expertise of people, many of whom have gone to school, to  journalism schools for undergraduate degrees, often for graduate  degrees, who go out to work for not a whole lot of money but to be able  to investigate, get to the facts, and then communicate. Too many of us  underestimate those talents. Maybe we have become spoiled.   But what has happened is a consequence of many things. The business  model has changed. Being from the bay area, Craigslist changed  classified ads, and that is a revenue source to print journalism. But  now as it moves to digital, a group of us wants to talk about what we  can do appropriately in Congress and maybe work with--not maybe, but  work with State and local officials to talk about how we can  appropriately support professional journalism so we can get back to  that point where Americans are engaged in a very deep way in their  discussion with government and, specifically, with local government.   Most Americans--and maybe it is because I came from local  government--learn about democracy, oftentimes, at the local level. They  know the people who are in the city council and on the school board. An  issue comes up. Their kids start to go to school, and they take an  interest in the governance and superintendent and the superintendent's  bosses. They care about the curriculum. Maybe there is a land use  decision at their city council, and so they start to learn about  democracy in a meaningful way that way.   Heretofore, except in the last 10 years with the demise of local  journalism, for a variety of reasons, they don't get that information.  They get a lot of information about Congress. They get a lot of  information about the President of the United States, and some  information still at the statehouse, but not nearly as much, and very  little at the local level.   I will say there are heroic people out there who are still doing  great local journalism, but because of the business model and because  of consolidations, that has become, I am afraid, very ill.   So just in terms of the definition of the problem, in 2017, estimated  daily U.S. newspaper circulation--that is print and digital. So when we  focus on, ``Oh, well, print is gone; forget about it,'' we realize that  the business model has changed.   But there is a digital model here that we can see in The Washington  Post, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, San  Francisco Chronicle. There is still a model. But their ability to talk  about local news is where we have to get more effort, I think, in  understanding, as citizens.   Circulation, print and digital, in 2017 was 31 million for weekday  and 34 million for Sunday. That is down 11 and 10 percent,  respectively, from each previous year. The chart next to me shows the  steady decline.   Newspaper consumption--that is digital and print--has been falling  every year since 1994. Today most Americans get their news from  television and social media, the primary way they get their  information.   Fifty-five percent of Americans are regularly tuning into TV to  consume that news information. In contrast, only 20 percent of  Americans regularly get their news from a physical newspaper. Only 38  percent of Americans regularly get their news online.   In 2017, advertising revenue for the entire newspaper industry was  $16.5 billion, a 10 percent decrease from 2016.   Then there are consolidations, an issue that I know Mr. Cicilline  will talk about, the consolidation of the print newspaper business in  particular.   And I will say this for the bay area where I live and represent, in  the bay area, newspapers, at their peak, had about 1,500 journalists.  This is for about 7.5, 7.75 million people, in one of the largest  metropolitan areas in the country that is very diverse, 1,500  journalists. These aren't support people. These are writers,  professional journalists. Now there are less than 300 serving those  same 7.5 million people in an area that is growing and has one of the  most innovative and fastest growing economies in the world.   It is not just the bay area. Since 2004, 1,800 local papers have been  closed or merged. What traditionally happens--and there are two large  companies that do this--is they go in and buy the newspaper and then  sell the assets. So very rarely now--when you go around to a city or a  town where it used to be a prominent building was the headquarters of  the local newspaper, those buildings have been sold.   The San Jose Mercury News had a prominent building in downtown San  Jose right by city hall. In Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times still  thrives because it has local ownership, fortunately; but that L.A.  Times building, a beautiful art deco that was so much a part of the  history of Los Angeles, was directly across the street from city hall.  There was a reason for that.    The Examiner and the Chronicle in San Francisco were prominent  downtown. These were icons. Well, a lot of these consolidations came  about, and they sold these iconic buildings where people worked. Then,  of course, they sold the print functions because there was less to do  and a lot of the distribution. But they also laid off and eliminated a  lot of the journalists, and that is where we get our information.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 39,210 people worked as  reporters and editors in the newspaper industry in 2017. This is down  from 44,000, about 15 percent from 2015, and 71,645 in 2004, about a 45  percent nationwide decrease. About one-third of the large U.S.  newspapers have suffered significant layoffs.   Additionally, journalists' wages remained low. In 2017, the median  wage for an editor was only $49,000, while the median wage for a  reporter was about $34,000. If you are in a place like the bay area,  Los Angeles, New York, D.C., or Boston, you can imagine what the cost  of living does to that kind of income for people whom we rely on to  provide us information.  [[Page H2981]]    There is hope, however: some newspaper groups like the one in  Philadelphia that has coordinated and consolidated with a nonprofit  model and is refocusing its mission on producing excellent journalism  to inform the public and focusing on local journalism.   There has been a spike in attendance in university journalism  programs in spite of the numbers I just told you since this President  took office in 2017.   Through programs to reengage citizens, particularly students, in the  importance of journalism and reimagining how we fund print and  electronic newspapers, we can ensure that journalism remains a bedrock  of the country and a check on its power as it always has been.   As someone from the bay area who has had a relationship with our  innovation and our tech companies, for Google and Facebook, they make  millions of dollars off of journalists, and we think that they should  contribute to that amazing asset that they have right now, largely free  of charge. So we look to them to partner with us so that these  platforms can be platforms not just for profit, but platforms for  democracy, where local journalists can put their wares out there and be  able to benefit from it just as they benefit from it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lofgren), who is my wonderful colleague from San Jose, in the San  Francisco Bay Area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for the nice  comments.   This bill is extremely important, and I am proud to follow the  gentleman's leadership in getting it passed and getting it signed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all my colleagues who  have joined me today. We started an informal group, actually, after the  instance that the congresswoman talked about in Denver.   The same ownership owns the Bay Area News Group and the Los Angeles  News Group, and there were similar layoffs there.   And in the Bay Area, being there, but also being there seeing the  demise of local news, seeing the Chronicle in San Francisco, still  owned by a local publisher, but then having the rest of the  newspapers--almost the entirety of what was the bedrock of local news  outside of San Francisco, for the other 7 million residents in the Bay  Area--almost 7 million people--they have seen these large layoffs like  Denver has.   I will say that, in my native town of Lowell, Massachusetts, the same  company owns that newspaper, and a similar event has happened there.   There is nothing wrong with people making money, wanting to make a  larger return on their investment; however, this is, I would argue, a  very unique institution for democracy.   As Jefferson said, ``Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press.  . . .''   As Brandeis said: How people get their information, these are not  things that you can separate. They are mutually intertwined.   So, we need the ability to have this, and particularly for local  government.   When I started almost 30 years ago in the city of Concord,  California, with a population of about 130,000 people, there was a  gentleman named Larry Spears who had written for years for the Oakland  Tribune and then for our local newspaper, The Contra Costa Times, a  county of about a million people--not a small county.   He was in the front row. There are still journalists in that front  row, but we need people--and more of them--in every front row. Mr.  Spears knew the relationships, how people got elected to city council,  who was appointed to the planning commission. Having him there made a  difference.   It is human nature that, if you don't have someone watching, you are  going to have human nature sometimes do things that it wouldn't if  somebody who was professionally charged and trained to be able to  explain to the general public what is happening and why it is happening  was there.    People will talk about the truth and deep truth, ``truth'' being the  simple explanation of what actually happened and ``deep truth'' being  the meaning of why people took those physical actions.   This is what journalism is about. It is both being able to explain  why a legislator or a city council member or a county supervisor did  what they did and why they voted. But, as important is understanding  why they did it. Did they do it for the reasons that they said that  were part of the agendized items, or were there other influences behind  their thoughts? And, can we explain ourselves so that the public can  understand why we took that choice.   And the ability of somebody to be able to communicate in an objective  way what we say is important to democracy.   So, I hope that today is the beginning of a discussion. Mr. Cicilline  talked about his bill that I am proud to be a coauthor of that we  introduced today. I think it is probably the most important.   We have many, many newspapers supporting it. We hope that there will  be, obviously, a wave of support. Editorial boards, we ask for your  help. Any interested citizen can contact my office. I have a simple  name to remember as far as Googling it.   Let us know how you can help. If you are at a journalism school, if  you are a journalist and you have ideas, give us ideas. These are  constitutionally difficult issues.   The Congress shouldn't be, as Congresswoman DeGette said, deciding  how the First Amendment is orchestrated, I should say, or organized.  But we should be supportive because, if we are successful, it is  because of independent journalism out there.   I would say that it is important that we have people who write, so  that people who read and cognitively accept complicated issues will not  become lazy.   We often get told that it is about our messaging, but messaging is a  two-way street. It requires the person who is speaking, or writing, to  be able to communicate in a succinct, profound, empathy-filled way, but  it also requires us, as citizens, to be listening and understand that  sometimes issues are complicated.   Well, how do you find that out? I would opine, as Mr. Postman did in  1985, that--and we know more about this now in terms of neuroscience  and cognitive development and exercise--the more we read, the more we  practice at our writing skills, the more we practice at our  communication skills in general, the deeper our knowledge and the  greater our capacity, cognitively, to understand and problem-solve.   So I would make the hope that this is the beginning of something that  we will do good bipartisan work on and will allow for newspapers, as  Jefferson said, to allow for democracy to exist and to prosper.   And lastly, in Lincoln's comment that I started with when he said: If  you let the people know the facts, the country will be safe--our  Speaker has a favorite quote where she says another Lincoln quote that  says: Public opinion means everything. No statute, no public  proclamation, Lincoln said, has any meaning if the people do not  support it and it has their sentiment.   I would argue this other quote from Lincoln is equally as important:  If the American people know the facts, the country will be safe.   We need to provide the professional journalism to make sure they get  those facts.
