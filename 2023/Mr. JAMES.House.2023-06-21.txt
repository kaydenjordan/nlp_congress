 Mr. Speaker, we had a slogan in Army aviation: ``High  Above the Best.'' It was a reminder that the American people entrusted  us, me and my men, to provide air support for the soldiers fighting for  their lives on the ground each and every single day. Likewise, in  Congress, our constituents, our customers, have entrusted our staff and  myself to provide air support to the good people in our district  fighting for their livelihoods each and every single day.   I stand here to say that my district staff has exemplified this  slogan, ``High Above the Best.'' In under 6 months in this office, my  team has already delivered on a monumental constituent casework  milestone in a freshman office.   Earlier this month, my team surpassed $100,000 in Federal casework  dollars returned to our constituents, to our customers. They are  providing that air support to Michigan's 10th Congressional District,  just like Army aviators.   It is a lot of work setting up a congressional office. Both our D.C.  and district teams have burned the midnight oil to get everything up  and running so  [[Page H3001]]  that we can serve you, our constituents, and deliver on the promises we  made.   On top of all the work that had to be done getting our district  office up and running, this staff delivered for the constituency and  has returned over $100,000 in Federal dollars and about a trillion-and- a-half passport requests.   I recognize each and every single member of my district staff by  name, in alphabetical other: Russ Cleary, Lisa Damon-Brown, Phil Rode,  Linda Torp, and Kris Zrinyi.   I thank them all for helping me serve Michigan's 10th Congressional  District, the greatest district in the United States of America.   Of the many cases my district team has closed this year, there are a  couple that I reviewed that really stuck out to me.   We got a call from a veteran in our district who hadn't received his  VA benefits in nearly 2 years. Together, my staff elevated this case  within the VA and got them to act. Now, this veteran in my district has  thousands in backpay and a monthly payment of roughly $2,000 that he  earned serving our country in uniform.   My team also helped a single mother of two get her tax return from  all the way back in 2015. This young mother is currently attending  nursing school to better the future for herself and her two children  and to serve her community. Between being a single mom and a student,  she didn't have enough time in her busy schedule to work with the IRS,  but she had time to give us a call. That is all that mattered. My  diligent team was able to step up for her and help her to retrieve  $9,000 from her tax return.   These are just two of the many stories and constituent cases that our  district office worked so diligently to close over just the past 5  months--in under 6 months, under half a year. I am so grateful for all  the work they have done for our constituents.   I am a combat veteran, but I am also a businessman, and I believe  that constituent services, customer service, is why I am here.   Customer service, serving constituents, is my number one priority in  Congress. I have served my country in combat, but the chance to serve  this community is the honor of my lifetime. We are ready to continue to  serve the good people of Michigan's 10th Congressional District. I  thank them for trusting me to be High Above the Best.                            ____________________
