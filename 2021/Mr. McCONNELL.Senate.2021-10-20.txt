 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Federal Government's own analysts  of the energy sector are predicting that this winter American families  could face home heating bills that are 54 percent higher than last  year--54 percent higher than just last year. On average, the price for  our households running on natural gas is expected to jump 30 percent.  For homes that use propane, a different assessment says the forecast  looks like ``propane-market Armageddon.''   As the head of one aid organization put it, ``After the beating that  people have taken in the pandemic, it's like: What's next?'' What is  next? Well, astonishingly, what is next is yet another reckless taxing- and-spending spree from Washington Democrats, including more  inflationary spending to push costs even higher and more anti-domestic- energy taxes and regulations that would only compound these problems.   That includes new, crushing taxes aimed at domestic natural gas  production. They want to reprise the Obama administration's War on  Coal. But this time the target is also--in addition to coal, the target  is also the natural gas that provides electricity for our communities  and heats families' homes. And then there are the new mandates and new  penalties that are essentially designed to make 49 States' electrical  grids move more in the direction of California's--paying higher costs  for less reliable power.   Now, unfortunately, this has been the Biden administration's playbook  going back to the very beginning. Remember, killing the Keystone XL  Pipeline and thousands of American jobs was a day one--a day one-- priority. Then it was the ban on new development of domestic energy  reserves and the hasty mission to rejoin the toothless Paris climate  accords, where virtually nobody--nobody--but America seems to be  remotely interested in achieving their nonbinding ``commitments.''   So for all the leftwing's apparent urgency to pass radical climate  policy, they seem not to care much about tackling the biggest sources  of the world's carbon emissions. The so-called international community  that had scraped together the failed Paris deal could only get the  world's most prolific polluter, that is, China, to agree--now, listen  to this--to curb its increase in emissions 9 years from now. That is  all they got out of China: an agreement to curb their emissions 9 years  from now.   That is what this administration calls a good deal? America signs up  for self-inflicted pain today, and China maybe--maybe--thinks about  beginning to follow suit in another decade.   So, listen, China continues to produce more than one-fourth--one- fourth--of the world's carbon output, roughly 2\1/2\ times as much as  the United States.   Instead of fighting back against our adversaries, Democrats' reckless  taxing-and-spending spree would just hand-deliver them one big gift  right after another, like the big new tax hikes on American businesses  that would leave our industries paying higher tax rates than businesses  in communist China; like doubling down on the anti-energy policies that  already have the Biden administration going hat in hand to Russia and  OPEC and begging them to up their own production for us.   As our colleague Senator Barrasso pointed out yesterday, before the  Biden administration took over, America was enjoying energy  independence for the first time in seven decades. Before the Biden  administration took over, America was enjoying energy independence for  the first time in seven decades, but now, we are heading the other way.  America has doubled our oil purchases from Russia on President Biden's  watch. We are twice as dependent on Russian oil today as we were before  this administration took power. And President Biden green-lighted  Putin's new gas pipeline that will give Moscow even more leverage over  the European continent.   So Democrats want our Nation on a path toward less energy  independence and higher costs for working families. Their reckless  taxing-and-spending spree would make it all dramatically worse.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, our country  would be much better off if our Democratic colleagues shelved their  radical wish list and focused on their fundamental responsibilities as  a one-party government. But while they continue to spin their wheels  negotiating this reckless taxing-and-spending spree, their most basic  jobs are being neglected.   This week, already months behind the usual pace, the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee released partisan drafts of spending bills  that are dead on arrival. They spend too much. They cut our  longstanding taxpayer protections like the Hyde amendment. They  shortchange our national defense even as we face serious and growing  threats from terrorism and from major competitors like China and  Russia. Most of these bills can't earn 50 votes, much less 60.   When Republicans ran the Senate, by this time of year, we had had  bipartisan frameworks in hand for months, and we were hammering out the  fine details across the aisle. Our Democratic colleagues are way, way  behind schedule, with no solution in sight.   It is also looking increasingly likely that we will reach Veterans  Day before the Senate takes up the National Defense Authorization Act-- now, never mind that this year's bill earned overwhelming, bipartisan  support in committee; never mind that it represents this body's single  most important opportunity to influence national security. Our troops  are being put in the back seat so the socialists can drive the car.   At the end of the month, because House liberals still cannot get  their act together and pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which  the Senate passed months ago, major highway projects and American  workers are scheduled to be thrown into limbo.   Our Democratic colleagues have unified control of the government-- unified control of the government. The country needs them to stop  arguing among themselves over how to waste trillions of dollars and get  about executing their most basic jobs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, later today,  the Democratic leader will have the Senate vote on the latest iteration  of his party's election takeover scheme.   Frankly, I have just about lost count of how many times our  Democratic colleagues have tried to truss up the same takeover with new  trappings. For multiple years running, Washington Democrats have  offered a rotating merry-go-round of rationale to explain why they need  to federalize voting laws and take over all of America's elections  themselves, but every time they try this shtick in the Senate, it falls  flat. Today will be no exception.   This latest umpteenth iteration is only a compromise in the sense  that the left and the far left argued among themselves about exactly  how much power to grab and in which areas. This latest bill still  subjects popular, commonsense election integrity protections like voter  ID to the whims of  [[Page S7096]]  Federal bureaucrats. It still sends government money to political  campaigns--government money, taxpayers' money, to political campaigns,  for goodness' sake. It still puts Washington in the middle of the  States' redistricting decisions and on and on. The same rotten core is  all still there.   The Senate knows how to make a law in a productive, bipartisan way.  We have done it this year on multiple subjects. We have done it on  election issues themselves in recent memory--the Help America Vote Act  20 years ago that Chris Dodd and I put together. We did that when there  was an actual problem that needed solving and an actual bipartisan  process. But as long as Senate Democrats remain fixated on their  radical agenda, this body will continue to do the job the Framers  assigned it and stop terrible ideas in their tracks.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
