 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5693, the  Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act. This bipartisan legislation will  expand veterans' access to medical foster homes, an alternative to  nursing home care, by allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs to  cover such care for up to 900 veterans every year.                                time  1230    The Medical Foster Homes program allows eligible veterans who require  day-to-day assistance to live in private homes with trained caregivers  who provide around-the-clock care and the services needed to help these  veterans with their daily tasks, such as getting dressed. The program  requires that caregivers be licensed and involved in frequent  inspections by the VA.   Most importantly, the Medical Foster Homes program provides aging  veterans the option to live in a private setting that may feel more  like a home than a nursing institution.   Additionally, the amended bill creates a fourth administration within  the VA, headed by a new Under Secretary, to administer the educational  and employment benefits currently managed by the Veterans Benefits  Administration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 5693.
