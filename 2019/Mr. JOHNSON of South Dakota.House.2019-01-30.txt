 Mr. Speaker, as my new Governor just  mentioned in her first budget address, in South Dakota, we don't spend  money we don't have.   South Dakota has never incurred any general obligation debt, and that  doesn't happen by accident. It takes decades of prudent and, sometimes,  unpopular decisions. I am proud to be a part of that history.   Now, in Washington, the story is a little different. We haven't  always had that same kind of intestinal fortitude, so our debt is $22  trillion.   Mr. Speaker, I know there is plenty of blame to go around, but I am  more interested in solutions. Taking our medicine--and we do need to  take our medicine--will not be easy, and we can't do it all at once,  but I am ready to take the tough votes. I am hopeful that some of my  colleagues are as well.   After all, fiscal responsibility is possible. Just ask South Dakota.                            ____________________
