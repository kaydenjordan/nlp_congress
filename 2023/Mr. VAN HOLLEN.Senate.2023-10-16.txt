 Mr. President, I rise today in memory of the  late David Harrington for his lifetime of service and contributions to  Prince George's County and the great State of Maryland.   Mr. Harrington's distinguished 16-year career in public service began  as mayor of the Town of Bladensburg. After 7 years as mayor, Mr.  Harrington went on to serve as county councilmember for 6 years and as  State senator for 3. Following his tenure as an elected official, Mr.  Harrington kept his focus on the growth and success of his community,  assuming the role of president and CEO of the Prince George's Chamber  of Commerce, where he cemented himself as the chamber's most impactful  leader. Under Mr. Harrington's leadership, the organization increased  its membership to 600, and revenue grew by 20 percent; he helped  spearhead 6 consecutive years of job growth in the county.   Mr. Harrington's legacy and commitment to fostering a better  community is further embodied by the Prince George's Junior Achievement  Finance Park located in Landover, MD. Mr. Harrington was pivotal in  helping to establish the facility, which provides local youth access to  financial literacy and other educational programs, nurturing their  future financial and academic success. Mr. Harrington's efforts are  beyond worthy of recognition through the dedication of the Prince  George's Junior Achievement Finance Park's Auditorium in his name.   I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Harrington's family for his  service. Mr. Harrington was passionate leader, mentor, and advocate.  Mr. Harrington was not only a revered public servant, but also a dear  friend. My thoughts are with Mr. Harrington's family, and may the  memory and name of Mr. David Harrington be remembered daily through his  dedication and the lasting impression he has made on the lives of  others.                            ____________________
