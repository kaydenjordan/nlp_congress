 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Police Week and formally honor our men and women who have  answered the notable call to serve in the law enforcement profession.   Every day, police officers patrol our streets, answer emergency  calls, put away criminals, and sacrifice their own safety in order to  protect members of their community. Law enforcement officers are our  communities' most essential line of defense against those who seek  violence or criminal activity.   This week is also an important time to pause and pay our respects to  the police officers who have laid down their lives in the line of duty.  May their sacrifice not be in vain and their memory be a blessing.   May we continue to recognize the heroic efforts of all members in the  police community and do all that we can to show our appreciation for  their sacrifices.   I will always stand with our men and women in blue, and may God  continue to keep them safe as they work tirelessly and with an  unwavering commitment to put service above self.   In God we trust.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my concerns about  the current state of the economy and the worker shortages that  employers face due to the Democrats' extended unemployment benefits.   As a small business owner for 51 years, I have seen a lot. I know  firsthand how challenging a year of government-mandated shutdowns have  been for business owners.   The enhanced unemployment benefits in last year's CARES Act were  meant to be temporary and targeted to the effects of this COVID-19  pandemic. Now, over a year later, and thanks to the success of  Operation Warp Speed and the Trump administration's focus on vaccine  development, the economy is ready to fully open. Yet, millions of  Americans who can return to work are choosing a government paycheck  over earning an income.   Unemployment was never meant to be a full-time job. We are telling  people it is a career, for crying out loud, and living off the  government for more than 26 weeks while you are capable of working will  only delay our economic recovery.   In Texas' 25th Congressional District, hundreds of small businesses  are feeling the effects. They simply cannot operate their businesses if  employees refuse to return to work. States need to enforce unemployment  laws. If employees are offered a job and they refuse it, unemployment  benefits should immediately expire.   Enhanced weekly payments will continue to eliminate the incentive to  return to work. Under no circumstances should they continue past  September.   Vaccines are widely available if people so choose, but there are no  longer excuses to remain on the sidelines.                                time  1915    Before the pandemic, we had the greatest economy in modern history.  Certainly the best I have seen in 51 years. For all the right reasons,  and with thanks to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by President  Trump and Republicans, we had more jobs than people.   However, under President Biden and House Democrats, we have more jobs  than people, because what they ultimately want is to make Americans  reliant on the government. It is simply called socialism. It is victims  versus patriots.   In God we trust.
