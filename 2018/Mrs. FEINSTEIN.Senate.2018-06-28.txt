 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Protect  Our Food From Phthalate Contamination Act. This bill would ban  chemicals called ortho-phthalates from materials that come in contact  with our food, because these phthalates have been found to actually  leach into what we eat.   Phthalates have been known to interfere with the body's hormones,  leading to a range of health concerns including reproductive harm.  These chemicals have also been linked to learning and behavior problems  in children and insulin resistance in adolescents and adults.   According to a recent study, individuals who regularly eat out had 30  percent higher phthalate levels. The findings for teenagers are  particularly troubling, where testing showed phthalate levels 55  percent higher than people who ate at home. Enjoying a meal out or  using packaged food to prepare meals on a busy schedule shouldn't come  with the cost of chemical exposure that can cause harm.   We've already banned certain phthalates from children's toys due to  serious health concerns, and now we need to remove the exposure through  the food we eat. Phthalates can be found throughout the food supply  chain, from the plastic gloves worn to handle food to the containers  and wrappings used for packaging.   This legislation would specifically ban the type of phthalates,  ortho-phthalates, currently being used in some food production and  packaging, and require that any substance used as a replacement is also  safe. The bill would implement the ban over the course of two years, so  that companies have time to phase out these harmful chemicals.   This bill is supported by several health and consumer organizations,  including the American Academy of Pediatrics, Breast Cancer Prevention  Partners, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Environmental  Health Strategy Center, Environmental Working Group, and Safer  Chemicals, Healthy Families.   I appreciate the support of my colleague, Senator Blumenthal, who is  an original cosponsor of the bill. I look forward to working with my  colleagues on this important issue. Thank you Mr. President and I yield  the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Wicker, Mr. King,          and Ms. Stabenow):   S. 3160. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  improve access to, and utilization of, bone mass measurement benefits  under part B of the Medicare program by establishing a minimum payment  amount under such part for bone mass measurement; to the Committee on  Finance.
