 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  irresponsible and immoral budget request proposed by President Trump.   The President's shameful betrayal of Americans most in need of vital  services comes just days after he stood in this very Chamber and  promised he would protect them.   A budget reveals our priorities, and this document makes clear  President Trump does not prioritize hardworking Americans and their  families. Once again, the President goes out of his way to target  Americans' access to healthcare and affordable education.   In the President's upside-down budget, $500 billion is stripped from  Medicare, $900 billion from Medicaid. Student loan funding is cut by  $170 billion. Public Service Loan Forgiveness would be completely  eliminated. More than $200 billion would be cut from the SNAP program,  the safety net for families facing temporary challenges putting food on  the table.   Madam Speaker, these cuts are wrong, and the House must not let them  go forward. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to  protect these critical programs that our seniors, working families,  young people, and children depend on.                            ____________________
