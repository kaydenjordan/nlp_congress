 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this morning on behalf of  the people of California's 18th Congressional District to pay tribute  to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Inscribed on the front of the building of the Supreme Court are the  words: ``Equal justice under the law.'' And that is what Justice  Ginsburg did. She brought equality relative to voting rights, to gender  equity, to civil rights. That was her work. She took it seriously using  her extraordinary intelligence, her faith, her belief in a more perfect  union.   We pay tribute to her in a unique way. In history, there are very few  individuals that are known by their initials: FDR, LBJ, JFK, and now  RBG.   As the poet wrote: And so she passed and all the trumpets sounded on  the other side.   Thank you, Justice Ginsburg, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________
