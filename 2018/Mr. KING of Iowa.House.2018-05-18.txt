 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to address you here  on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I always appreciate  that opportunity.   It is a right and a privilege of any Member of Congress to come down  here and address you from this floor about whatever issues might be on  our minds, and I have a couple of them on my mind here this afternoon,  Mr. Speaker. One of them is the circumstance that brought about the  loss of the farm bill here on the floor.   I come from the Fourth Congressional District of Iowa, and I will  make the case with anyone in this Congress, out of all 435 districts,  that we produce more agricultural products in the Fourth District than  any other. There are some folks in the San Joaquin Valley who we have  an interesting discussion with, and I tip my hat to their progress but  still stand in defense of the Fourth District of Iowa.   The corn we raise, the soybeans we raise, the pork that we produce,  the eggs that come out of there, all of that sets the standard for the  rest of the country. And I am giving the credit to the producers, the  families that raised the farmers that we have today who went off to  school and came back with the technology in their brain and developed  the technology to bring this kind of crop out of this ground.   I have two ears of corn down in my man cave, Mr. Speaker, and they  are beside each other on a nail. I would say half the people in this  Congress would guess wrong on which was which. One of them is an open- pollinated variety that they used to plant back in 1848, and the other  one is a triple-stack hybrid that came out of the 2015 crop, neither  one of them irrigated. God's rainfall raised them.   That one ear that is just as big as the other one and actually has  got more rows around it is the open-pollinated from 1848, and it  yielded between 15 and 25 bushels to the acre.   Then you look at the 2015 ear. It is roughly the same length, with  fewer rows of kernels around it, and that yielded not 15 to 25 bushels,  but 232 bushels to the acre, over the scales. That is how far we have  come with agriculture technology.   You can divide your 15 or 20 to 25 bushels into the 230. It is almost  10 times. You might make the argument that we have got 10 times the  yield today that we had back when the pioneers rolled across the  prairie in their covered wagons and began to figure out how to bring  crops out of this ground. That is an example of what has taken place.   We have tractors running around out in the field now. No markers. The  markers used to always--there used to be planter wire and cross- checked. Then the markers would mark until we came back around, and you  lined up on that mark from the last round so that all the rows were  nice and beautiful and parallel and straight. Everybody took pride in  having fields where they could look down those rows and see that  wonderful crop of corn and soybeans and other crops coming out of the  ground.   Now there are not markers on a lot of our planters, and some of the  planters are running around with the markers folded up because we are  being guided by GPS. That is just some of the technology.   We are applying fertilizer differently as the soil types change going  across the field. We have got the ability to change and adjust the  numbers of corn according to the soil type, too. We are using less  fertilizer than we did. We are taking care of the water quality.   Lots of good things are coming up out of the ground, and that means  food for America and Americans. This farm bill is designed to stabilize  our family farm operations so that they can stay in business. It is not  good enough just to be in business next year, but to be in business  next generation. This is the center and the heart and soul of America.   This is the American Dream: the family farm on that land looking back  through their generations and seeing  [[Page H4237]]  they are the fourth generation, the fifth generation family farm, the  sixth, the seventh generation.   I stood in a machine shed that has had some pretty good feedlots  around it and a lot of good farm ground around it and talked to--well,  I guess I saw, because the seventh generation hadn't quite learned to  talk yet, seven generations on the family farm. I have watched them  also as they stood there together and held hands and cried as the  auctioneer sold off their life's work, when we didn't have a program in  place that could stabilize their hard work, their smart work, their  dedication.   Nobody can do this like a family farm can. There is not a corporation  that can go out there and hire people and be vertically integrated and  somehow get this thing scaled up to the size that they can be more  efficient than what is going on right now with our family farms in  America because, when it is in your culture, when it is in your blood,  you make hay when the Sun shines.   In fact, the culture is so strong in my neighborhood, we had a case  in court. I was sitting in the courtroom in Sac County a number of  years ago, and the lawyers were bickering back and forth and the judge  was deliberating and maybe dithering a little bit. My lawyer said: Come  on. Let's get this done. I have got hay down.   Well, you have got hay down. We know what that means. You have got to  get it back up again before it rains. When the weather is there, you  have got to move. And if the Sun goes down and you can still go, you  keep going because you are looking at the clouds coming on the horizon.   By the way, we have got technology to address that, too. Now we have  got the setup with the technology, teamed up with Monsanto and with  Google, to put together a corporation that watches the weather report  and indexes that in and sends a message off to the farmer's cellphone  in a text that says: You are going to get 1\1/2\ inches of rain  tonight, and you have got 6 hours, 7 hours, or 10 or 12 hours to side- dress 20 pounds of nitrogen.    That is what your crop needs because we have been monitoring it for  these years, and we have calculated the Sun days, the heat units, the  humidity, and the growth patterns. This is a scientific, now, very  sophisticated industry.   And that is just crop farming. Then you have got the livestock side  of this as well.   We worked long and hard to put this farm bill together, Mr. Speaker,  and all of the hearings that were held on it. The big things that we  need to make sure that we sustain and extend are crop insurance, number  one, because crop insurance is the number one risk management tool for  our producers.   If you don't have an ability to ensure your crop and go to the bank  and be able to predict that you have got a reasonable chance of at  least servicing your loan and paying your input costs and taking a few  dollars out to feed the kids, if you can't do that, the bankers can't  stand with you. So Federal crop insurance is an essential component of  our family farm operations. It is not something that they can get along  without, because we have seen these markets cycle.   We have seen the markets cycle in these ways. For example, January 4,  1980, Jimmy Carter embargoed grain sales to Russia. Excuse me. I am in  the modern vernacular. It was the Soviet Union. All the Soviet Union,  no U.S. grain goes in there.   They were our number one market at the time, so that embargo shut off  that market for our producers in the farms all across this country, and  we saw the commodities prices on the Chicago Board of Trade go into a  tailspin. It nose-dived down into the gutter.   To get back out of that and get those markets put back together again  didn't really happen in the way we might anticipate. It was not a  bounce back. It was a struggle back. We lost family farm after family  farm. I watched farm sale after farm sale.   I went to those sales. We went in some of those building sites that  the family farms were pushed off of. Some of them, the acreage was sold  off to somebody that had a little cash, and they came in and tried to  fix up the place a little bit and tried to live there. It worked for  some. In fact, it worked where I live. But it didn't work for everyone.   Some of them were burned. Some were buried. We did a lot of that. I  can drive you around the countryside, Mr. Speaker, and I can point to  those places now that you just see as dirt, and I can tell you who  lived there, the kids' names who were there, where they went off to  school--maybe Iowa State, University of Iowa, maybe UNI--also, maybe  off to the coast somewhere.   Too many of our children went off to get an education and didn't look  back, and now my neighbors, if they are still neighbors, buy a plane  ticket to see their grandchildren. That is the result of what happened  when we had the grain embargo in 1980 that was brought to us by Jimmy  Carter.   We had subsidies that had to be poured into the Midwest in huge  amounts. Even today, we would be stunned if I were to say into the  Record the amount of money that was put in to try to bail out the  disaster that we had in agriculture.   And land change prices. CRP came in, in the pick year of 1983; and  with that, land prices tumbled down to, I can say, a third of what they  were at their peak.   When government stepped in and put CRP in place, some of it was for  conservation; and we preserve a significant amount of it in this farm  bill. But, Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers paid for some of those farms a  couple of different times as a result of what happened with the grain  embargo in 1980.   Well, today we have a trade circumstance. That trade circumstance  started, I believe, not for the negotiations of NAFTA, but the tariff  that the President put on steel and aluminum--and that was globally-- for all countries that were exporting their steel or aluminum into the  United States, a 25 percent tariff on it.   Then, after 2 or 3 days, the President--the Canadians--not as much  the Mexicans, but the Mexicans, too--objected to the tariff that went  on them. They were negotiating NAFTA. So after 2 or 3 days, the  President lifted that tariff off of Canada and Mexico for the countries  that are involved in NAFTA.   That, I think, was designed to try to get the Canadians to the table  on NAFTA. Perhaps that has been useful, and it worked; but we also knew  that a tariff on steel and aluminum coming in out of China was going to  bring about retaliatory trade moves on the part of the Chinese, and  they acted in a predictable fashion. They slapped a tariff on our U.S.  ag products going from the United States into China.   And so here I am, Mr. Speaker, representing the Fourth Congressional  District of Iowa, all of northwest Iowa, almost all of north-central  Iowa, some of northeast Iowa. And when I look at the map that was put  out by Bloomberg that showed the counties in America that went Democrat  in blue, the counties in America that went Republican in red--and that  would be, of course, the Trump election--and over the top of that they  laid out a focus in, I will say, I believe they were yellow dots, that  was the production of soybeans, the concentration of the production of  soybeans.   It is clear that the dead center, the center of the hub of the middle  of the bull's eye, that those tariffs that the Chinese put on soybeans  and pork, especially, went right into the Fourth District and right  into Iowa. And then it spreads out: Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana.   We all know what the corn belt looks like. The soybean belt is a  little different, but that is where most of it is still raised. So we  take this hit in our neighborhood, and our producers are holding  together pretty well because they understand that our President is a  multifaceted, multidimensional trade negotiator.   So the trade negotiations that started with NAFTA and the tariff on  steel and aluminum that included the Canadians and the Mexicans in the  beginning for 2 or 3 days are part of, also, what has happened with the  retaliatory tariffs that the Chinese put on, especially, soybeans and  on pork.    That brought the South Koreans to the table, too, and they said: Give  us some relief on the tariffs on the steel. The South Koreans are the  third largest exporter of steel to the United States.  [[Page H4238]]    While they were there, they offered up the invitation for--they had  it in their pocket, evidently--President Trump to sit down with Kim  Jong Un. The President said: Yes, I will do that. Stuck his head in the  press room and told the press: I am going to meet with Kim Jong Un.   Now, we are pretty confident that that is going to happen in  Singapore on June 12. All of this is wrapped up together, Mr. Speaker,  and much more besides: national defense, national security, the  denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula. It also plays into the  Iranian nuclear agreement that was signed by, I believe, John Kerry,  technically, but under the Obama administration.   You put this all together, and I have just given a quick snapshot,  Mr. Speaker, on the multiple layers of strategy and negotiations that  are part of this President.   Meanwhile, the message that is sent overseas to the Chinese, for  example, who are putting pressure on the very producers that need to  have stability, that need to have their Federal crop insurance, and  those that need to know that we have got an EQIP program and those that  need to be able to measure what we are going to do with our CRP  program, for example, our conservation programs, all of this is only 20  percent of the overall farm bill, and the other 80 percent goes to  nutrition.   When I came to this town, there were 19 million people on food  stamps; and we called them food stamps then. Nineteen million. At the  peak of the Obama administration, which would be about the seventh year  of the Obama administration, those 19 million on food stamps had become  47 million on SNAP; and the cost to the taxpayer grew, of course,  proportionally and even faster because of the inflationary aspect of  this. So we found ourselves at 2\1/2\ times more people on food stamps  than there were when I came to this Congress in 2003.   How do we fund that? We are watching our deficits go sky-high: $20  trillion, on the way to $21 trillion, in deficit spending.   And where do we get the money to pay the bills that are pushing us  into the deficit and running up $20 trillion in national debt? Not  deficit spending, Mr. Speaker.   Where do we get the money to service the national debt, and where do  we get the money to pay the bills as we watch our national debt go up  over $20 trillion? Well, the primary places are China, Saudi Arabia.  About half of this comes from the American people investing in bonds  and securities.   So we are borrowing money from China to buy people food stamps, and  all we ask in this bill is that they work.                                time  1300    Now, why should a farmer work and watch the stability underneath him  that is the farm bill, that is the Federal crop insurance piece, that  is EQIP, that is a conservation program that has a MAP program on it,  the Market Access Program, why should that farmer be out there  sweating--sweating bullets sometimes--wondering if he can make it with  markets that are 50 percent of what they were just a few years ago when  other people aren't working at all? Why should the sweat of the  farmer's brow pay for the food of the person that refuses to work?   The American people know this, Mr. Speaker. It is not a complicated  thing. If you poll that out there and you ask them, 80 to 90 percent of  the American people, they say: Yes, you ought to have to work if you  are going to eat. It is Biblical, it is John Smith's rule, and it is  the rule within the culture of the American people. It is just a rule  that is hard to get passed here on the floor of the House.   We don't force anybody off of food stamps. We only look at the people  that are able-bodied, between the ages of, I believe it is, 18 to 59. I  know it is not any older than 59. And we say: If you want to get food  stamps, then, fine, we will give them to you, but you have to work 20  hours a week or go to school 20 hours a week, or some combination of  your own improvement 20 hours a week.   Well, 20 hours a week, is that too much to ask, Mr. Speaker, for  someone to put in 20 hours a week in order to eat for free all the  other hours of the week? I think it is entirely reasonable. And,  furthermore, all work has dignity, all work has honor, all work  enhances the character and the work ethic of the people doing it. There  is no shame in being productive. There is honor in being productive.   But 20 hours a week, that is only a day's work for a farmer that is  in the field that is out there planting corn or planting soybeans or  harvesting those beans when you see the weather coming in, or combining  corn in the fall. When you go, you go, and there are a lot that put in  20-hour days, and I know because I keep up with them and so do our  crews from time to time. When we have to, you do what you need to do.   So, here we are, a bill that has been shot down here on the floor.  This is the second time this has happened in the last, I will say, 5  years, a farm bill comes out here to the floor. We just need some  Democrats that will support work, and we would have passed this bill  here today.   But looking at the roster of those that voted ``no,'' every Democrat  voted ``no'' on this farm bill. And they didn't vote ``no'' because  they didn't like what was in on the ag side. They voted ``no'' because  there were work environments on the food stamp side.   So when I came to this Congress, there were Democrats here that  believed in work, and they would vote accordingly. We had about 53 Blue  Dog Democrats, moderate Democrats that wanted to get to a balanced  budget, and their agenda was: Let's cut some spending and let's raise  some taxes. Let's get to balance. My agenda was: Let's cut some  spending and get to balance, but we can do business.   Too many of them were forced to vote for ObamaCare. When they did  that, they essentially walked the plank. When they voted for ObamaCare,  the American people rose up and voted them out of office and put in  conservative Republicans instead. Some of those conservative  Republicans decided they wanted to leverage this farm bill for a vote  on a bill that includes at least two components of amnesty.   I am wondering: Where have we gone, America? Where have we gone that  we can't take care of our farmers? Where have we gone that we can't  require a little bit of work to go along with a lot of free food? Where  have we gone when we say that 20 hours a week to get free food--when  you ask a farmer to work 20 hours a day when the weather let's him do  that, and to suspend his risk management program at least--it is not  suspended here, technically. I mean, it goes on. But the message is to  spend it, and the doubt hangs out, and they won't sleep as well  tonight, and they won't have as good a weekend.   And the people that are getting food stamps without work, they are  probably snickering a little bit. They might be sitting on the couch in  their front lawn right now going: You know what, those Republicans  aren't going to be able to make me work, and all those Democrats are  going to protect me so I don't have to work.   I regret the direction that this culture and civilization is going if  work is so disparaged by one party that we can't have a tiny little bit  of it plugged into a fully funded welfare program that went from 19  million people on food stamps in 2003, on up to 47 million at its peak,  and now down around 45 and change, as I recall.   Forty-five million people on food stamps. And now, another one of  these arguments is: Well, we have to bring in workers from overseas.  That is one of the bills that some of the folks that voted against the  farm bill today, Mr. Speaker, it's one of the bills that they want to  bring to the floor. It brings in guest workers.   Well, actually, initially, it won't bring them in. It will amnesty  the ones that are here. People that are working illegally here, a lot  of them, in fact, I will say it with confidence, with utter confidence,  most of them operating on somebody else's Social Security number,  guilty of the felony of document fraud, would get a pass to stay in  America or do a touchback and come back to America.   And, you know, the only ones that would leave to do a touchback and  come back are the ones that will be precertified to have a free pass  coming back into the United States, 410,000--410,000 would get that  pass in a bill that they want to see come to the floor  [[Page H4239]]  maybe next week. And there is another 40,000 that would go into food  processing.   So we have not had guest workers come into food processing. That is  low-skilled work, as a rule. Now, if you are going to fill the ranks of  low-skilled workers, then I suggest that we put Americans to work  at that. The highest unemployment rates, the double-digit unemployment  that you look at are the lowest skilled workers, and people say: We  don't have anybody in America that is willing to do the work.    Well, why not? This is not that complicated an equation. We have  between--disagreement here--but nobody thinks there is less than 70  different means-tested Federal welfare programs in this country. Nobody  thinks there is less than 70. Some people take that number all the way  to 87. But between 70 and 87 means-tested Federal welfare programs  exist in this country. Not one person has memorized the names of them  yet; let alone, understands how they work, how they interact with each  other, how they might motivate or demotivate people that we ought to be  asking to go to work.   So, what we are doing is we are bribing Americans. We are paying them  not to work with welfare programs. And if we didn't have anybody out  there to pay not to work and we didn't have that labor, then I could  maybe understand the argument that somebody 1,500 miles away in a  foreign country that doesn't speak English, that has a 6th grade  education and no skills, should be coming into the United States to do  some of that work, but that is not the case.   We did the chart on this, Mr. Speaker, and I believe I have  introduced it into the Congressional Record, and it works like this. It  is a big pie chart, and it is out on the internet, but there are 326  million Americans, according to the most recent estimate of the U.S.  Census Bureau, and out of them, I will ask: What are they doing?   Well, there are 153 million of them that are employed. Now, they  might be not fully employed, but they are employed. So 153 million of  them working. All right. I take those off to the side. Seven million of  them, though, are on unemployment, drawing unemployment checks right  now, right, just a hair under 7 million. They ought to be going to  work.   Second one is, there are 46 million Americans who are simply not in  the workforce. They have opted not to look for a job, not to work,  whatever the reason is. Maybe they are already wealthy enough that they  don't need to work anymore. They could possibly be in school or  enhancing their education, but chances are, a whole lot of them are on  some of those 70 to 87 different welfare programs that we have.   So they are drawing down some combination of that. Maybe they are  working in the black market for cash somewhere, and they don't show up  on the record, 46 million of them.   Then there is another 14 million. They are starting to get a little  bit older now, but some of them do want to work and can. That is those  between the ages of 65 and 74. Walmart hires at 74, unemployment gets  paid at 74, so we put that in there to calculate also, Mr. Speaker.   And then there are 23 million Americans on disability. And I can't  believe, when I see double-amputee wounded warriors roll themselves to  work every day, that all 23 million of those that are on disability  payment, that none of them can work. Some can, and we ought to go back  and take another look at them.   By the time I add all of this up--there is a couple of other lesser  categories there--by the time I add all of this up, there are 107  million Americans of working age who are simply not in the workforce,  and they are in categories that we can hire from every one of those  categories. We just can't hire everyone from any of those categories,  but starting with unemployment, then the 46 million, and on down the  line.   So I say to people: If you need one worker, can you find him out of  107 million? If you need 100 workers, can't you find them out of 107  million? If you need 1,000 workers, can't you find them out of 107  million? And, of course, that answer is: Yes, we can.   But somehow we have the employment force, or the employer force in  America that has convinced themselves that they don't want the American  worker, and they are not willing to come to this Congress and work with  us to tighten down this welfare system. This welfare system was created  to be a safety net, not a hammock, and because of these additions to  the welfare systems, going up to the 70 to 87 of them, and the benefits  coming out of there, people that have the safety net has been ratcheted  up and up and up till it has become a hammock. We have tens of millions  of Americans that are lying in the hammock. They might be the third  generation that has not worked.   There was a study that was done, Mr. Speaker, in Milwaukee that  carved out a 36-square-block residential area of Milwaukee, six blocks  by six blocks, and they went in and interviewed each one of those  residents in those households. Now, these are people that came up from  the Gulf Coast when they lifted prohibition in the 1930s to take on the  good brewery jobs that were formed in Milwaukee. And, by the way, the  GDP of the beer in Wisconsin today is over $7 billion, so it is a huge  industry. But they came up to work there three generations ago.   The company that went in to survey those, every home in those 36  square blocks, came to this conclusion: There wasn't a single employed  male head of household in any of those homes in 36 square blocks in  Milwaukee--third generation.   Why not? They moved up there for the jobs. The story lamented that we  couldn't bring jobs to them. I read it and thought: If their  grandfathers could move up there for jobs, why can't they go to where  the jobs are? There are plenty of jobs in America.   And the reason they can't is because they are rooted in the home. The  home may be paid for or partially paid for, and they have established  themselves a comfort zone on a welfare system and supplemented however  they need to to get to that place where they are in a comfort place.   We don't need to have policies that encourage that. We don't need to  have people that haven't worked in three generations. We need to have  the industrious can-do American spirit driving an economy and  free enterprise and being rewarded for the work they do.    I don't any longer put out any statements that say: Hardworking  Americans; hardworking Iowans. There are a lot of hardworking Americans  and hardworking Iowans, Mr. Speaker, but it is also important to work  smart. I want to see smart working, hardworking people all over this  country, and our job needs to be to increase the per capita GDP, the  average per capita GDP of our people, and that comes about by starting  with work on food stamps and taking that philosophy, make it a success,  and move it over into many of the other welfare programs.   Another one is: You can take all those welfare programs, the 70 to 87  of them that are there, converge them all into one committee here in  Congress, and then start dropping off the ones that aren't working and  measuring them and shake it all down to about five different programs,  instead of 70 or 87 of them. Those things will work.   We are here today with a farm bill that went down on this floor. It  went down because no Democrat supports work. It went down because some  Republicans wanted to leverage this farm bill in order to get a bill  out on the floor to vote on that has within it two components of  amnesty.   And I oppose amnesty because it destroys the rule of law. When Ronald  Reagan signed the Amnesty Act in 1986--he only let me down two times in  8 years, and I revere that man in his legacy. But I believed that as  the debate went on in the House and the Senate, that Ronald Reagan  would see with utter principled clarity that if you reward lawbreakers,  you are destroying the rule of law, and there will be another amnesty  and another and another and more people will come for it.   And they have, and there have been six minor amnesties since that  period of time. But this is the big one sitting here: Amnesty for  people that are in America illegally; amnesty for DACA recipients. They  say they came here when they were 3 years old; their mother led them  across the Rio Grande River.   I actually have seen the data. I don't know of any other Member of  Congress,  [[Page H4240]]  I don't believe, has seen the data. We have been digging it out for  months on end, and I think I will soon be able to make it public. Some  of them were brought here at 3 years old. Some of them were girls at  that age. Some of them, it was their mother. But that doesn't represent  that universe of DACA recipients.   And what I do know is, of those large numbers, especially of males  that came here illegally, they were 14, 15, 16, and been more years  old, that they knew what they were doing and they were responsible for  what they were doing. I want to restore the rule of law, pass the farm  bill, and I want to get people back to work, and I want to have allies  on this floor that support work, whether they are Democrats or  Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 16 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, May  21, 2018, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________            H.R. 5750.        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant       to the following:        Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of United States       Constitution
