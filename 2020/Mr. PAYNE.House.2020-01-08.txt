 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my colleagues for  passing my important cancer screening bill as part of the critical  healthcare bill.   The Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act was added to  the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, H.R. 3, right before  it passed on December 12.   My bill would allow Medicare to cover the costs when cancerous polyps  are removed during colorectal cancer screenings. No longer will  patients have to wake up to a surprise charge after their screening.  These are charges that could cost from $400 to $20,000. It will improve  the health and save the lives of millions of Americans.   My father, former Congressman Donald Payne, Sr., died from colorectal  cancer. I introduced this bill so that more fathers, brothers, and sons  can survive this deadly cancer.                            ____________________
