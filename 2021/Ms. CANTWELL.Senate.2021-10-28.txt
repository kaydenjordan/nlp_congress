 Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  talk about the affordable housing crisis in the USA.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in  the Record. It is from 44 different mayors representing 20 different  States and the District of Columbia, talking about those housing  priorities that we need to see in legislation that we will be voting  on, including, No. 1, strengthening and expanding the low-income  housing tax credit.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   October 23, 2021.       Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,      President of the United States of America, Washington, DC.       Hon. Charles Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President, Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi: As       44 mayors representing communities across 20 states and the       District of Columbia, we are writing to urge you to include       our top housing priorities in any infrastructure investment.       During this time of uncertainty and financial instability,       the need to ensure all Americans can access safe, affordable       housing is greater than ever. Housing investments are       critical to the recovery of our cities and a top priority for       our residents. We respectfully request that you prioritize       them in the Build Back Better package, specifically:        1. Strengthen and Expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit       (Housing Credit). The Housing Credit is our nation's primary       tool for creating and preserving affordable housing and a       critical building block to achieve multiple goals from the       Build Back Better agenda--stabilizing families, climate       resiliency, better physical and mental health outcomes, child       development, and racial justice and economic opportunity.       Further, Congress must act to increase Housing Credit       authority this year or we will see a cut to production with       the expiration of the temporary volume cap increase       implemented in 2018, which will happen at the end of this       year. States are also increasingly becoming bond-cap       constrained and lowering the 50 percent bond-financing test       would result in immediate production for those communities.       In all, the production provisions proposed by the House would       create an additional 1.4 million homes for 3.2 million people       and generate 2 million jobs.        2. Include Robust Funding for the HOME Investment       Partnerships (HOME) and Community Development Block Grant       (CDBG) Programs. HOME and CDBG are proven tools in helping       states and communities address their most pressing housing       challenges, providing states and localities with the       necessary flexibility and resources. Currently, Build Back       Better includes $34.77 billion for HOME--which estimates       predict could help state and local governments develop nearly       107,000 new affordable housing units, while also providing       tenant-based rental assistance to over 300,000 low-income       families--and $8.5 billion for CDBG. HOME and CDBG are smart       investments that leverage billions more in public and private       dollars and jumpstart the economy. In fact, HOME leverages       more than $4.50 in public and private funds for every dollar       of HOME funding and has supported roughly 1.9 million jobs       and generated $123.6 billion in local income, according to       the HOME Coalition's most recent analysis. Likewise, every       dollar of CDBG leverages $4.09 in public and private sources       and has benefited 51.5 million persons through infrastructure       improvements and another 1.6 million households through       housing investments. Investment in these critical programs       would mean better infrastructure, more jobs, increased access       to key services, and additional units of affordable housing.        3. Provide Housing Stability for Families by Investing in       Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV) and Project-Based Rental       Assistance (PBRA). We strongly support the $90 billion       housing investment in HCVs and PBRA passed by the House       Financial Services Committee in recognition of the critical       importance of investing in decent, accessible affordable       housing for those with the greatest needs--people       experiencing homelessness and people with the lowest incomes.       Taken together, transformative investments in HCVs and PBRA       would mark the beginning of the elimination of homelessness       once and for all. It would also provide a level of housing       resilience that would enable renters to weather the next       recession, pandemic, or disaster.        Our country cannot address poverty without also addressing       our homelessness and housing crisis, and the investments in       this bill to support families and build back our       infrastructure will be diminished if families cannot afford a       place to call home.        With a bold investment in housing, the federal government       can effectively end housing instability in our country. The       federal government has the opportunity to make that       aspiration a reality.        Thank you for your time and leadership.

Mr. President, I come to the floor because many of my  colleagues--29 have joined a bill that myself and Senator Young  sponsored, and, I think, 132 Members in the House of Representatives  joined, all saying we need to incent more affordable housing.   Why do we need to incent more affordable housing?   If you don't incent it with the tax credit, people won't build it,  particularly in a place like Seattle, where you can build other things  and get a whole lot more money.   We need a workforce and we need the workforce to be in Seattle. We  don't need them to be four counties away and drive in every day and  clog our roads with added traffic that didn't need to be there. We need  to build people close to their homes and need the flexibility of the  affordable housing tax credit, which has been, in my mind, very helpful  in being very specific in every community.   You can build affordable housing just for returning veterans. You can  build affordable housing for workforce needs. You can build affordable  housing just to house previously homeless people. You can build  affordable housing to take students who are still going to school and  don't have a place to live, making them have affordable opportunities.   The affordable housing tax credit is the primary tool with which we  build housing. Let me say, 90 percent of the affordable housing that  gets built in the USA gets built with the tax credit. That is right.  Ninety percent of the affordable housing that gets built in the United  States with the tax credit is built with--90 percent of affordable  housing gets built with the tax credit.   That means even if we have other programs in the legislation that we  have been talking about between the House and the Senate--like the home  grant program or vouchers or things of that nature--if you don't use  this aspect of the program, you are not going  [[Page S7445]]  to be able to build that housing, so it has been incredibly popular.   That is why we have to increase the amount of capital we are going to  put towards the tax incentive. The reason why we have to do that is  that the United States has a supply shortage.   You can ask: Why did we get to this supply shortage?   If you ask me, it was really accentuated in the downturn of 2008,  when so many more individuals fell out of the job market, creating more  demand for affordable housing at that price point. We also, at that  point, had a lot of returning veterans, and we had really some very big  changes in the diversification of our economy. We had a lot of mental  health that had been deinstitutionalized and pushed in a different  direction. And we had changes in policy as we saw the challenges of an  aging population, really, living a lot longer than people anticipated  and they are also needing housing.   We had all these issues combined to this dramatic effect of 6.8  million affordable housing shortage in the United States of America.  That is the amount of units that we actually have to build.   I wish I could say these problems go away if you just don't--if you  say: Well, if they don't build the housing, it will just take care of  itself.   No, it doesn't take care of itself. If these people end up being  homeless, it costs 30 percent more to deal with them in our hospitals  and in jails. In various places, the people who are truly homeless and  living on the streets are extra costs.   We actually had hospitals support building affordable housing just so  people wouldn't be in their emergency room every day. That is how much  it was worth to hospitals to have affordable housing.   So the crisis, as we know in America, is that there are now 10.5  million Americans who pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent.  That means they are rent-burdened. This number has just continued to go  up in the charts for years in growth and, basically, continued to  exacerbate the problem. Why? Because people will tell you, you can't  spend 50 percent of your income in rent.   These dynamics are what is plaguing us in the United States; and it  is a problem that, until we increase the affordable housing tax credit,  you are not going to get the relief that you think you can get out of  this situation.   Our legislation--myself and Senator Young's legislation--would have  increased the tax credit by 50 percent over a 10-year period of time.  That would have helped us build a million more units of affordable  housing and try to address this problem in the near term.   I hope our colleagues will--as we work through both the proposals  that have been part of our infrastructure bill and the reconciliation  act--will look and see that we need to include the low-income housing  tax credit as part of that proposal. If we don't have the affordable  housing tax credit as part of that proposal, we are not going to have  the robust solutions that we need.   While I understand there are very geographic differences across the  United States--the East Coast may have some particular aspects that  will be very benefited, and the West Coast has other aspects that would  benefit--we all can benefit from the low-income housing tax program.  That is what is so unique about it.   Every State has used it with great flexibility. Every State has used  it to solve their problems, and the incentives have helped us stimulate  the economy. It is literally worth billions of dollars of economic  activity, and that is why we also should be making this investment.   Many times when our country has faced a downturn in the sixties or  seventies or eighties, you would hear a shout-out for housing. People  would say: Let's build housing.   Well, you haven't heard that shout-out in the last decade or so. You  literally haven't for a bunch of different reasons. No one has been  trumpeting: We need more housing.   I tell you, Mr. President, we need more affordable housing for those  individuals. And I have met so many in my State whose lives have been  changed--literally changed.   A woman basically got out of an abusive relationship and moved in  with her father in Walla Walla, but knew it wasn't sustainable. She  lived in Billingham. Basically, the affordable housing program in Walla  Walla got her and her son into a home. She started school. She got a  job, changed her life.   I have seen it recently in Spokane. Take a couple who basically had  become homeless. They separated. They had children that couldn't all  live together. They brought them back together under one roof. And in  this particular housing project, the promise was made by the partners  that everybody in that particular housing would get access not only to  help them get a high school education, but a college education as well.   That is what you can do with these projects. You can tailor-make them  with community partners to address the needs of your specific  community.   So this tax credit is bipartisan. It worked successfully. I would say  it is one of the most successful programs that we had in the United  States for getting affordable housing. Let's not leave it off the  table. Let's put it in this legislation and make sure it gets to the  goal line of the President's desk and is signed into law.   I yield the floor.
