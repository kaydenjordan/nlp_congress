 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for  yielding and for her tremendous leadership.   The post office is as American as motherhood, baseball, and apple  pie. It is one of the only entities actually mentioned in the United  States Constitution. It has been around for hundreds of years. The  first Postmaster General was Dr. Ben Franklin. It is part of the heart  and soul of this country, and the attacks on the post office by the  Trump administration are shameful.   The American people deserve a Postal Service that delivers Social  Security checks to senior citizens, delivers medicine to disabled  veterans, delivers unemployment insurance checks to displaced  Americans, and, yes, delivers ballots to those who choose to vote by  mail in the midst of a deadly pandemic, because no American should ever  have to choose between their health, safety, and well-being on the one  hand and the constitutional right to vote on the other.   This is why we need a fully functional Postal Service. Don't mess  with USPS.
