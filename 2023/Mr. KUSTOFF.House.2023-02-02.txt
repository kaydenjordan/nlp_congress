 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution  to remove Congresswoman Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee  for her anti-Semitic speech, comments, and rhetoric.   No doubt, words have meaning. When a Member of Congress stands in  this Chamber or at home or in their district, the Nation and the world  pays attention to what they say and how they say it.   When a Member of Congress makes hateful and anti-Semitic remarks,  they are amplified. They are magnified even more so when that Member  sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the committee tasked with  helping set policy and providing oversight over our Nation's  relationship with Israel and with Jewish communities around the world.   It is imperative that this body not only speaks against anti-Semitism  but also holds accountable those who spread such hateful beliefs.   As our Nation's leaders, we have the ability and the responsibility  to help combat anti-Semitism and ensure that our children, tomorrow's  leaders, are taught that such rhetoric is unacceptable.   Let's be clear: Anti-Semitism has no place in the Halls of Congress  nor in our national conversation.   I stand here today, in solidarity with the Jewish community, to send  a strong message that the United States House of Representatives does  not tolerate such behavior.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.
