Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee met and  produced a rule, House Resolution 597, providing for consideration of  two measures, H.R. 3935 and H.R. 3941.   The rule provides for H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust  Leadership in American Aviation Act, to be considered under a  structured rule with 104 amendments made in order. It provides 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,  or their designees, and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3941, the Schools  Not Shelters Act, under a structured rule with 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, or their designees.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying pieces of legislation.   H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American  Aviation Act, was subject to a thorough committee process, one that saw  a 2-day markup and eventually passed out of committee in an  overwhelming fashion. This is a work product the whole House can be  proud of.   Chairman Graves and his team, working with Ranking Member Larsen and  his team, have produced a comprehensive and timely bill. I am sure I am  joined by all of my colleagues in thanking them for their hard work.   As Chairman Cole mentioned in his opening remarks at the Rules  Committee hearing yesterday, since the birth of flight, the United  States has been a world leader in aviation safety and innovation. Mr.  Speaker, I firmly believe this bill follows in and adds to that  tradition.   Our aviation industry needs certainty, and it needs opportunities to  innovate. At the same time, we need to ensure that there are proper  guardrails for safety. I believe the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee delivered on these goals.   As a testament to meeting the mark, the Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure has provided a lengthy list of groups in the  aviation industry that are supportive of this bill.   Aviation plays a crucial role in the American economy. This holds  true in each and every congressional district represented by this body,  whether that be large international airports or smaller regional  airports in districts like mine.   In preparing for the bill's passage, I have spoken to local aviation  officials  [[Page H3651]]  in southern Indiana to gather input. One of my constituents even  referred to the underlying bill as ``one of the best'' FAA  reauthorization bills they have seen.   Comments like this give me great confidence in the policies we are  advancing and the importance of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, the United States must remain the leader in aviation  safety. We must preserve the United States' position as a world leader  in providing an efficient, innovative, and safe aviation transportation  system.   Simply put, we must remain at the forefront of global aviation, and  this FAA reauthorization is a strong illustration of our leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I will move on to H.R. 3941, the Schools Not Shelters  Act.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3941. As a member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee, we were presented with staggering statistics  that provide further evidence of Biden's border crisis.                                time  1230    We learned that over 2,500 migrants are pouring into New York City  weekly with over 87,000 migrants arriving since last spring. It is  obvious that action must be taken.   These statistics from our larger cities preview what could happen  across the country if action is not taken. We know some Democrats are  willing, even eager, to ignore Federal immigration law, and that is why  I am concerned with proposals to house illegal migrants in our schools  and what that means for our students and school safety all across the  country.   While every child should have access to all the resources they need  to be successful in their education, K-12 facilities should be used for  educational purposes, not as housing units for illegal immigrants.  Colleges and university campuses should not be distracted from meeting  the educational needs of students because the Biden administration has  failed to secure the southern border.   I am sympathetic to the issues created by this administration leading  to the influx of migrants into the interior of the United States, but I  vehemently disagree that these problems should be borne by our schools  and their students. That is why this legislation is necessary and why I  am, again, proud to be a cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will note that new laws will not keep guns from criminals any more  than the current ones that we have.   This legislation does not defund schools. I think there is a  disconnect from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle because we  have before us legislation that would simply say that schools need to  be focused on education and not on housing illegal migrants--migrants  that the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. McClain) pointed out have no  background checks--and that they have no ability to verify and  determine if they would be safe.   Meanwhile, parents of students in my school corporation have to have  background checks to go in for classroom parties.   We are not defunding schools. We are simply saying that schools  cannot house these migrants as a matter of safety for our children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Van Orden).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We face another week of big legislation under consideration for a  vote on the House floor to better the lives of everyday Americans.   Both the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation  Act and the Schools Not Shelters Act are important steps in delivering  on our promise for a nation that is safe.   Republicans are keeping our Commitment to America.   With the passage of these two bills, we can continue to lead in  aviation safety and innovation and keep the promise to our students  that schools are a place dedicated to learning and safety.   I look forward to moving these promises out of the House this week,  and I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the previous  question and ``yes'' on the rule.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
