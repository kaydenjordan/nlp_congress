 Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Smith for  yielding and for his hard work and leadership on this matter.   Madam Chair, I rise today to support H.R. 2824, which would  reauthorize the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting  Program. At its core, MIECHV improve the lives of families in at-risk  communities, focusing on the first years of a child's life.   Like the chairman, I, too, have seen firsthand its successes. I  recently traveled to a Nurse-Family Partnership facility, which is a  nonprofit that arranges home visits from registered nurses to low- income, first-time mothers.   I had the opportunity to meet the nurses and the women who currently  are enrolled in the program. NFP facilities transform the lives of  vulnerable first-time moms and their babies, empowering them to build  brighter futures and stronger families, none of which would be possible  without MIECHV funding.   I am proud to note that, like my previous speaker, my home State of  Michigan has already taken the initiative to invest significant funding  for the NFP facilities and other organizations, in addition to MIECHV  funds, to the extent that Michigan would now already meet the  requirement proposed in the bill.    I am particularly thankful for the chairman's transparent engagement  process within the committee, specifically, early on. I raised the  concern that the addition of new evidence standards, along with  substantial evidence standards already in place, might be problematic,  and I wanted to ensure that home visitors were not overly burdened by  data collecting so that they can care for the mothers and the babies.   Both of these concerns were addressed with the amendments contained  in the chairman's amendment, and I want to thank Chairman Smith and  Chairman Brady for their leadership in addressing these concerns and  other concerns.   I want to thank the chairman for all of his hard work, and I want to  join him and my colleagues in supporting H.R. 2824.
