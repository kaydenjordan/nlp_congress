 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins for her leadership  on this issue. I am very happy to have a chance to work with her on  this.   Today, my colleague Senator Collins and I are introducing a bill to  help fight Lyme disease, so we are introducing this bill today here in  the Senate as many Minnesotans and Mainers get ready to head out to our  beautiful national parks, lakes, and coastline to go fishing, hiking,  and all of the things that we love, love, love to do.   In Minnesota, we have more than 10,000 lakes and a lot of space for  outdoor activities, and we also have a growing tick population due to  warmer summer months. With so many lakes and our excitement to get  outside after a long winter, Minnesotans have become more at risk of  contracting Lyme disease and other vector-borne illness.   A vector-borne illness means an illness that is carried by an insect,  like ticks. Unfortunately, the number of Lyme disease cases in  Minnesota is on the rise. Over the past 10 years, the number of  reported cases has increased by nearly a third.   Our bill, the TICK Act, aims to reduce the number of cases by  establishing an interagency office of oversight and coordination to  target, prevent, and treat Lyme disease and other vector-borne  illnesses. In our legislation, we made sure to enable collaboration  between universities and public health agencies, and it is important we  train and equip our public health first responders in how best to  prevent and treat vector-borne illnesses.   The TICK Act is supported by a coalition of researchers, as Senator  Collins just said, also frontline medical professionals and government  officials from across the country, so I urge my colleagues to listen to  the professionals on the ground fighting vector-borne diseases and  quickly take up and pass this bill.   May is Lyme disease awareness month. We must be aware of and prepare  for future vector-borne disease outbreaks, and this bill will be an  important first step.   So I want to thank Senator Collins, my colleague on the HELP  Committee, for her leadership on this important issue. I am glad we are  able to work together on this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mr. Reed):   S. 1659. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for  the participation of pediatric subspecialists in the National Health  Service Corps program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
