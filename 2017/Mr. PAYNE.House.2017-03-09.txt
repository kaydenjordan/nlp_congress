 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Rutgers  men's basketball team on a tremendous accomplishment.   With their win last night over The Ohio State University, the Scarlet  Knights celebrated their first Big Ten Tournament victory since joining  the conference in 2014. Their hard work this season has paid off, and  they now advance to play Northwestern tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the team, first-year head  coach Steve Pikiell, and the entire Rutgers program.   Following their win, Coach Pikiell said that the team learned how to  compete this year. Well, last night it certainly showed, and I look  forward to watching the Scarlet Knights play tonight and wish them  continued success in the tournament.                            ____________________
