 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for  yielding and for those very kind words. I thank Chairman Engel and Mr.  McCaul, the ranking member, for bringing this resolution forward.   I rise today in strong support of the passage of my resolution  calling for the immediate release of Trevor Reed.   For the past 475 days, Trevor Reed, an eighth-generation Texan, Eagle  Scout, and, more importantly, a United States Marine veteran, has been  held in a Russian prison camp for crimes he did not commit.   The Putin regime is clearly using Trevor as a political pawn. If they  do not release him, he will be forced to serve an additional 9 years in  a Russian prison camp, making it almost 10 years, total, that Trevor  and his family will endure this nightmare.   Trevor was initially detained by Moscow's Police Service in August of  2019 for public intoxication, but after the Russian intelligence agency  identified him as a U.S. Marine, they upped the charge, now accusing  him with endangering the lives of two police officers.                                time  1700    Their claims were undeniably disproved by Trevor's defense team. The  accusation, and the lack of evidence to support it, was so absurd that  even the Russian judge erupted in laughter during his trial. Yet the  judge disregarded all evidence, witnesses, and government experts by  choosing to sentence Trevor to the harshest punishment ever given for  this alleged crime in this particular classification.   Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened our Nation and bullied our  allies around the globe. His antagonism and animosity towards our  country, our people, and our ideals holds no bounds.   We are now seeing our own innocent citizens and their families caught  in the middle of Putin's reprehensible political games.   Mr. Speaker, an entire decade of this man's life is at stake. I urge  my colleagues to support this resolution with a strong message to  Vladimir Putin: the House of Representatives solidly stands against an  American citizen being used as a political pawn. Free Trevor Reed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his kind words again.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and honor that I  rise today to recognize Jimmy Dodson as he completes his term as the  chair of the Farm Credit Council Board of Directors.   Jimmy is a third-generation farmer, and he grows cotton, corn, wheat,  milo, and operates a seed sales business near Robstown, Texas, where he  and his wife, Barbara, live today.   Jimmy is a great leader in the cotton industry, as the past chair of  the National Cotton Council of America, the American Cotton Producers,  and the Cotton Foundation. He is a founding member of Cotton LEADS, the  cotton industry's sustainability program, and a member of the boards of  Cotton Incorporated, the Texas Agricultural Cooperative Council, and  the Gulf Coast Cooperative. He was one of the first farm leaders to  visit China to work to expand U.S. ag exports into that country.   He is also a great leader within the cooperative Farm Credit System,  which he first joined in 1974. Jimmy was first elected by his fellow  south Texas farmers to represent them on the board of the Coastal Bend  Production Credit Association in February 1982. Jimmy went on to become  a lifelong board member of the Farm Credit Bank of Texas, where he  serves today as board chair and oversees efforts to support farmers in  Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. This year,  Jimmy will complete his term as board chair of the Farm Credit Council,  where he has led efforts to support farmers and farm families across  the United States.   Jimmy Dodson has devoted his life to agriculture, and our Nation's  farm families have benefited tremendously from his efforts. On behalf  of the U.S. House of Representatives and the House Agriculture  Committee, I extend my deepest gratitude to Jimmy for his tireless  efforts and his tireless support of American farmers and ranchers. I  wish him the very best as he continues his lifelong service to Texas  and U.S. agriculture.                            ____________________
