 Mr. Speaker, during their floor speeches today, both  Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer claimed this bill is for the workers.   If my Democratic colleagues care so much about American workers, why  do they support incentivizing millions of illegal immigrants into our  Nation to take away jobs from American workers?   Why do they support this bill that could force workers to pay union  dues even if they don't want to?   Why do they want to take away Arizona workers' rights under the  Arizona's right-to-work law?   This bill is bad for employees. It is bad for employers. And it is  bad for America. I oppose this bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back into the classroom.
