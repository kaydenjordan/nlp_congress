 Mr. Speaker, it was over 2 years ago that Hurricane Maria  hit the island of Puerto Rico, and our fellow Americans sustained one  of the worst natural disasters, with the highest death toll in modern  history. Now we have, again, earthquakes hitting the island since  December 28 to this date.   I got to go this week and saw firsthand schools crumbling. I saw  folks sitting out in tents who need emergency housing and mental health  services. Yet we still have less than half the money that we allocated  for Hurricane Maria actually down on the island.   It is time for the Trump administration to bring that money down.   In addition, it is time to declare a major disaster declaration. We  cannot let this tragedy happen again. America is watching. History is  watching. It is time to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico.                            ____________________
