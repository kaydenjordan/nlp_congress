 Mr. Speaker, there are countless successful middle  Tennesseans who did not go to college, yet President Biden expects them  to pick up the tab for those who did.   It is simply wrong to take hard-earned dollars from blue-collar  workers in Tennessee who have no student loan debt just to eliminate  some or all of the student loan debts of usually higher paid college  graduates. But it is also blatantly unconstitutional for President  Biden to unilaterally take this cynical election year action without  the required congressional authorization. He is, after all, the  President, not our king or dictator.   Further, this misguided decision comes at the cost of more than $500  billion, which will push inflation and the skyrocketing cost of  everything even higher and add to the financial pain Tennesseans  already feel from the record inflation caused by the President's other  disastrous fiscal policies.   I ask the President to please join us instead of fighting us in  trying to put our Nation's fiscal house back in order.                            ____________________
