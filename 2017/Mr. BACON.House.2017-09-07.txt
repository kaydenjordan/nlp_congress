 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 5. I plan to  ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. However, before I do,  I would ask to engage Chairman Calvert in a brief colloquy.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman.    The Fish and Wildlife Service has a backlog of 49 species  waiting to be down-listed or delisted. This issue is further compounded  by the fact that an additional 839 species are overdue for their  mandatory 5-year status review to determine if ESA protections need to  continue.   It is no wonder why States are frustrated that species are put on the  list and rarely removed. To be more effective in species conservation,  the Fish and Wildlife Service must address this backlog so States can  better focus their recovery efforts.   I respect the committee's progress made on this front, but I hope we  can make further efforts to ensure the Fish and Wildlife Service is an  effective ally in species conservation under EPA.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman for his feedback and efforts, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment No. 5.
