 Mr. Speaker, I do want to take a moment to clarify a  conversation we had here on the floor last week on sanctions  legislation against Mr. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch. My remarks were  passionate and aimed at the administration's proposed policy to lift  sanctions on that individual. In no way did my remarks intend to  reflect on the integrity of my friend from Texas, who was, in fact,  comanaging the bill to oppose that action.   As my friend from Texas knows, I admire him deeply, and I believe  that he is a leader of integrity. Nothing I said last week was meant in  any way to deflect from that. I wanted to clarify that publicly on the  floor.   I thank my good friend for yielding me time, and I look forward to  talking about the issue at hand. I, again, thank my good friend from  Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, the distinguished  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I thank my friend,  the distinguished ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, for helping Mr. Panetta bring this bill to the floor.   I rise today in support of H.R. 676, the NATO Support Act,  reiterating congressional support for the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization and prohibiting U.S. withdrawal from that organization.   As we mark 70 years of the NATO alliance this year, it is critical we  recognize the invaluable role that NATO has played in protecting U.S.  national interests and global stability.   NATO remains the foundation of U.S. foreign policy to promote a  Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. NATO  [[Page H978]]  has invoked Article 5, the commitment to collective defense, only once  in 70 years, and that invocation was on behalf of the United States  after we were attacked on 9/11.   As a result, nearly one-third of the fatalities suffered by coalition  forces when we fought in Afghanistan to rid that country of al-Qaida  and the Taliban--one-third of the casualties--were from non-U.S. NATO  member and partner countries.                                time  1715    They put their blood and their flesh on the line on behalf of this  country as part of that alliance.   Despite these sacrifices, unfortunately, our President has questioned  the value of NATO and falsely claimed that NATO allies owe the United  States money.   As head of the United States delegation to the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly and rapporteur for the political committee of that assembly, I  can attest to the anxiety within NATO regarding this administration's  commitment to the alliance.   Case in point: one can't talk about the U.S. commitment to Article 5  in 2019 without mentioning President Trump's failure to embrace it in  full view of our NATO allies during his first Presidential trip to  Brussels in 2017.   This past summer at NATO's annual summit in Brussels, President Trump  injected further discord into the alliance by calling our NATO ally,  Germany, a ``captive of Russia'' and demanding that ``delinquent''  alliance members increase their defense spending ``immediately.''   The President's provocative comments undermined the summit's goal of  projecting unity in the face of renewed Russian aggression, especially  given that they occurred just days before what turned out to be a very  difficult, if not disastrous, Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin.   Meanwhile, Russia continues its forcible and illegal occupation in  the Crimea, eastern Ukraine, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, and  parts of Moldova, and its attack on democracies throughout Europe and  even in our own country.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to support Mr.  Panetta's bill. This bill affirms the U.S. support for NATO and  preempts any attempts to withdraw from the same.
