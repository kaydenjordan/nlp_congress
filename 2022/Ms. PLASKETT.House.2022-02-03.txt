 Madam Speaker, today, I would like to honor Virgin  Islander Alton Adams, Sr., and express my gratitude to the U.S. Navy  for the creation of the Alton Augustus Adams Sr. Award for Emerging  Composers.   Adams, born in 1889 in the Virgin Islands, was the first Black  bandmaster of the U.S. Navy and led an all-Black Navy band during a  period of racial segregation.   Adams played the flute and piccolo and composed songs such as ``The  Governor's Own'' and ``The Virgin Islands March.'' In 1924, Adams  toured the Nation with his band and won the esteem of fellow  bandmasters, but his nomination for membership in the American  Bandmasters Association was denied in 1936. Nearly 70 years later, he  received the honor, in 2006, and has been recognized for his  contributions.   Composers recognizing the work of rising composers whose work  reflects the legacy of this leader can receive the Alton Augustus Adams  Sr. Award for Emerging Composers.   I thank the U.S. Navy, and I thank Alton Adams. Have a blessed Black  History Month.  [[Page H924]]                                ____________________
