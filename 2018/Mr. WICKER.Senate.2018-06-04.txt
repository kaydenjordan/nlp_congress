 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the  Republic of Azerbaijan, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of its  declaration of independence on May 28.   The United States was one of the first countries to recognize  Azerbaijan's independence. The country faced horrific challenges when  it was invaded by the Bolsheviks in 1920 and later incorporated into  the Soviet Union. With the end of the Cold War and the demise of the  USSR, Azerbaijan once again achieved its independence on August 30,  1991. Our country recognized Azerbaijan's independence that same year  and established diplomatic relations with the Republic of Azerbaijan on  February 19, 1992.   Azerbaijan is a key security partner of the United States. For  example, Azerbaijani troops have served in Afghanistan since 2002 to  assist the United States and our partners in NATO. Additionally, the  country supports the United States through the Northern Distribution  Network, which allows for the transit of nonlethal supplies through  Azerbaijan's territory to our forces in Afghanistan and permits the  overflight through its airspace of U.S. military personnel heading to  Afghanistan.   Azerbaijan also stands as an example of a secular, Muslim-majority  country that has excellent relations with its own Jewish community and  has maintained diplomatic relations with our strong ally, Israel, for  over 25 years.   Through the Southern Gas Corridor, Azerbaijan will provide energy to  our allies in Europe, thus lessening the continent's reliance on Russia  for gas.   For this and many other reasons, I commend the Republic of Azerbaijan  and its people on this significant anniversary.                            ____________________
