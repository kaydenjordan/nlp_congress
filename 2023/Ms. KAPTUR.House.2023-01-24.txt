 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the valorous life of  Lieutenant Colonel Harold Brown of Catawba Island, Ohio, who recently  took his final flight to the heavens.   Since sixth grade, Harold's dream was to be a pilot. By the age of  19, he made that dream a reality as a Tuskegee Airman.   Harold served as an exemplary officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps,  completing dozens of combat missions during World War II. Once while on  a mission, his plane was shot down, and Harold was taken as a prisoner  of war.   This experience did not deter his service to our country. Harold  served again during the brutal Korean War. Truly, he embodied the  spirit of his Spit Fire legendary airmen.   Harold's devotion to his country extended beyond the battlefield. He  worked to desegregate the military. He worked as a teacher to inspire  new generations of students. His life was dedicated to service beyond  self.   Today, America honors Harold for his service. We remember what an  impact his life had, and our prayers are with his loved ones.   Truly, one human being can change the direction of the world for the  better, and Harold Brown did that.                            ____________________
