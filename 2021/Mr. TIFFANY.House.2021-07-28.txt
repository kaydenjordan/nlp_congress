 Mr. Speaker, my amendment, which is included in this en  bloc, would prohibit the use of any funds to create, procure, or  display any map which depicts Taiwan as part of the People's Republic  of China.   This is a commonsense measure. As we all know, Taiwan has never been  part of Communist China.   The Taiwanese people elect their own leaders, raise their own Armed  Forces, conduct their own foreign policy, and maintain their own  international trade agreements.   By every measure, Taiwan is a sovereign, democratic, and independent  country. Any claims to the contrary are simply false.   Since the 1970s, America's so-called One China policy has  acknowledged Beijing's bogus argument that Taiwan is part of Communist  China.   This is a dishonest policy, and it is one that America should  abandon.   While we cannot end this policy with my amendment today, we can at  least require honest maps that stop perpetuating the One China lie.   Communist China is Communist China, Mr. Speaker, and Taiwan is  Taiwan. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.
