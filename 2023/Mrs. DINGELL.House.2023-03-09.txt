 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of H.J. Res. 27,  which would roll back important clean water protections.   Colleagues, for over 50 years, the Clean Water Act has served as an  essential pollution prevention tool and helped us clean up our nation's  streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands.   Clean water is a human right. And it is our shared responsibility to  ensure we protect human health and our environment for future  generations. Whether you live in the heartland near the Great Lakes, or  out west near the incredible Colorado River, we all benefit from the  federal protections of our waters. As one of the architects of the  Clean Water Act, John Dingell, wrote and made clear the intent was to  protect ``all the `waters of the United States.' ''   Wetlands, rivers, lakes, and streams must be protected and due to the  2019 repeal of this rule, there have been hundreds of development  projects that were able to move forward with limited regulation,  putting our water systems at risk. I would like to thank the Biden  administration for their leadership on its rule to establish a revised  definition of the ``Waters of the United States'' to protect our most  vital natural resource--water.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to oppose this resolution and  protect clean water for all Americans.
