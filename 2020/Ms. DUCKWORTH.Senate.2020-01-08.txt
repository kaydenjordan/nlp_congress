 Mr. President, I am here to speak on two matters.   The first is the nomination for Ambassador to the Kingdom of Thailand  of Michael DeSombre. The Kingdom of Thailand has been a longtime U.S.  ally and is a key partner for our efforts in the Southeast Asia region,  both economically and militarily.   Unfortunately, this nominee has failed to reach out to either me or  my colleague and my senior Senator, Dick Durbin, both of whom are his  home-State Senators. He has not reached out to me. So I am asking my  colleagues to please vote no on cloture on Michael DeSombre to be our  Ambassador to the Kingdom of Thailand until such time as I am able to  have a chance to sit down with him.
