 Mr. Speaker, the city of Knoxville and the people of  the Second Congressional District lost a distinguished citizen and  leader on March 11 when my good friend, Arthur Seymour, Jr., died at  the age of 74.   Arthur was born in Knoxville and lived there his entire life, leaving  only to attend the University of the South at Sewanee and to serve in  the U.S. Army.   He was a leading attorney in east Tennessee and was an example of  what an attorney should be. He was fair, well-prepared, honest,  objective, and relentless for his clients.   He was involved in many civic organizations and was a strong leader  at St. John's Episcopal Church. He served on the Knoxville Airport  Authority as a board member and chair of the East Tennessee Historical  Society.   He virtually never missed an election and took his civic duties very  seriously. He and his wife traveled extensively in Europe, and Arthur  had a particular interest in literary matters. For several years he  belonged to a book club which met regularly, and he was always reading  a book.   His life was enhanced by a 50-year marriage to his wife, Susan, who  was a longtime teacher in our wonderful city of Knoxville.   Arthur Seymour, Jr., was truly an example of what a citizen should  aspire to be.                            ____________________
