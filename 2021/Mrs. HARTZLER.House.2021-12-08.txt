 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  5609, a bill that I am a cosponsor of, the Cattle Contract Library Act.   This legislation includes a vital piece of my Optimizing the Cattle  Market Act that establishes a USDA-maintained library of cattle  contracts, including information on the type of contract, length of the  contract, pricing information, and delivery information. The increased  market transparency that this bill provides is long overdue.   American cattle producers continue to face challenges as a result of  market disruptions and the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19  pandemic. It is essential that cattle producers are equipped with the  necessary resources and knowledge to increase their leverage during  price negotiations for cattle.   The Cattle Contract Library Act can provide a much-needed tool in  helping cattle producers make informed decisions and survive volatility  across today's industry.   I fully support this bipartisan legislation, and I thank Congressman  Dusty Johnson for his hard work and leadership on this. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
