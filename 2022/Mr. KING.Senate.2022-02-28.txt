 Madam President, I voted to proceed to the consideration of  the Women's Health Protection Act today with some reluctance, not  because of any doubts about the substance of the bill--I have been a  strong supporter of reproductive choice throughout my public life--but  because of concern about and disagreement with some of the provisions  of its introductory ``Findings'' section.   Several of these provisions assert that opposition to reproductive  services, including abortion, is rooted in racism and misogyny. I don't  believe that this is true, and I do believe that it is unfair and  insulting to the millions of Americans whose opposition to abortion is  rooted in their faith and deeply held moral principles. While I  disagree with their conclusion--that it is appropriate for the  government to impose these beliefs on others who do not share them and  thereby intrude into the personal medical choices of all women--I don't  question their motives and strongly disagree with the language of the  bill that does so.   My vote today was not a vote on the final passage of the bill, but  only to bring it to the Senate floor for debate and amendment. Had the  motion succeeded, I, along with many of my colleagues, would have voted  to remove this inflammatory and unnecessary language from the bill.   Fundamentally, this issue is about who should have the power to make  this most personal and difficult choice, the government or individual  women in consultation with their doctors. While respecting the motives  of those who disagree, I think that power should rest with the woman.                            ____________________
