 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to stress the importance of  maintaining Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, commonly known as  DACA.   DACA recipients were brought here to the United States as children,  and in most cases America is the only home they have ever known. They  want to contribute to our economy, to our society, and our country; and  they will, unless we are foolish enough to stop them.   Taking any step against DACA would not only hurt DACA recipients, it  would hurt the United States. Let's protect these promising youth and  keep this program intact while we work out a humane path to  citizenship.                            ____________________
