 Mr. President, as I have said for months, the only  solution for avoiding a harmful government shutdown is bipartisanship.  We now have 4 days to go until funding expires on Saturday at midnight.  We are now right at the precipice. Yet, all last week, Speaker  McCarthy, instead of focusing on bipartisanship, catered to the hard  right and has nothing--nothing--to show for it. And now the Speaker  will put on the floor hard-right appropriation bills that have nothing  to do with avoiding a shutdown.   So, this week, the Senate will move forward first. Over the weekend,  Senate Democrats and Republicans together worked in good faith to reach  an agreement on a continuing resolution that will keep the government  open beyond September 30. We are very close to finishing our work and  hope to release text very soon.   This bipartisan CR is a temporary solution, a bridge toward  cooperation and away from extremism, and it will allow us to keep  working to fully fund the Federal Government and spare American  families the pain of a shutdown. While, for sure, this bill does not  have everything either side wants, we will continue to fund the  government at present levels while maintaining our commitment to  Ukraine's security and humanitarian needs and while also ensuring those  impacted by natural disasters across the country begin to get the  resources they need.   In a few hours, we will hold the first procedural vote to move  forward on the vehicle for the CR, and I thank my colleagues and staff  from both sides of the aisle who spent all weekend negotiating in good  faith to get us to this point. The Senate CR is a good, sensible, and  bipartisan--let me emphasize, bipartisan--bill. It will achieve the  most important immediate goal,  [[Page S4670]]  avoiding a shutdown. It will protect American families from needless  pain, pay our troops, and make good on our promise to American seniors.  It will promote access to affordable healthcare, sustain investment in  lifesaving research, and avoid costly disruptions to our supply chains.   Now, of course, today's agreement won't have everything that both  sides want. But let me repeat: This CR is a bridge, not a final  destination. It will help us achieve our immediate and necessary goal  of avoiding a government shutdown and move us away from the senseless  and aimless extremism that has dominated the House so we can get to  work on appropriations.   We can and must do more to respond to disasters that have ravaged the  country. We can and must do more to lower costs and grow the middle  class. We can and must do more to stand with our friends in Ukraine and  resist Putin's dangerous attacks on democracy and freedom. And we can  and must do more to finish the bipartisan appropriations process in a  way that makes strong investments in our country, in our families, and  in our future.   We will continue to work on these and many more, but, right now, this  CR is a must-needed bridge away from extremism and toward cooperation.  Make no mistake, a shutdown would be a terrible outcome for the  country, despite what some on the hard right would have us ludicrously  believe.   It is hard for me to believe that some on the extreme right in the  other Chamber say they actually want a shutdown--what insanity. This  will avoid that, that terrible outcome.   It will pay for our servicemembers, which could be halted if there is  a shutdown. It would prevent millions of Americans who count on  government services from suffering. It would prevent food safety,  public health protection, small business loans, and infrastructure  projects from being cut and, at least temporarily, ended, because they  are all at risk right now, if there is a shutdown.   If there is a shutdown, TSA could be thrown into chaos, meaning  possible delays and disruptions for all flyers. Border enforcement  Agencies would be undermined. Even FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund could  actually dry up.   We don't need to go through any of this. The Senate's bipartisan CR  will ensure that none of the bad things I just enumerated happen. I  urge--I urge strongly--reasonable Members of both Chambers to come  together to pass this bridge CR and move forward, freed from the hard- right extremists who are hell-bent on destroying trust in government  and hurting millions and millions of middle-class families.                          United Auto Workers Strike    Mr. President, now on labor, the UAW, and the WGA, early this  morning, before I came to Washington, I went to Rockland County, NY,  and stood with UAW Local 3039 on the picket line in solidarity with  their fight for better wages, better benefits, safer working  conditions. Rain or shine--and today it was mostly rain--UAW Local 3039  is out there, standing for a fair, equitable contract to share in the  profits they helped create.   We must not forget that during the auto crisis of 2008, unions and  workers gave back plenty. It is one of the reasons that the auto  companies are making such large profits. And the workers are entitled  to have a fair share of those profits. So we need to make sure the  settlement is fair to working people.   It is simple: When unions win, workers win; the middle class wins;  America wins. Just take the WGA strike--the Writers Guild--for example.  This past weekend, after nearly 5 months on strike, the WGA announced a  tentative settlement with Hollywood studios to get members back to  work. The WGA deal proves that progress is possible, that workers can  gain, and I hope it encourages the big three auto companies to stay at  the table and bargain in good faith.   Today, in a milestone for the UAW strike and the history of working  people in this country, President Biden traveled to Michigan today to  stand with the UAW on the picket line. It is likely to be the first  time in 100 years a sitting President joined workers on the picket  line. It shows how important strong labor unions are to this President  and to Democrats. That is why I thought it was appropriate for me this  morning to join some of our New York UAW members on the picket lines in  New York, as the President marched in Michigan.   President Biden's visit underscores a historic moment for the  American labor movement. We may be on track to see the most labor  activity in 40 years. And I am proud that so many of my colleagues on  the Democratic side of the aisle have stood on the line with workers,  fighting for a better life.   As President Biden said today, ``The middle class built this country.  And unions built the middle class.'' Praise God we have a President as  pro-union and pro-worker as President Biden in office at a time like  this. Of course, we weren't always so lucky. Former President Trump  will also be in Michigan this week, where he will no doubt try to style  himself as a champion of unions and working Americans. That is pretty  rich coming from someone who led one of the most anti-worker  administrations in recent memory, one openly hostile to labor unions,  disinterested in the well-being of working families, and who appointed  anti-labor people to many of the Agencies that regulate labor.   No working American should believe Donald Trump when he claims to  fight for them. Where was Donald Trump when UAW went on strike against  GM in 2019? All talk, no substance. Even now, he is openly attacking  the UAW that is trying to secure better contracts.   The difference between the Biden administration's record on labor and  the Trump administration's record couldn't be starker. Under the Biden  administration, Democrats secured historic relief to protect hard- earned pensions through the American Rescue Plan. Under the Trump  administration, on the other hand, Republicans reversed rules to expand  overtime pay for 8 million workers, loosened infection and safety rules  for oil rigs and coal companies, and reversed bans on toxic pesticides  that protected farm workers.   Under the Biden administration, Democrats broke the nearly decade- long funding freeze on the National Labor Relations Board. But under  the Trump administration, Republicans appointed the most anti-labor  NLRB nominees, and they voted to make it harder for workers to  organize, while making it easier for employers to oust existing unions.   Under the Biden administration, we passed historic bills, like the  infrastructure bill, CHIPS and Science, and the Inflation Reduction,  all of which are creating good-paying jobs. As majority leader, I made  sure that pro-union provisions were written into this legislation. But  under the Trump administration, Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax  cut that overwhelmingly benefited big corporations and the  ultrawealthy, while giving peanuts to working families whom Donald  Trump claimed to fight for.   So it easy to see who is really on the side of unions and working  Americans and who isn't.   I was proud to stand with the UAW this morning, and I am proud that  President Biden is standing with working people of this country today.   I yield the floor.                     Recognition of the Minority Leader.     Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from  Washington State, the chair of Appropriations. We worked together so  hard and diligently over the weekend, and we produced a result, I  think, that shows that bipartisanship can triumph over extremism. Here  in the Senate, we are bipartisan. I want to thank Leader McConnell. He  worked with us throughout. I want to thank Ranking Member Collins. They  worked with us throughout because we all know, together, that a  government shutdown will be devastating--devastating--for this country.   It amazes me that some in the other body--just an extreme few--say  they want a shutdown. That hurts tens of millions, hundreds of millions  of Americans for only some kind of ideological political purpose. But  we said no. The funding levels continue at the same level as before.  [[Page S4675]]    There is $6.1 billion for Ukraine on the defense side and on the--on  the State Department side. There is $6 billion for disaster relief. On  all of these, this is a bridge towards cooperation. This is not going  to be the final proposal for the whole year. But to avoid a government  shutdown, we needed a bridge. It is a bridge toward cooperation and  away from extremism, which will allow us to keep working to fully fund  the Federal Government and spare families the pain of a shutdown.   Let us hope that we get many people on both sides of the aisle voting  for this product and that the House understands that bipartisanship  there is the only way to go to avoid a shutdown.   I yield the floor.                                 Cloture Motion     Mr. President, I am very glad to see cloture was adopted  by a very large, bipartisan majority. This shows we can work together,  even with our differences, for the betterment of the country. I hope  the House follows suit.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto  messages on S.J. Res. 9 and S.J.
