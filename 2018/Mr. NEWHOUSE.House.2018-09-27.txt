 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and missed the  votes that occurred on September 27, 2018 due to the vehicle I was  riding in being struck by another vehicle on the way to the day's first  series of votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on the  four rollcall votes: No. 409 Ordering the Previous Question on H. Res.  1084; No. 410 Adoption of H. Res. 1084; No. 411 Passage of H.R. 6757;  and No. 412 Passage of H.R. 6756.                            ____________________
