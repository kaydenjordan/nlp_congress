 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to let colleagues know that  the tax cuts are working in Montana.   For the last 2 weeks, I met with hardworking Montanans who are  benefiting from tax cuts.   Owners of the Billings Flying Service are investing in new equipment,  as well as more research and development.   Workers at the UPS facility in Missoula are receiving expanded  benefits and more money in their paychecks.   The owner of KFC restaurants throughout Montana gave employees a  raise, boosted starting wages, and plans renovations for many of its  facilities.   Owners at Loenbro in Great Falls are increasing benefits and  investing in new equipment.   A farmer near Bozeman plans to double his food processing staff from  6 to 12.   Mr. Speaker, the tax cuts are working in Montana and throughout the  country. They are leading to job creation, bigger paychecks, greater  investment, higher wages, and economic growth. We must remain focused  on policies to encourage growth, optimism, and the American Dream.                            ____________________
