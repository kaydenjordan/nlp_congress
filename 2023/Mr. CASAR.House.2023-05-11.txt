 Mr. Speaker, I am the son of immigrants and proud to  represent the heart of Texas here in the United States Congress. For  generations, my family has moved back and forth between Texas and  Mexico, Mexico and Texas. People immigrate. Sometimes they are in  search of safety, and sometimes it is for economic opportunity, but  always for family and a better life.   What folks aren't immigrating for is to bring fentanyl into the  country as folks on the other side of the aisle have been talking about  time after time after time. In committee it was laid out very clearly  that over 90 percent of folks arrested for fentanyl trafficking are  U.S. citizens and lawful residents.   That is why this Republican anti-immigrant bill, H.R. 2, is cruel,  extreme, and not based on fact. It would destroy the asylum system,  cage children and families indefinitely, and make the situation at our  border worse.   In fact, this bill would eliminate funding for much of the remaining  legal immigration system that we have, leading to chaos, but chaos,  unfortunately, is what top Republican officials want. They want the  immigration system to stay broken so that they can blame Democrats for  it. This is a case of arsonists blaming the firefighters for the  flames.   For example, Congressman Castro and I worked with the Biden  administration to expedite funding to Texas this month to ensure that  migrants can sleep in a safe shelter while they process their  immigration case instead of being in a tent on the border. In stark  contrast, this Republican bill in front of us today would ban this  source for shelters and services.   Immigrants sleeping on the streets of Texas may be a better shot for  FOX News cameras, but it is a much worse deal for everyday people.   In Texas we are still mourning those killed by a mass shooter in  Allen. We are seeking justice for the kids and the teachers killed in  Uvalde. We haven't fixed our electric grid, and people are struggling  to pay their rent and their mortgage. We need help from this Congress,  but instead we get hate for immigrants. We should be creating an  economy that works for everyone--immigrant and native-born.   We should be expanding our freedoms, not ripping away peoples'  rights. Let's welcome asylum seekers fleeing violence and catastrophe  with a safe and orderly system. Let's create pathways for legal  immigration rather than the broken system today that forces people to  go around the rules. Let's work toward a safer and more just and more  prosperous Western Hemisphere so that we reduce those factors that are  pushing mass migration.   Let's look at the role of U.S. sanctions that starve people abroad  instead of feeding them. Let's recognize that immigrants are a key part  of our past and our present in this country.   Many of our joint faith traditions call for us to care for our  neighbors near and far. I remember when my priest told me the story of  how the Holy family was persecuted by King Herod and how Jesus, Mary,  and Joseph had to flee across the border into Egypt. They had to cross  a big river. The priest said that he forgets whether the river was  called the Nile or the Rio Grande, but that is beside the point. Today,  our story is no different.                                time  1230
