 Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of the  need for annual physicals through my participation in the Flannel Check  Challenge.   The goal of Flannel Check is simple: Wear flannel; schedule your  annual physical screening; and cure diseases early.   Some may ask, why flannel? The answer is that every individual  disease has a color to raise awareness, like pink for breast cancer,  light blue for prostate cancer, red for heart disease, and so on.  Flannel and plaid patterns, which come in countless color combinations,  create one identifiable pattern for all diseases.   The unfortunate reality is that disease is all around, and the key to  defeating any disease is by catching it early through annual physicals.  However, only 20 to 25 percent of males and  [[Page H940]]  60 to 65 percent of females go in for physicals every year.   Madam Speaker, we must work together to raise awareness on this  important issue. So I encourage everyone to participate in Flannel  Check's challenge by wearing flannel and scheduling an annual physical  today.   Together, we can help save lives.                            ____________________
