 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Rodgers for this  work.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7666, the Restoring  Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act.   Lockdowns, isolations, economic instability, disruptions to learning  and daily routines. For well over a year, school closures, mask  mandates, and online learning became the new normal for far too many  young Americans.   As a result, a new crisis is afoot in our country, one with  potentially dire consequences for our future, a mental health crisis  among younger Americans.   Today, nearly 7 in 10 parents of young children in Ohio are worried  about their kids' mental or emotional health. Drug overdose is now the  leading cause of death of Americans ages 18 to 45. Our kids are  counting on us, and we are counting on them.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 7666.
