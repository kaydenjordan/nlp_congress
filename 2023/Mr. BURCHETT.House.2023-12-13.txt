 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Yeoman 3rd Class William  [[Page H6925]]  Osborne. Yeoman Osborne went to Maryville College where he majored in  psychology and played for the football team all 4 years and served as  co-captain during his senior year.   After graduating, he joined the Naval Reserve and went to boot camp,  then served 1 year in the Reserves and 2 years on Active Duty.   In September 1970, he got a job as a probation and parole officer  trainee in Virginia, then worked at the Virginia State Penitentiary,  and after that he drilled on a World War II destroyer.   Around this time, the Navy was under pressure to do something about  troops returning from Vietnam with substance abuse issues.   Since Yeoman Osborne had a degree in psychology and experience  working with people with drug addictions, he was selected as part of a  team who received training as substance abuse counselors.   He went on to get his master's degree in education and his Ph.D. in  public policy and administration, and he had a great career as a  criminal justice educator.    He is currently enjoying retirement with his wife, Maureen; and  living in Knoxville close to his son Patrick, and his wife, Jessica,  and their two children. He also has another son Ryan, who lives in  North Carolina.   It is my honor to recognize Yeoman William Osborne as the Tennessee  Second District's 2023 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
