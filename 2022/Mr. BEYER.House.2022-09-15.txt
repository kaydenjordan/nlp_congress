 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302,  sponsored by my friend and colleague from Virginia.   Three out of four of my grandparents were career Federal servants. I  represent more Federal employees than any Member of Congress. I have a  deep appreciation for the vital work our civil service does to keep our  Federal Government functioning.   Our Federal employees have endured attack after attack from our  former President and his allies. The most significant threat to our  Federal workers came when the former President tried to use executive  action to strip Federal workers of their most basic protections and  replace our career civil servants with political loyalists.   This rule would have made a huge number of Federal employees fireable  by any future President, overturning a century-old system put in place  by Congress to prevent this politicization.   Congress passed the Pendleton Act 139 years ago, through Democrats  and Republican Presidents all those years, to require civil servants to  be politically independent. We insist our public servants be loyal to  our country, not to our political leaders. We demand integrity,  competence, and experience, not partisanship and ideology.   Should schedule F ever be enacted, any future President could  unilaterally transform a whole government overnight in wildly  destructive ways.   The bill we are about to vote on will prevent something like schedule  F from ever becoming law. It would block any reclassifications of  Federal employees to schedule F and prevent any position in the  competitive service from being reclassified to an excepted service  position.   This bill is essential to keep Federal employees from being used as  political bargaining chips and protects the careers of thousands of  civil servants and their families, along with the legitimacy of the  institutions under which they serve.
