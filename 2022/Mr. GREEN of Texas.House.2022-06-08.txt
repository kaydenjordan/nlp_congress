 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today  with a message of grave concern, especially for those who have suffered  in Uvalde, Texas, with reference to the slaughter that took place  there, the mass murders.   But I do have something that gives me some degree of hope. I have an  open letter that was published in The Dallas Morning News that I would  like the share. I would like to read some excerpts from the letter. It  is styled: ``An Open Letter Supporting Senator John Cornyn and Gun  Safety Measures.''   It reads in part:         We, the undersigned, are conservatives, mostly from Texas       and our friends from other States, outdoor and gun       enthusiasts. We vote for Republican Senators. We believe in       the Second Amendment.    It goes on to read:         We are especially encouraged that Senator Cornyn is       focusing on two vital ways to improve gun safety: red flag       law and expanding background checks.        We are also hopeful that the momentum building for those       two changes may also spur consideration of raising the age to       purchase a gun to 21, which we believe is another important       step in curbing gun violence.    They close with:         There are many of us across these great United States. We       are organizing. Please join us.    I thank them, the conservatives, gun enthusiasts, and those who  support Senators. I want to thank them for this open letter because  this issue of gun violence is one that we have to have a collective  response to. The politicians alone will not solve this problem.   I respect my colleagues and the political order. I happen to be one  of them. But I know that there has to be some input from the  influentials of the world, the chambers of commerce and the businesses  communities.   So I encourage the business communities to do as these  businesspersons have done: Take a stand, a public stand. Take a stand  for justice. Take a stand for these children. Take a stand against mass  murders. Please take a stand. Those who tolerate this perpetuate it.                            ____________________
