 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the loss of a  Floridian, a patriot, and one of the Air Force's finest.   Two weeks ago, three servicemembers were lost in a crash of a  reconnaissance and surveillance plane in New Mexico. These young men  were not just servicemembers serving in our United States Air Force;  they were sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers.   In particular, Florida's own Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, a  dedicated first lieutenant, had a long and promising career ahead of  him. Lieutenant Dellecker was 26 and known amongst his friends for his  legendary humor.   As a veterinarian, I was particularly touched by Lieutenant  Dellecker's love of animals. His friends and family recently revealed  that, while in pilot training, Lieutenant Dellecker once shared a  hotdog with a flea-bitten stray who had just delivered a litter of  puppies and was starving. He ended up taking her in and giving her a  second chance at a new life.   I would like to take a moment on behalf of all Americans and all of  the Members here today to thank him and his family for their service.   Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, your name will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
