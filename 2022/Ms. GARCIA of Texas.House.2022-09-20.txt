 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and  recognize the good-paying jobs that will be created by the historic  investments Democrats have recently made in America.   What are the investments, you may ask?   Well, let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act, the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act.  These are three key laws that will power America forward by creating  jobs, jobs, and, yes, better-paying jobs.   Since President Biden took office in January 2021, over 9.4 million  jobs have been created. I will repeat that: 9.4 million jobs.   If we look closely at the numbers and reports of these three new  laws, we get a preview of how many more jobs will be created under  President Biden's leadership.   First is the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill has the power to  create 9 million new jobs over the next decade, nearly 1 million jobs  each year, and 5 million of these jobs will likely be new clean-energy  jobs across America.   Second, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will add 2 million  new jobs per year over the next decade.   Third, the CHIPS and Science Act will create more than 1 million  construction jobs over the next 6 years to build America's  semiconductor factories.   All these laws work to create good-paying union construction jobs for  plumbers, pipe fitters, electrical workers, steel workers, laborers,  electricians, and other trades for working people.   These are the types of jobs that residents across my district, Texas  29, and millions of Americans across our Nation proudly work to help  keep their families together, to feed their children, and to look to  the future. These are the kinds of jobs that power America and its  economic engine.   House Democrats and President Biden understand that growing the  middle class means creating better-paying jobs right here in our  country. That is why we passed these monumental laws.   Under the leadership of President Biden, who is the most pro-worker  and pro-union President in American history, we have also invested  hundreds of millions of dollars in registered apprenticeships and pre- apprenticeships to provide new opportunities for working people to get  good-paying union jobs.   President Biden knows it is not only about providing opportunities  for Americans today, but it is also about planning for tomorrow's  generation of workers and having a better life for our children.   I am proud President Biden is building a better America for  generations to come by putting people over policy politics. Sadly, as  House Democrats and the President are working to create better-paying  jobs, the Republicans are job killers. They oppose this legislation  because they only focus on controlling women and their bodies.  Democrats trust women.   So while Republicans are focused on their own power, House Democrats  and President Biden remain laser focused on producing results for the  American people, and Democrats are delivering big-time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the  disturbing Dobbs decision handed down by the Supreme Court recently.   With the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court overturned two historic  rulings--Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern  Pennsylvania v. Casey.   These two decisions established a constitutional right to obtain the  medical procedure known as an abortion.   With the Dobbs decision, for the first time in nearly 50 years,  Republicans have succeeded in making sure America's daughters have less  freedom than their mothers.   Republicans did this by taking away a woman's right to have an  abortion.   It's simple. This decision was made for one reason and one reason  only: to control women and female service members, and their  reproductive health care.   All women, and especially those who have put their life in harm's way  to serve their country, should have the right to choose their own  reproductive health care.   Sadly, nearly 80,000 female service members--40 percent of them on  active duty--will have no access or very limited access to abortion  services in the U.S.   On top of that, women serving in the military experience unintended  pregnancy rates 22 percent greater than civilians.   According to a study in 2020, between 2,500 through 4,100 active-duty  servicewomen have an abortion annually.   Now, because of the right-wing Supreme Court, servicemembers  stationed in states that ban abortion now may need to travel long  distances to obtain an abortion.   In my home state of Texas, there are 15 military bases.   Female servicemembers stationed at these bases would virtually need  to travel out of state in all cases to get an abortion. As Texas has  banned abortions in all cases--even rape or incest.   Shockingly, they need to use their own personal leave to travel out  of state. This is absolutely crazy.   You see, only a very small amount of these abortions are done at  military facilities as current laws prohibit military health insurance  from covering abortions.   The only exceptions are unless the pregnancy is a result of rape or  incest, or the mother is at risk of death.   Seriously, everyone, put yourselves in the shoes of a young E-1 in  the military. An E-1 is the beginning rank for a military career--their  pay is roughly $22,000 a year.   That is about $1,833 a month. Trust me, it's not easy to travel out  of a large state like Texas on that type of salary.   Many of these servicemembers don't even have cars as they are just  beginning their military life and move to different bases constantly.   These are dedicated and strong women who have fundamental rights and  should be able to decide for themselves.   They do not need Republican lawmakers telling them what is best for  their health.   This is cruel. It's not right. And it must stop.   This is not how servicemembers should be treated. We should be  honoring them and their service, but Republicans are only seeking to  control them and their bodies.   Even worse, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Dobbs has served  as a catalyst for a wave of anti-women efforts led by Republicans  across our country.   Some Republicans even want to ban contraception now. It's ridiculous.   But House Democrats, Rep. Speier, we won't let them.   We promise to always stand by women and fight for their rights.  That's why House Democrats passed bills like the:   Right to Contraception Act;   Women's Health Protection Act; and   Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act.   We passed these bills because House Democrats trust women and  servicemembers.   We always have and we always will.                            ____________________
