 Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, President Trump nominated  Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado to fill the vacancy left  by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Judge Gorsuch, in  my opinion, is the ideal choice to fill this seat. He has impeccable  credentials and a decade-long record on the bench demonstrating a keen  understanding of the proper role of a judge.   Given the increasingly contentious nature of the confirmation  process, it is not surprising that many of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle and their special interest group allies are  stretching to find anything objectionable about Judge Gorsuch, no  matter how ridiculous.   Today, I wish to address one of their latest, most outlandish claims:  that Judge Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the  executive branch. For example, last week in Politico, Senator Schumer,  the distinguished Senator from New York, declared in an opinion piece:  ``The most important factor in assessing a Supreme Court nominee . . .  is whether or not the potential justice will be an independent check on  an executive who may act outside our nation's laws and the  Constitution.'' Senator Schumer doubled down on these comments in the  New York Times. There, he argued that it was impossible for him to  discern Judge Gorsuch's judicial independence when they met in person.  Why? Because Judge Gorsuch refused to say how he would rule on specific  issues or how he would review particular government actions. These  misleading narratives are an irrelevant, wasteful distraction from our  consideration of Judge Gorsuch's sterling record and the merits of  confirming him to the Supreme Court.   Last month, I warned that the left would use these diversion tactics  in an attempt to discredit the President's nominee. Shortly before  Judge Gorsuch's nomination was announced, I predicted in an opinion  piece in the Washington Post that advocates and interest groups would  want to know how the nominee would decide particular cases before those  cases ever reached the Court to make sure the nominee is on the right  team. I was right.   Our Nation's Founders would have been embarrassed by such questions.  Instead, the questions we ask should focus on whether the nominee will  interpret and apply the law faithfully and neutrally no matter what the  issue is. After all, that is what our Constitution demands.   Our Founders are not the only ones who would be embarrassed. I have  been in the Senate for the last dozen Supreme Court confirmations.  Every nominee we have considered has rightly refused to answer such  questions. Consider, for example, Justice Ginsburg's response at her  confirmation hearing. She said:         A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,       no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the       specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain       for the entire judicial process.    Just last month in a speech in Arizona, Justice Sotomayor had an even  stronger warning against asking and answering such questions. She said:         What you want is for us to tell you how as a judicial       nominee we're going to rule on the important issues you find       vexing. . . . Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an       agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will       vote is the kind of person you don't want as a judge.    So let's stop with this nonsense of trying to get Judge Gorsuch to  prejudge issues that could come before the Court. I hope my colleagues  appreciate the irony in asking a judge to say how they would rule on  particular issues in order to prove that the judge is judicially  independent. I agree with Justice Sotomayor: A nominee who will tell  you how she would vote is the kind of person you do not want as a  judge.   But if judicial independence really is the most important factor, as  Senator Schumer suggests, then this confirmation process should be the  easiest one in the Senate's history. Over 11 years on the Tenth  Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has consistently demonstrated in his judicial  opinions and other writings that he deeply values the constitutional  separation of powers between the three branches of the Federal  Government. Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution gives each  branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws, the President enforces  those laws, and the courts interpret those laws and the Constitution.  The branches may act only according to the powers the Constitution  grants them, with the remaining powers and rights reserved to the  States and ultimately to the people.    With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge Gorsuch has  a strong record of reining in actions which violate the Constitution  and the  [[Page S1191]]  law. Perhaps the best example is his opinion in the immigration case  Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. There, the Attorney General attempted to  apply a new agency rule retroactively prohibiting a noncitizen from  receiving relief under Federal immigration law. Writing for the Tenth  Circuit, Judge Gorsuch ruled that such action exceeded the executive's  power to enforce the law.   In a separate opinion, he noted that there is an elephant in the  room: the so-called Chevron deference doctrine, which requires courts  to defer to Federal agency interpretations of the law we pass. He  expressed constitutional concerns about Chevron deference. Judge  Gorsuch wrote:         [T]he fact is Chevron . . . permit[s] executive       bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and       legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that       seems more than a little difficult to square with the       Constitution of the framers' design. Maybe the time has come       to face the behemoth.    Judge Gorsch then proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the  proper separation of powers under our Constitution. As he stated, the  Founders included a strong separation of powers in the Constitution  because ``[a] government of diffused powers, they knew, is a government  less capable of invading the liberties of the people.''   As my colleagues know, I am no fan of Chevron deference. Last  Congress, I introduced the Separation of Powers Restoration Act to get  rid of it. As I noted when I introduced the legislation, regulators  have taken advantage of the courts' deference under Chevron to shoehorn  the law for their own political agenda, expanding their authority well  beyond congressional intent. But the Constitution's separation of  powers makes clear that it is the responsibility of the courts, not the  bureaucracy, to interpret the law. So I am pleased Judge Gorsuch  understands that the Constitution requires Federal judges to serve as  an independent check on how Federal agencies interpret the laws we  enact.   Separation of powers is not just about ensuring that the executive  branch performs its proper role of executing the law; separation of  powers is also about making sure Federal judges understand their proper  role under the Constitution. As Chief Justice Marshall famously  explained in Marbury v. Madison, judges have a constitutional duty to  say what the law is. Simply put, judges must be faithful interpreters  of our laws and the Constitution.   Under our constitutional separation of powers, it is not the role of  Federal judges to make or change laws by imposing their own policy  preferences. It is not their role to look beyond the law to consider  their personal views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose  winners and losers based on subjective beliefs that favor one group  over another.   In my 40 years in the Senate, I have reviewed the record of hundreds  of nominees for the Federal bench. I don't think I have ever reviewed  the record of a nominee who better understands his proper role under  the Constitution than Judge Gorsuch. Consider, for example, Judge  Gorsuch's touching tribute to Justice Scalia that was published last  year in the Case Western Reserve Law Review. In that speech, Judge  Gorsuch eloquently explained how judges should not be in the business  of ruling in ways that reflect their own political views or policy  preferences. Judges, after all, are not elected legislators. Instead,  judges should interpret the law as written. They must start with the  text of the statute and then utilize the traditional tools of statutory  interpretations to discern the meaning of any particular law.   Judge Gorsuch understands, to borrow from Alexander Hamilton, that  the judiciary should be the least dangerous branch. These aren't just  words; Judge Gorsuch's judicial record confirms that he lives this  judicial philosophy of restraint and humility.   In an essay I published last week on SCOTUSblog, I reviewed a number  of judicial opinions by Judge Gorsuch that demonstrate his commitment  to the separation of powers and the proper role of a judge in our  Federal system. I will not go through all of those cases here, but I  ask unanimous consent that the essay be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             [From SCOTUSblog]     Worried About the Separation of Powers? Then Confirm Judge Gorsuch                          (By Senator Orrin Hatch)         Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil       Gorsuch to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme       Court. Judge Gorsuch is an ideal choice to fill this seat: He       has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the       bench demonstrating a keen understanding of the proper role       of a judge. Given the increasingly contentious nature of the       confirmation process, it is no surprise that many Democrats       are stretching to find anything objectionable about Judge       Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous. In the current political       environment, they have focused much of their criticism on one       particularly strained argument: their claim that Justice       Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the       executive branch.        Fortunately, we do not have to speculate about how Justice       Gorsuch would decide these kinds of cases. Judge Gorsuch has       consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other       writings that he deeply values the constitutional separation       of powers between the three branches of the federal       government. Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution       gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws,       the President enforces those laws, and the courts interpret       those laws and the Constitution. The branches may act only       according to the powers the Constitution grants them, with       the remaining powers and rights reserved to the states and,       ultimately, to the people.        With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge       Gorsuch has a strong record of reining in unlawful overreach.       For instance, in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, the Attorney       General had attempted to apply a new agency rule       retroactively to prohibit a noncitizen from receiving relief       under federal immigration law. Writing for the U.S. Court of       Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch concluded that       such action exceeded the executive's power to enforce the       law. In a separate opinion, he went one step further and       expressed concerns about how judge-made doctrines that       require judicial deference to federal agency actions--namely,       Chevron deference and its progeny--''permit executive       bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and       legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that       seems more than a little difficult to square with the       Constitution of the framers' design.'' Judge Gorsuch then       proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the proper       separation of powers between the three branches, concluding       that ``[i]t was to avoid dangers like these, dangers the       founders had studied and seen realized in their own time,       that they pursued the separation of powers. A government of       diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of       invading the liberties of the people.''        Nor is Judge Gorsuch a supporter of federal judges who go       beyond their constitutional role in interpreting the law. As       Judge Gorsuch has eloquently explained, ``judges should be in       the business of declaring what the law is using the       traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing       the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own       political views, always with an eye on the outcome, and       engaged perhaps in some Benthamite calculation of pleasures       and pains along the way.'' It is not judges' role to make or       change laws by imposing their own policy preferences instead       of what Congress actually passed. It is not their role to       look beyond the text of the law to consider their personal       views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose       winners and losers based on subjective beliefs that favor one       group over another. Judge Gorsuch's opinions reinforce his       judicial philosophy of restraint and humility and his proper       understanding--to borrow from Alexander Hamilton--that the       judiciary should be the ``least dangerous'' branch.        Consider, for example, United States v. Games-Perez. There,       the 10th Circuit upheld a conviction for possession of a       firearm by a felon. The criminal defendant argued that he was       unaware that he was a convicted felon, but the court rejected       this argument as foreclosed by the court's prior precedent.       Judge Gorsuch penned a separate opinion. He agreed that the       court was bound by its own precedent, but he wrote separately       to urge the court to reconsider its precedent in light of the       plain text of the statute that requires the government to       prove the defendant knew he was a convicted felon. As Judge       Gorsuch explained, ``we might be better off applying the law       Congress wrote than the one [the court] hypothesized. It is a       perfectly clear law as it is written, plain in its terms,       straightforward in its application.'' He continued: ``Of       course, if Congress wishes to revise the plain terms of [the       statute], it is free to do so anytime. But there is simply no       right or reason for this court to be in that business.''        Sometimes a judge is asked to consider the proper       separation of powers between all three branches. For       instance, in Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, the 10th       Circuit considered whether certain regulations issued by the       U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the       Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act violated the       plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration       Act. In particular, the plaintiffs argued that the       regulations' health  [[Page S1192]]       insurance mandate for employers violated RFRA's statutory       protections on religious freedom by forcing employers to       provide health insurance coverage for abortion-      inducing drugs and devices. Judge Gorsuch's opinion explained       why the owners of one of the plaintiff companies were       entitled to relief under RFRA. As an initial matter, he noted       that the owners' ``religious convictions are contestable''       and that ``[s]ome may even find [their] beliefs offensive,''       but that RFRA ``does perhaps its most important work in       protecting unpopular religious beliefs.''        Judge Gorsuch then turned to the statutory interpretation       question at issue and noted that the case was a ``tale of two       statutes.'' Wrote Judge Gorsuch: ``The ACA compels the       [plaintiffs] to act. RFRA says they need not. We are asked to       decide which legislative direction controls.'' To decide       which statute controlled, he did not defer to the executive       branch's position on the matter. Nor did he seek to impose       his own policy preferences. To the contrary, he noted that       ``[t]he tiebreaker is found not in our own opinions about       good policy but in the laws Congress enacted.'' Because       ``Congress structured RFRA to override other legal mandates,       including its own statutes, if and when they encroach on       religious liberty,'' and ``because the government identifies       no explicit exclusion in the ACA to its dictates,'' Judge       Gorsuch concluded, RFRA's directive prevailed.        Even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions should       eliminate any concerns my Senate colleagues may have       concerning his commitment to the Constitution's separation of       powers. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted executive       branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing       those laws as written. Indeed, his opinions and other       writings cogently make the case for this approach to       separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the       federal bench and reminds me much of the case Justice Scalia       made during his time on the Court. Judge Gorsuch, moreover,       has been a model of respect for the proper judicial role, a       judicial philosophy under which ``judges seek to interpret       texts as reasonable affected parties might have done rather       than rewrite texts to suit their own policy preferences.''        To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender       of the separation of powers and the rule of law does not mean       his rulings will match his policy preferences, much less       mine. In fact, in his tribute speech to Justice Scalia last       year, Judge Gorsuch embraced Justice Scalia's philosophy of       judicial restraint: ``If you're going to be a good and       faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that       you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.''       That is precisely why Judge Gorsuch is the right choice for       the Supreme Court.     To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce  defender of the separation of powers does not mean his rulings will  match his policy preferences. As Justice Scalia wisely remarked, good  and faithful judges will not always like the conclusions they reach in  interpreting the law. And it certainly does not mean that his rulings  will match my policy preferences or those of my colleagues. As I have  repeatedly stated on this floor over decades, that is not the proper  inquiry when we assess the qualifications of a nominee to the Federal  bench. Federal judges must be judges, not super-legislators.   The bottom line is, even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions  should eliminate any concerns my colleagues may have concerning Judge  Gorsuch's commitment to the Constitution's separation of powers. Any  review would lead to that conclusion. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch  has resisted executive branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely  enforcing those laws. Judge Gorsuch's opinions and other writings make  the compelling case for separation of powers in a way that finds few  rivals on the current Federal bench.   If my colleagues are truly concerned about the proper separation of  powers between the three branches of government, there is a simple  solution: Confirm Judge Gorsuch as an Associate Justice on the United  States Supreme Court.    While we are setting the record straight on ObamaCare, my  colleagues on the other side have repeated a particular false claim  that needs correction. My Democrat friends are fond of characterizing  the repeal of ObamaCare as a tax cut for high-income earners and a tax  increase for low- and middle-income taxpayers. That claim is simply  false.   According to JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Affordable  Care Act imposed significant and widespread tax increases on taxpayers  earning less than $200,000 a year, despite President Obama's repeated  promises that the law would not do so. In fact, in 2017, a single  provision--the reduction in the deductibility of catastrophic losses-- is projected to raise taxes on 13.8 million taxpaying families and  individuals, mostly from the middle class. That is more than the number  of taxpayers who receive exchange credits and other premium subsidies  under  [[Page S1194]]  current law. That is just one example. There are others.   Fortunately, we have been able to forestall the impact of a number of  the ObamaCare tax provisions. We have fought and negotiated long and  hard to do so, but virtually all of those taxes are still looming on  the ObamaCare horizon.   Most of us on the Republican side have been fighting these taxes more  or less since the day ObamaCare was signed into law. We have  highlighted their harmful impact on the economy and decried the crony  capitalism that was behind the effort to draft and enact them.   Given this long history, at least in my view, it is essential that we  repeal all of these taxes, along with the rest of ObamaCare. It is  difficult to imagine how Republicans, who are now in the majority in  large part due to the promises we made to repeal and replace the  Affordable Care Act, can now sift through ObamaCare's taxes and decide  which ones are the least objectionable so that we can use them to pay  for our own healthcare reforms.   ObamaCare isn't problematic simply because healthcare costs are not  going up; it was fundamentally flawed at the outset. The way the law  was drafted was, and still is, a problem. The way the law was  negotiated--with stakeholders being played against each other--was, and  still is, a problem. Of course, the way the law was paid for was, and  still is, a problem. The ObamaCare taxes are a big part of this  equation. In my view--and, I think, the view of the vast majority of my  Republican colleagues--they have to go.   As I said, there really are not widespread disagreements among  Republicans on these issues. Overall, we broadly agree on the  fundamental issues surrounding ObamaCare, and, as I noted last week, it  is not all that problematic to have some differences of opinion on the  initial stage, so long as we can overcome those differences in the end.  I think we can do that. More importantly, I think we will.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Illinois.

Most of us on the Republican side have been fighting these taxes more  or less since the day ObamaCare was signed into law. We have  highlighted their harmful impact on the economy and decried the crony  capitalism that was behind the effort to draft and enact them.   Given this long history, at least in my view, it is essential that we  repeal all of these taxes, along with the rest of ObamaCare. It is  difficult to imagine how Republicans, who are now in the majority in  large part due to the promises we made to repeal and replace the  Affordable Care Act, can now sift through ObamaCare's taxes and decide  which ones are the least objectionable so that we can use them to pay  for our own healthcare reforms.   ObamaCare isn't problematic simply because healthcare costs are not  going up; it was fundamentally flawed at the outset. The way the law  was drafted was, and still is, a problem. The way the law was  negotiated--with stakeholders being played against each other--was, and  still is, a problem. Of course, the way the law was paid for was, and  still is, a problem. The ObamaCare taxes are a big part of this  equation. In my view--and, I think, the view of the vast majority of my  Republican colleagues--they have to go.   As I said, there really are not widespread disagreements among  Republicans on these issues. Overall, we broadly agree on the  fundamental issues surrounding ObamaCare, and, as I noted last week, it  is not all that problematic to have some differences of opinion on the  initial stage, so long as we can overcome those differences in the end.  I think we can do that. More importantly, I think we will.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Illinois.    While we are setting the record straight on ObamaCare, my  colleagues on the other side have repeated a particular false claim  that needs correction. My Democrat friends are fond of characterizing  the repeal of ObamaCare as a tax cut for high-income earners and a tax  increase for low- and middle-income taxpayers. That claim is simply  false.   According to JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Affordable  Care Act imposed significant and widespread tax increases on taxpayers  earning less than $200,000 a year, despite President Obama's repeated  promises that the law would not do so. In fact, in 2017, a single  provision--the reduction in the deductibility of catastrophic losses-- is projected to raise taxes on 13.8 million taxpaying families and  individuals, mostly from the middle class. That is more than the number  of taxpayers who receive exchange credits and other premium subsidies  under  [[Page S1194]]  current law. That is just one example. There are others.
