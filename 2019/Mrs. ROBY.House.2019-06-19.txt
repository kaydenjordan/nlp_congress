 Madam Chair, I would like to use my time to raise  awareness that a correctly sized and properly configured maintenance  facility to support and repair F-35 aircraft coming to the 187th  Fighter Wing is needed very soon at Dannelly Field in Montgomery,  Alabama.   The 187th Fighter Wing was selected as a preferred location for the  bed-down of the F-35, with the first aircraft to arrive in several  years. Squadron operations require administrative, training, and  support space as part of the aircraft organizational maintenance shop.   Currently, the existing facilities that service the F-16 Red Tails  squadron are inadequate. Aircraft maintenance currently resides in  three temporary facilities or trailers. Much of the space designated  for these functions is less than required for effective operations. The  aircraft maintenance shops are 43 percent undersized, and the required  tool storage is kept in aircraft parking spaces in the hangar.   I appreciate very much the committee chairwoman and ranking member's  efforts to provide our men and women in uniform adequate and acceptable  working spaces so they can do their jobs accurately and effectively. It  is my hope that, moving forward, we will continue to work together on  this particular issue through the fiscal year 2020 appropriations  process.   Again, I, too, thank the chairwoman and, certainly, the ranking  member for yielding me this very important time.
