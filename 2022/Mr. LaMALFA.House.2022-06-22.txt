 Madam Speaker, on President Biden's first day in office,  he canceled the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. It was a campaign  promise.   This would have brought 700,000 barrels of oil per day into the  United States. Instead, this move has cost thousands of Americans their  jobs as well as much of their income.   Continuing his attack on our energy industries, he halted all oil and  natural gas leases on Federal lands, despite a judge's ruling against  this illegal ban.  [[Page H5740]]    His administration has also shut down the congressionally authorized  oil and gas program in the 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge in Alaska and has threatened industry with regulation and  increased royalties, which will significantly impact investment in new  energy production. Indeed, the large financiers are already backing  away due to their ESG idealism and the intimidation by the government  to do so.   ANWR is actually 19.6 million acres. The 1002 Area is a small  fraction of that total area, and the actual drilling itself will take  place on an even smaller fraction of that, as well.   Most recently, the Biden administration has scrapped a court-ordered  offshore 5-year lease in the Gulf of Mexico. This could likely spell a  complete ban on offshore leases until the end of his whole term.   What does he expect is going to happen? Well, we are seeing it, and  the people are feeling it: $5 gas nationally; $6, $6.50 in California,  where everything is more expensive; $7 for diesel.   How do they expect that trucks are going to deliver items to the  store or trucks are going to bring things from manufacturing facilities  to distribution centers or from the field to the dryer, to the mill,  the fertilizer brought to the field, the seed brought to the field? All  these things, how do they expect they are going to happen with $7 fuel  and higher?   The expectations are it is not going to get better anytime soon. We  have seen proposals by the Biden administration to relieve the gas tax  and diesel tax, which is about 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 on  diesel. I think we would always be happy to take a reduction in taxes,  whether it is temporary or not, but it is not going to make but a tiny  impact on $5, $6, $7 fuel.   What we need is production. Production will alter the market. When  they are hesitant or reluctant or just flat saying no to increasing  production, especially in a worldwide market where we had been relying  on Russia for some reason for about 8 percent of our oil consumption,  yes, we need to replace that.   We shouldn't buy anything from Russia. We shouldn't really be buying  anything from China. Why do we want to be dependent on them for  anything? Solar panels? Our energy policy in this country needs to be  turned on its ear and put back to something that favors Americans.   They are blaming everything under the Sun for these rising costs  except for the policies they are putting in place. The President is  blaming MAGA Republicans. What does that even mean? How does that make  sense?   Washington, D.C., has been under one-party rule for the last couple  of years. It is clear: The price hikes we are seeing at the gas pump  are caused directly by the Biden administration's anti-American, anti- energy policies. His exact words while campaigning were: ``No more  drilling on Federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No  ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period. It ends.''   Well, you are seeing the effects, and it is unaffordable for people.  Normal folks don't have discretionary income to even get through an  emergency, in a lot of cases, within their family, and we keep heaping  this upon their backs, for their energy needs, driving their vehicles,  and heating their homes.    We are taking away natural gas. There are areas moving to do that.  Cities and certain other jurisdictions want to say no more natural gas  for your stoves, heaters, and such. They want it to be all electric.   These hostile actions are, indeed, creating long-term uncertainty. We  are seeing the futures contracts for energy are staying high.   How much longer can we do this? How long will they be in place that  way? Less drilling results in higher oil prices, which means higher gas  prices for consumers. It is that simple. It is not rocket science.   Instead, the President is traveling to Saudi Arabia to beg for them  to send more of their oil to us. We have the reserves in many States in  our own country that we can be tapping into and doing it more  ecologically soundly and certainly more economically soundly. He would  rather, I guess, lie in the pockets of OPEC oligarchs than create the  high-paying jobs we have right here and do it well.   We know that American energy is the cleanest and safest in the world.  It is much cleaner than natural gas that Russia was sending to Western  Europe and now is cutting off from them. Well, that is a surprise,  isn't it? Germany gets rid of their nuclear power plants and cuts back  on other forms of energy, and now instead, because they cannot rely on  Russian gas coming in through the big pipe, they are having to restoke  their coal-fired plants.   Isn't that amazing? You actually go backward on environmental issues  when you don't plan, when you can't foresee what might happen with what  Russia would do.   We could be a major exporter, and we should be a major exporter,  helping our European allies and helping Americans have jobs and  decently priced energy that comes from our own country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, according to a new whistleblower report,  OSHA had reports of health and safety problems at the Michigan baby  formula plant all the way back in February 2021. That is a year before  the plant was indefinitely shut down by FDA and well over a year before  the Biden administration even acknowledged it.   The administration knew for at least months, if not well over a year,  that this crisis would happen with the shortages, but they failed to  act because they didn't consider it a top-level crisis. Now, over 70  percent of the Nation's baby formula is out of stock. In what universe  is that not a top-level crisis?   How is it possible that our FDA is so incompetent that they sat idle  for 14 months, knowing full well that American babies and families  would suffer shortages?   How inept is the administration that they would admit to knowing  about this looming crisis for months but ignored it?   How cruel is the Biden administration that while American parents  desperately search for formula for their babies, the administration is  taking it right off the shelves and shipping it down to the border?    Even the Biden administration's deal with the Abbott plant to restart  production will take 6 to 8 weeks to put formula back on the shelves.  People can't wait that long.   The Biden administration should have addressed this worsening baby  formula shortage when House Republicans raised the alarm months ago. We  will hold this administration accountable for this issue.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Tennessee  with that very warm introduction and allusion to the fact that we do  produce food in California when we are given the water that we already  own to do so, but that is a little different supply chain discussion  that we could be having tonight.                                time  2015    I want to focus this evening on the border situation that is  unnecessarily wide open. It doesn't have to be this way. It is just  inattention to enforcing the laws and doing the things you would  normally do to maintain a border.   We have millions of dollars' worth of steel fence material laying in  piles down there next to the border that could be used to fill some  obvious gaps that would make it so much easier for Customs and Border  Patrol to do their jobs that they would like to do.   Morale down there, of course, is really bad amongst our officers,  just for inability to do their job effectively, and not being supported  by this Federal Government and this administration.   And also, the wild accusations that those that are mounted on  horseback using their reins in order to move their horses about and  steer them where they want to go, somehow they have been accused of  using those as whips upon illegal immigrants coming across the border;  all part of just a bunch of hype and misinformation put out by the  administration, by the media, to make a narrative on the border that is  completely false and vastly unproductive for the American people, as we  see so much fentanyl coming across, so much illegal activity.   And also, since the Biden administration took over, at least 50  individuals that we know about on the terrorism watch list have been  caught red-handed, trying to sneak across our border to do God knows  what in cells inside this country.   So you really do have to commend the Border Patrol, what they are  able to get done on finding these 50, and  [[Page H5819]]  saving the countless lives they do, whether it is preventing terrorism,  catching these drugs that are coming across and just, in general, at  least trying to slow the tide coming in here illegally and affecting so  much of our society.   But we have to wonder with the nearly 3 million illegal border  crossings in Biden's term, how many dangerous individuals did get away  or sneaking through--the getaways are what we are talking a lot about  these days because we have no way to put a number on that. They affect  our whole society, our whole system of social programs, crime,  everything else. They don't seem to be interested in this  administration of getting a handle on that.   They have taken away, of course, our demoralized border agents'  resources to be able to keep the border as safe as it could be, cutting  them back and giving them--reassigning their mission, repurposing is a  common word around here. So instead of doing that job of enforcing the  border, they are basically running a welcome wagon operation,  transporting illegal immigrants to be processed and turned right into  the country.   Hopefully, they will show up within a couple of years for the massive  backlog of court hearings they would have on their status, whether they  actually deserve asylum or not, which isn't really the case. Probably  80 or 90 percent of them are here for economic relief, economic  opportunity in our great country.   So what do we have? The Biden administration, having halted  construction, and then some of the other methods with which we can  somewhat control this tide at the border. They are working really hard  at trying to roll back title 42, which is one of the best resources  that the Border Patrol agents have to quickly expel those who are  coming here illegally from certain countries.   Their soft-on-crime policies have incentivized millions of illegals  to continue to cross into our country, knowing that even if they are  caught, they can just skip their court date to stay here because the  backlog might be too long, or because the cell phone they got handed at  the border they can't be reached at. That is supposed to be our way of  keeping track of them, by handing them a cell phone.   So, with a caravan of 15,000 waiting on title 42 to come across, we  have got a giant problem that makes our core personnel at the border  powerless to stop it.   We have seen the pictures. I have been there myself on a trip to  Yuma, and it is devastating. It is devastating for the morale of the  people on the borders, the cities, the economies there, Border Patrol  themselves.   So instead of giving the border agents the tools they need, the FBI  and Department of Homeland Security are making up fake, dangerous  scenarios all over the country.   Instead, the FBI is going after concerned parents at school board  meetings speaking out over some of the filth that is being taught and  put into our schools. They are trying to label them as domestic  terrorists.   Then they push legislation that would go after our servicemembers and  law enforcement personnel for various things that they get accused of  while doing their jobs, if they are not being defunded to begin with.   So even though our data shows that servicemembers and law enforcement  personnel are more likely to be a victim of terrorism, they are getting  accused of being terrorists themselves.   FBI and Department of Homeland Security must start focusing their  efforts at the southern border instead of politicizing law enforcement  officers and concerned parents at school board meetings.   Everything is backwards with the way this administration is handling  the issue at our border, energy, the food shortages that are pending  because we are not prioritizing the basic building blocks that make a  society strong, the economy strong, families strong, and America  strong.   We have got a lot of work to do to educate the public. Maybe it will  take the midterm election to turn it around. I wish the people that  were operating the government would put America first instead of some  crazy agenda on the Green New Deal or globalism.   So I appreciate the time here tonight. I thank my colleague from  Tennessee for running this for us and allowing us to continue to speak  out and put the truth out there in front of the American people.
