 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  long-term friend, Lee Paull III, of Wheeling, West Virginia, who passed  away earlier this month.   There was nothing Lee loved more than his family and being from  Wheeling. He was an absolute pillar in the community, a successful  business owner, an active member of the Wheeling Chamber of Commerce  and Rotary, and a passionate supporter of the Linsly School and  Wheeling Hospital, as well as numerous other organizations.   His active role in political circles earned him the nickname of ``Mr.  Republican.''   Lee was a proud supporter of conservative values and principles. But  most importantly, Lee worked hard to try to make Wheeling, West  Virginia, a strong and vibrant community for generations to come.   He and his wife, June, touched the lives of thousands in our area.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, their three children,  and six grandchildren as we all mourn his passing.   Lee, you made a difference. You will be missed.                            ____________________
