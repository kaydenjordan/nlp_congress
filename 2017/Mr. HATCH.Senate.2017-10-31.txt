Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to finish my full speech.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to finish my full speech.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the Senate will consider this week four  nominations for the U.S. courts of appeals. Two are well regarded  professors at prestigious law schools, and two are highly respected  State supreme court justices. Each of them has received the highest  rating from the American Bar Association, ``well qualified,'' which my  Democratic colleagues have said is the gold standard for evaluating  nominees.   I applaud the majority leader for committing to do what it takes to  confirm these nominees, including, if necessary, working through the  weekend to get it done.   I want to address the state of the confirmation process by focusing  on one of these nominees, as well as attempts to change the process  itself.   Later today we will confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Seventh Circuit.  She has taught at the Notre Dame Law School for 15 years in fields that  are especially relevant to the work of a Federal appellate judge. A  distinguished and diverse group of more than 70 law professors at  schools from Massachusetts to California and from Minnesota to Florida  wrote that her scholarship is ``rigorous, fair-minded, respectful and  constructive.''   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       May 19, 2017.      Re Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Court           of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.       Hon. Charles Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We are       writing to express our strong support for the nomination of       Professor Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for       the Seventh Circuit. We are a diverse group of law professors       who represent a broad range of fields and perspectives. We       share the belief, however, that Professor Barrett is       exceptionally well qualified to serve on the U.S. Court of       Appeals, and we urge the Senate to confirm her as a judge of       that court.        Professor Barrett has stellar credentials for this       position. She received her undergraduate degree magna cum       laude from Rhodes College and her law degree summa cum laude       from the University of Notre Dame, where she finished first       in her law school class. She served as a law clerk to Judge       Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the       D.C. Circuit and to Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme       Court. After her clerkships, she practiced law in both trial       and appellate litigation in Washington, D.C. at Miller,       Cassidy, Larroca, & Lewin, and at Baker Botts. She has served       as a law professor at the University of Notre Dame since       2002.        As a law professor, Professor Barrett has distinguished       herself as an expert in procedure, interpretation, federal       courts, and constitutional law. She has published several       important and influential law review articles on these topics       in leading journals. Although we have differing perspectives       on the methods and conclusions in her work, we all agree that       Professor Barrett's contributions to legal scholarship are       rigorous, fair-minded, respectful, and constructive. Her work       demonstrates a thorough understanding of the issues and       challenges that federal courts confront in their daily work.       In addition, we admire Professor Barrett's strong commitment       to public service, including her work as a member of the       Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate       Procedure from 2010-2016.        In short, Professor Barrett's qualifications for a seat on       the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit are first-      rate. She is a distinguished scholar in areas of law that       matter most for federal courts, and she enjoys wide respect       for her careful work, fair-minded disposition, and personal       integrity. We strongly urge her confirmation by the Senate.            Sincerely,        Jonathan H.

One leftwing group, for example, objects  because she has no judicial experience. I don't recall this group being  concerned about the nearly 60 appeals court judges appointed by recent  Democratic Presidents who had no prior judicial experience. In fact,  President Clinton appointed a judge with a profile strikingly similar  to Professor Barrett's--a woman who clerked on both the U.S. court of  appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court and who, after a few years in  private practice, taught at a well-known Midwestern law school for 15  years and then received the ABA's highest rating to serve on this very  same court. Leftwing groups supported the Democratic President's  nominee but opposed the Republican President's nominee.   It appears that Professor Barrett has one big strike against her, and  that is her religious faith--an important part of her life, by the way.  That is all it takes for her critics to say that she has no place on  the Federal bench, that women or men with such personal religious faith  cannot be impartial judges who respect the rule of law. That is bunk.  It is ridiculous, it is despicable, it is stupid, and it is beneath the  dignity of this body. I strongly reject that view. I find it appalling.   These critics apparently believe that judges decide cases based on  their personal beliefs. They may believe that, but Professor Barrett  certainly does not. In her hearings she pledged to unflinchingly follow  all Supreme Court precedents. She said: ``It is never appropriate for a  judge to apply their personal convictions whether derived from faith or  personal conviction.'' This has been her view for nearly two decades.   In a 1998 law journal article she coauthored, she explored the real- world situation of how a judge should approach the death penalty when  her religious beliefs counsel against capital punishment. Professor  Barrett wrote that ``judges cannot, nor should they, try to align our  legal system with the church's moral teaching whenever the two  diverge.''   In her hearing, I asked Professor Barrett about this article and  about what should happen when a judge faces a conflict between her  personal views and the law. I wanted the record to be crystal clear so  that her views would not be distorted or misrepresented. Here is what  she said, as shown on this chart:         I believe that the law wins . . . if a judge ever felt that       for any reason she could not apply the law, her obligation is       to recuse. I totally reject and I have rejected throughout my       entire career the proposition that a judge should decide       cases based on a desire to reach a certain outcome.    Her critics appear, to put it most charitably, to have read a  different article by a different Professor Barrett. My Democratic  colleagues observed that religious dogma and the law are different--so  far, so good, as far as I am concerned. But then there is this: ``The  dogma lives loudly within you, and that is of concern.'' Can you  imagine, in this day and age, one of our colleagues asking a question  like that?   Professor Barrett, as I described, has consistently argued for nearly  20 years that judges may not decide cases based on their personal  religious beliefs. So what is the problem? It appears that the problem  for some critics is not Professor Barrett's religious faith in general  but the particular religious faith she has. Now this sounds  disturbingly like a religious test for public office. In fact, it is a  religious test by some of our colleagues, who ought to be ashamed of  themselves.   I thought America's Founders put that to rest when they wrote article  VI of the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting a religious test for public  office. I thought we had grown past periods in our history when  suspicion was leveled against someone running for public office simply  because of the church to which he or she belonged. I thought the free  exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment included being  free from that kind of suspicion and prejudice.   Earlier today, the assistant Democratic leader tried to distract  attention from the clearly inappropriate examination of Professor  Barrett's religious beliefs. He suggested that by asking Professor  Barrett whether a judge's personal beliefs should take precedence over  the law is no different than expressing concern that ``the dogma lives  loudly within you.''   Let me be clear. Inquiring whether a nominee will have her judicial  priorities straight regarding the law and her personal views is one  thing. Inquiring about her religious beliefs themselves is something  very different, and I believe it should be off limits.   I enthusiastically support Professor Barrett's nomination precisely  because she knows the difference between her personal beliefs and the  law and she is completely committed to maintaining that distinction  when she becomes a judge.   Let me now take a step back from this nominee and focus on the  confirmation process itself.   The Constitution gives the power to nominate and appoint judges to  the President and it gives the power of advice and consent to the  Senate as a check on the President. The latest dispute about the  Senate's part in this process concerns a practice used in the Judiciary  Committee to highlight the views of Senators regarding judicial  nominees who would serve in their States. Judiciary Committee chairmen  have come to use a blue piece of paper to inquire about a home State  Senator's views on a particular nominee. We call it the blue slip.   Today Democrats and their grassroots and media allies are demanding  that the blue-slip process be used as a single-Senator veto, even  though the vote is for a court of appeals judge who will represent a  wide variety of States if not the whole country. They demand that a  single home-State Senator be able, at any time and for any reason, to  stop a nomination dead in its tracks without any Judiciary Committee  consideration at all. That is ridiculous.   I can understand why they want to weaponize the blue slip like this.  After all, they once used the filibuster to prevent confirmation of  Republican judges but then abolished nomination filibusters so that no  one else could use them. Today, Democrats are trying to turn the blue- slip process into a de facto filibuster. They want a single Senator to  be able to do in the Judiciary Committee what it once took 41 Senators  to do on the Senate floor.   Shortly after Democrats abolished nomination filibusters, Judiciary  Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy warned: ``As long as the blue-slip  process is not being abused by home-state Senators, then I will see no  reason to change that tradition.'' He was right. The key is to know  when that line has been crossed, and Senator Leahy made that point.   I have served on the Judiciary Committee for more than 40 years. That  experience leads me to suggest two things that can help us prevent  abuse of this part of the confirmation process. The first thing to keep  in mind is the history of the blue-slip process.   Now, 19 Senators have chaired the Judiciary Committee, including me,  since this practice began in 1917--10  [[Page S6904]]  Democrats and 9 Republicans. Only 2 of those 19 chairmen have treated  the blue slip as a single-Senator veto. According to the Congressional  Research Service, until the 1950s, no Judiciary Committee chairman  treated a negative blue slip as a single-Senator veto. Home-State  Senators could express their objections in confirmation hearings, and  the Judiciary Committee might report a nomination to the Senate with a  negative recommendation, but in each case the process moved forward.   Senator James Eastland, who was chairman when I first joined the  Judiciary Committee--a Democrat--was the first chairman to treat a  negative blue slip more like a veto. Since then, according to CRS, the  blue-slip policy has been modified to ``prevent a home-state Senator  from having such absolute power over the fate of a nominee from their  state.''   Under Chairman Ted Kennedy, for example, a negative blue slip did not  stop consideration of a nominee. Chairman Joe Biden actually put his  policy in writing in a letter to President George H.W. Bush in early  1989. A negative blue slip, wrote Chairman Biden, would not be a veto  if the administration had consulted with home-State Senators. When I  became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1995 and again in 1997, I  wrote the White House Counsel that I would continue the Biden policy.   The second thing to remember is the purpose of the blue-slip process.  As I wrote in both 1995 and 1997, it is ``a courtesy the Committee has  established to ensure that the prerogative of home state Senators to  advise the committee of their views is protected.'' Nearly two decades  later, in the 2014 op-ed I wrote for The Hill, I said the same thing-- that highlighting the views of home-State Senators encourages genuine  consultation with the Senate when the President chooses judicial  nominees.   The history and purpose of the blue-slip process will help identify  when it is being used properly and when it is being abused, and,  believe me, confirmation abuses have occurred. Before 2001, for  instance, only 1 percent of judicial nominees with no opposition were  confirmed by a time-consuming rollcall vote. Under President George W.  Bush that figure jumped to 56 percent.   Before 2001, there had been four filibusters of judicial nominees and  no majority-supported judicial nominee had ever been defeated by a  filibuster. Under President George W. Bush, Democrats conducted 20  filibusters and ultimately kept multiple appeals court nominees from  being confirmed.   In July, we held another unnecessary cloture vote on a district court  nominee.   After voting 97 to 0 to end the debate that no one apparently wanted  in the first place, Democrats forced us to delay the confirmation vote  by 2 more days. This was the first time in history that a unanimous  cloture vote was not followed immediately by a confirmation vote.   What is going on here? What is wrong with our colleagues on the other  side? Why are they doing this? They could have taken a few hours but  instead took 2 weeks from the filing of the cloture motion to the final  unanimous confirmation vote that took place here.   Now, this is not the only time Democrats forced cloture votes to slow  consideration of nominees they end up supporting. What was the point of  all that? It is simple. Democrats want to make confirming President  Trump's judicial nominees as cumbersome and time-consuming as possible.   At this point in President Obama's first year, when Republicans were  in the minority, the Senate took cloture votes on less than 1 percent  of the executive and judicial branches--1 percent of all the nominees  that we confirmed. This year, with Democrats in the minority playing  confirmation spoiler, the Senate has been forced to take cloture votes  on more than 27 percent of the nominees we confirmed. In fact,  including those we take this week, Democrats have forced us to take 51  cloture votes on President Trump's nominees so far this year. That is  seven times as many as during the combined first years of all nine  Presidents since the cloture rule has applied to nominations.   These were the nominations under Obama and this is President Trump.  What is going on here? That is seven times as many as during the  combined first years of all nine Presidents since the cloture rule  applied to nominations.   In 2013, Democrats abolished the ability of 41 Senators to prevent  confirmation. Today, they are demanding the ability of just one Senator  to prevent confirmation. If that is not an abuse of the confirmation  ground rules, I don't know what is.   It would be a mistake to do to the blue-slip process what has been  done to other elements of the Senate's advice and consent role. This  can be prevented by following the less partisan guidance of history and  purpose to chart our way forward.   The blue-slip process exists to highlight the views of home State  Senators and of course to encourage the executive branch in this  country--whoever is the President--to be open to the feelings of the  home State Senators and to consult with them when choosing judicial  nominees. If it is serving those purposes, the blue-slip process should  not become yet another tactic for hijacking the President's power to  appoint judges.   What we have going on here today with President Trump's nominees is  hypocritical, and it is wrong. It is debilitating to the courts, and it  is unconstitutional. It bothers me that my colleagues on the other side  are doing this when they, themselves, were treated much more fairly by  our side--not just much more fairly but absolutely more fairly. This is  really pathetic. I hope we can somehow or other bring ourselves to  treat each other on both sides better.   With regard to judges, whoever is President ought to be given great  consideration for the choices. That is what we do when we elect a  President. I know it is tough on the other side that President Trump is  the President, but he is the President, and he is picking really  excellent people for these judicial nominations. I hope we start  changing this process and get it back to being a reasonable, effective,  honest, and good process.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 3:30 p.m. today, there be 30 minutes  of postcloture time remaining on the Barrett nomination, equally  divided between the leaders or their designees; that following the use  or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the confirmation of  the Barrett nomination; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Arizona.
