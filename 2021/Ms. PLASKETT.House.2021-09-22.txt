 Madam Speaker, last week, the Ways and Means Committee  on which I sit, along with numerous other committees in this House,  moved forward toward completing our work to achieve President Biden's  and the American people's vision to build back better.   The legislation contains economic development initiatives that I have  long championed to create good-paying jobs, while lowering costs and  cutting taxes for American families, not American wealthy. This is the  kind of legislation that makes America great. This is the kind of  legislation that assures the American people that we have not abandoned  them in their time of need. To remain the greatest Nation, we must  support the most vulnerable portion of America.   Importantly, for my district, this bill contains specific measures  for the much-needed economic recovery of the U.S. territories, which  have been severely tried in recent years. It fixes longstanding fiscal  cliffs related to rebate on Federal excise taxes on distilled spirits  production in the territories, our rum cover over. The cover over has  been a part of the fundamental tax relationship between the United  States and its island territories before there was even an income tax.  This bill would repeal the cap that has been imposed on the program  since 1984.   In addition, we are continuing to expand the federally funded Child  Tax Credit, including reimbursing the Islands' government who pay out  the costs for providing the credit. The credit, as expanded in the  American Rescue Plan, would be continued for additional 4 years.   This child tax cut has cut child poverty by 50 percent, 50 percent.  Cutting child poverty by the child tax cut makes economic sense.   Under the Annie E. Casey Foundation study, America has lost $500  billion a year in lost production due to children who have lived in  poverty most of their life because of hunger, leading to loss of jobs,  school dropouts, prison, all of these things will now have a way for  these children to come out.   Furthermore, we are extending the changes made to the Earned Income  Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan. We increase the value of the  Earned Income Tax Credit for workers with no qualifying dependents, and  we do that on a permanent basis in Build Back Better.                                time  1030    In addition, we are providing lookback provisions that are necessary  for individuals. This important part of the earned income tax credit is  premised on the idea that if a taxpayer's earned income was less in a  given year than it is in the prior year, the taxpayer may elect to use  their prior year's earned income in computing the EITC. That is, this  is a 1-year lookback. This will provide stability to taxpayers who have  experienced economic shocks in any given year, the same way we do for  businesses.   This legislation provides much-needed relief to the U.S. territories  from the GILTI tax that was supposed to apply to foreign jurisdictions.  Since 2017, there have been significant concerns about the application  of the GILTI tax to sovereign territories of the United States,  including the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as the other territories,  flowing from the treatment of U.S. territories under the Internal  Revenue Code.   I am pleased to see the additional accommodations to smaller-sized  businesses and the economic activity that will allow jobs and incomes  to flourish. For these employers, the possessions wage credit would be  increased from 20 percent to 50 percent of eligible possessions wages  and allocable fringe benefits for each employee. With these enhanced  credits, the Ways and Means Committee acted to provide relief to  service-based economies.   I am also excited about the proactive support for disaster  resilience. We are providing tools to mitigate the impact of natural  disasters by providing incentives for upfront investments.   We are providing strong incentives to attract capital and promote  jobs in communities that need it the most, significant resources for  rural areas, Tribal communities, and underserved minority communities.   We have affordable housing to help reduce housing inequality and  pathways to homeownership, which is about wealth creation in this  country.   Democrats have heard the needs and desires of the American people,  all American people--Democrats, Republicans, independents, rural,  urban, small town, islands even. We are here to help you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week the House is expected to pass a  continuing resolution to fund the government through December and avoid  a government shutdown, which would be catastrophic for families and the  economy as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.   I am pleased that this bill includes a provision to cancel the  outstanding balance of community disaster loans issued by FEMA to the  Virgin Islands as well as disaster assistance throughout this country.   The CR also extends the current enhanced rate of Federal matching  funds for Medicaid through December 3 of 2021, averting a sharp decline  in the rate of Federal Medicaid funding for essential healthcare for  the territories and Virgin Islanders living there.   The suspension of the debt limit is also in the continuing  resolution, to prevent a default that would trigger an economic  catastrophe, not only here but around the world. This suspension is to  help pay for President Trump's 2017 tax cut and the original COVID  relief bill signed into law by President Trump.   We know from his past practices that President Trump has no trouble  keeping debt, declaring bankruptcy. Thank God Democrats will be the  adults in the room and make responsible decisions.                            ____________________
