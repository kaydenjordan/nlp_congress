 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the distinguished  majority leader, Mr. Scalise, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30  minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my good  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time is yielded for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the section-by-section  analysis of the resolution.                                 H. Res. 5                 Adopting the Rules for the 118th Congress                        Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1. Adoption of the Rules of the One Hundred           Seventeenth Congress.        This section provides that the Rules of the 117th Congress       are the Rules of the 118th Congress, except for the       amendments contained in section 2 of the resolution and       orders contained in the resolution.      Section 2. Changes to the Standing Rules.        Initiatives to Reduce Spending and Improve Accountability.       Subsection (a)(l) replaces current ``pay-as-you-go''       requirements with ``cut-as-you-go'' requirements. The       provision prohibits consideration of a bill, joint       resolution, conference report, or amendment that has the net       effect of increasing mandatory spending within a five-year or       ten-year budget window. This provision continues the current       practice of counting multiple measures considered pursuant to       a special order of business which directs the Clerk to       engross the measures together after passage for purposes of       compliance with the rule and provides a mechanism for       addressing ``emergency'' designations.        Subsection (a)(2) strikes the ``Gephardt rule'' that       provides for the automatic engrossment and transmittal to the       Senate of a joint resolution changing the public debt limit,       upon the adoption by the House of a concurrent resolution on       the budget resolution, thereby avoiding a separate vote in       the House on the public debt limit legislation.        Subsection (a)(3) restores a point of order against net       increase in budget authority for amendments to general       appropriations bills.        Subsection (a)(4) restores a point of order against budget       reconciliation directives that increase net direct spending.        Increased Threshold for Tax Rate Increases. Subsection (b)       restores a requirement for a three-fifths supermajority vote       on tax rate increases.        Two Minute Votes. Subsection (c) provides that the Speaker       can reduce vote times in the House to not less than two       minutes on any question that follows another electronic vote.       The subsection also states that to the maximum extent       practicable, advance notice will be given when reduced voting       times are expected in a voting series.        Modifications to Calendar Wednesday. Subsection (d)       modifies the notice requirement to use Calendar Wednesday to       conform with the 72-hour notice requirement prior to       consideration of legislation.        Committee Authorization and Oversight Plans. Subsection (e)       restores the requirement that each standing committee (except       the Committees on Appropriations, Ethics, and Rules) vote to       adopt an authorization and oversight plan, which must be       submitted to the Committees on Oversight and Accountability       and House Administration no later than March 1 of the first       session of a Congress. The plan must include a list of       unauthorized programs and agencies within the committee's       jurisdiction that have received funding in the prior fiscal       year, or in the case of a permanent authorization, have not       received a comprehensive review by the committee in the prior       three Congresses. The subsection requires committees to       describe each program or agency that is intended to be       authorized in the current Congress or next Congress, and a       description of oversight to support reauthorization in the       current Congress. The subsection also requires the  [[Page H58]]       plan include any recommendations for moving such programs or       agencies from mandatory to discretionary funding. When       developing these plans, committee chairs must coordinate with       other committees of jurisdiction to ensure that programs and       agencies are subject to routine authorization efforts.        The subsection also provides that committee authorization       and oversight plans may make recommendations to consolidate       or terminate duplicative or unnecessary programs and       agencies. Committees may make recommendations for changes to       existing law to address Federal rules, regulations, statutes,       and court decisions related to programs that are inconsistent       with Congress' Article I authorities, as well as provide a       description of other oversight activities that may be       necessary.        The subsection also requires the Committee on Oversight and       Accountability to report to the House no later than April 15       the authorization and oversight plans submitted by committees       together with any recommendations it may make to ensure       effective coordination of the plans.        Cost Estimates for Major Legislation to Include       Macroeconomic Effects. Subsection (f) restores the       requirement that the Congressional Budget Office and Joint       Committee on Taxation, to the extent practicable, incorporate       the macroeconomic effects of major legislation into the       official cost estimates used for enforcing the budget       resolution and other rules of the House. The subsection       requires, to the extent practicable, a qualitative assessment       of the long-term budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major       legislation, which is defined to cover legislation that       causes a gross budgetary effect in any fiscal year covered by       the budget resolution that is equal to or greater than 0.25       percent of the projected GDP for that year. This subsection       also allows the chair of the Committee on the Budget, or in       the case of revenue legislation the House member serving       as the Chair or Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on       Taxation, to designate major legislation for purposes of       this rule.        Ethics Reform. Subsection (g) directs the Committee on       Ethics to adopt rules which provide for a process to receive       complaints directly from the public.        Empaneling Investigative Subcommittee of the Committee on       Ethics. Subsection (h) codifies House Resolution 451, 110th       Congress, directing the Committee on Ethics to empanel an       investigative subcommittee or issue a report within 30 days       of the date a Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner       is indicted, or criminal charges are filed.        Treatment of Evidence in Committee and Subcommittee       Investigations. Subsection (i) eliminates a requirement that       the Committee on Ethics adopt a rule allowing the use during       an ethics investigation of evidence presented in a related       criminal case where the respondent was convicted because this       is already contained in the committee rules of the Committee       on Ethics.        Designating Committee on Oversight and Accountability.       Subsection (j) redesignates the Committee on Oversight and       Reform as the Committee on Oversight and Accountability.        Designating Committee on Education and the Workforce.       Subsection (k) redesignates the Committee on Education and       Labor as the Committee on Education and the Workforce.        Subcommittees of Committee on Agriculture. Subsection (1)       permits the Committee on Agriculture to have six       subcommittees, codifying a separate order in effect since the       114th Congress.        Cybersecurity. Subsection (m) modifies the jurisdiction of       the Committee on Homeland Security to include functions of       the Department of Homeland Security related to cybersecurity.       Committees currently holding jurisdiction over cybersecurity       functions of DHS will retain a shared jurisdictional interest       in such functions.        Scope of Authority to Act in Continuing Litigation Matters.       Subsection (n) eliminates ``including, but not limited to,       the issuance of subpoenas'' in the description of authority       to act as successor-in-interest in continuing litigation       matters, such language being superfluous.        Record Votes on Measures Reported by the Committee on       Rules. Subsection (o) requires reports from the Committee on       Rules to include a depiction of recorded votes.        Access to the Hall of the House. Subsection (p) strikes       language providing Governors of Territories and the Mayor of       the District of Columbia access to the Hall of the House.        Resolution Declaring the Office of Speaker Vacant.       Subsection (q) strikes language from rule IX to allow any       member to offer a privileged resolution declaring the Office       of Speaker vacant.      Section 3. Separate Orders.        Holman Rule. Subsection (a) reinstates the ``Holman Rule''       which allows amendments to appropriations legislation that       would reduce the salary of or fire specific federal       employees, or cut a specific program.        Restoring Legislative Branch Accountability. Subsection (b)       states regulations adopted pursuant to House Resolution 1096,       117th Congress will have no force or effect in the 118th       Congress.        Requirement with Respect to Single Subject Bill. Subsection       (c) provides that, effective February 1, 2023, a bill or       joint resolution may not be introduced unless the sponsor       submits a statement setting forth the single subject of the       bill or joint resolution. This statement must be included       with the statement required by clause 7(c) of rule XII       (Constitutional Authority Statements). A statement for any       bill or joint resolution introduced prior to the effective       date shall, to the extent practicable, be submitted by the       sponsor prior to committee or House consideration.        Question of Consideration for Germanenes. Subsection (d)       establishes a question of consideration on a special rule       that waives germaneness for an amendment. The question of       consideration is debatable for 20 minutes and is not subject       to any intervening motion.        Budget Matter. Subsection (e)(l)(A) provides the authority       for the chair of the Committee on the Budget to file       allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate budgetary       levels for the purpose of enforcing provisions of the       Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Additionally, this       subsection states that the provisions of S. Con. Res. 14,       117th Congress shall have no force or effect.        Subsection (e)(l)(B) provides adjustment authority to the       chair of the Committee on the Budget for a bill, joint       resolution, amendment thereto, or conference report thereon       if the measure does not increase direct spending over five       or ten years. It additionally provides adjustment       authority to the chair of the Committee on the Budget to       take into account the most recent baseline published by       the Congressional Budget Office.        Subsection (e)(1)(C) allows the Majority Leader or his       designee, should the chair of the Committee on the Budget not       yet be elected, to file statements permitted under       subsections (f)(1)(A) and (f)(1)(B).        Subsection (e)(1)(D) allows the chair of the Committee on       the Budget (or the Majority Leader or his designee, should       the chair not yet be elected) to adjust an estimate under       clause 4 of rule XXIX to exempt the budgetary effects of       measures to protect taxpayers with taxable incomes below       $400,000 from an increase in audits above the most recent tax       year from the Internal Revenue Service.        Subsection (e)(2) establishes a point of order against       consideration of a bill or joint resolution reported by a       committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) or an       amendment thereto, or a conference report thereon, which has       the net effect of increasing direct spending in excess of       $2,500,000,000 for any of the four consecutive 10 fiscal year       periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10       fiscal years after the current fiscal year. The levels of net       increases in direct spending shall be determined based on       estimates provided by the chair of the Committee on the       Budget.        Subsection (e)(3) requires the Congressional Budget Office       on any legislation that shows changes in mandatory spending       which cause a gross budgetary effect in any fiscal year       covered by the budget resolution that is equal to or greater       than 0.25 percent of the projected GDP for the current fiscal       year, to the extent practicable, to provide an estimate of       the inflationary impacts of that legislation. This subsection       also allows the chair of the Committee on the Budget to       designate major legislation for purposes of this order.        Subsection (e)(4) requires the Congressional Budget Office       on any legislation impacting either the Medicare Part A trust       fund or OASDI trust fund that causes a gross budgetary effect       in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution that is       equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of the projected GDP       for the current fiscal year, to the extent practicable, to       display: (1) the impact of legislation on the Medicare Part A       trust fund's unfunded liabilities over a 25-year projection,       solvency projections, and the net present value of those       liabilities; and (2) the impact on the OASDI trust fund's       unfunded liabilities over a 75-year projection, solvency       projections, and the net present value of those liabilities.       This subsection also allows the chair of the Committee on the       Budget to designate major legislation for purposes of this       order.        Spending Reduction Amendments in Appropriations Bills.       Subsection (f) provides for spending reduction account       transfer amendments and requires a spending reduction account       section to be included in all general appropriations bills.        Scoring Conveyances of Federal Land. Subsection (g)       reinstates the separate order from the 115th Congress       providing that any provision in a bill, joint resolution,       amendment, or conference report requiring or authorizing a       conveyance of federal land to a State, local government, or       tribal entity, shall not be considered as providing new       budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory       spending, or increasing outlays.        Member Day Hearing Requirement. Subsection (h) modifies the       Member Day hearing requirement to only occur at the full       committee level. Each standing committee (other than the       Committee on Ethics) must hold a Member Day Hearing during       the first session of the 118th Congress to receive testimony       from Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner on       proposed legislation within its jurisdiction. The subsection       permits the Committee on Rules to hold its Member Day Hearing       during the second session to receive testimony on proposed       changes to the standing rules for the next Congress.        Information to Committees of Congress on Request.       Subsection (i) requires that the chair of the Committee on       Oversight and Accountability be included as one of the seven       members of the committee making any request of an Executive       agency pursuant to section 2954 of title 5, United States       Code.        Remote Appearance of Witnesses. Subsection (j) provides       limited authorization to a chair  [[Page H59]]       of a committee to allow witnesses to appear remotely at       committee and subcommittee proceedings. This subsection       applies only to witnesses appearing in a non-governmental       capacity and in accordance with regulations issued by the       chair of the Committee on Rules and printed in the       Congressional Record.        Deposition Authority. Subsection (k) provides the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence and each standing committee       of the 118th Congress (except for the Committee on Rules) the       authority to order the taking of a deposition by a member or       counsel of such committee and limits persons who can attend       depositions to members, committee staff, an official       reporter, the witness, and up to two, personal,       nongovernmental attorneys. Depositions taken under this       authority are subject to regulations issued by the chair of       the Committee on Rules and printed in the Congressional       Record.        Broadening Availability and Utility of Legislative       Documents in Machine-Readable Formats. Subsection (l)       instructs the Committee on House Administration, the Clerk,       an other officers and officials to advance       government transparency by continuing efforts to publish       documents of the House in machinereadable formats and       broaden their utility by enabling all House staff to       create comparative prints.        Improving the Committee Electronic Document Repository.       Subsection (m) directs the Clerk, the Committee on House       Administration, and other officers and officials to continue       to improve the existing electronic document repository       operated by the Clerk for use by committees. Such       improvements are intended to increase public availability and       identification of legislative information produced by House       committees, including votes, amendments, and witness       disclosure forms.        Providing for Transparency with Respect to Memorials       Submitted Pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the       United States. Subsection (n) carries forward provisions that       clarify the procedures of the House regarding the receipt of       Article V memorials from the States by directing the Clerk to       make each memorial, designated by the chair of the Committee       on the Judiciary, electronically available, organized by       State of origin and year of receipt, and indicate whether the       memorial was designated as an application or rescission.        In carrying out this subsection, it is expected that the       chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will be solely       charged with determining whether a memorial purports to be an       application of the legislature of a state calling for a       constitutional convention or rescission of prior       applications. The Clerk's role will be entirely       administrative. The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary       will only designate memorials from state legislatures (and       not petitions from individuals or other parties), as it is       only state legislatures that are contemplated under Article V       of the Constitution.        In submitting each memorial to the Clerk, the chair of the       Committee on the Judiciary will include a transmission letter       that indicates it has been designated under this subsection.       The Clerk will make publicly available the memorial and the       transmission letter from the chair. Ancillary documentation       from the state or other parties is not expected to be       publicized.        War Powers Resolution. Subsection (o) continues a separate       order from the 117th Congress expressly providing that any       motion to discharge a measure introduced pursuant to section       6 or section 7 of the War Powers Resolution is not subject to       a motion to table.        Further Expenses for Resolving Contested Elections.       Subsection (p) authorizes such sums as may be necessary for       the Committee on House Administration to resolve contested       elections. Funds shall be available for expenses incurred       between January 3, 2023, and January 3, 2024. Amounts made       available under this subsection shall be expended in       accordance with regulations prescribed by the Committee on       House Administration.        Ethics Reform. Subsection (q) directs the Speaker to       establish a bipartisan task force to conduct a comprehensive       review of House ethics rules and regulations. The task force       is directed to submit a report to the Speaker, Majority       Leader, Minority Leader, and chair and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ethics and Rules.        Exercise Facilities for Former Members. Subsection (r)       continues the prohibition on access to any exercise facility       that is made available exclusively to Members, Delegates, the       Resident Commissioner, former Members, former Delegates,       former Resident Commissioners, officers, and former officers       of the House and their spouses to any former Member, former       Delegate, former Resident Commissioner, former officer, or       spouse who is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying       Disclosure Act of 1995 or any successor statute, or who is an       agent of a foreign principal as defined in clause 5 of rule       XXV.        Non-Disclosure Agreements. Subsection (s) continues a       separate order from the 117th Congress providing that non-      disclosure agreements required by offices as a condition of       employment for paid or unpaid staff or contractors cannot       require notice or approval for employees to communicate with       the Committee on Ethics, the Office of Congressional       Workplace Rights, or any other office or entity designated by       the Committee on House Administration; and that non-      disclosure agreements must also provide clear guidance to       that effect.        Mandatory Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policies       for House Offices. Subsection (t) continues a separate order       from the 117th Congress requiring the Committee on House       Administration to issue regulations to carry out the       subsection by April 1, 2023. Additionally, each House office       is directed to adopt an anti-harassment and anti-      discrimination policy.        Displaying Statement of Rights and Protections Provided to       House Employees. Subsection (u) continues from the 117th       Congress a requirement that the Committee on House       Administration issue regulations requiring each House office       to prominently display a statement of the rights and       protections provided to House employees under the       Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, including       procedures available to employees for responding to and       adjudicating allegations of workplace rights violations.        Requiring Members to Pay for Discrimination Settlements.       Subsection (v) continues from the 117th Congress a       requirement for a Member, Delegate, or the Resident       Commissioner to reimburse the Treasury for any settlement of       a complaint related to a claim alleging a violation by the       Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner of sections       201(a), 206(a), or 208 of the Congressional Accountability       Act of 1995, which cover discrimination based on race,       color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or       an employee's service in the uniformed services, and       retaliation for claims alleging such discrimination.        Congressional Member Organization Transparency Reform.       Subsection (w) modifies Congressional Member Organization       Transparency reform to allow participating Members to enter       into agreements with eligible Congressional Member       Organizations for the purpose of payment of salaries and       expenses. The subsection requires that for an organization to       be eligible during the 118th Congress, the organization must       register with the Committee on House Administration,       designate a single Member to be responsible for the       administration of the organization, have at least three       employees assigned to perform work for the organization, and       had at least 30 Members during the 117th Congress using a       portion of their Members' Representational Allowance to pay       for the salaries and expenses of the organization.        Determination with Respect to Placement of Measure on       Consensus Calendar. Subsection (x) directs the Majority       Leader to submit a statement to the Congressional Record if a       measure does not comply with his legislative protocols within       two legislative days of a measure being placed on the       Consensus Calendar.        Transfer of Certain Committee Records to the Committee on       House Administration. Subsection (y) directs those committees       designated by section 7(b)(l) of House Resolution 503, 117th       Congress, and the Archivist of the United States to transfer       any records related to the committee established pursuant to       House Resolution 503, 117th Congress, to the Committee on       House Administration not later than January 17, 2023.        Procedures During District Work Periods. Subsection (z)       provides that during district work periods throughout the       118th Congress, the Journal shall be approved; the Chair may       declare the House adjourned to meet within Constitutional       limits; the Speaker may appoint Members to perform the duties       of the Chair; and each day during this period shall not       constitute a day for purposes of section 7 of the War Powers       Resolution, clause 7 of rule XIII (resolutions of inquiry),       clause 7(c)(1) of rule XXII (motions to instruct conferees),       and clause 7 of XV (Consensus Calendar).        In carrying out this subsection, it is expected that the       designation of a district work period will be satisfied by a       letter submitted by the Speaker that is laid before the       House.        Reduction of Unauthorized Spending. Subsection (aa)       establishes a new point of order against an unauthorized       appropriation in a general appropriation bill in excess of       the most recent enacted level. If such a point of order is       sustained, an amendment shall be considered to have been       adopted reducing the amount of the appropriation to the most       recent enacted level. In order to entertain a point of order       under this subsection, the level of the most recently enacted       appropriation must be submitted to the Chair.        Numbering of Bills. Subsection (bb) reserves the first 10       numbers for bills (H.R. 1 through H.R. 10) for assignment by       the Speaker and the second 10 numbers for bills (H.R. 11       through H.R. 20) for assignment by the Minority Leader.      Section 4. Committees, Commissions, and House Offices.        Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. Subsection       (a) establishes the Select Subcommittee on the Corona virus       Pandemic of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability to       investigate, make findings, and provide legislative       recommendations on the origins of the Coronavirus pandemic,       including the Federal Government's funding of gain-of-      function research, the use of taxpayer funds and relief       programs to address the pandemic, the effectiveness of laws       and regulations to address the Coronavirus pandemic and       prepare for future pandemics, the development of vaccines and       treatments and the implementation of vaccine mandates for       federal employees and the military, the economic impact of       the pandemic, including state and local government responses,       the impact of school closures on American children, Executive       Branch decisions and communications related to the pandemic,       the  [[Page H60]]       protection of whistleblowers who provided information about       improper activities, and inter-government cooperation       regarding oversight of the preparedness for and response to       the pandemic.        The Speaker is directed to appoint up to 12 Members,       Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner to serve on the       Select Subcommittee and to designate one of its members to       serve as the chair.

Subsection (h) allows the Speaker to recognize a member for       the reading of the Constitution on any legislative day       through February 28, 2023.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), my good friend and the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I begin by thanking my good friend from Massachusetts for his  leadership of the Rules Committee over the last 4 years. While we  certainly haven't always agreed, we have tried to always be agreeable  while working with one another. I certainly associate myself with his  remarks about the terrific work of the staff on both sides of the aisle  for helping us facilitate the operation of the House over that 4-year  period. I look forward again to working with my friend in the years  ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer the rules resolution that will  govern the House during the 118th Congress.  [[Page H62]]    Determining the rules we will follow is one of the first and most  consequential decisions we must make as a body at the beginning of each  Congress. In many ways, the Rules of the House of Representatives serve  to demonstrate where our priorities and values lie as an institution.   Make no mistake, the priorities of the new Republican majority are  fully on display in this resolution.    First and foremost, Mr. Speaker, we are taking action to reopen the  people's House and ensure that we, the people's elected servants, are  here in Washington, D.C., doing our jobs.   For far too long, the House allowed Members to do their jobs from  home without ever setting foot in Washington. What started out as a  pandemic accommodation lasted far longer than necessary, but today,  even President Biden admits that the pandemic is over.   It is time for the House of Representatives to return to our normal  operating procedures, and it is time for the Members of Congress to  actually show up to work. Today's rules package eliminates proxy voting  and puts an end to remote committee proceedings.   We restore the requirement for committees to establish plans for how  they will conduct much-needed oversight. Republicans have robust plans  to ensure that we will hold the Biden administration accountable for  its actions, but being a counterbalance to the administration will not  stop there. With today's rules package, we will also establish a new  select subcommittee, modeled on the Church Committee, to investigate  the radical left's weaponization of the Federal Government in recent  years.   We will also modify the jurisdiction of the Select Subcommittee on  the Coronavirus Pandemic to ensure we investigate the origins of the  virus and finally look into the financial and societal impacts of  shutdowns.   We will establish a Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between  the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to respond to threats  posed by the CCP, ensure economic competitiveness for America, and  protect human rights.   Other important changes in this resolution are those that are  designed to address our out-of-control spending problem, which the  former majority made vastly worse last Congress. In fact, when  Democrats were in control of this Chamber, they spent so much money  through partisan bills that they managed to drive this country into an  inflationary crisis. Those aren't my words; those are the words of  former Clinton Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.   The American people elected Republicans to get our fiscal house in  order, and get our fiscal house in order we will. That starts with  making key changes to House rules to ensure we will instill some fiscal  sanity in Congress. These changes reflect a return to budgetary rules  that were in place for over a decade before Democrats removed them.   We will restore the CutGo rule, which requires us to offset any  increase in mandatory spending with a corresponding cut in mandatory  spending. No more will the House be able to use budget gimmicks and  tricks to pretend increases in mandatory spending are paid for when  they actually are not.   We will restore a requirement for a three-fifths majority to approve  any tax rate increase. If this rule had been in place, the House would  not have passed the massive tax increases the Democrats included in  last year's reconciliation bill.   We will eliminate the so-called Gephardt rule, which allows the House  to automatically suspend the debt ceiling upon passage of a budget  resolution. Just as the American people have to live within their  means, so, too, should the Federal Government.   Automatically suspending the debt limit may be the easy and expedient  way, but on a matter as important as the national debt limit, what is  easy and expedient is hardly appropriate. The American people expect us  to make a decision on the national debt limit only after full and fair  consideration and debate in the House. That starts with ensuring it  will receive a separate, standalone vote on the floor.   Finally, we will remove the rule that allowed Democrats to simply  ignore budget estimates for bills dealing with the COVID pandemic or  climate change. Although it may sound controversial to my friends on  the other side of the aisle, Republicans cannot and will not thrust our  heads in the sand and ignore the effects of out-of-control Federal  spending.   Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on, but on the whole, I am very proud  of today's rule package. It reflects Republican priorities and the  priorities of the voters who elected us. It reopens this institution  and ensures that all Members will be in Washington to do their work, as  our constituents expect. It ensures that we will hold the Biden  administration and the Chinese Communist Party accountable. It ensures  that we will get our fiscal house in order.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the rules package, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess), my very good friend, a member of both the Rules  Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), my colleague on the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), my very good friend who had so much to do with  some of the extraordinary changes in this rules package.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Speaker be  authorized to postpone the vote on ordering the previous question on  House Resolution 5 to a designated time later today.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair may  reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on any  question relating to House Resolution 5 that follows a 15-minute vote.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever my friend is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution  establishing the rules of the 118th Congress. The changes we are  proposing today will ensure that the institution is set on a path of  success for the new Congress.   They will ensure that Members return to Washington and do their work  here.   They will set up an institution to hold the Biden administration  accountable.   They will put in place budgetary rules designed to prevent the kind  of reckless spending spree Democrats recently engaged in.   I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and  ``yes'' on the rule.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House stand  in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m.    Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 6         Resolved, That unless otherwise ordered, the hour of daily       meeting of the House shall be 2 p.m. on Mondays; noon on       Tuesdays (or 2 p.m. if no legislative business was conducted       on the preceding Monday); noon on Wednesdays and Thursdays;       and 9 a.m. on all other days of the week.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged concurrent resolution and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the concurrent resolution, as follows:                               H. Con.

The concurrent resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
