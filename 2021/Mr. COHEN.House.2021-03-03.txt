 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.   I started my career as the legal adviser to the Memphis Police  Department. There were many fine policemen, and most of them never used  a choke hold, never used their gun, and operated admirably. Some did  not.   The disproportionate share that African Americans have suffered from  killings by police shows we need to act. You can't think about George  Floyd being choked with a knee and killed for 8 minutes. You can't  think of Eric Garner being wrestled down like a prize trophy animal and  killed in Staten Island, or young Tamir Rice, shot without an officer  taking a second to think about it.   Mr. Speaker, these deaths require us to act. This is not defund the  police. This is reform the police and save human lives. We need to pass  this bill today. We should have passed it 40 years ago when I was a  police attorney. Pass it now.
