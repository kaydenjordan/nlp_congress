 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the lives and  legacies of four precious little girls--Addie Mae Collins, Denise  McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley--who died within  the sacred walls of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham,  Alabama, 59 years ago.   On September 15, 1963, as the four little girls were getting dressed  in the bathroom of the church basement, preparing to sing in the choir,  19 sticks of dynamite placed under the church detonated and totally  exploded, causing the interior walls to actually cave in.   The crowd of about 200 people who gathered for the 11 a.m. service  evacuated the church. But the church was filled with smoke, and  underneath the debris lie four little girls.   Along with the little girls who lost their lives, dozens of others  were injured that day, including Sarah Collins Rudolph, the younger  sister of Addie Mae Collins, who was in the basement with her sister  and the other girls preparing for church that day.   Due to the violently racist nature of the attack, thousands of  African Americans protested across the State of Alabama. In response,  George Wallace called the police to break up the demonstrations.   The violent clashes between protesters and police resulted in massive  arrests and the tragic loss of two more lives, two little boys who died  that day, Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware. The two boys, one 16 and the  other 13, were killed within hours of the church bombing.   Following the attack, several people, many of whom were members of  the KKK, were arrested, but none of them--none of them--were actually  prosecuted until 34 years later.   Described by Dr. Martin Luther King as one of the most vicious and  tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity, this racially  motivated act of terrorism focused America's eyes on Birmingham,  Alabama, bringing into sharp clarity the injustices that sparked the  civil rights movement.   Although we will never replace the lives lost or injuries suffered,  the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act  of 1965 proved that their sacrifices were not in vain.   Today, as we reflect on our painful history, we are reminded that  every gain in the battle for civil rights has come at a high cost paid  by those who sacrificed everything for a vision and a dream bigger than  themselves.   As a direct beneficiary of the legacy of the four little girls, I was  honored that the very first bill that I passed in this body  posthumously bestowed upon them the Congressional Gold Medal to ensure  that this Nation will never forget their sacrifice.   I not only question where I would be today without the influence of  the four little girls, but more importantly, I question where America  would be today. The premature and senseless deaths of these four little  girls awakened the slumbering conscience of America and galvanized the  civil rights movement.   It was their memory that carried John Lewis and those brave foot  soldiers, unarmed and unafraid, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in my  hometown of Selma, Alabama.   It was their sacrifice which burned in the mind of President Lyndon  Johnson as he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights  Act of 1965.   It was their sacrifice that inspired a generation of freedom fighters  to move this Nation closer to its highest ideals of equality and  justice for all.   Madam Speaker, as we commemorate the 59th year since the bombing of  the 16th Street Baptist Church, we, as Americans, are called upon to  reflect on the legacy of the four little girls and to know them by  name: Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Denise McNair, and Cynthia  Morris Wesley. These four little girls and the loss of their lives have  changed America forever.   The legacy of the four little girls paved the way for a more  equitable and more just future. For that, we owe it to them to pick up  the baton and carry it forward.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the  59th anniversary of the lives of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair,  Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley.   May we always remember their names: Addie Mae, Denise, Carole, and  Cynthia.                            ____________________
