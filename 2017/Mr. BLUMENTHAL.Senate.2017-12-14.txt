 Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator  from New York, our minority leader, for his very powerful and eloquent  remarks on net neutrality. He has been a leader in protecting consumers  in so many areas, and this one is preeminently important.   We are here on a day when the FCC may well repeal the net neutrality  order. I spoke at length about it yesterday, and I am struck by the  mockery that the FCC will make of consumer protection if it proceeds  with this very misguided and mistaken course. It is a course that will  be reversed, I believe, in the courts if it is followed, and it should  be reversed in this body as well. It is profoundly important to the  future of the internet to have access and affordability to innovation,  to our economy, and to job creation. The open and accessible internet  is part of our lifeblood economically and culturally in this country.  Part of what makes America great is the freedom of access and  innovation.
