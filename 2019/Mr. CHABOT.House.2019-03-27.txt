 Madam Speaker, the Cincinnati Moeller Crusaders have done  it again, back-to-back Ohio Division I basketball champs 2 years in a  row.   The Crusaders defeated the strong Akron Saint Vincent-Saint Mary team  over the weekend, 52-44, to take the championship.   Moeller was undefeated this season going 29-0. In fact, going back to  last season, it is their 49th win in a row in a league and a State  known for great high school basketball teams.   As a graduate of a Greater Catholic League rival school, La Salle, I  have to acknowledge that Moeller is strong in just about everything. In  fact, my senior year at La Salle, Moeller was the only team to beat us  in football, even with me anchoring the La Salle defensive line.   To Moeller's players, especially the seniors who will be graduating,  the coaches, parents, teachers, and fans, congratulations. I wish them  all the best in the future--unless, of course, they are playing my alma  mater, La Salle.                            ____________________
