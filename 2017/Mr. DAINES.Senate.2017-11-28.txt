 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.   The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (H.R. 1) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to       titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget       for fiscal year 2018.     In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be  placed on the calendar.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 343, submitted earlier today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A resolution (S. Res. 343) to authorize testimony, document       production, and representation in Arizona v. Mark Louis       Prichard.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolution.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for  testimony in a criminal action pending in Arizona State court. In this  action, the defendant is charged with threatening to cause physical  injury to Senator Flake and for trespassing on his Tucson, AZ, office.  A trial is scheduled for November 29, 2017.   The prosecution is seeking in this case testimony from an employee in  the Senator's office who witnessed the relevant events. The enclosed  resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other current or  former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence may  be necessary, to testify and produce documents in this case, with  representation by the Senate legal counsel.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The resolution (S. Res. 343) was agreed to.   The preamble was agreed to.   (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record  under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
