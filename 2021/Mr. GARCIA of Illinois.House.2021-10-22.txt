 Madam Speaker, last week, Chicago and the  Nation lost a great champion for justice and civil rights, Dr. Timuel  Black.   As a World War II veteran and a leader in the Black community that  came to Chicago during the great migration, Tim always challenged the  inequities he witnessed in the United States and abroad.   In his 102 years, Tim was a historian, educator, author, and civil  rights activist. He inspired generations to fight for racial and social  justice.   He fought alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and helped organize  the march on Washington. He registered voters and raised funds to elect  Harold Washington, the first Black mayor of Chicago, in 1983. He  mentored the first Black President of the United States, Barack Obama.   On a personal note, I will always be grateful for Tim's support  during my mayoral campaign in 2015. He said he supported me as someone  who was able to communicate with everyone and transcend racial lines.   Tim profoundly shaped the struggle for civil rights in Chicago and  across the country. I will seek to honor him by following his example  and fighting for the voiceless in our city.   Rest in power, Tim Black.  [[Page H5796]]                                ____________________
