 Madam President, first, I would like to wish a very happy  and healthy new year to you and to all of our staff and pages who make  the Senate run so efficiently every single day and frequently late into  the night. The world's most deliberative body has unpredictable hours,  which all too often means missing important events with family because  we are here going back and forth on the pressing issues of the day.   This is why we have a Senate, after all--to give voice to the various  viewpoints of Americans from each State and then try to resolve those  differences. It isn't always easy since, unlike the House of  Representatives, the Senate's unique rules require us to work together  across party lines.   I know what it is like to work with my Democratic friends. In fact, I  was named as one of the most bipartisan Senators of either party in the  past 25 years. That is what it takes to get things done here because  the rules force us to reach consensus.   The Senate was created specifically to prevent a mob rule mentality.  James Madison, the father of the Constitution, described the Senate as  the ``anchor'' of the Federal Government that would act as a  ``necessary fence against fickleness and passion.'' George  [[Page S177]]  Washington famously said that the Senate was established to cool  legislation passed by the House in the same way that a saucer cools hot  tea.   Folks, we certainly have seen a lot of hot mess coming over from the  House. It is very concerning that the saucer intended to cool heated  passions is itself beginning to boil over as a result of hot air from  within.   Senate Democrats are threatening to blow up the Senate to  fundamentally change the U.S. Senate and to radically transform our  country. It cannot be understated how detrimental this action would be  to America. It would unravel two centuries of American representative  democracy. It would silence millions of Americans and destroy  what comity remains within this body.    I have to ask my colleagues, which side of history do you want to be  on? Do you want to go down in history books as the ones who turned the  Senate, the world's most deliberative body, into the House of  Representatives?   The law of our land would dramatically sway back and forth, and the  resulting political uncertainty would all but erase what little trust  the people have in our governing institutions and lead to even greater  political divisions. I don't think this is a future any of us want and  certainly not the one that was promised by President Biden when he  pledged--when he pledged--to the American people not to divide but to  unify our country.   When the threat of blowing up the Senate arose during Mr. Biden's  time in this institution, he spoke passionately against it. I don't  often quote Joe Biden, but I would urge you all to listen to his full  speech on the matter.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have his speech printed  in the Congressional Record following my remarks.   Then-Senator Biden warned:         History will judge us harshly, in my view, if we eliminate       over 200 years of precedent and procedure in this body and, I       might add, doing it by breaking a second rule of the Senate,       and that is changing the rules of the Senate by a mere       majority vote.    Senator Biden concluded:         This nuclear option is ultimately an example of the       arrogance of power. It is a fundamental power grab by the       majority party.    Flash-forward 17 years later. Joe Biden is still in Washington, and  he and his Democratic counterparts are the ones who are exercising that  arrogance of power.   Now as the President, Biden just yesterday declared:         We have no option but to change the Senate rules, including       getting rid of the filibuster.    So how and why are we at a point where nuking the Senate could even  be a possibility? Plain and simple: The Democratic leader, who has  participated in hundreds of filibusters over the past 5 years-- hundreds, folks; hundreds--wants to have his way regardless of the  longstanding rules of this institution, the viewpoints of other  Senators, or even, folks--get this--the wishes of the citizens of his  own State.   Just last week, the Democratic leader said the filibuster was being  used to ``embarrass the will of majority,'' and therefore ``the Senate  will debate and consider changes to the Senate rules on or before  January 17.''   Folks, it is not the Senate rules embarrassing the majority but,  rather, their two-sided flip-flopping on the importance of the  filibuster to this institution and to our democracy.   Not so long ago, the Democratic leader said that eliminating the  filibuster would turn ``the cooling saucer of democracy into the rubber  stamp of dictatorship.'' It will be ``a doomsday for democracy.''  Today, he is the one with the finger on the nuclear button, all because  he can't get his way.   This is the kind of power grab you would expect from tyrants in  socialist nations, who seem to be where the Democrats are taking many  of their cues from these days. Tyranny is no way to run a democracy,  and destroying the U.S. Senate for a power grab is certainly not the  example we should be setting for the rest of the world.   But the hypocrisy doesn't end there, folks. Democrats are  manufacturing hysteria that Republican-controlled States are placing  what they consider ``unfair restrictions'' on voting as an excuse to  blow up the Senate and thereby clear a pathway for the rest of their  radical liberal agenda. The irony here is that New York, home of the  Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and Delaware, home of President  Biden, have some of the most restrictive absentee voting laws in the  entire country.   Just this past November, the Democratic leader's constituents--his  constituents--overwhelmingly voted down a ballot initiative to allow  absentee voting without providing an excuse and another proposal to  permit unregistered voters from registering and then voting on election  day. They were voted down--his constituents. So in New York, the only  way to qualify for an absentee ballot is to be out of the country or  sick or have a physical disability. No other reasons are permitted.   Now the senior Senator from New York is threatening to destroy the  Senate to override the wishes of the residents of his very own State  who voted against the policies he is trying to impose on every other  State. Did you catch that, folks? He is overriding the will of the  people in his own State. Does that sound like democracy to you? It is  not Senate Republicans blocking the Democrat leader's agenda; it is his  own constituents.   Folks, the reality is, this election takeover bill is just the  beginning, used as an excuse by the majority leader to then break the  Senate and strengthen his own grip on power.   This party boss mentality may work in New York, but, folks, the  Senate is not Tammany Hall. While Senate Democrats would have you  believe Republicans are somehow limiting the rights of Americans to  vote, they, in fact, are the ones plotting to silence millions of  Americans.   The same partisans on the other side of the aisle who ``boasted''  of--air quotes right here, folks, you see them--they ``boasted'' just  about a year ago of resisting. Just a year ago, they were encouraging  resisting; filibustering and blocking just about every proposal or  nominee put forth by the prior President.   Now they call this tool a threat to democracy. Remember, less than 2  years ago, following the very tragic death of George Floyd, the Senator  from New York voted to block consideration of a police reform bill put  forward by my friend Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.   That is just one of the many other examples of commonsense bills the  Democrats blocked for purely partisan reasons.   The real threat to democracy isn't the filibuster but those  politicians who abuse the power with which they have been entrusted.  The Democratic leader has already put a choke hold on democracy right  here in the Senate, abusing his position to singlehandedly block other  Senators from offering amendments to bills he chooses to bring to the  floor.   If the majority wants to demonstrate a commitment to democracy, why  not start right here in the Senate? Instead of threatening to have less  deliberation, why not commit to more? Let's bring up bills that have  already had broad bipartisan support, and let's allow more votes on  amendments.   But rather than starting this new year with a resolution to take this  approach and make the Senate a true example of democracy in action,  where every voice is heard and respected, the Democratic leader penned  each of us a bombastic letter written with the left's usual dramatic  flair and theatrics, comparing the filibuster to a dead hand and  promising to permanently alter the Senate unless we bend to his wishes.   The senior Senator from New York should leave the theater for  Broadway, where it belongs. And before casting a vote that could  fundamentally change the Senate forever, I would urge my Democratic  colleagues to take some advice about the intended behavior of the  Senate from our Nation's greatest statesman, George Washington, and  cool it.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            Congressional Record                        VOL. 151, NO. 69--MAY 23, 2005          I yield the floor.
