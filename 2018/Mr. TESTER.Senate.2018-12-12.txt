 Madam President, before I start, I thank Senator Hatch  for his decades of service to this body, and I wish him well in  retirement.   This CR is about one thing--transparency, sunlight, and making sure  people know what is going on with their government. I rise on behalf of  the millions of Americans who are tired of seeing their democracy  undermined by mega-donors as they hide in the shadows. As my friend  from Maine said, it would be like going to a public meeting with a bag  over your head. That is what this is about. Take the bag off. Take them  out of the shadows.   Since the Supreme Court's ruling in 2010 in a case called Citizens  United, we have had our democracy and our elections for sale. Over the  past 8 years, billions of dollars have been spent to influence our  elections. Nobody knows where this money comes from. It could be coming  from foreign countries.   Just 3 years after the unpopular Citizens United decision, these  wealthy families once again used the Supreme Court to chip away at our  democracy with the McCutcheon ruling. A handful of our Nation's  wealthiest families have used this court ruling to hide behind  political action committees with stoic names so they can build  pipelines of cash to push their own agendas.   While we are still tallying the totals from this past election 5  weeks ago, we know that dark money groups in 2016 spent $1.4 billion in  that single election.   If we don't take an aggressive approach, more dark money is going to  [[Page S7474]]  flood our elections. It is going to mislead voters and turn people away  from our elections, our democracy, and, quite frankly, will put our  democracy at risk.   This is a very important joint resolution, and it is not the first  time we have been here. During the Gilded era of the Copper Kings, this  Nation's wealthy openly exercised their power over our democracy. Once  again, they tried to buy it. In fact, in my home State of Montana,  Copper King William Clark's solicitation for bribes during his campaign  for the U.S. Senate was so blatant that Mark Twain called him ``as  rotten a human being as can be found anywhere under the flag.'' Today,  I am concerned that the days of the Copper Kings have returned and are  being ushered in, in part, by policies from this administration.   Back in July, the Treasury Department and the IRS took an  unprecedented step and eliminated the requirements for certain tax- exempt organizations to report to the IRS the identities of their major  donors.   I will say one thing about the Senator from Wisconsin's remarks--the  Obama administration's view on this was that it opposed it because it  would constrain the IRS in enforcing its tax laws. This  administration's policy through the Treasury, through the IRS, created  another safe haven for this country's wealthiest donors to hide in the  shadows while they pulled the levers of power in our democracy.   Just like ordinary Americans took control of our government at the  end of the days of the Copper Kings, when Senate seats were openly for  sale--they acted--we have to act today. Today's vote will overturn that  rule and shed more light on the folks who are trying to buy our  elections.   In my reelection campaign over the past 2 years, over $40 million of  outside money was spent to influence just 500,000 voters. We will never  know who those folks were. These out-of-State fat cats didn't know the  State of Montana; they just wanted to write the large checks to try to  influence and buy our State, just like the Copper Kings did 100 years  ago. I guarantee that a lot of those dollars came from the same dark  money groups that are opposing this vote here today. They don't want to  see this joint resolution pass because it undermines their efforts to  anonymously influence our elections--once again, taking away from the  transparency of our government.   In addition to these wealthy few who are trying to buy our elections,  these dark money policies open the door to foreign contributions to  House, Senate, and Presidential campaigns. Of course, it is illegal for  a foreign national to contribute to our Federal candidates for office,  but when you do not know who is contributing the money, how do we know  that it is not the Russians or that it is not the Saudis or other  nations that are infiltrating our elections? Our adversaries are always  looking for the weakest link to try to destroy our country and destroy  our democracy. One of our weak links today is our broken campaign  finance system.   It is time to pass this bill, shore up the election infrastructure,  and take a step toward eliminating the ability of our enemies to choose  leaders in Washington, DC.   I thank the senior Senator from Oregon for his leadership and for  helping to force a vote on this important legislation. Senator Wyden  and more than 30 Members of this body cosigned our discharge petition,  and 35 Members of this body cosponsored this joint resolution of  disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to force today's vote.   The public needs to know where the Senators stand. Do they stand on  the side of transparency and accountability, or do they side with the  dark money special interests who flood our elections with television  ads and our mailboxes with misleading ads? It is past time to wrestle  our country back from the wealthy few who are fighting to drown out the  voices of regular folks. I urge the support of this joint resolution of  disapproval so as to help take our country back.   I will close with one thing, and then I will be quiet--and thank you  for your tolerance. This is about transparency. Tell me one time when  transparency has not been a good thing. It is the antiseptic for good  government.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am going to change pace a little bit  here. I want to talk about a couple of people on my staff who are going  to move on to greener pastures, you might say, and I want to  acknowledge them.   First of all, I want to acknowledge a man who has always been there  for me when I have needed him. Day or night, hell or high water, yes,  even during the first few weeks of his fatherhood, my chief of staff,  Aaron Murphy, has given himself to Montana and to this Nation.   For years, he and his wife Patience and their children Mira and Wes  have dedicated nights and weekends to ensuring that our State remains  the best place to live and raise a family.   Dating back to my first U.S. Senate campaign in 2006, Aaron has been  an integral part in shaping my message, crafting my political policy,  and ensuring that every word matters. He takes the job seriously, but  he never loses the ability to laugh at himself--the mark of a true  leader.   One 4th of July, he tasked his communications team to write a  statement honoring Independence Day. My team wrote:         We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We       will be united in our common interests.    Aaron was appalled by the hyperbole, and he began editing the  statement, only to find out that his team had pranked him by copying  and pasting lines from the Hollywood blockbuster movie ``Independence  Day.''   Aaron's no-nonsense style has kept us focused on what really matters,  and that is the people. His ability to see the big picture and the end  goal is one of his greatest gifts.   His work ethic is second to none. He is the first person in the  office in the morning, and he is the last one out at night. He is  rooted in his desire to create opportunity for the next generation, and  his passion drives him to excel every day--never settling for second  best.   He has worked as my press secretary, as my communications director,  and now he wraps up his time as my chief of staff.   I want to tell him, on behalf of my entire family and team Tester:  Thank you for your service.   Aaron has been at my side through three grueling elections and  countless national media appearances.   I remember the first time I met this man. He was working at a local  TV station. I was informed by my then-communications director that we  had this guy who wanted to work for my campaign. At the time, I said to  Matt McKenna: Why would he want to work for me? He has a good job.   Matt responded: Maybe he actually thinks you can win this election.   That is exactly what Aaron Murphy believes. He believes in the future  of this country. He believes in the future of Montana.   There was another time, before the 2012 election, when Aaron was  driving to my farm. He took the wrong road, and he ended up stuck in  the mud. He buried the car up to the frame, and, fortunately, he found  a spot where his cell phone worked and got ahold of me. I went out with  the tractor and pulled him out of the mud. I was laughing at the time,  making fun of his inability to navigate a muddy road, but Aaron saw an  opportunity. He later told that story to a national reporter, who used  it in a story to show that I hadn't lost my roots.   Thanks for getting stuck in the mud, Aaron.  [[Page S7497]]    Here is the thing about Aaron Murphy. He sees things differently. He  has the ability to connect with people and drive an agenda that matters  to everyday Americans. He is genuinely creative, full of passion, and  good for a terrible pun or a dad joke.   Aaron, on behalf of my family, on behalf of the entire staff--both  here in DC and in State--I want to thank you for your hard work, your  service, your dedication, and your willingness to come back to the  political fray and help me for the last 2 years.   Thank you very much.                           Tribute to Dayna Swanson    Mr. President, I also want to talk about my State director, who is  also leaving for greener pastures. I guess that is what happens when  you get reelected.   My State director's name is Dayna Swanson. She is an incredible  woman. She is a leader, wise counsel, and friend. Anybody who knows  Dayna knows she is a package of dynamite.   A few years back, Dayna wanted to get an old pickup. She looked  around, and she found an old pickup. She found a 1949 Chevrolet pickup  that had a pretty, fresh, green paint job. In fact, it was a paint job  that also included part of the chrome bumper painted green. It looked  good to Dayna, and she bought it. Needless to say, it probably needed a  little work. When you went around the corner, the doors would fly open,  and sometimes it would start, and sometimes it wouldn't.   I figured, what the heck. It is an old pickup. It is a great parade  vehicle. We had a homecoming parade coming up in Missoula, so I asked  Dayna if we could use her new 1949 pickup in the parade. We were in the  parade with the vehicle and, as usual--it is what you would think--it  overheated, the hose blew, and before we knew it, the Lieutenant  Governor was pushing the rig down the road with me driving it, which  was kind of nice.   That is Dayna. She is not afraid to take a risk. She inherited these  traits from two marvelous people, her parents, Butch and Kathy.   Dayna and I come from different parts of the State of Montana, but we  still have some things in common. I come from North Central Montana,  where agriculture is the business. It is done there, and we dig in the  Earth to make a living. She comes from just east of the Continental  Divide, where hard-working miners dig in the Earth to find minerals  and, consequently, are able to put food on their table.   Her Anaconda roots--her Irish roots--define her, as evidenced by her  love of Jameson Whiskey, but it is her heart that makes her so special.   Dayna has compassionately lead my Montana team in the State, guiding  them through difficult times, overcoming government bureaucracy, and  putting some big wins on the board for the State she loves--Montana.   When a Montanan walks into one of my offices, regardless of what the  problem is, Dayna goes to work to make sure the problem is solved.  Dayna's team bends over backward to get them the help they deserve.   Her leadership skills literally save lives. When I first got elected  12 years ago, Dayna designed our constituent casework process. She knew  that my No. 1 goal would be to help the people of Montana, and every  day since then, she has committed her heart and soul to that mission.   She has ushered Cabinet Secretaries across the State, showing them  what rural America looks like. She has worked with county  commissioners, State legislators, and everyday Montanans to ensure that  Montana remains the last best place.   She has flown in the dead of winter with me when it has been so cold  you couldn't see the ground, and when you did land, you could see that  the wings of the plane were covered with ice.   For 12 years, she has been my eyes and ears on the ground in Montana.  We have spent hundreds of hours together--windshield time--from places  like Wibaux to Libby and all along the way. We have shared countless  laughs and have worked to make the State a better place.   While her time in my office comes to a close, I know there are great  opportunities on the horizon for Dayna and her partner Denise, who just  took over as superintendent of schools in the Seattle school system.  She will be heading out to Seattle, where she will make Seattle a  better place, just as she has made Montana a better place.   In Dayna Swanson's particular case, on behalf of my wife, the entire  Tester team, and the people of Montana, I say: Thank you for a job well  done.   With that, I yield the floor.
