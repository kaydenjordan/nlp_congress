 Mr. Speaker, since its implementation in 1965,  Medicare has excluded coverage for hearing aids and related audiology  services, routine dental care, and routine eye exams and eyeglasses  despite the fact that large numbers of older Americans need these  essential items and services. Today, with well over 100 original  cosponsors, I will be introducing the Seniors Have Eyes, Ears, and  Teeth bill, which will lift these terribly unfair restrictions on the  population most in need of these services.   We know that hearing loss affects more than 40 percent of persons  over 60 years old, more than 60 percent of those over 70, and almost 80  percent of those over 80 years of age. Yet, sadly, only one in five  seniors currently diagnosed with hearing issues uses a hearing aid,  which can range in cost from $1,000 to $6,000. For the more than half  of Medicare beneficiaries who live on incomes below $24,150 per year,  these high, out-of-pocket expenses are out of their reach.   We also know seniors account for approximately 80 percent of the 2.8  million Americans with low vision. Routine eye exams for these seniors  can cost from $50 to $300 or more, and the average cost for a pair of  prescription glasses is $196.   Mr. Speaker, it is increasingly well documented that untreated vision  and hearing loss not only diminishes quality of life, but also  increases the risk for costly health outcomes such as falls and  resulting disability, depression, and dementia. Also tragic is that  nearly 70 percent of older Americans currently have no form of dental  insurance. This lack of insurance has been identified as the major  barrier to accessing dental care for seniors. It is a well-known fact  that neglect of oral health can result in the deterioration of overall  physical health and that the lack of access to even routine dental  exams and cleanings can exacerbate serious and complicated overall  health problems that increase with age.   Expanding Medicare to cover vision, dental, and hearing services is a  cost-effective intervention because it will prevent healthcare costs  due to accidents, falls, cognitive impairments and increases in chronic  conditions and oral cancer. But most importantly, giving our seniors  the gift of hearing, vision, and oral health will go a long way toward  helping our seniors enjoy their golden years free from depression and  social isolation.   Mr. Speaker, few bills are ever introduced with this overwhelming  support. Additionally, it has the strong support from the National  Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. I invite my  colleagues to join me and the over 100 original cosponsors of this  legislation in supporting dental, vision, and hearing care for our  seniors.                                      National Committee To Preserve                                      Social Security & Medicare,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Lucille Roybal-Allard,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Roybal-Allard: On behalf of the       millions of members and supporters of the National Committee       to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, I am  [[Page H397]]       writing to endorse, the ``Seniors Have Eyes, Ears and Teeth       Act.'' It is our hope that action will be taken on your       legislation during the current 115th Congress.        The ``Seniors Have Eyes, Ears and Teeth Act'' would help       millions of Medicare beneficiaries who need vision, hearing       and dental care, which is not covered by Medicare. Paying for       these services is a hardship for many Medicare beneficiaries,       half of whom live on incomes below $24,150 per year. Medicare       households spend on average 15 percent of their income, over       two times more than younger households, on Medicare cost       sharing and for services not covered by Medicare.        Routine dental services are very important to the overall       health of Medicare beneficiaries, and today, many Medicare       beneficiaries suffer isolation and severe health problems       because they cannot afford to pay for vision and hearing       examinations or to buy eyeglasses or hearing aids. For these       reasons, the National Committee's current Legislative Agenda       includes support for expanding Medicare benefits to cover       vision, hearing and dental health services and equipment,       which are important for healthy aging.        Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. We       look forward to working with you to secure enactment of the       ``Seniors Have Eyes, Ears and Teeth Act,'' which would       improve the Medicare program for today's seniors as well as       future generations of beneficiaries.            Sincerely,                                                      Max Richtman,      President and CEO.                            ____________________
