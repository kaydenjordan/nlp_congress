 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and colleague  from Utah. I appreciate his service and his force with which he does  things here.   Mr. Speaker, all right, where are we? Gigantic deficits, yet we want  to add to the burden of that deficit with a forced $900 million, nearly  $1 billion, every year in this bill for acquiring new Federal land.   Now, I come from the West, so we are already ravaged by wildfire, by  unmanaged lands that are detrimental to the neighbors, to the private  lands. I have three fires going on in my district right now. A lot of  this emanates from unmanaged Forest Service lands. So, we want to add  to their inability to manage even more lands in this legislation.   Now, the part of the bill that Mr. Bishop had authored is a good  part, taking care of the backlog that we have in our parks and our  lands, if you would listen to him, $20 billion worth of backlog that we  haven't found a way to pay for yet. Yet, instead of finishing our  dinner, we are already going for the dessert by buying more lands that  we can't afford and we know we can't manage.   I will be thinking about this, and my constituents will, as more and  more forest lands burn each year and threaten communities. These  forests are gated off because they don't have time to do the  maintenance and the work that needs to be done so the public can have  access to these lands because of the $20 billion backlog or the funding  to take care of the juniper problem that we have in northeast  California, the wild horse population that needs to be managed so they  don't die out there of starvation during the draught, the sage grouse  habitat so they don't become endangered, and our local counties, our  rural counties, that are already struggling with the lack of PILT funds  because they have to come back here and beg every year for the payment  in lieu of taxes to get this place to keep its commitments on that and  [[Page H3654]]  to secure rural schools funds that our rural counties need.   Mr. Speaker, I say ``no'' on this bill and get back to managing what  we should manage.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission for the decision the other day to not accept the  proposal by an entity called the Klamath River Renewal Corporation,  which seeks to remove four very important hydroelectric dams on the  Klamath River in northern California and southern Oregon.   These dams produce enough renewable hydroelectric power to power  70,000 homes. The problem with renewing them, thinking it is going to  help the fish population, is that it would unleash at least 20 million  cubic yards of silt with who knows what all is in there--heavy metals,  et cetera--that will then be unleashed upon the rest of the river all  the way out to the ocean.   It takes only 3 years to wipe out a salmon population, and it will  take much longer for the silt to dissipate in the river.   So much more needs to be done to explore this situation. I advocate  that we allow these dams to continue to operate and provide power to  our grid that indeed is renewable and helps meet the renewable  portfolio standard for California and not just tear them out at unknown  costs exceeding $450 million.                            ____________________
