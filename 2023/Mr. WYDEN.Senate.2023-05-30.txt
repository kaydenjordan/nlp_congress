 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a woman whose  remarkable life included decades of service fighting hard for fishers  on the Oregon Coast, practicing with distinction as an attorney and  together with her husband Bob, raising a family.   My friend Michele Longo Eder tackled the many administrative duties  in the family's fishing business and somehow found time to serve on  numerous advisory boards to protect fishing families' across Oregon and  the Nation. In the course of her extraordinary life, Michele was  appointed to the National Fishing Vessel Safety Advisory Committee, the  Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, and the U.S. Arctic Research  Commission. My overarching memory of this dynamic Oregonian was her  constant presence in my office. She never backed down from advocating  for fishers and always tried to find solutions to the challenges they  faced.   Michele also worked as a trial attorney. In 2004, she and Gerry  Spence represented Brandon Mayfield, an Oregonian wrongfully  investigated by the FBI for the 2004 train bombing in Madrid. The FBI  targeted Brandon because of a mismatched fingerprint, going so far as  to arrest him for several weeks, even when Spanish authorities clearly  indicated they had other suspects. Michele worked tirelessly and  successfully for Brandon until he regained his rights and freedom.   Michele also volunteered within her own community, finding multiple  ways to be a true public servant in Oregon. She was president of the  Yaquina Bay YMCA, board member for Newport Fishermen's Wives, and a  member of the board of trustees at Oregon State University. She also  screened cases for the Oregon Innocence Project, helping to fight  injustices in our legal system. In a 2014 interview, Michele was asked  to describe fishing with one word. Michele answered ``hope.'' That is  the word that always leaps to mind when I think of Michele along with  grace and the wealth of knowledge she brought to every situation.   I extend my condolences to her husband Bob, their son Dylan, and  their grandkids August Benjamin and Lark Michele.   Michele Longo Eder lived an extraordinary life and deserves huge  thanks for her career of contributions to our State and Nation. Her  dedication to public service will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
