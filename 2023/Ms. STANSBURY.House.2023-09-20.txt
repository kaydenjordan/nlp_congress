 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because labor is in the  House, the people's House, as we stand with workers all across America  who are on strike, especially our United Auto Workers, who are on the  front lines right now.   As a daughter of labor, this is a powerful moment in history. Across  the Nation, across sectors, American workers are tired of giving their  lives for their jobs every single day and getting less in return. They  are standing up, organizing, and demanding better pay, better  conditions, and better benefits.   This movement is about people, about writers, actors, postal workers,  and autoworkers who are paving the path for future generations and  receiving just compensation.   This is the moment. I am proud to stand in solidarity with our United  Auto Workers and every worker across America who is collectively  bargaining for the pay, benefits, and conditions that they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends to stay strong and keep up the fight.                            ____________________
