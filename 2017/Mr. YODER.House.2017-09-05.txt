 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague, Ms. Jenkins, and I appreciate her  support in leading this legislation as we support S. 1616, a bill to  award the Congressional Gold Medal to Senator Bob Dole.   Service, sacrifice, and statesmanship--these are the words that  describe Senator Bob Dole, one of Kansas' proudest native sons and one  of the greatest men to serve and walk the Halls of Congress.   Born and raised in Russell, Kansas, Senator Dole attended my alma  mater, the University of Kansas, where he excelled as a three-sport  varsity athlete for the Jayhawks.   His college career was interrupted by World War II, when he answered  his country's call and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He would distinguish  himself in the service, earning several decorations and becoming  seriously wounded in combat in Italy.   Although those wounds would cause a lifelong disability for him,  Senator Dole did not shy away from the challenges they presented. He  instead used that personal experience to help others, becoming a fierce  advocate for disability rights and the father of the Americans with  Disabilities Act.   His career in public service spanned over 46 years, with his first  election to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1951 and ending with  his Presidential campaign and retirement from the Senate in 1996. His  legislative and political accomplishments during that time are almost  too many to count.   His top priority has always been service to others, whether it is  people with disabilities, Kansas farmers, or his fellow veterans.  Senator Dole has always put his country ahead of himself, and he stayed  grounded in his strong Kansas roots.   I can think of no one more fitting to be recognized with a  Congressional Gold Medal. As a member of the Kansas delegation, I am  truly honored to follow in the footsteps of Senator Dole by serving our  great State and our great country in Congress. He is an inspiration to  me and an enduring example of what statesmanship and public service  should look like.   I ask my colleagues in the House to support this bill and to join me  in working daily to uphold Senator Dole's legacy of service and  civility in Congress.                                time  1745
