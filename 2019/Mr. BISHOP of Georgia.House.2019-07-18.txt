 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R.  582, the Raise the Wage Act, a bill that would radically improve the  lives of millions of Americans.   For ten years, the longest period in United States history, workers  have suffered as the federal minimum wage stayed the same as inflation  rose. With the same wages and rising prices, workers essentially  received a 17 percent pay cut. That's unacceptable, and it's about time  we give American workers a raise.   Americans are working just as hard as any generation, and yet, they  are receiving less than their parents and they are struggling to afford  basic necessities and claim their share of the American dream.   Nationwide polls show that Americans support raising the minimum wage  across geographic and party lines.   Georgia's Second Congressional District, which I represent, is one of  many that would be most impacted. 43 percent of workers would receive a  wage increase. A majority of these workers are women and people of  color, who are disproportionately affected by poverty. The largest age  group that would benefit are those between the ages of 25 and 39.   Nationally, raising the minimum wage to $15 would lift 1.3 million  Americans out of poverty, including 600,000 children. Poverty has  devastating effects on families, and studies have shown children born  into poverty have greater difficulties succeeding in the future.   Mr. Speaker, Americans work hard and should be able to support  themselves and their families. This bill is modest and gradual, giving  businesses plenty of time to adjust. Raising the minimum wage is simply  another way to help our constituents improve their lives and boost the  economy.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
