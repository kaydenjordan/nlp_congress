 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 957) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure  that certain medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs  have physical locations for the disposal of controlled substances  medications.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 957         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PERIODS DURING WHICH ANY INDIVIDUAL                     MAY DISPOSE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES                     MEDICATIONS AT FACILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 3009 of the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D.       Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020       (Public Law 116-315; 38 U.S.C. 8110 note) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (b) and (c) as subsections       (c) and (d), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new       subsection (b):        ``(b) Designation of Periods for Any Individual to Dispose       of Medication.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall designate periods       during which any individual may dispose of controlled       substances medications at a covered Department medical       facility.        ``(2) Public information campaigns.--The Secretary may       carry out public information campaigns regarding the periods       designated under paragraph (1).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 957.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are bringing up to the floor  Senator Kennedy's bill, S. 957, the DUMP Opioids Act. I also want to  commend Congresswoman Miller-Meeks and Congressman Trone for their work  in introducing a House companion to this legislation.   We have all seen reports of a dramatic increase in accidental and  intentional overdose deaths during the pandemic, both among veterans  and nonveterans, in our communities. While addressing the factors that  lead to substance misuse, we must also act immediately to lower access  to controlled substances for those in distress.   I applaud my colleagues for advancing this legislation as one piece  in our lethal means safety approach to suicide and accidental death  prevention.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has been a leader in decreasing  prescribing of opioids and in developing nonopioid forms of pain  management. This is vitally important given what we know about the  health risks that even prescription opioids pose for veterans and  others in our Nation.   At the same time, chronic pain is a challenging, significant, and  ongoing concern for many veterans and there are times when opioids are  appropriately prescribed and monitored. We need to make sure, however,  that people have safe ways to dispose of opioid medications when they  are either no longer needed or when they could be used unsafely in a  home. This bill ensures that veterans and members of the public may  safely dispose of unused controlled substances in special repositories  on VA properties on days specifically designated by VA as public take- back days.   The Secretary of the VA has the authority to set appropriate  guidelines for safe disposal by members of the public.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the DUMP  Opioids Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 957, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1910) to authorize major medical facility projects of the  Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2021.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1910         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Major Medical Facility       Authorization Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR FISCAL YEAR                     2021.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       carry out the following major medical facility projects in       fiscal year 2021 at the locations specified and in an amount       for each project not to exceed the amount specified for such       location:        (1) Construction of an outpatient clinic and national       cemetery in Alameda, California, in an amount not to exceed       $266,200,000.

(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for       fiscal year 2021 or the year in which funds are appropriated       for the Construction, Major Projects account, $2,083,941,000       for the projects authorized in subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 1910.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Senator Tester's S. 1910, the  Major Medical Facility Authorization Act of 2021. I also thank my good  friend and a valued member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  Representative Colin Allred, for introducing the House companion to  this vital and important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, each year, the Department of Veterans Affairs submits an  annual budget request to Congress, and then it is our job to authorize  and appropriate the funding that VA needs to care for America's  veterans and their families. Within that larger funding request is VA's  request for funds to replace and modernize its medical facilities.   This year's major construction request totals just over $2 billion  and will build a much-needed spinal cord injury center in Dallas,  Texas; erect a community living center and renovate domiciliary and  outpatient facilities in Canandaigua, New York; construct an outpatient  clinic and a national cemetery in Alameda, California; and allow for  the construction of a new specialty care building in American Lake,  Washington, among other things.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress, our committee has highlighted VA's aging  infrastructure. It might surprise some Members to learn the median age  of VA medical centers is 58 years old. In the private sector, it is  about 11 years.   Delivering 21st century healthcare in buildings that were built  during the latter half of the 19th century is far from ideal and  certainly not what our veterans deserve.   Despite outdated facilities, RAND and other academic entities have  found VA provides better care than private options, in most cases. That  is right. The VA provides better care even though it is working from  outdated facilities. Imagine what those findings would look like if VA  was competing with a modern infrastructure.   During our oversight efforts, the committee has learned that in order  to fully recapitalize the Department's portfolio, VA would need roughly  $100 billion. The Biden administration's $18 billion proposal to  enhance VA's physical infrastructure is a downpayment in ensuring  veterans have access to the most advanced healthcare and most robust  infrastructure that we can provide.   My colleagues across the aisle may argue that potentially spending  $18 billion on VA's infrastructure is premature because it fails to  consider existing reform efforts already underway, alluding to the AIR  Commission. They will argue that we should wait for the Commission's  findings. Given the severity of underfunding as it relates to VA's  capital assets, we cannot afford to  [[Page H3885]]  wait until the AIR Commission provides recommendations to Congress and  the White House.   Life safety and seismic issues across the portfolio must be addressed  now. Regular maintenance should not be delayed because of budgetary  concerns, nor should we delay retrofitting facilities to meet the needs  of VA's fastest growing population--women veterans--or delay addressing  the lessons learned from this Nation's first pandemic in more than 100  years.   If we are going to build back better, if we are going to build back  trust in VA, we have to start making serious investments in the  outdated infrastructure meant to serve them, and nearly three-fourths  of Americans agree.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I support S. 1910, and I thank Senator  Tester, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for  prioritizing and passing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred), my good friend and a member of the  House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where he is an active member of  the Subcommittee on Health.   (Mr. ALLRED asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 1910, the Major Medical Facility Authorization Act of 2021,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
