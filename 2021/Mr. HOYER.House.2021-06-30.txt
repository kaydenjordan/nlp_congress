 Madam Speaker, the American public watching this debate  must think that some of the verbiage was written by Lewis Carroll.  Lewis Carroll, of course, wrote ``Alice in Wonderland,'' where up was  down, black was white, left was right, and right was left.   There is an advantage, I would tell you, of not having served here  for some time because you don't know what happened in the past. The  gentlewoman who represents the Rules Committee said, gee, there have  been other investigations.   I remember how outraged I was when the Republicans had the eighth  investigation of Benghazi, outraged not only because, as it has been  opined by the gentlewoman, that, oh, we looked at this, but because for  the first seven times, they found nothing there, ``they'' being the  Republicans. And so, they logically concluded, we need to have another  study until we get the answer we want.   Lo and behold, the investigator, Mr. Gowdy, felt to be a person of  extraordinary intellect, which he was, had a study, a partisan study,  and found exactly the same outcome.   The studies to date have found that there were many things done  wrong, but they were limited in their scope, which is, of course, the  one thing that the Republicans wanted to do with the bipartisan  commission they asked for, that the Speaker gave them: five Democrats,  five Republicans; equal power over subpoenas. And the staffing,  clearly, had been worked out on the Senate side.   In the final analysis, the issue was really: See no evil, hear no  evil, speak no evil.   Madam Speaker, like many of our colleagues and many Americans, I had  hoped that Congress would establish a bipartisan commission to  investigate the terrible, tragic, almost unthinkable events of January  6, when we saw Americans assault this Capitol, these Representatives on  this floor and the floor down the hall, calling for the death of the  Vice President of the United States and the Speaker of the House, one  of the most tragic events in the history of our country.   The House brought a bill to this floor. The Speaker brought to this  floor what the minority leader asked for, except for one thing, scope,  the fear that we would look at the very essence of what January 6 was  about.   Yes, some accuse us of concluding that, because the President  recruited people to come to Washington, incited them in a fiery speech,  and then deployed them to the Capitol of the United States, Heaven  forbid that we would look at him as being a cause of that event. That  is only three things that he did.   The House voted on May 19 to do exactly that. And then what happened?  Well, the Republicans all voted against it. Not everyone, strike that.  There were a few courageous souls that did vote for it because they  wanted to see the truth and get the truth. In fact, some of them  articulated the truth, and to that extent, their party kicked them out  of the leadership.   That is what they said: See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. The  Bible says the truth shall set you free, and the people need to know  the truth because that is what will keep them free.   We voted, with hopes that the Senate would concur in the House's  judgment, that a bipartisan commission consistent with what Leader  McCarthy asked for, except for scope--we wanted the commission to be  able to look at the event that was the cause of the commission's  creation. Afterward, however, the former President tweeted:  ``Republicans in the House and Senate should not approve the Democratic  trap of the January 6 commission.''   What was the truth? That was the trap. That was the trap that the  President feared. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.   The Senate was forced to choose between a bipartisan process that  many Republicans had earlier supported--you remember, of course, that  the ranking member of the committee that reported out the commission  bill supported it and urged his colleagues to do so as well. It was not  a partisan effort; it was a bipartisan effort. But, of course, Mr.  Trump hadn't spoken at that point in time.   They were forced to choose between the President and the truth.  Sadly, they chose former President Trump, not truth.   However, the American people are still demanding answers and  accountability, and they deserve both. They want to know that steps are  being taken to understand what happened and take measures to ensure  that it never happens again. It had never happened before, and we don't  want it to happen again.    Just like after the 9/11 attacks, we need to come together, as we did  after 9/11, to ensure that a full investigation is conducted on an  independent and bipartisan basis.   Now, yes, this select committee is not even, as other investigative  committees have not been even. We would prefer even, which is why we  brought it to the floor. Mr. Katko preferred even, which is why we  brought it to the floor. Mr. McCarthy had asked for even, which is why  we brought even to the floor. Sadly, House and Senate Republicans made  it impossible to establish a commission on a bipartisan basis because  you have reached your conclusion. And your conclusion is: Let's move  on. Let bygones be bygones. Let the past be forgotten.   Who said that? John Thune. He said: We don't want to--the gentlewoman  has said it. All they want to do is drag this on because we don't want  it to adversely affect our election. That is what was said. Senator  Thune essentially said that.   Notwithstanding that, the House is going to do its job, and we are  going to create this select committee to achieve the goal of truth. We  will do it on behalf of the people we represent, who watched in horror  as their Capitol was assaulted by a violent mob bent on overturning a  United States election. That is insurrection.   The people who thought it was a tourist visit I don't think were on  the floor. You heard the gentlewoman from California talk about her  experience. It was not a tourist experience.   I hope my Republican friends will participate in this committee's  work in good faith with their Democratic colleagues to carry out its  mission. If they see things being done that are not the truth, then  they ought to tell the truth. They ought to bring up the facts as they  see them.   That is what our adversary system is. We have an adversary system  here in this House. We have an adversary system in our legal system.  Engage, be involved, raise the flag as you see it.                                time  1445    I hope we can come together to create the bipartisan commission so  many have sought and still seek. The launching of this new select  committee will not preclude the alternative objective.   So I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this resolution today,  and I hope we can begin to uncover exactly what happened and take  responsible steps to prevent the events of January 6 from reoccurring,  and, yes, find out who is responsible.   Who is responsible for inciting a mob to come to the Capitol of the  United States to overturn the election of the President of the United  States?   That was their stated intent.  [[Page H3333]]    Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote for this select committee  Americans deserve and want and let us pray they get the truth.
