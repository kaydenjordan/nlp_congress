 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his extraordinary leadership in representing the House  Democrats as the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee. He  brings to that position the values shared by the American people of  fairness, transparency, and openness in what goes on here in Congress,  and doing so in a way that is accountable to the American people. So I  thank him for his leadership.                                time  1000    Sadly, I come to the floor again to talk against, yet again, another  Republican tax scam. The gentleman who just spoke talked about how we  should be filled with joy--filled with joy.   Well, if we are talking about emotion, let us talk about St.  Augustine. St. Augustine, 17 centuries ago--17 centuries ago, 1,700  years ago--said: ``A State which is not governed according to justice  is just a bunch of thieves.''   Pope Benedict, who quoted Augustine, said: ``The State must  inevitably face the question of how justice can be achieved here and  now.'' Benedict cautioned against the danger of certain ethical  blindness caused by the dazzling effect of power and special interest.  That is what they talked about.   This is about justice, justice for our country in terms of economic  justice, justice in our society in terms of everyone participating in  the prosperity of America and not, yet again, the warmed-over stew of  trickle-down economics. If you give 83 percent of the benefits to the  top 1 percent--glory, alleluia--it may trickle down on you. If it does  not, so be it. That is what the former speaker said: So be it.   Let me quote some of the Republicans, enforcing what I said earlier.  Who are these tax scams for?   Congressman Chris Collins said: ``My donors are basically saying,  `Get it done or don't ever call me again.'''   Senator Lindsey Graham said the financial contributions will stop if  this--and I say--if this tax scam fails.   Here we are again. Here we are again at a time, on this last day of  the session, as this body prepares to pack its bags and return home for  the next 6 weeks, the GOP's priorities have been laid bare, as we waste  our final moments debating a new version of the Republicans' same old  tax scam, with no accountability, no transparency, and no fairness for  the American people.   The first GOP tax scam for the rich added $2 trillion to the national  debt, when you talk about the tax cut plus the interest on the debt,  sticking our children with a bill for massive tax breaks for Big  Pharma, big banks, big corporations, making it more profitable for them  to ship jobs overseas, and the wealthiest 1 percent.   People across America have raised their voices to condemn the  Republicans' plan to spend trillions on tax cuts for the wealthy. What  is so sad about it is, in their first tax scam, they decided that they  would set up a thing where the individual mandate was repealed and,  therefore, the benefit of preexisting condition no longer barring you  from having access to health insurance. Their first tax scam was an  assault on the preexisting condition benefit in the Affordable Care  Act.   Not only that--that was not good enough for them--the President went  further in his budget and said: We have increased the debt. Now we have  to pay for it, because, contrary to the illusion that our Republicans  like to present, these tax breaks do not ever pay for themselves.   Don't take it from me. Those who have worked even with Jack Kemp have  said: Anybody who tells you that these tax breaks pay for themselves is  telling you something that is not true, is nonsense, and is BS, except  he said the whole word in our testimony.   So here they are. Now they have to pay for it. Where are they going  to get the money? They have just given 83 percent of the benefits to  the top 1 percent, a big tax break for corporations, enabling them to  send jobs overseas. And who is going to pay for it?   Well, in the President's budget, to make up for the $2 billion plus,  they cut $500 billion from Medicare; $1.4 trillion from Medicaid,  legislation that is not just about poor children but middle-income  seniors, a benefit for middle-income seniors; $214 billion from food  stamps, a benefit needed by our seniors, by our veterans, by our poor  children in America. All of this is to pay for tax cuts for the rich.   So here we are again. Imagine what the Republicans will try to do  after adding trillions more to the deficit. Their intentions are clear.  The President's adviser--whatever his title is now--Larry Kudlow, his  top economic chief, said: If Republicans control Congress, they will  immediately move to cut the larger entitlements, probably next year.   In budget after budget, Republicans have made their plan perfectly  clear: Add trillions to the deficit with their GOP tax scams for the  rich, and then use those deficits to justify slashing Medicare,  Medicaid, and, actually, disability benefits for people on Social  Security.   Added $2 trillion to the debt with their first tax scam, putting  forward a budget that would, again, claw millions of dollars back from  seniors and hardworking Americans, and now they want to do it again.   Well, don't take it from me. AARP wrote a letter to Congress  yesterday to warn against the grievous damage that would be done by the  second phase of Republicans' deficit-exploding tax scam.   They wrote: ``We have grave concerns about H.R. 6760. AARP is  troubled by the further negative effect this bill will have on the  Nation's ability to fund critical priorities.''   They then said: ``The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that  [[Page H9171]]  H.R. 6760 will reduce Federal revenue by approximately $631 billion  over the 10-year budget window. This is in addition to the $1.5  trillion reduction in revenue over the 10-year budget window resulting  from last year's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.''   Revenue, revenue that can be used for investment. Think of what we  could have done with those resources to build the infrastructure of  America, a small piece of it to address the pension crisis in America,  the recognition that investments in education are the best investments  we can make, because nothing brings more to the Treasury than  investments in education. Instead, we have this.   The AARP goes on to say: ``Additional increases of this magnitude in  the deficit will inevitably lead to calls for greater spending cuts,  which are likely to include cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other  important programs serving older Americans.''    The letter concludes: ``AARP cannot support H.R. 6760.''   Again, here we are. They give this big tax break. They say people are  going to get raises and bonuses.   Some got bonuses. That is good. If you worked there a long time and  the rest, you got a bonus. But it didn't add to your base salary, which  would have been the important increase for people to make.   One estimate by Goldman Sachs was that there would be, following the  former tax bill, $1 trillion in buybacks; in other words, corporations  buying back their stock--not investing in their workforce, not  recognizing that their success depends on the productivity of the  workforce and that any increase in productivity should also include an  increase in the wages of the workers, but, instead, an increase in the  compensation for the CEO.   It is shameful.   To conclude on that point, there is a better way to do this. There  could have been, instead of as they did with the first tax scam and now  this one--the first one in the dark of night and in the speed of light,  putting forth a bill that they almost didn't even know what they were  voting for. That did a grave injustice to our Nation for what it  deprives us of by giving these tax breaks at the high end.   There is a way to do it. Mr. Neal has suggested it over and over  again. Let's see what we have done before.   Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neill, 1986, almost a year of hearings and  transparency and openness where the public could see and people could  understand what it meant to them in their lives.   Instead, they just go into those rooms, and say: How can we, how can  we, how can we milk the public? How can we exploit the taxpayer by  adding to the wealth of the wealthiest 1 percent in our country?   It is shameful.   As St. Augustine said, unless a government is formed to promote  justice, it is just a bunch of thieves.   We are robbing from our children's future with this national debt. We  are robbing from the participation in the full benefits of our  prosperity, of our workers, in our country. We are robbing our Nation's  ability to be itself, to make America good again. In doing so, again,  to have people have financial stability in their lives, so that they  can be entrepreneurial, so that they can take risk, so that they can  invest in their children's future.   It is not only good for the individual taxpayer or person in our  country; it is good for our country, because it makes us competitive in  the world with our values and with our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
