 Mr. Speaker, it has been 1 year since the death of a  young woman, Mahsa Amini, in Iran, and it has been 1 year during which  revulsion to repression has given birth to so many courageous Iranians  expressing their defiance of arbitrary restrictions on their freedom.   Nevertheless, it has also been another year of torture and murder at  the hands of a fanatical tyranny. With approval of this legislation  named for Mahsa, we say to Iranians: ``Your voices are heard, your  voices are important, and you are not forgotten.''   While the type of military action against Iran urged by fanatics  outside  [[Page H4246]]  of Iran would be disastrous and counterproductive, through this act we  seek to use all other available means to hold accountable the cruel  repressors in Tehran.   Those of us who are progressives, opposing any war against Iran, are  equally opposed to the Iran war that the government is currently  carrying out against its own children. We share the battle cry of  peaceful Iranian protesters: Woman, life, freedom.   This bill has little to do with the Iran nuclear agreement, which was  wisely negotiated by President Obama's administration and our European  allies. The world is less safe today not because of that agreement but  because of President Trump's unilateral cancellation of the agreement  presenting us today with an Iran that is nearer the development of a  nuclear weapon than it was prior to the agreement.   We need to be seeking to do everything we can to prevent Iran from  acquiring a nuclear weapon short of war; but our desire for a safer  world should not impair our willingness to do more to make Iran safer  for its own citizens.   As Amnesty International reported just this past month, Iranian  authorities have been subjecting victims' families to arbitrary arrest  and detention, imposing restrictions on peaceful gatherings at  gravesites, and even destroying victims' grave markers, and now within  the last few days, detaining Mahsa's uncle so that he cannot speak out  this Saturday on the anniversary of her murder.   Already this year, the Iranian Government has executed 320 people,  doubling the rate prior to Mahsa's death, and giving Iran the wretched  distinction of the highest number of executions per capita in the  entire world.   Building upon current, existing executive orders, this bill proposes  to codify existing sanctions targeting those at the top of the Iranian  regime for their human rights abuses and for this egregious action over  the last year.   Nevertheless, the attacks on President Biden really are misplaced if  this is to be a truly bipartisan initiative. I believe that passage of  the MAHSA Act sends a message to Iranians not about this  administration, but of the fact that we, the elected Members of the  people of the United States, oppose these abuses.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, passage of this act is not about what this  administration has or has not done, but that it reflects the broad  determination of this body, the Congress, the Representatives of the  people of the United States, to speak out against a brutal theocracy.  We stand with Iranians who seek a brighter future where the rule of law  and freedom are respected, and hopefully one day there will be an end  to the terrible division between our two countries.
