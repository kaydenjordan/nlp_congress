 Mr. Speaker, at this time it is an honor to yield to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker), my friend that is  apparently in his last term in this body. Hopefully, he will be serving  in another body.    Reflections on the Privilege of Service in the United States Congress     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. He has been a real asset  here in the House, and I look forward to more accomplishments in the  days to come.   Speaking of people I have served with, now she is a Senator, Marsha  Blackburn of Tennessee, very proud of her home State. She is doing a  great job as a Senator, just as she did a great job in the House.   She has become the object of ridicule by a Chinese state-owned media  editor. This article was written by Christina Wong, December 3. It  says: The European Union Bureau Chief and columnist for Chinese state- run media outlet China Daily lodged a profane insult at U.S. Senator  Marsha Blackburn, Republican from Tennessee, on Thursday in a tweet.   Blackburn, a respected conservative Senator who is a hawk on China,  tweeted Thursday: China has a 5,000 year history of cheating and  stealing. Some things never change.                                time  1445    Chen Weihua, EU bureau chief and columnist for China Daily, then  responded to her tweet with: Witch, spelled with a B, Senator  Blackburn.   Chen then followed up with another tweet that said: This is the most  racist and ignorant U.S. Senator I have seen. A lifetime witch, spelled  with a B at the start of the word.   The gentlewoman retweeted his one-word reply to Blackburn. Blackburn  responded a couple of hours later in a statement. She said: ``From  Tiananmen Square to Uighur genocide, Communist China is an expert at  slaughtering populations. America will not bow down to sexist Communist  thugs.''   Breitbart News' James Pinkerton profiled Chen in May. He wrote:  ``Chen Weihua works for the government-owned China Daily, reliably  cranking out articles with headlines such as `White House must  concentrate on fighting outbreak, not China-bashing,' and, `Washington  must stop making decisions which undermine WHO.'   ``In other words, his journalistic output nicely coincides with the  People's Republic of China's propaganda plans, from deflecting blame  for the coronavirus away from Beijing to defending Beijing's minions at  the World Health Organization.''   Chen has previously tweeted: ``Trump and Pompeo are not even good  liars.''   Pinkerton noted that Chen bashes the President and his administration  reliably, but also eagerly, echoing top Democrats and leading never  Trumpers.   Chen has also called Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri,  another leading China hawk in the Senate, ``ignorant.'' Hawley  responded: ``#China not happy about my call to confront their economic  imperialism by ending the WTO and replacing it with a system that is  good for American workers. I love being insulted by #China state-run  press.''   Pinkerton noted that Chen has been the beneficiary of many liberal  programs in the U.S.   Chen lists on his blue-checkmark verified Twitter bio he was a John  S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford and a World Press Institute  Fellow at Macalester College in Minnesota. He also listed the Freedom  Forum in Washington, D.C.   So isn't that special. Perhaps one of these institutions is where he  learned to call women witches, spelled what a B wherever it was. He is  not a very polite person and is very defensive of being part of a  misogynistic, sexist, racist, and religion-hating administration. He is  apparently proud of that. It is very unfortunate.   But I am proud of Senator Blackburn. We are known by our friends, but  we are known even more by our enemies, and Senator Blackburn has a real  enemy there.   I was reminded back early on in my time in China when we went to  China. She and I, the two of us, personally confronted, in Beijing, the  Chinese bureaucrat in charge of enforcing copyright and patent fraud,  which was just overwhelming in China. The amount that the state  appeared to not only allow but actually be involved in was pretty  staggering. At one point, either Marsha or I asked: Why do you allow  all of this patent fraud and copyright theft to go on?   The Chinese bureaucrat indicated that, actually, they don't. They  step in, and, in fact, he said the year before, they had seized the  assets from 500 different vendors who were selling copyright- or  patent-infringed goods. Whether DVDs, CDs, things that violated  Americans' patents, they seized them.   I said: So what did you do with what you seized?   I don't know Chinese law, but his indication was that, well, under  Chinese law, we can't just destroy goods that have value, so we had to  do something with them.   It appeared very clear that they seized these assets that were  violating international trade, copyright, and patent laws. If they are  not allowed to destroy such goods, then, obviously, they had to get rid  of them since they felt they had value. So, the Chinese Government must  have gotten into the business of selling copyright- and patent- infringed goods. So, there is not a lot of comfort there.   Marsha and I did talk back then, and once you get away from the  center of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing and you get around to  different cities in China, Mr. Speaker, we were both reminded they were  so hospitable, so gracious, and so wanting you to  [[Page H6853]]  have a good experience in their towns. It reminded us both of Southern  hospitality here in the U.S. The people were absolutely wonderful, Mr.  Speaker. You just had to get away from the central government before  you saw just how wonderful and fantastic the Chinese people are.   But in Beijing, you have the hotbed of Communist Party activity.  Although there are some in the United States who are wanting to get to  being a Communist nation as quickly as possible, we see, anytime there  is a Communist government, it is not good for the people at all.   Another story from Simon Kent, December 1: ``No Twitter `Fact-Check'  Warning on Chinese Official's Fake Photo of Australian Soldier  Beheading Child.''   A lot of people have seen the photo, yes, but the Chinese produced a  photo that was falsified. The Australian soldier was not about to  behead a child. It is just more fake information out of the Chinese  Communist Party.   I guess if you are Twitter, Mr. Speaker, that is not something you  would fact-check. You only want to fact-check honorable and honest  people with whom you have disagreements. You wouldn't want to fact- check someone who is providing you a lot of money despite their  retraining camps, their lies, and their official misrepresentations.  You wouldn't want to do that because they might be tempted to cut back  the revenue to your form of business.   So, as Chris Plante says, if it weren't for double standards, they  would have no standards at all there at Twitter.   Twitter expands hate speech rules. Well, of course, you are not going  to go after people who truly are full of hate, Mr. Speaker. They think  conservatives are hateful. As a Christian, we are admonished by Jesus  to love one another. We were admonished by Jesus Himself to love the  Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and soul. The second is like  it: Love your neighbor as yourself.    So, Christianity is truly a religion based completely on love. It is  such an incredible thing to base a religion on, but that is what it is.  God so loved the world He gave His Son; His Son so loved the world He  gave His life. Then, you have people saying: Well, these Christians and  these churches are full of nothing but hate, when actually that is  doing what the Chinese Communist Party does. You are taking something  out of context and actually perverting the actual beliefs of  Christianity.   Twitter is expanding hate speech rules that will allow them to  continue to produce things and get revenue from the Chinese Communist  Party and not call into question their true hate of groups that might  disagree with them. You run over them with a tank if they disagree with  you even though they are unarmed. That is the kind of thing that  Twitter is embracing here.   But this story from Lucas Nolan, 3 December, says: ``Twitter has once  again expanded its hate speech policies to `prohibit language that  dehumanizes people on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national  origin.' ''   That is really rich coming from Twitter since they embrace the  Chinese Communist Party and their hatred and their dehumanization of  Uighurs, Christians, and people who want to have more than one child,  and based on race, ethnicity, and national origin.   ``Engadget reports that social media platform Twitter has expanded  its hate speech policies again, this time to `prohibit language that  dehumanizes people.' ''   And on it goes: ``The change in policy comes more than 2 years after  Twitter said that it intended to ban dehumanizing language and over 6  months from that last change to the site's policies that banned hate  speech relating to age, disability, and disease.''   So, anyway, again, if it weren't for double standards, Twitter would  have no standards at all.   This article from Rich Noyes, November 24, ``The Stealing of the 2020  Presidency: The Media Kept the Truth From Americans'': ``A new study  shows that if the media didn't apply a leftist bias to its Presidential  news coverage, Donald Trump would have comfortably won a second term as  President.   ``To measure the true effect of the media's censorship on the  election, the Media Research Center asked The Polling Company to survey  1,750 Biden voters in seven swing States--Arizona, Georgia, Michigan,  Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin--six of which, all  but North Carolina, were called for Biden. We tested these voters'  knowledge of eight news stories, all important topics that our ongoing  analysis had shown the liberal news media had failed to cover properly.  We found that a huge majority, 82 percent, of Biden voters were unaware  of at least one of these key items, with 5 percent saying they were  unaware of all eight of the issues we tested.   ``This lack of information proved crucial: One of every six Biden  voters we surveyed, 17 percent, said they would have abandoned the  Democratic candidate had they known the facts about one or more of  these news stories. A shift of this magnitude would have changed the  outcome in all six of the swing States won by Joe Biden, and Donald  Trump would have comfortably won a second term as President.''   Now, that is from Newsbusters. I really like those folks, but they  are wrong about that. As we saw from the results and what occurred, and  we are seeing more evidence every day, this concludes Donald Trump  would have won comfortably. But as many of us know, there would have  been more trucks with more fake ballots that would have been brought  in, so the claim would have been made anyway that Donald Trump did not  win because they just needed to know how many ballots they needed to  overcome and they would bring them in to do so.                                time  1500    Consistent with that, from Just the News, David Payne--it is a story  about what has been going on.   Sworn testimony of several whistleblowers on Tuesday--and this isn't  like the fake whistleblower against President Trump that didn't  actually hear the conversation. He was basing it on double hearsay.  These are actually whistleblowers who had firsthand knowledge of what  went on. And when they testified under oath from those who say there is  no evidence, it is unfounded to say there was fraud, it is not their  fault they are saying that, it is just they are very uneducated.   So to help with that, when a witness has firsthand knowledge,  personally observe, personally saw something occur, and they put that  in a sworn affidavit, then we have evidence. It is not unfounded. I  know people that have said that. It is not their fault. They are just  ignorant, uneducated on what is evidence and what isn't. But sworn  testimony is evidence when it is first person.   And there are some exceptions to the hearsay rule that lots of  articles have been written about and discussed in legal treatises. But  in this case, it is not hearsay for most of these things that have been  produced.         But sworn testimony of several whistleblowers alleged what       one election integrity activist is calling ``potential ballot       fraud on a massive scale,'' with multiple eyewitnesses       testifying to alleged suspicious behavior in Pennsylvania and       Wisconsin.        In a press conference in Arlington, Virginia, the Amistad       Project--a civil liberties initiative of the Thomas More       Society--presented the testimony of three individuals who       claim to have witnessed apparent voting malfeasance--that       means wrongdoing for those that don't know about evidence--      during the 2020 election.        One, Jesse Morgan, a truck driver for a subcontractor with       the United States Postal Service, claimed that a trailer he       was driving, one full of potentially upwards of 288,000       ballots, disappeared from its parked location at Lancaster,       Pennsylvania, U.S. Postal Service depot after Morgan dropped       it off there. Morgan had transported these ballots from       Bethpage, New York.    Well, that is interesting. You could have 288,000 voting ballots that  were produced in Bethpage, New York, and supplied to Pennsylvania-- apparently, having already been voted in. And it is possible that  people would want to give them the benefit of the doubt. It is possible  they had 288,000 people from Pennsylvania just temporarily residing in  Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and wanted to vote absentee in the  Pennsylvania election.   So, yeah, maybe it is possible that 288,000 Pennsylvanians were not  in Pennsylvania pursuing homemade pumpkins pies--Perry Como used to  sing--that they were actually in Bethpage, New York.         The subcontractor also reportedly experienced ``odd       behaviors'' from U.S. Postal Service personnel, behaviors       which postal experts have said in sworn statements, ``grossly       deviated from normal procedure and  [[Page H6854]]       behavior,'' according to a press release from the Amistad       Project.    Mr. Speaker, by the way, for anybody that might be uneducated on the  ways of court evidence, in a civil matter such as this, the normal  standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, just the  slightest evidence more showing that conduct probably was in  appropriate. That is enough. It does not have to be beyond a reasonable  doubt unless you are getting ready to prosecute people under criminal  laws.   Once you move into the criminal realm to prosecute people guilty of  election fraud, then it does need to be beyond a reasonable doubt but  not to establish a standard for an injunction to prevent  decertification or to force decertification after certification, or to  actually declare an election invalid, even. That is a burden of more  probable than not, or probable cause rather than beyond a reasonable  doubt.        Another whistleblower, Nathan Pease of Madison, Wisconsin--      himself also a subcontractor for the U.S. Postal Service--      alleged that he was told that the postal service was planning       to backdate tens of thousands of ballots in the days after       the November 3 election in order to circumvent the ballot       submission deadline.        A third witness, Gregory Stenstrom--who testified at a       Pennsylvania legislature hearing in Gettysburg last week--      claimed to have witnessed a Dominion Voting Systems vendor       inserting jump drives into voting aggregation machines in       Delaware County, Pennsylvania.    And for those that don't know, that is not appropriate under the  situation, as was here. And it really shouldn't be appropriate in any  situation. We need to do away with the ability to have some foreign- owned counting service, like we have had in Texas, in the big cities-- no county that wasn't a big city controlled by Democratic officials  would ever allow that to happen in east Texas, west Texas, south Texas,  north Texas. But in our big cities, yes, they will hire foreign firms,  as they have, or firms funded by foreign money. They will hire them.   But they should not be, number one, connected to internet, should not  ever be susceptible of foreign ability to access information, which  means also to manipulate information if they are good hackers. And just  as I said in 2001, back when I was a felony judge in Texas and Congress  overstepped what was appropriate and ordered that every county in  America had to give up what system of voting, no matter how effective  and appropriate and protected it was, and all by electronic voting  machines, it costs, seemed like $2 billion or so dollars. It was an  unfunded mandate. But worse to me is someone who worked in our county  courthouse--I said back in 2001, this means because of Congress'  inappropriate bill they passed, that eventually elections will go to  the best--the person with the best hacker. And now, 19 years later,  that is what we have.   Mr. Speaker, but it wasn't just hacking. It was also manipulation  that wasn't hacking. There were doors to which electronic experts could  go to manipulate things. It was creating fraudulent ballots. It was-- also, as I recall, the Texas constitution itself requires that ballots  are to be numbered sequentially, and I don't believe that has been done  in quite some time.    So Texas, even though President Trump won and we picked up Republican  seats there, I would submit it would be potentially even better results  if we had ballots that comported with the Texas constitution. And I  would submit that everybody ought to be having sequentially numbered  ballots just to protect the election and voting process.   ``In its press release, Amistad Project director, Phil Kline, said  the testimonies are `compelling.' ''   You see, testimony means things that were said under oath, which  means it is evidence. It is a foundation for the claims of election  fraud.   `` This evidence joins with unlawful conduct by State and local  election officials, including accepting millions of dollars of private  funds, to undermine the integrity of this election, Kline said.' In  this press release, the Amistad Project says it has collected sworn  expert testimony alleging that `over 300,000 ballots are at issue in  Arizona, 548,000 in Michigan, 204,000 in Georgia, and over 121,000 in  Pennsylvania.' ''   And in case there is wondering about whether or not that would affect  the election, that would absolutely affect the election in each of  those states.   The story from PJ Media, Tyler O'Neal, December 1, again, talks about  the truck driver that testified--which means it was under oath and it  is evidence--``He had driven thousands of ballots from Bethpage, New  York, to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 2 weeks before Election Day. Phil  Kline, a former attorney general of Kansas and director of the Amistad  Project of the Thomas More Society, said that the Amistad Project  corroborated the truck driver's story.''   So that is evidence.   This story by Jim Hoft: ``Colonel Phil Waldron''--that I believe he  has some former NSA folks that work with him--``tells Michigan  lawmakers truckloads of ballots for Joe Biden were inserted into the  Michigan 2020 election.''         Colonel Phil Waldron spoke tonight--this is dated December       2--at a Michigan hearing following his explosive testimony in       Arizona on Monday on the voting machines used in U.S.       elections. The Dominion systems were connected to the       internet as well, despite Dominion's claims to the contrary.    And that also--let me insert here--that also helps explains the U.S.  Government's director that was suppose to have been protecting our  election, cybersecurity, making sure it was secured. There was a puff  piece done on the director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Association--or agency. Krebs was his name, Christopher Krebs. He had  indicated in an article on Election Day that he wanted to thank his  partners in Silicon Valley. And he was also grateful--I am sure he had  someone in Dominion advising him, but Krebs said everything is good  because he talked to people that might have been involved in the fraud  and they assured him everything was good. So he said everything was  good.   Also, with our Attorney General Barr, he said he had seen no evidence  of fraud. And there are others that have said the same thing. And I  would humbly submit that all you have to do is close your eyes, stick  your fingers in your ear, and sing ``la la la'' for a long period of  time. Keep it up and you will neither see nor hear any evidence of  fraud.   So if our Attorney General can keep that up, then he will continue  not to see or hear any evidence of fraud. So, hopefully, he has not  been listening to what I have had to say here in the House because,  here, again, it would cause him to demand to see and hear the actual  evidence, and he may not want to do that so he can stay consistent.   But the evidence is there. It is evidence. It is sworn. And as this  article points out:         According to Waldron, the United States has a copy of the       traffic and the packets of information that were sent to       Germany on election night.        Yesterday, the first expert at the Arizona State       Legislature hearing with Rudy Giuliani was U.S. cybersecurity       expert, Colonel Phil Waldron.    And Phil is an impressive man, an impressive person when it comes to  cybersecurity.                                time  1515    ``Colonel Phil Waldron spoke first at the Arizona hearing about the  voting machines used in the U.S. election. The Dominion systems were  connected to the internet as well, despite Dominion's claims to the  contrary. The records within the system can be manipulated by outside  parties and insiders as well.   ``On Wednesday night, Colonel Waldron told the committee that they  have witnesses now who delivered truckloads of ballots for Joe Biden  from New York to Pennsylvania. Waldron said they likely did the same  thing in Wisconsin.   ``Waldron explained that Democrats inserted truckloads of fraudulent  ballots into the fraudulent 2020 election.''   Many people saw the video from Georgia that was played yesterday,  last evening. This article from The Gateway Pundit, December 3, says:  ``Earlier today Cristina Laila reported on the explosive video that was  revealed during the Georgia ballot counting at the State Farm Arena  where crooked Democrats pulled out suitcases full of ballots and began  counting these ballots without election monitors in the room.   ``Trump's legal team showed a video from the State Farm Arena  tabulation center when poll workers were told to leave at 10:25 p.m.  [[Page H6855]]    ``A few `workers' stayed behind and were seen pulling suitcases of  full of ballots out from under tables to be tabulated.''   So that seems strange, if you believe that the mainstream media never  reports anything but facts, because you can, as I did yesterday, go  online and put into Google anything about vote counting being suspended  during election night. All of the first entries you get tell you that  it was fact-checked; it is not true; it is fraudulent representation.  It is not true; there was never any suspension of vote counting for  anytime in the swing States.   In other words, even though you heard it and you saw it happening on  TV, don't believe your lying eyes and ears; believe what we tell you,  because we are coming to you through the internet, so you can trust us,  but don't trust your lying eyes or ears.   Anyway, in that video, it is very clear, they did pull out suitcases  full of ballots that were--whether intentional or not, they were hidden  under tables, and they weren't pulled out until after the monitors and  the other vote counters were ordered to leave, that they were stopping  the vote counting, and they did leave. That is when the ballots come  out from under the table and the counting of those ballots begins. It  is absolutely extraordinary.   But some of us have known that this kind of activity has been going  on. We know that there were electronic manipulations in Dallas County  in 2018. It is really unfortunate. Our Texas Attorney General had a  chance to be a national hero, had they stepped in, utilized evidence  from there. And I have heard people say, Well, I heard about that.  There was really nothing to that.   Well, I have been following that for two years and trying to get  people in law enforcement to do something about it. But they avoided  the chance to be a national hero and refused to go after the fraud that  existed in the 2018 primary and general election in Dallas County,  again, by a firm that had foreign money supporting it, and they did the  counting for Dallas County. But since nothing was done there, then the  people were free to continue that type of operation in the national  election.   Here is an article from Joel Pollak. ``Attorneys Sidney Powell and  Lin Wood told a rally in Atlanta, Georgia . . . Republicans should not  vote in the January 5 runoff election for U.S. Senate unless State  authorities rectify problems in the State's voting system.''   And I haven't talked to Lin Wood or Sidney Powell about that, but I  would imagine, knowing them, that they were trying to make the point  that this system needs to be cleaned up before the election on January  5, because we do need people to vote in that election--not multiple  times, but legally; not people come in and illegally vote, but people  vote legally as to who they want to represent them in the U.S. Senate.   So here is a story from the Epoch Times, Christina Kim, November 28:  ``The complaint against Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson  and Governor Gretchen Whitmer, marks the beginning of Powell's lawsuit  against the State.   ``Some of the allegations are repeated claims from Michigan and other  States. Republican challengers were unable to `meaningfully observe,'  and workers were instructed to backdate ballots.   ``Other claims are newer.   ``Expert witness, Russell James Ramsland, Jr., works with the Allied  Security Operations Group. In the past, he has worked with NASA and  MIT.   ``Ramsland said there were four `physically impossible' `spikes  totaling almost 385,000 ballots allegedly processed in a combined  interval of 2 hours and 38 minutes.' He concluded that `Dominion alone  is responsible for the injection, or fabrication, of 290,000 illegal  votes in Michigan that must be disregarded.' This is nearly twice the  number of ballots by which Biden is leading Trump, which is  approximately 150,000 ballots.   ``Dr. David Keshavarz-Nia has a Ph.D. in engineering and technology  and received advanced training from the CIA, NSA and DHS. In his sworn  statement . . . ''--and again, since it is a sworn statement, it means  the allegations are not unfounded and there is evidence of what is  alleged--`` `that USB memory cards were used to facilitate  administrative' backdoor access `to disrupt polling operations and  impact ballot counting across Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona  and Wisconsin.'   ``He also said, after a detailed analysis of the New York Times data,  in his expert judgment, `the vote count distribution in Pennsylvania,  Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia, are not based on  normal system operation. Instead, they are caused by fraudulent  electronic manipulation of the targeted voting machines.'   ``Another affidavit was submitted by someone whose name and personal  information was redacted. This person was an electronic intelligence  analyst with extensive experience as a white hat hacker used by some of  the top election specialists in the world.    ``The expert alleged that a search of Edison Research showed they had  an Iranian server and there are records showing China accessing  Dominion Voting's servers.'' Wow. ``Edison Research reports the vote  count tabulation to Decision Desk HQ for election results.   ``According to the affidavit, the digital forensics analysis shows  there is `unambiguous evidence that Dominion Voter Systems and Edison  Research have been accessible and were certainly compromised by rogue  actors, such as Iran and China.' ''   Now, this is an area that does require expertise, and that is why you  need experts to come in and testify about it. It is true that simply  making a statement under oath in an area that requires expertise may  not be considered evidence until a judge--going back to the Merrell Dow  decision of the U.S. Supreme Court--the judge became the gatekeeper,  had to make inquiries of the expert outside the hearing of the jury,  and determine whether or not this person was expert in an area in which  he was proffered as a witness, and if the judge so finds, then that is,  indeed, sworn evidence before the court.   ``The complaint asks the Court to provide emergency relief to de- certify Wayne County's results, stop Benson and Whitmer from  transmitting the State's certifications to the Electoral College, and  `to transmit certified election results that President Donald Trump is  the winner of the election' in Michigan, among other requests.   ``Michigan's Senate Committee is set to meet next Tuesday, December  1, to hear testimony about absentee ballot counting at Detroit's TCF  center.''   You know, this is a matter that should be thoroughly investigated by  all areas of the Government, the three branches of Government,  including--for those who we are told are recent college graduates that  know the Three Stooges' names better than the three branches of  Government--it is the executive branch, from the President all the way  down; the legislative branch, including Congress and the Senate; and  also the judiciary branch, where you would ultimately come to have  judicial decisions made over these things.   Those are all important. We all ought to be investigating this. It is  part of our job as Members of Congress. That is what we need to be  doing.   Yet, it is worth noting--and I think important to note--that as we  heard the majority leader talking about concerns about COVID and  businesses going bankrupt and not being able to operate and, of course,  the unconstitutional shutdown of churches, where the Government does  prohibit the free exercise of religion, those matters should concern  everybody and especially about who you place as your servant in the  Government.   But we hear the words from some people in this body about how  critical it is that we do something about COVID. One of the first  things we should have done--we had over $120 billion that was unused  that was authorized and appropriated in the original Payroll Protection  Program. It is just sitting there. All we have got to do is say yes, go  back and allow that to be used by businesses in trouble under the same  conditions, or we can modify them, and we have a bill.   And Republicans have been, We don't care. Put a Democrat name on  there. That is fine. Let's just do it to help businesses avoid going  out of business. Instead, what we took up was the tiger bill. We took  that up pretty quick this week.   And as my friend, Dr. DesJarlais, pointed out, if you look at the  time that we spent in here voting on the  [[Page H6856]]  tiger bill, that, as I understand, only pertains to one place that  keeps tigers, that during that period we voted on the tiger bill, there  have been more people die of COVID than have died from tigers over the  last 25 years. Yet, we rush in here to do the tiger bill.   I know there is a lot of use, metaphorically, of the red pill/blue  pill from The Third Eye or The Matrix. And it is intriguing. You know,  the red pill is supposed to show you truth, what is really going on,  and the blue pill, you will just be in blissful ignorance. I couldn't  help but be reminded of that.   When we are in here, we are not passing anything to help with COVID,  not to help businesses going out of business. We are passing what ought  to be called the blue pill law. We are not going to fix your problems,  but we are hoping you will smoke dope so that you can--marijuana. So we  are--I didn't vote for it--but appropriating a bunch of money to make  marijuana more accessible, not for medicinal purposes--a lot of us are  okay with that--but for widespread recreational use.   So that if you are bothered--whether it is seeing an election stolen  or seeing your business go bankrupt, because the Government won't you  let you open, or seeing your church being closed and the preacher being  taken down for someone who failed to wear a mask--smoke some dope. That  is the message of the week. And that is what we did this week.   So that is the message from the majority. Go smoke some dope, take  the blue pill, and you will enjoy life so much more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
