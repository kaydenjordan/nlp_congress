 Mr. President, today, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon will  sign a joint resolution of the Wyoming Legislature recognizing December  10, 2019, as Wyoming Women's Suffrage Day.   On December 10, 1869, the Wyoming Territory passed the first law in  U.S. history granting women the right to vote and hold public office.  This right became so important to the people of Wyoming that, when the  State sought statehood, it refused to enter the Union if this right was  not protected.   In 2015, I came to the floor to speak in honor of the 125th  anniversary of Wyoming statehood. I shared with the Senate the  challenge Wyoming faced from Congress in its quest to become a member  of the Union. I believe it is timely to share that story again.   The debate in Congress was contentious, with the arguments centering  on one of our most proud accomplishments: a decision made long before  Wyoming became a State. On December 10, 1869, the Wyoming Territory was  the first in the United States to grant women the right to vote.   Efforts to attain statehood finally came to fruition 20 years later.  It was incumbent on our delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives,  Joseph M. Carey, to convince his colleagues to support the statehood  bill.   On March 26, 1890, the day of the statehood bill debate, Joseph Carey  spoke passionately about Wyoming. His words still hold true today. He  said that Wyoming was rich in agricultural possibilities. He explained  Wyoming was one of nature's great storehouses of minerals. Joseph Carey  also talked about grazing development, educational leadership,  widespread railway construction, the model Constitution, and the unique  opportunities for women.   Yet opponents to our statehood did not support women having the right  to vote. On the same day as Joseph Carey's impassioned speech,  Representative William Oates of Alabama argued against our admittance  to the Union. He said, ``Mr. Speaker, I do not hesitate to say that in  my judgment the franchise has been too liberally extended. Should we  ever reach universal suffrage this Government will become practically a  pure democracy and then the days of its existence are numbered.''   The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed Wyoming's statehood  bill with a vote of 139 to 127. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on June  27, 1890. Wyoming officially became the 44th State on July 10, 1890,  and became the first state to allow women the right to vote and hold  public office.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Enrolled Joint  Resolution No. 1 of the Sixty-Fifth Legislature of the State of Wyoming  recognizing December 10, 2019, as Wyoming Women's Suffrage Day.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S1322]]                       Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 1, Senate               SIXTY-FIFTH LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WYOMING                            2019 GENERAL SESSION         A Joint Resolution recognizing December 10, 2019 as Wyoming       Women's Suffrage Day.        1Whereas, Wyoming is often referred to as the ``Cowboy       State,'' its more apt sobriquet is the ``Equality State'';       and        Whereas, women, like all persons, have always inherently       held the right to vote and participate in their government;       and        Whereas, Wyoming was the first government to explicitly       acknowledge and affirm women's inherent right to vote and to       hold office; and        Whereas, this inherent right, at the founding of the United       States, was inhibited; and        Whereas, women, at the founding of the United States, were       also prevented from holding office; and        Whereas, women's suffrage--the basic enfranchisement of       women--began to burgeon in the United States in the 1840s and       continued to gain momentum over the next decades, despite the       oppressive atmosphere in which women were not allowed to       divorce their husbands or show their booted ankles without       risk of public scandal or worse; and        Whereas, during the 1850s, activism to support women's       suffrage gathered steam, but lost momentum when the Civil War       began; and        Whereas, in the fall of 1868, three (3) years after the       American Civil War had ended, Union Army General Ulysses S.       Grant was elected President, and chose John Campbell to serve       as Governor of the Wyoming Territory; and        Whereas, Joseph A. Carey, who was thereafter appointed to       serve as Attorney General of the Wyoming Territory, issued a       formal legal opinion that no one in Wyoming could be denied       the right to vote based on race; and        Whereas, the first Wyoming Territorial Legislature,       comprised entirely of men, required consistent and persistent       inveigling to warm to the notion of suffrage; and        Whereas, abolitionist and woman suffrage activist, Esther       Hobart Morris, was born in Tioga County, New York, on August       8, 1812, and later became a successful milliner and       businesswoman; and        Whereas, Esther Hobart Morris, widowed in 1843, moved to       Peru, Illinois, to settle the property in her late husband's       estate and experienced the legal hardships faced by women in       Illinois and New York; and        Whereas, Esther Hobart Morris married John Morris, a       prosperous merchant, and in 1869 moved to the gold rush camp       at South Pass City, a small valley situated along the banks       of Willow Creek on the southeastern end of the Wind River       Mountains in the Wyoming Territory just north of the Oregon       Trail; and        Whereas, William Bright, a saloonkeeper, also from the once       bustling frontier mining town South Pass City, was elected to       serve in the Territorial Legislature and was elected as       president of the Territorial Council; and        Whereas, the Territorial Legislature met in 1869 in       Cheyenne and passed bills and resolutions formally enabling       women to vote and hold property and formally assuring equal       pay for teachers; and        Whereas, William Bright introduced a bill to recognize the       right of Wyoming women to vote; and        Whereas, no records were kept of the debate between Wyoming       territorial lawmakers, although individuals likely asserted a       myriad of motivations and intentions in supporting women's       suffrage; and        Whereas, the Wyoming Territory population at the time       consisted of six adult men for every adult woman, some       lawmakers perchance hoped suffrage would entice more women to       the state; and        Whereas, some lawmakers may have believed that women's       suffrage was consistent with the goals articulated in post-      Civil War Amendment XV to the United States Constitution       guaranteeing the ``right of citizens of the United States to       vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or       by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition       of servitude''; and        Whereas, some lawmakers inherently knew that guaranteeing       the right of women to vote was, simply, the right thing to       do; and        Whereas, the Territorial Legislature advanced a suffrage       bill stating, ``That every woman of the age of twenty-one       years, residing in this territory, may, at every election to       be holden under the laws thereof, cast her vote. And her       rights to the elective franchise and to hold office shall be       the same under the election laws of the territory, as those       of electors'' and that ``This act shall take effect and be in       force from and after its passage''; and        Whereas, when invited to join the Union, demanding that       women's suffrage be revoked, the Wyoming Legislature said,       ``We will remain out of the Union one hundred years rather       than come in without the women''; and        Whereas, in July 1890, Esther Hobart Morris presented the       new Wyoming state flag to Governor Francis E. Warren during       the statehood celebration, making Wyoming the 44th state to       enter the Union and the first with its women holding the       right to vote and serve in elected office; and        Whereas, the United States did not endorse women's suffrage       until 1920 with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the       U.S. Constitution; and        Whereas, despite the passage of the 19th Amendment, women       of color continued to face barriers with exercising their       right to vote, as American Indian men and women were not       recognized as United States citizens permitted to vote until       the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, and       ongoing racial discrimination required the passage and       implementation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; and        Whereas, achieving voting rights for all women required       firm and continuing resolve to overcome reluctance, and even       fervent opposition, toward this rightful enfranchisement; and        Whereas, Wyoming, the first to recognize women's suffrage,       blazed a trail of other noteworthy milestones, such as Louisa       Swain, of Laramie, casting the first ballot by a woman voter       in 1870; and        Whereas, in 1870 the first jury to include women was in       Wyoming and was sworn in on March 7 in Laramie; and        Whereas, Esther Hobart Morris was appointed to serve as       justice of the peace in February 1870, making her the first       woman to serve as a judge in the United States; and        Whereas, Wyoming women become the first women to vote in a       presidential election in 1892; and        Whereas, in 1894 Wyoming elected Estelle Reel to serve as       the state superintendent of public instruction, making her       one of the first women in the United States elected to serve       in a statewide office; and        Whereas, the residents of the town of Jackson in 1920       elected a city council composed entirely of women - dubbed       the ``petticoat government'' by the press - making it the       first all-women government in the United States; and        Whereas, in 1924 Wyoming elected Nellie Tayloe Ross to       serve as governor of the great state of Wyoming, making her       the first woman to be sworn in as governor in these United       States; and        Whereas, all these milestones illuminate and strengthen       Wyoming's heritage as the ``Equality State''; and        Whereas, December 10, 2019 marks the 150th anniversary of       the date women's suffrage became law.        Now, therefore, be it resolved by the members of the       Legislature of the State of Wyoming:        Section 1. That the Wyoming legislature commemorates 2019       as a year to celebrate the one hundred fiftieth (150th)       anniversary of the passage of women's suffrage.        Section 2. That the Wyoming legislature is proud of its       heritage as the first state to recognize the right of women       to vote and hold office, hereby affirming its legacy as the       ``Equality State.''        Section 3. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit       a copy of this resolution to the National Women's Hall of       Fame in support of Esther Hobart Morris' induction into the       Women of the Hall.        Section 4. That the Wyoming legislature encourages its       citizens and invites its visitors to learn about the women       and men who made women's suffrage in Wyoming a reality,       thereby blazing a trail for other states, and eventually the       federal government, to recognize the inherent right of men       and women alike to elect their leaders and hold office.                            ____________________
