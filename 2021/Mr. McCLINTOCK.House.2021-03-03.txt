 Mr. Speaker, whenever the left takes control of local  law enforcement, the result is predictable and catastrophic. They act  to defund the police, deliberately withhold police protection from law- abiding shopkeepers and citizens, declare sanctuaries for criminal  illegal aliens, decline to charge criminals, and prevent law-abiding  citizens from protecting themselves.   Mr. Speaker, we are now suffering the result: skyrocketing homicides,  shootings, and other violent crimes, preying most of all upon the  decent citizens of our inner cities. Now, after their summer of love  and lawlessness, look at the results. Their storefronts are boarded up.  Their buildings are burned out. Their streets are increasingly  surrendered to the lawless.   Frankly, the Democrats in Congress that have applauded these policies  would not be my first choice to micromanage every police department  across our country as this bill does; just saying.   The ultimate target of the left is not isolated abuses by law  enforcement officers but, rather, law enforcement itself. As we can now  see, without law enforcement, there is no law.
