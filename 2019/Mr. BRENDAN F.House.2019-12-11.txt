 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Chair, I thank the  chairman and all the colleagues of mine on both sides of the aisle and  my committee, the Ways and Means Committee.   What a perfect illustration of the difference in priorities between  the two parties. The major health initiative of the opposite party,  when they were in power 2 years ago, was to repeal the Affordable Care  Act, which would have taken away healthcare from more than 20 million  Americans.   Yet, now the House, under Democratic leadership, is considering a  major priority on this side of the aisle, H.R. 3. A bill that,  according to the Congressional Budget Office, will save on drug costs  of $500 billion for the American people.   Now, there are many reasons why I support H.R. 3, and I am proud to  do so, but I want to highlight, especially, just one of them. This  legislation would generate $10 billion to fight the opioid crisis,  setting aside resources for the localities that have been impacted the  most. That includes many rural areas in our country, but it also  includes urban areas as well, especially in my district, in my hometown  of Philadelphia.   I am proud to stand here and support H.R. 3. This is one of the most  important things we can do for the American people: save prescription  drug costs.   Madam Chair, I urge its support.
