 Mr. President, we have a busy day in store for the  Senate as we aim to hold a number of important votes before the start  of Yom Kippur.   Today, we will vote to advance four Presidential nominations. First,  we will confirm James Kvaal to be Under Secretary of Education, and we  will also confirm both David Estudillo and Angel Kelley to serve as  district judges in Washington and Massachusetts, respectively.   This afternoon, we will also advance the nomination of Ms. Veronica  Rossman of Colorado, who has been nominated by President Biden to sit  on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ms. Rossman has spent  practically her entire legal career in public service as a Federal  defender, giving a voice in the courtroom to those who often cannot  afford legal representation.   She is also an immigrant, who fled Russia with her parents as a child  after her family endured anti-Semitic persecution in their home  country. She understands personally the damage faced by those who  endure discrimination.   If confirmed, Ms. Rossman would be the only Federal defender to sit  on the Tenth Circuit, and one of the few in the entire country. I am  proud to have nominated Eunice Lee to the Second Circuit Court of New  York. She, too, has been a Federal defender.   We also have plenty of prosecutors and corporate lawyers wearing  black robes.   Like so many other of President Biden's judicial nominees, Ms.  Rossman is going to bring a sorely needed perspective to our courts.  The more we work to make our courts reflective of the diversity of this  country, both demographic and professionally, the more we will  strengthen the public's trust in our judicial system.   Now, secondly, today, the Senate Democrats will also continue work to  turn President Biden's Build Back Better agenda into law. It bears  repeating: This is a historic effort. This is not just another simple  piece of legislation. We are laying a foundation for another century of  American prosperity. Just like the Great Society and the New Deal  before it, our legislation will bring transformational change to help  build ladders so that those can climb up into the middle class, while  making it easier for those already in the middle class to enjoy that  middle class life and stay there. Too many in the middle class worry  they are going to slip out with all the changes occurring in our  society. We strengthen their ability to stay.   And too many who are trying to climb those ladders find the ladders  steep and unavailable. We are providing those ladders so they can get  there, too. It is strong, bold, important legislation, and it is really  a privilege to be here in the Senate and consider something as strong  and bold as this.   Later today, our caucus will discuss the latest elements of the  reconciliation bill. Working with our colleagues in the House, we will  have met the target date of September 15 set in the  [[Page S6464]]  budget resolution for producing text to review.   I expect our committee chairs will provide an overview of all the  work that each of their committees have done over the last 4 weeks in  drafting legislative text, and the entire caucus will have the chance  to offer feedback so we can continue to move this process forward.   This will continue to be a collaborative process. Everyone-- everyone--is going to have input into this legislation. But, of course,  our unity is our strength, and if we are not unified with 50 votes, we  can't get anything done. So we all must come together.   Now, I am pleased to say, after working for weeks over the summer on  our reconciliation bill, we are making great progress toward bringing  the bill to the floor.   Now, while Democrats are fighting to strengthen the middle class, our  Republican colleagues, unfortunately, are resorting to the same, tired,  predictable objections they raise about practically any Democratic  proposal. Rather than explain why they oppose supporting families or  expanding healthcare or taking action on climate change, they spent the  last several months recycling old accusations about ``liberal wish  lists.'' And rather than engage our policies on the merits and have a  real debate, too often they raised unwarranted and incorrect points  about how these programs will impact inflation.   I remind my colleagues of a report released not long ago by the chief  economist at Moody's Analytics, Mr. Mark Zandi. When Mr. Zandi examined  the Democrats' two main legislative proposals, our infrastructure bill  and our Build Back Better legislation, he concluded these packages  would provide a massive boost to our economy. Specifically, he said our  program would ``lift the economy's longer-term growth potential'' and  would ``lift productivity and labor force growth''; that is, our  proposal will do exactly what we said it would do, according to this  impartial arbiter, Mark Zandi.   And as for the Republicans' overheated rhetoric on inflation, Mr.  Zandi dismisses such concerns as ``overdone'' and said our two  infrastructure bills are designed to ``ease''--his words--inflation  pressures.   Let me repeat that. According to Moody's top economist--hardly a  fervent liberal--the Democratic proposals would actually ease inflation  pressures, not raise them.   When you strengthen worker productivity, when you increase supply  chains, the push to inflation decreases--decreases. And he also said  that, in the long term, it would help grow our economy so that more  Americans can get to and stay in the middle class.   Compare that to the signature accomplishments that Senate Republicans  forced when they were in charge: a massive tax break for corporations  and the wealthy that did little to help everyday Americans.   That is the difference between a Democratic majority and a Republican  one. We are fighting to strengthen American workers and American  families. Republicans seem only worried about protecting those at the  very top.   And, in addition, to those with inflationary concerns, we are going  to pay for our proposal. The Trump tax cuts, which every Republican  voted for, created a $2 trillion deficit.   So let's be realistic here. Let's be honest here. The charges of  runaway inflation are just wrong, especially when you consider we are  paying for it, when Republicans were so willing to give tax cuts to the  rich without paying for them at all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another subject--one that the  Presiding Officer cares about a great deal, among the many other things  you care about a great deal--voting rights. All year long, Senate  Democrats have committed to passing legislation to protect the most  sacrosanct right in our democracy, the right to vote. On two occasions,  Senate Democrats voted unanimously to begin debate in the Senate on  this critical issue, and both times Republicans formed a wall of total  opposition against any progress on voting rights in the U.S. Senate.   But Republicans' refusal to work with us is no excuse for not getting  something done. So later today, my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, along  with Senators Kaine, King, Manchin, Merkley, Padilla, Tester, and  Warnock, will be introducing the Freedom to Vote Act, a compromise  voting rights bill that I intend to schedule a vote on in the very near  future.   To piece this bill together, I am proud to have convened and worked  with eight Members of my caucus--four progressives and four moderates-- in bringing this bill to fruition. The compromise proposal contains  many of the important provisions of previous voting rights bills  championed by Senate Democrats, particularly by my colleague Senator  Merkley. It will protect the right to vote and put a stop to partisan  gerrymandering and the scourge of dark money in our politics.  Critically, the legislation also incorporates important feedback from  election officials and includes new measures to promote greater voter  confidence in our elections while stopping partisan election  subversion. This is a good proposal, one that nobody in this Chamber  should oppose.   My colleague Senator Manchin is working with Republicans to secure  support for the bill, and we look forward to hearing what changes they  might make on legislation. I applaud Senator Manchin for his work here.  He has always said that he wants to try and bring Republicans on, and  now with the support of Democrats and this compromise bill that Senator  Manchin had great input into, he can go forward in that regard.   The fact of the matter is that this legislation is critical for  stopping some of the most egregious assaults against voting rights  happening at the State level. A few weeks ago, the Governor of Texas  signed one of the most sweeping voter suppression bills in the entire  country. It comes on the heels of other restrictions sprouting across  the country--from ending election day registration in Montana, limiting  after-hour drop boxes in Florida, and even making it a crime to give  food and water to voters at the polls in Georgia.   No one can look at these restrictions with a straight face and say  they have a legitimate purpose. They have only one goal. It is a  despicable goal. It is a nasty goal, making it harder for younger,  poorer, non-White, and typically Democratic voters to access the  ballot.   Republicans lost the election. Biden is President. I am majority  leader. Instead of doing what you are supposed to do in a democracy-- win over the people you didn't win before--they are trying to stop the  people who didn't vote for them from voting. That is autocratic, anti- democratic--small ``D''--and not what America is all about. It is a new  phase of what used to be called ``Jim Crow.''   The Freedom to Vote Act is a necessary step to put an end to these  assaults on the franchise. As majority leader, it is my intention to  hold a vote on this bill as soon as next week, as I mentioned.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, finally, on debt ceiling. In the  long history of our country--the long, long history--the United States  has never defaulted on its obligations to pay its debt. The full faith  and credit of the United States has been the bedrock of our country's  economic prosperity--a spotless record that both parties have, for  years, worked together to preserve.   No matter who was President, Democrat or Republican, in the past, the  other party always stepped up to the plate and said: We can't let the  country default.   Until most recently, when President Trump was in office, Democrats  stepped up on three separate occasions to work with Republicans to  suspend the debt ceiling and continue to ensure that the U.S. was able  to pay its bills, even when there was a Democratic majority in the  House. We did not resort to hostage-taking or proclaim that it was the  other side's responsibility. We simply knew that when it came to the  debt ceiling, it was important to put aside political differences and  act responsibly, no matter who sits in the Oval Office.   We know that failing to raise the debt ceiling would be--as the  Republican leader has said in the past when  [[Page S6465]]  Trump was President and he was arguing that Democrats should join him,  would be a disaster. Well, if anything, that is an understatement.   Just yesterday, one top forecaster said that ``a failure to raise the  debt limit will have serious negative consequences.'' So in the  immediate future, we need to raise the debt ceiling again. As in  previous instances, it must, must, be a bipartisan endeavor, and the  reason is simple: We have to get this done.   But much of the recent debt we need to pay for was incurred during  the Trump administration. In fact, President Trump added nearly $8  trillion to the national debt, $5\1/2\ trillion of which was since the  last time the debt limit was suspended until Trump's final day in  office.   So, in other words, $5\1/2\ trillion of this debt is totally under  Republican management, in a sense, because Trump was the President and  Leader McConnell was the majority leader. Democrats think that we got  that. That is when the debt was created, with Republican votes--lots of  Republican votes. Both sides, led by a Republican Senate, as I said,  incurred much of this debt. Senators from both parties overwhelmingly  voted in support of the many laws that contributed to this obligation.  So neither party can wash its hands of responsibility to pay the bills.   Leader McConnell keeps talking about the new spending the Democrats  have done. That is not this debt. This debt, $5\1/2\ trillion, was all  under Trump and when McConnell was the majority leader. Leader  McConnell was the majority leader.   Some Republicans recklessly, irresponsibly, so overwhelmingly  politically seem eager to push our economy to the brink of total  catastrophe by suggesting they will oppose any effort to raise the debt  ceiling. And rather than urging their colleagues to immediately drop  this reckless idea, the Republican leader--shame on him--seems to be  giving it his blessing, if not promoting it.   If the United States defaults on its debt, it will harm every single  American in this country, including potentially those who rely on  Social Security and the members of our military. The consequences will  reverberate around the world and will cause irreparable harm to the  global economy at a time when we are all working to lift ourselves out  of a once-in-a-century pandemic.   So any efforts to play nasty, political games with the full faith and  credit of the United States is reckless, irresponsible, and despicable.  It could pose permanent damage to the U.S. economy and is a complete  nonstarter.   In America, when it is time to pay the bills, we do it without  exception.   I yield the floor.
