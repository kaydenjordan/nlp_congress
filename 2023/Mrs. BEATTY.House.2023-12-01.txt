 Madam Speaker, I rise today in fierce opposition to this  resolution of disapproval.   For the record, I was a former small business owner for decades. Let  me also thank Ranking Member Waters for clearly clarifying the  language.   The CFPB rule seeks to increase transparency in small business  lending to increase competition, to lower borrowing costs for small  businesses, and to detect and deter lending discrimination and create  new lending opportunities, particularly for small businesses owned by  women, by people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and rural businessowners.   This rulemaking is long overdue, as we heard. By requiring lenders to  provide information about loan applications, including whether they  were approved or denied, as well as pricing data in applicant  demographics, the rule will enhance accountability, which we talked  about, and ensure financial institutions are meeting the needs of the  entire community.    Wouldn't we want to know if we had a loan that was denied?    Madam Speaker, I think it is very important. I can't  imagine any one of us applying for a loan and getting it denied that  would not call that lender and say, tell me why my loan was denied.  That is a part of this, Madam Speaker.   Lastly, this transparency will not only benefit small businesses but  also family farms, financial institutions, and the economy overall. I  strongly recommend that we support this and go back and re-read the  language.
