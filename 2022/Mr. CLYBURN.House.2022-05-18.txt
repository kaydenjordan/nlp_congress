 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.   It is heartbreaking to stand here today, just days after 10 innocent  lives were taken in a Buffalo, New York, grocery store by a gunman  espousing white supremacist views and hatred toward African Americans.   This devastating massacre took me back to June 17, 2015, when another  white supremacist gunned down nine parishioners at Charleston's  historic Emanuel AME Church.   In the intervening years, we have witnessed far too many other acts  of domestic terrorism: from a counterprotest in Charlottesville,  Virginia; to a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; to a Walmart in  El Paso, Texas; to a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin; and to an  Asian-owned nail salon in Atlanta, Georgia. All told, over 200 mass  shootings this year.   To be sure, all of these shootings have not been racially motivated  or motivated by hate, but all of them share one thing in common: They  have been committed in a country too tolerant of irresponsible  regulations of weapons of war and a proliferation of firearms of mass  destruction.   This legislation is long overdue. It would enable the Justice  Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI to  prevent, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism more  effectively.   I, and many others in this body, know what it is to experience acts  of racial hatred and witness events of domestic terrorism. We cannot  continue to turn a blind eye to white supremacist vigilantes.   It impacts all of us. While the gunman in Buffalo was aiming for  people who looked like me, others who did not look like me fell victim  to his evil act.   Shortly after my first meeting with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., back  in 1960, I met with one of my professors, Mrs. Rosa Harris, to share  the Saul to Paul transformation I was experiencing. Two days later,  Mrs. Harris handed me a copy of Dr. King's 1958 book, ``Stride Toward  Freedom.''    To share one passage from that book, I quote, ``True  peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of  justice.''   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will provide Federal agencies with  necessary tools to ensure that peace and justice prevail. I urge a  ``yes'' vote from all Members of this august body.                                time  1830
