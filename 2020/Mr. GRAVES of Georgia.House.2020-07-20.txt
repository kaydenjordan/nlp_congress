 Madam Speaker, I first met John Lewis just a  few feet from where we are right now in the well of the House. I was a  special elect Member-to-be, and it was John who welcomed me down in the  well.   I will never forget that day. It was his thunderous voice that filled  the Chamber as he welcomed me and introduced me to each of you. He  honored me that day. Afterward, he embraced me, and then he stood by me  as I put my hand up and took the oath of office.                                time  1230    It is truly a privilege now for me to be able to stand before you and  to honor him not far from where he honored me as we remember the life  and the legacy of one who is known as a gentle, gentle giant; a man  whose courage and strength in the face of injustice and violence will  forever be remembered; a man whose kindness and humility was apparent  to anyone who had the opportunity to meet him.   Our Nation has indeed lost a giant, and it is times like these that  we must be reminded of the shoulders that we stand on, the shoulders of  giants like John.   I am better off because of   John Lewis. We are all better because of    John Lewis. Our Nation is so much better because of John Lewis.   So, in the days to come, we should all strive to be a little bit more  like John: humble, grateful, and thankful for the opportunity to leave  this Nation in better shape for the next generation.   May God bless   John Lewis and bring peace to his family in the days  to come.
