 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow the regulatory  overreach that has been happening to the agriculture community through  misuse of the Clean Water Act.   The recapture provision of the Clean Water Act was never meant to  swallow the original intent of the agricultural exemptions, the clear  ag exemptions in the law. But that is exactly what has started  happening, and if this amendment passes, it will only get worse.   The agriculture industry is already one of the most overregulated in  the country, and there is little clarity for farmers and ranchers about  what exactly those regulations are and how they apply to their  operations.   This amendment provides additional uncertainty. It was never the  intention of the Clean Water Act to punish farmers for conducting  normal farming operations such as plowing or doing stock pond  maintenance, yet that is what is happening. Without the ability to  freely conduct these normal activities, farmers and ranchers are unable  to do their jobs and grow the food we need as a nation.   There is a difference between filling a river, a wetland, and plowing  the corner of your own field. These exemptions were constructed to  address that difference.   The ongoing expansion of enforcement under the Clean Water Act has  chipped away at the rights of landowners and has made it a danger to  farmers to effectively utilize their own property.   This hasn't been happening for 40 years. It was never the original  intent. This is a fairly recent expansion of the interpretation of the  law. Indeed, it is ridiculous that a farmer has to worry about being  slapped with a fine, in some cases millions of dollars. This has  occurred for simply conducting normal farming activities on their land  where there are clear exemptions for agriculture.   In my own district in northern California, there have already been  lawsuits against residents for farming without Federal permission.  Cases like these across the country cost farmers millions of dollars in  legal damages, and they risk running farmers out of business.   If this amendment is not defeated, these damages to the farm  community will only grow. It is not a situation we want to put upon an  industry that is already, in many cases, in financial crisis.   Farmers and ranchers deserve our support, and they deserve the  ability to make decisions about managing their land, whether it is  going to be in a crop this year or not, and not have the Federal  Government decide if it has been idle for a few years now that that is  an abandonment of their land. Market conditions and a lot of different  things affect what a farmer's decision is going to be; but, indeed, it  is their land without having more ambiguity and aggressive enforcements  over things that really clearly are exempt in the Clean Water Act. So  we don't need additional red tape, and we don't need these threats.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would invite my friend, Mr. Beyer, to  come talk to the ranchers and farmers who are being hit with these new  interpretations and aggressive interpretations coming out of the  divisions of northern California to see what is happening to them for  simply applying farming techniques to their land.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4928]]         Mr. Chairman, again, it has been a much more aggressive  interpretation of the exemptions under the Clean Water Act that were  clearly made by Congress to allow normal farming activities, the normal  crop rotation that you would use.   Indeed, if these activities were applied even more aggressively,  normal year-to-year crops could find themselves unable to be planted  because of plowing or disking or land planing, things that are  considered normal in the millions of acres we have in northern  California that are under agriculture.   So the activities of the EPA and the Army Corps go above the law to  impose these requirements, and they certainly expand the jurisdiction  of the Clean Water Act well beyond what Congress had ever intended 40- plus years ago.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.'' I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment today aims to protect private  property rights of farmers and ranchers by upholding the longstanding  policy of ``once a PCC, always a PCC,'' otherwise known as a prior  converted cropland.   There are over 53 million acres of prior converted cropland  throughout the country, and for more than 30 years, both Congress and  the administration have clearly stipulated these lands were not waters  of the United States. These are lands that have been previously  cleared, drained, or otherwise altered and operated for decades of  farming activity. They do not have the same geographical values as a  wetland and should not be regulated as such.   This view was further reinforced by the Clinton administration in its  1993 wetlands plan, specifically exempting prior converted cropland  from this regulation. This should apply regardless of any change in  use, including agriculture back to non-agriculture use.   However, in recent years, the EPA and Army Corps have used a creative  interpretation of their abandonment criteria to regulate prior  converted cropland, massively devaluing farmland that had been  previously converted from wetlands for the purpose of agriculture  decades before.   We have already seen this in a number of cases, where the EPA  presumes cropland is under their jurisdiction unless the property owner  proves otherwise, either through lengthy and expensive soil testing or  by taking land out of production and fallowing it for years.   If this rule continues, there is no obstacle to prevent agencies from  applying this more broadly, including to any project in the U.S. being  planned on prior converted croplands actively used for agriculture  production.   Furthermore, this regulation has set a terrible precedent by being  authored in the Federal Register, where there is no public comment or  review period.   My amendment seeks to unify the policy of the United States  Department of Agriculture on prior converted cropland with the EPA,  and, indeed, once it is a prior cropland, it is always a prior  cropland, regardless of its use.   By unifying these policies, this amendment will ensure that all prior  converted croplands that are exempt will remain protected from  overregulation and reinterpretation of the Army Corps and EPA.   My amendment will not force wetlands back into agricultural lands. It  will not prevent any current wetlands from being regulated as wetlands.  This simply says that the land we have already converted away from  wetlands will stay that way, not be unfairly regulated under the intent  of Congress when this legislation was originally passed.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply reiterates that the  long-held policy that prior converted--and these are key words, ``prior  converted croplands''--all these prior converted croplands were done  over 30 years ago before laws were changed to prevent such activity of  converting wetlands. Every intent of Congress, and even the Clinton  administration, worked to clarify that you cannot use the Clean Water  Act.   Indeed, you talk about 40 years' worth of policy. It has only been in  recent years that a more aggressive reinterpretation of policy by Army  Corps and EPA has started coming after people requiring 404 permits if  they choose to do something different with their own private land after  5 years.   This is affecting people in my own district, and they are losing  million-dollar lawsuits because of this reinterpretation, not one set  up by Congress when the original legislation was passed.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not prevent any  current regulations on current wetlands. Again, it goes after the  aggressive rulemaking that EPA, with their cohorts in the Army Corps,  have put upon landowners and farmers and ranchers in more recent years.   So, if we sit back and watch bureaucrats attempt to gain control over  every ditch, puddle, and pond they can  [[Page H4968]]  get their hands on, then we are in a bad way in agriculture and, as  well, the sacred private property rights our country is founded on. It  is a major threat to the livelihood of ag and rural America.   So, again, the intent here is not to roll back any current wetlands  but simply to allow people, if they want to make crop changes, they  want to make decisions on their land that they are paying the property  tax on, they are paying the mortgage on, if they want to change their  use of the land, they should have that right in the United States of  America and not have to get permission for something that has been--the  key words here--prior converted under the law.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for ``aye'' votes of this body, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
