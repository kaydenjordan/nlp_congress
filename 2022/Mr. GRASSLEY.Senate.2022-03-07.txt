 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Saturday, deadly tornadoes swept  through Iowa, destroying homes, parks, and leaving over 10,000 people  without power.   The communities most affected are Winterset, IA, and Chariton, IA,  but other communities as well. Tragically, seven people--five adults  and two children--died, and many people have been affected because of  this severe weather. This is the deadliest tornado in our State in 15  years. The one 15 years ago came close to my hometown of New Hartford,  IA, and the adjoining community of Parkersburg, IA, and 13 people lost  their lives that time.   So, with today's incident, as families, businesses, and communities  continue to assess the damage and clean up from these storms, I want  Iowans to know that I have talked to the Department of Homeland  Security's Secretary Mayorkas about these tornadoes. He has been  assuring that wherever the Federal Government has authority to help,  they will step in and do that. I have also reached out to FEMA, the  State of Iowa, and affected communities. I will do everything I can at  the Federal level to assist.   Unfortunately, Iowa is no stranger to tornadoes and natural  disasters. Once again, I am encouraged by the stories I hear from  neighbors of strangers helping each other and their communities. Of  course, we all know that that is the Iowa way: neighbor helping  neighbor. These storms take time to recover, and I know that we will  continue to reach out and help our fellow Iowans in need.   My thoughts and the thoughts of all Iowans and their prayers go out  to those who lost loved ones and to those whose properties were  affected by these tornadoes. I also pray for those who were hurt and  for some who were hospitalized in that they will have speedy  recoveries.   Iowans are strong and resilient people. We will recover, and we will  rebuild. As Iowa's Senator, I will be there to help in any way needed.                                 Free Speech    Now, Mr. President, another matter that I have spoken of on the floor  of the U.S. Senate recently and, to some extent, a few times last year  is the issue of freedom of speech in our colleges. In recent years, I  have tried to highlight some of the most ridiculous impositions on  freedom of speech in college, but so many of these cases get swept  under the rug.   It can be hard to get an idea of whether typical students feel free  to speak their minds in the university environment. So last spring, the  Iowa legislature passed a bill strengthening free speech across our  State's education system. In part, this bill was meant to find out how  big a problem the restraint of free expression is at our State's public  universities. Last month, that led to the results of a survey of 17,000  students in Iowa's public universities. The results raised serious  concerns.   Now, get this: Fewer than half of the employees thought that their  universities allowed them to say what they believed. A third of the  students thought that their institutions ``hinder[ed] free speech.'' A  quarter of the students didn't even think that their campuses provided  an ``environment for [the] free and open expression of ideas.''   A university that can't meet that basic bar is missing the whole  purpose of a college or university. You have heard me say my definition  of a ``university'' is one wherein controversy ought to run rampant.  Thankfully, the bill that passed the Iowa legislature takes action to  solve the issue that I just described.   This semester, students across the State have begun taking a course  to instill in them the value of free speech. The goal is to ensure that  students and faculty understand the value of the First Amendment:  freedom of speech. The course emphasizes respect for another's speech  and its impact both in and out of the classroom.   I am hopeful that this will start to steer us in the right direction  in not only my State of Iowa; I hope it has some impact across the  country, because letting students speak their minds is central to the  idea of a liberal arts education. Yet the default has increasingly  become to censor at the drop of a hat, only allowing free speech if  administrators find blowback.   Just look to a case last month here in Washington, DC, at George  Washington University. A student put up posters criticizing having the  Olympics in China, given the repressive regime there. We know about  that repressive regime because we talk about it quite often as the  Chinese Communists deny freedom of religion and other freedoms to the  Uighur minority. These posters at George Washington University were  well done and well within the mainstream discussion. They speak to the  concerns that I have myself about what goes on in China.   The university immediately responded by tearing them down and saying  the posters were racist. They only reversed themselves when it came out  that the artist himself--I had better say himself or herself--was  Chinese and that the concerns were far from unique. I find it hard to  believe the university's namesake would approve of this approach.  [[Page S1009]]    Examples like this are why we need Iowa's new free speech course.  Hopefully, this example set in my State by our own State legislators is  followed elsewhere. Students and administrators alike have forgotten  why the First Amendment matters. I am glad to see States like Iowa are  starting to remind everybody.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
