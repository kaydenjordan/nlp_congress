 Madam President, on Saturday evening, a great loss  echoed throughout our country. Six decades of patriotic service came to  an end.   We have suspected for some time that we would bid farewell to our  colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, John McCain. John took full  advantage of the months since his diagnosis. His hard work continued,  but happy reminiscing, fond farewells, final reflections, and time with  family actually came to the fore. I was privileged to spend a small  share of that time with John. We sat on his back porch in Sedona under  the desert sky, replaying old times. John did things his way these last  months.   For his colleagues here, the time confirmed a sad but obvious truth:  The Senate won't be the same without John McCain. I think it is fair to  say that the passion John brought to his work was unsurpassed in this  body. In more than 30 years as a Senator, he never failed to marshal a  razor-sharp wit, a big heart, and, of course, a fiery spirit.   When John saw an issue the same way you did, you knew you had just  found your most stalwart ally. You would thank your lucky stars because  when you found yourself on the other side of that table, as I think all  of us learned, you were in for a different kind of unforgettable  experience. Either way, serving alongside John was never a dull affair.  I found myself on both sides of that table over the years. John and I  stood shoulder to shoulder on some of the most important issues to each  of us, and we also disagreed entirely on huge subjects that helped  define each of our careers.   John treated every day, every issue, with the intensity and  seriousness that the legislative process deserves. He would fight like  mad to bring the country closer to his vision of the common good. But  when the day's disputes were over, that very same man was one of our  most powerful reminders that so much more unites us than divides us;  [[Page S5942]]  that we should be able to differ completely on policy and stay united  in love of our country. John himself once put it:         We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing       over the means to better secure our freedom, and support the       general welfare. But it should remain an argument among       friends who share an unshaken belief in our great cause, and       in the goodness of each other.    John and I sure had those fights, and we sure had that friendship. I  am just glad we never found ourselves in opposite dugouts. You see,  John and I spent years as neighbors in the Russell Building. Often,  when softball season rolled around, our offices would take the field  together as one united McTeam, we called it.   As a seriously wounded war hero and a childhood polio survivor, I  would have to say John and I didn't exactly have the makings of an  elite double-play duo. I took the mound once or twice, but I admit, we  mostly offered moral support. Moral support. Really, that is what John  McCain gave this body and this country for so long. His memory will  continue to give it because while John proudly served with us as the  Senator from Arizona, he was America's hero all along.   Just this month, Congress finalized a major bill for our All- Volunteer Armed Forces that we named after John. This might seem like a  small detail, but, really, it was a fitting capstone for a career so  thoroughly defined by service in and then service for the ranks of  those who wear our Nation's uniform.   Generations of McCains have served with distinction in our great  Navy. As John described his Scottish heritage in one memoir, ``The  McCains [were] bred to fight.'' And fight they have. One by one,  McCains have entered the academy's gates in Annapolis. One by one, they  marched past a centuries-old battle flag bearing the phrase ``Don't  Give Up the Ship.''   While honorable service was in his DNA, John's story was never  simple. At Annapolis, as he would come to explain with some relish, his  major distinctives were mostly the weakness of his grades and the  length of his disciplinary record. The first miracle in John's military  career was the fact that he somehow made it through school. But he  prevailed, and bigger tests soon came. He stared death in the face  aboard the USS Forrestal and again when he was shot down and dragged,  battered and broken, into the hands of our Nation's enemies. Five and a  half hellish years in captivity. Merciless beatings for the uniform he  had worn and the values he would not renounce. That stubborn,  rebellious streak went from a stumbling block to a saving grace.  Stubborn virtue sustained John. He declined early release in solidarity  with his brothers. He never gave up the ship.   We all know this story. But while John didn't shy from sharing his  experiences, he insisted he was no hero and no saint. He measured his  life in simpler terms. When asked after this diagnosis last year how he  would like to be remembered, here is what he said: ``He served his  country, and not always right--made a lot of mistakes, made a lot of  errors--but served his country, and I hope we can add, honorably.'' He  will certainly get that wish.   For many, the service and sacrifice that John rendered overseas would  have been more than enough--more than a lifetime already--but somehow  John McCain was convinced that he still owed his country more. In 1983,  he arrived in Congress. John knew exactly what it meant to swear to  ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' When he  was sworn in here in the Senate 4 years later, he was no stranger to  pledging to protect the Constitution from ``enemies, foreign and  domestic.''   The following years brought legislative accomplishments, to be sure.  While John's constituents were lucky to have him as their Senator from  Arizona, John also remembered that our titles say ``United States  Senator.'' He worked across the aisle on the Select Committee on POW/ MIA Affairs, whose work helped heal the wounds of war and normalize  relations with Vietnam. He led congressional delegations and overseas  travel that were famously as grueling as they were educational. John  was seemingly immune to jet lag, and he was never more excited than  when he had an opportunity to share American values abroad.   And, of course, he was singularly devoted to the men and women of our  Armed Forces. From countless visits with deployed units in Iraq and  Afghanistan to his committee meetings right here in this body, John  honored their sacrifices in a way that only he could. He never forgot  that notwithstanding the grandeur of our military might and  technological prowess, our armed services are made up of people--of our  constituents, of volunteers, of the brave.   John's favorite novel was Ernest Hemingway's ``For Whom the Bell  Tolls.'' I suspect we will hear it quoted quite a bit in the days  ahead. The lead character is an American ex-pat named Robert Jordan who  risks everything in the Spanish Civil War. He is a little bit brash,  maybe a little hotheaded. In fact, he is a dynamite specialist whose  specialty literally is blowing things up, and he goes down fighting,  right down to the book's final pages. I am sure some of us can imagine  why John might identify with this guy.   I recently rediscovered something John wrote a few years ago about  this book. He noted that his favorite literary hero wasn't some  contrived caricature of a hero from central casting. The book is full  of complexities. The character has to face all of the messiness of life  and war. His idealism is challenged. But he realizes that the  imperfections of this world don't mean the concept of sacrifice is  outdated. They don't make love of cause or country into something  quaint or naive. They only make patriotism, service, and hope that much  more noble and necessary.   It takes one kind of heroism to undergo unimaginable pain and  suffering as a POW but then persist in loyalty. It takes another kind  of heroism to sustain that passion for decades more, to withstand the  slings and arrows of politics, the compromises, the disappointments,  the defeats, and yet still consider it a joy and an honor to serve. Few  have either kind of heroism. John McCain had both.   Fortunately, all that intensity came paired with a world-class sense  of humor. As we all know, John really hated to lose. The line he used  after his Presidential campaigns still makes me laugh. Some would ask  how he was coping with defeat. John would say:         Actually, I'm sleeping like a baby. You know--I sleep for       two hours, wake up, and cry.    Seriously, it is hard to describe this larger-than-life figure  without lapsing into what sound like cliches.   We have all heard our whole lives about the importance of patriotism  and self-sacrifice, but we cannot take that culture of commitment for  granted because just like our Nation's security and our American  liberty, the very notion that some causes really are greater than  ourselves only survives because servicemembers and statesmen like John  McCain will fight and even die to defend it.    The bond between John and his country was so deep, but, of course,  other bonds ran deeper still. While John's colleagues grieve our own  loss, we also send our love and support to those who know him even  better--those who call this man their husband, their son, their father,  and their grandfather. We stand with John's loving wife Cindy. We stand  with Doug, Andy, Sidney, Meghan, Jack, Jimmy, and Bridget. We stand  with his mother Roberta and with all of John's devoted friends and  loyal staff. Thank you for lending him to us longer than we had a  right. Thank you for supporting him while he supported us.   John McCain has fought his last battles and cast his final votes, but  the Nation he loved is still not done with him yet. This week will be  dedicated to remembering him. On Friday, he will lie in state in the  Capitol like other American heroes before him. As the days turn to  weeks, I know we are all eager to come together and collaborate on ways  we can continue to honor his memory.   Generation after generation of Americans will hear about the cocky  pilot who barely scraped through Annapolis but then defended our Nation  in the skies, witness to our highest values even through terrible  torture, captured the country's imagination through the national  campaigns that spotlighted many of our highest values, and became so  integral to the U.S. Senate,  [[Page S5943]]  where our Nation airs and advances its great debates.   America will miss her devoted son, her stalwart champion, her elder  statesman. We will miss one of the very finest gentlemen with whom I  have had the honor to serve, but we will not forget him. I consider it  our privilege to return some small share of the love John poured out  for this country.   It is our honor as Americans to say to the late, great John Sidney  McCain III what we pray he has already heard from his Creator: ``Well  done, good and faithful servant.'' Well done. You fought the good  fight. You finished the race. You kept the faith. You never gave up the  ship.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
