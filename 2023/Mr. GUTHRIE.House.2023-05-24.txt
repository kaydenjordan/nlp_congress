 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  legislation and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 467.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, action is needed now to address the fentanyl crisis.  That is why I rise today in strong support of H.R. 467, the HALT  Fentanyl Act.   Fentanyl is the top cause of death for Americans 18 to 49 years old.  In my home State of Kentucky, illicit fentanyl overdoses represented 70  percent of all overdoses in 2020 and 2021.   The fentanyl crisis is one of the foremost problems that the American  public faces and has been made worse by the crisis at our southern  border. Illicit fentanyl is turning virtually every community into a  border community with these poisons flooding streets across America and  taking innocent lives, including the lives of our kids.   The HALT Fentanyl Act would ban all fentanyl analogues and strip the  drug cartels and other criminals of the incentive to create new  versions of fentanyl to skirt around the law. This bill is a key step  to help get these poisons off our streets and give law enforcement the  tools they need to crack down on illicit fentanyl trafficking.   A two-pronged approach to addressing this crisis is needed. We must  have a law enforcement and a substance use recovery strategy to address  this crisis. That is why I look forward to examining the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act later this year to continue providing  access to treatment and recovery support services that so many  individuals rely on throughout the country.   To those who oppose this legislation on the grounds it could lead to  mass incarceration, the emergency classwide scheduling implemented by  President Trump did not lead to mass incarcerations. In a Government  Accountability Office study from 2021, the GAO found that there were  only eight prosecutions--yes, eight prosecutions--during the period in  which the Trump administration temporarily scheduled fentanyl-related  substances as schedule I drugs from 2018-2020, with four of them being  individuals working on behalf of the cartel because the cartels quit  creating illicit fentanyl separate from the fentanyl that is poisoning  our kids today.    It could be even worse. I know there are also those who believe the  emergency scheduling order didn't lead to reductions in overdose deaths  and that this bill before us won't effectively address the issues we  are facing.   To both of those criticisms, this bill stops these analogues from  being produced in the first place. Right after the classwide ban was  put in place, the number of fentanyl analogue encounters dropped nearly  89 percent, more than 6,200 fewer reports of analogues. DEA officials  stated that the classwide scheduling contributed to this dramatic drop.   It also includes provisions to facilitate more research into the  detection of fentanyl-related substances and potential treatment of  fentanyl poisonings, something that has much more red tape in the  status quo.   I am happy to see the White House supports two main provisions of the  HALT Fentanyl Act. The HALT Fentanyl Act is one step of many this body  needs to take to address the end of the overdose crisis. The time to  permanently act is now, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 467.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this was a bipartisan bill. It got  bipartisan votes in committee. It is the DEA's number one priority.   If you are selling fentanyl to our kids, you deserve to be  incarcerated. We don't apologize for that.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  State (Mrs. Rodgers), the chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), the bill's sponsor.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), the vice chair of the Health Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California, Mr.  Mike Garcia.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from New Jersey did say that this law expires at the end of  the year. That is why we are here today to make scheduling illicit  fentanyl permanent.   We have to understand what the status quo is. The status quo  currently is horrific. Before these illicit fentanyls were scheduled,  although we couldn't get them permanently scheduled, there were all  kinds of analogues throughout America. That is why the DEA and  others recommended that we schedule these, because once you change the  fentanyl molecule, unless these are scheduled, then it becomes no  longer illegal. These all appeared in our country, and that is why we  are reacting to it. They are scheduled now, and what we are moving to  do is to make it permanent.    What has happened since they were scheduled?   They came to me, and they talked about mass incarceration. We have  heard that today. There have been eight people in prison under this  law, four dealing with cartels, which I would say absolutely should be  in prison.   I asked some of my law enforcement people when I was looking into  this bill: If you have only arrested eight people, why does it matter?   That is what they are saying on the other side of the aisle.   What they said was the only reason we have only arrested eight people  is because when this was put into place, the analogues--not fentanyl,  but the analogues, which can be more dangerous--had disappeared from  the marketplace. They are bringing in fentanyl that is already  scheduled.   The problem is, if we treat fentanyl analogues differently than  fentanyl, they are going to reappear again. That is why we have to put  them in the same category. If you have fentanyl subject to mandatory  minimums, but not these analogues, then they are going to reappear.   We have to pass this bill, we have to move forward, and I recommend  support of this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Griffith) having assumed the chair, Mr. D'Esposito, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 467) to  amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the scheduling of  fentanyl-related substances, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
