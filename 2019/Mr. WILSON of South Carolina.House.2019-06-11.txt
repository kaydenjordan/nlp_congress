 Mr. Speaker, last week was the 102nd  anniversary and Victory Week at Fort Jackson in South Carolina.   Under the leadership of Brigadier General Milford Beagle, Jr., and  Command Sergeant Major Jeremiah Gan, Fort Jackson is the bedrock for  building readiness for all components of the Army.   This week, the Greater Columbia Region is being honored as a Great  American Defense Communities Award recipient. The Columbia Chamber of  Commerce, led by President Carl Blackstone and Chairman David Lockwood,  provided the nomination, citing Fort Jackson, the South Carolina  National Guard, and McEntire Joint Air Base.   Fort Jackson is the Nation's largest basic training base, conducting  over half of the Army's basic combat training, with over 60,000  soldiers per year and with about 10,000 soldiers in basic combat  training at any given time. Fort Jackson also trains more than 60  percent of all women entering the Army each year.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
