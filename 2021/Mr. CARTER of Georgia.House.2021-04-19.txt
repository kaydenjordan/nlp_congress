 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lorrie Ford Merker for all the work she has done to improve the lives  of Georgia's blueberry farmers.   Lorrie has made outstanding contributions to the blueberry industry  for three decades. Born and raised in southeastern Michigan, Lorrie  graduated from Michigan State University and has spent her entire adult  life improving the agriculture sector.   For the past 32 years Lorrie has worked with the Michigan Blueberry  Growers Association which represents 250 growers in eight States and  British Columbia. She has also been involved in advocacy at the State  and national levels to promote an understanding of the labor and  environmental challenges facing farmers.   Throughout her career she has accumulated a long list of awards and  accomplishments, including the North American Blueberry Council's Alex  Wetherbee Award, for her outstanding contributions to the promotion and  marketing of blueberries.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Lorrie for all the work she has done  for Georgia's blueberry growers and for growers across the country.                            ____________________
