 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  Mr. Ellison and our ranking member, Congresswoman Waters, for their  great leadership on behalf of American consumers, American investors,  and American taxpayers.   I rise in opposition to the amendment and to the bill.   Mr. Chair, today House Republicans are pushing a dangerous Wall  Street first bill that would drag us right back to the days of the  Great Recession. Eight years ago, unchecked recklessness on Wall Street  ignited a financial meltdown that devastated families in every State in  the Union: hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs every month,  and the unemployment rate soared to 10 percent; more than 11 million  Americans lost their homes through foreclosure; $13 trillion in wealth,  including families' hard-earned retirement savings and college savings,  was destroyed.   On the night of Thursday, September 18, 2008, the Treasury Secretary  came to the Capitol for an emergency meeting with congressional  leaders, Democrats and Republicans from the House and the Senate, to  inform us of the financial meltdown. Secretary Paulson described the  financial meltdown, which was horrific. When I asked the Chairman of  the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, what he thought of what he was  telling us, Chairman Bernanke told us that, if we did not act  immediately, we would not have an economy by Monday.   We would not have an economy by Monday.   Tens of millions of middle class families across America still bear  the scars. You saw on the right the rise of the Tea Party, on the left,  Occupy Wall Street.   The Democratic Congress vowed that Main Street taxpayers must never  again pay the price for the recklessness of some on Wall Street. I  don't paint everybody there with the same brush, but many on Wall  Street, the predatory lenders and profiteers, had abused American  families for far too long.   With Dodd-Frank, Democrats enacted the strongest Wall Street consumer  financial protections in history, critical reforms to protect  hardworking Americans and to insist on accountability from Wall Street.  [[Page H4796]]                                     time  1530    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that the law created has  returned nearly $12 billion worth of compensation to 29 million wronged  Americans--many of them seniors, many of them servicemembers.   But with this bill, the Republicans will undo these safeguards,  eviscerate the Consumer Bureau, and take our country back to the days  of massive taxpayer bailouts. We cannot let that happen.   Our Republican colleagues have named this dreadful and dangerous  legislation, this Wall Street-first legislation, the Financial CHOICE  Act. The Financial CHOICE Act to prey on investors, to prey on  consumers, to prey on taxpayers. That is the choice they want to give  the financial institutions.   But let's look at the appalling choices it represents. Instead of  protecting consumers, Republicans choose to help those who try to cheat  consumers. Instead of protecting seniors, Republicans choose to help  those who prey on retirement savings. Instead of protecting men and  women in uniform, Republicans choose to help those who take advantage  of our servicemembers' families while our heroes are defending our  freedom on the battlefield. Instead of advancing an economy that works  for everyone, Republicans choose to help the special interests get  richer and to stick working people with a bill for a bailout when it  goes wrong.   They have always been handmaidens of the special interests. We know  that. But even for them, when we think we have seen it all, this really  takes them to a new low.   So they call it the Financial CHOICE Act, but these are not the  choices that the American people want. They are choices of the  Republican Party that puts Wall Street first, that are handmaidens of  special interests.   So while Director Comey testified in the Senate earlier today, on  this side of the Capitol, House Republicans are feeding working  families to the wolves on Wall Street.   As I said, I don't paint all on Wall Street with the same brush. The  pervasive incentives baked into the Republican bill will enable the  predatory to punish the honest.   Now, here we go. Think of it. We have a Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, 29 million Americans benefitting from $12 billion in  compensation. Oh, they don't like that. They want to do away with that.   The Volcker Rule, which would prevent the financial institutions from  taking risk at taxpayers' expense, the classic Republican: privatize  the gain, nationalize the risk. If we win, the private sector and these  banks benefit. If we lose, the taxpayer pays the tab.   Something that had nothing to do with the Dodd-Frank bill, the  fiduciary rule, which only simply said that financial advisers should  have the interest of the investor they are advising at heart. This bill  says no. We are doing away with the very compromised, I might say,  fiduciary rule to protect investors.   So as I say, I don't paint all of Wall Street with the same brush.  The American people want to know who stands with them. I know you want  me not to talk about this because it is the truth about what you are  doing to the American people, but as the minority leader, I have the  right to speak on the floor. You had plenty of time to spread your  malicious legislation to hurt the American people. I am using my time  to speak the truth to them about what this bill does to their financial  stability.   The American people want to know who stands with them and who stands  with the special interests. My Republican colleagues, in the name of  hardworking American families, I use my time on behalf of America's  hardworking families, not on behalf of special interests.   I urge my colleagues to make the choice to reject this dastardly Wall  Street-first bill and to vote in support of our men and women in  uniform, our seniors who have built our country, in support of those  hardworking Americans who are saving for their children's education,  hoping to achieve the American Dream of homeownership, and do not want  to be preyed upon by Republicans in Congress.
