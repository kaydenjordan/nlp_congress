 Madam Speaker, I rise today because our border is still  in crisis. I rise today to bring attention to the dereliction of duty  by this President occurring at our southern border. Most of all I rise  to ask this: Can we all stop pretending?   Can we stop pretending that this administration deserves any benefit  of the doubt, pretending it is a tough situation beyond their control,  pretending that this administration, and frankly, the entire Democratic  Party have any intention of solving the border crisis. Stop pretending  as if this isn't purposeful, because it is.   When every single policy measure that you partake in results in more  illegal immigration, well, then it stands to reason using the powers of  deduction that maybe you want more illegal immigration. So let's stop  pretending otherwise.   And while we are at it, let's also stop pretending that more than a  tiny fraction of those illegally crossing our border have any valid  claims to asylum whatsoever. We all know it. We all know that they are  coming because it is easy and because America is a pretty great place.  We all know they were trained by their drug cartel handlers to repeat  certain phrases that make them eligible for the asylum process so that  they will be given a bus ticket and maybe a court date which they will  never show up for.   Let's stop pretending that this isn't just a giant scam, a giant  abuse of our well-meaning and generous system.   And also, let's stop pretending mass migration is America's fault.  Let's stop pretending to listen to outlandish claims of climate change  causing migration or the tired old refrain of, well, it is American  imperialistic foreign policy or whatever, and so let's just let  everybody in.   And let's stop pretending that this isn't getting exceedingly  dangerous for us. It is dangerous for our border agents. It is  dangerous for our border communities. It is dangerous for the children  being trafficked. It is dangerous for everyday Americans.   At our border communities, crime is rising. There is greater  insecurity. There is a spike in COVID cases. And the migrants, who I  thought my friends on the other side of the aisle claim to care about,  well, they are paying thousands of dollars to smugglers to take them on  an exceedingly dangerous journey that often ends in children dead,  stranded in the desert, or in the Rio Grande.                                time  1115    The only people who benefit from all of this are the drug cartels.  They make money off the human misery by using asylum-seeking migrants  to tie down the border agents so they can move their drugs with little  to no risk. These smugglers aren't just bringing your generic pot. They  are bringing fentanyl, bringing enough fentanyl to kill every single  American.   Finally, let's stop pretending that the Democrats' pro-open border  position has anything to do with compassion or kindness. There is  nothing compassionate about tent cities, nothing compassionate about  children being trafficked. There is nothing compassionate about firing  American workers for not getting a COVID shot, putting them out on the  street while illegal immigrants flood into our country without even a  COVID test and then get treated to a bus ride or a hotel at the expense  of the American taxpayer. And then, they probably get hired.   And guess what? There is nothing compassionate about allowing  hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to cut in front of millions  of  [[Page H4876]]  law-abiding potential immigrants around the world. People with actual  asylum claims and real persecution are told, well, they are out of luck  if they can't just walk across our border. Sorry about your civil war  or your religious persecution. We are out of space. The system is just  too clogged up now.   Let's stop pretending about all of it. Let's start telling the truth  so we can actually solve this crisis.
