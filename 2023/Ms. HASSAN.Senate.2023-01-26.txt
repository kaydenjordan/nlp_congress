 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Harold  ``Harry'' Armstrong of Canaan and John Bayliss of Hanover as December's  Granite Staters of the Month. For decades, Harry has led a successful  effort to collect used medical equipment and deliver it to those in  need in the Upper Valley area and beyond.   Harry helped start the Health Closet, with members of the Canaan  Lions Club, more than 40 years ago. The group collected used medical  equipment, such as manual and electric wheelchairs, walkers, lift  chairs, crutches, canes, and bath stools from the area's visiting  nurses, nonprofits, hospitals, and individuals. They would then keep  the equipment in storage until they found someone who needed it.   When Harry was hospitalized 2 years ago and had to have his foot  amputated, he worried that Health Closet's mission would cease to be  fulfilled. That is when Harry's friend and Lebanon Upper Valley Lions  Club member John Bayliss stepped up to help run the initiative.   Through their work, the duo profoundly touches people's lives by  giving them the medical equipment that they desperately need to go  about their lives and continue to be a part of their community. From  doing DIY fix-ups of medical equipment in Harry's and John's garages,  to lugging large medical machinery in their pickup trucks, their  dedication to helping others, willingness to take the initiative, and  generosity is a shining example of the Granite State spirit.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Kaylee  Richard of Manchester and Samantha Grenier of Goffstown as January's  Granite Staters of the Month. This high school student duo organized a  career fair targeted toward young women in the Manchester School  District in order to empower the next generation of women leaders.   Kaylee and Samantha became friends at age 8 at a summer camp operated  by Girls at Work, an organization that hosts programs to build  confidence and strength in girls. In high school, they stayed involved  with the organization as mentors, and so when they were faced with a  challenge, they were prepared to take it on.   When Kaylee and Sam attended a career fair in 2022, they noticed that  it was geared heavily towards men and that they and other young women  were struggling in the environment. In response, the pair approached  their Girls at Work mentor, Elaine Hamel, to help them organize their  own career fair targeted toward young women.   In coordination with Girls at Work, the Manchester School District,  and the Gear Up program, they organized a job fair with 16 local  employers such as NH Fish and Game, the Manchester Police Force, and  Trader Joe's. The 150 or so female sophomores and juniors from  Memorial, West, and Central learned from women professionals from a  variety of careers.   I admire Kaylee and Samantha for taking the initiative to make a  difference in their community and empower women to explore their career  options. It is important that young Granite State women were able to  see themselves in the women professionals they talked to and envision  their career paths accordingly. Their courage in tackling the issue and  making New Hampshire a more inclusive place is emblematic of the  Granite State spirit, and I wish them luck as they organize a second  women-only career fair this spring.                            ____________________
