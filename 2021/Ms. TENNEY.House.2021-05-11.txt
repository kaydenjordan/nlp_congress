 Mr. Speaker, it is a tremendous honor for me to recognize  Eileen Ucekay, a hardworking and outstanding constituent of the 22nd  Congressional District in New York. She retired on May 9 of this year  after working 45 years as the village clerk and treasurer of West  Winfield.   Eileen hails from the nearby city of Utica, where she grew up with  her two sisters and attended high school there before moving to West  Winfield.   Eileen married her late husband, Jack, and had three wonderful  children in our community, all while continuing to work for the  village.   In addition to her many decades of public service, Eileen serves the  West Winfield community through her  [[Page H2159]]  church, the Greater West Winfield Historical Society, the Red Cross,  and the Red Hat Society.   She is truly a role model for all. Her remarkable life, strong  character, and deep dedication to public service have gained her the  respect of everyone in our community.   We are grateful for Eileen Ucekay's service and her compassion for  our community.                            ____________________
