 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 4254) to amend the  National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 to strengthen the  aerospace workforce pipeline by the promotion of Robert Noyce Teacher  Scholarship Program and National Aeronautics and Space Administration  internship and fellowship opportunities to women, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women in Aerospace Education       Act''.       SEC. 2. ROBERT NOYCE TEACHER SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FELLOWSHIP                     OPPORTUNITIES.         (a) In General.--The National Science Foundation       Authorization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-368; 42 U.S.C.       1862n et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 10(a)(3)(A)(iv), by inserting ``, including       research experiences at national laboratories and NASA       centers'' before the semicolon; and        (2) in section 10A(c)(4)--        (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(C) providing internship opportunities for fellows,       including research experiences at national laboratories and       NASA Centers.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to grants awarded on or after       October 1, 2018.       SEC. 3. NASA INTERNSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES.         Not later than October 1, 2018, the Administrator of the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration (in this       section referred to as ``NASA'') shall institute a process to       encourage the recruitment of qualified candidates who are       women or individuals who are underrepresented in the fields       of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)       and computer science for internships and fellowships at NASA       with relevance to the aerospace sector and related fields.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 4254, the bill now under  consideration.  [[Page H9581]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4254, the Women in Aerospace Education  Act, as amended by the Senate. I speak on behalf of the bill's sponsor,  Representative Steve Knight, who could not be here this afternoon, but  he has worked for more than a year to get the bill across the finish  line.   H.R. 4254, directs NASA and the National Science Foundation, through  the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, to use their fellowships  and internships to encourage more women to get aerospace experience  while they are training to be science and mathematics teachers.   These teachers are then better equipped to educate and inspire  students to pursue studies and careers in aerospace.   Twenty percent of U.S. aerospace engineers are of retirement age  today. They are beginning to exit our workforce, which will create a  shortfall in our national security preparedness.   Meanwhile, women represent only about one-quarter of all science,  technology, engineering, and math, or STEM workers, and only about 15  percent of all aerospace engineers. We need to improve our STEM  education pipeline from ensuring STEM classes are available to students  at a young age to encouraging young Americans to pursue the completion  of a degree in STEM fields.   Attitudes about career paths are formed at a young age. The role  models and young leaders from which women learn have an enormous impact  on future decisionmaking.   The Women in Aerospace Education Act directs some of the Federal  Government's best teacher training programs to increase the number of  women teachers who can educate students about the Nation's leading  aerospace programs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Representative Steve Knight and  his cosponsors, Representative Elizabeth Esty, and Research and  Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock for advancing this  bipartisan legislation. We look forward to its being signed into law  soon.   If all goes well, it will be the 15th Science, Space, and Technology  Committee bill to be enacted into law this Congress, and one of 35  bills that the committee has passed in the House this year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill and send it to  the President's desk, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the  gentleman from California, my friend and colleague, for yielding me  time.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 1768, the National Earthquake Hazards  Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018.   The final text of the legislation we are considering today was first  introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher as H.R. 6650 in August.  Representative Rohrabacher, an active and valued senior member of the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee, led efforts to improve the  original Senate bill and authorize some additional funding to advance  earthquake monitoring and early-warning systems that are critical to  his home State of California.   It has been 15 years since the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program  was last reauthorized. This legislation modernizes earthquake safety  programs  [[Page H9586]]  that help States prepare for and respond to earthquakes.   The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act  is a result of bipartisan collaboration and work with the relevant  agencies, congressional committees, private sector and State agency  stakeholders.   I want to thank Representative Rohrabacher for his initiative on  moving the bill forward and working across the aisle and across the  Capitol with Senator Dianne Feinstein to get it across the finish line.                                time  1630    I also want to congratulate him for his 30 years of service to the  House Science, Space, and Technology Committee; the Congress; and his  constituents. Since joining the committee in 1989, he has been a  dedicated advocate for our Nation's space exploration programs, energy  research and innovation, and preparing our Nation for natural hazards.   I encourage my colleagues to support S. 1768 and send it to the  President's desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology be discharged from further  consideration of the bill (S. 3389) to redesignate a facility of the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
