 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of Cecilia Zarate-Laun. Her passing leaves Wisconsin without one of its  greatest advocates for justice and peace, and I am proud to pay tribute  to this extraordinary woman.   Cecilia was born in Santander Province of Colombia. She was the  oldest of five sisters and attended school in Bucaramanga and at the  National University of Colombia. Following the completion of her  studies, she took a position as a professor of nutrition, a job that  led to her arrival in Madison, WI for graduate school.   Cecilia received a scholarship to attend the University of Wisconsin- Madison for her master's degree. While studying in Madison, Cecilia met  her beloved husband, Jack. After completion of graduate school, Cecilia  returned to Colombia, working as a nutritionist for the Colombian  Government's National Nutrition Plan. In 1976, she married John  ``Jack'' Laun and the following year returned to the United States.   In 1987, extended civil war in Colombia inspired Cecilia and Jack to  cofound the Colombia Support Network CSN, a grassroots human rights  organization based in Madison, WI. Cecilia's work with CSN was her  pride and joy. As CSN program director, Cecilia worked tirelessly to  connect Americans to Colombian communities affected by the war. She was  inspired to help establish new chapters of CSN in locations ranging  from the University of Wisconsin-Madison to central New York,  connecting these communities through a ``sister cities'' program to  rural Colombian communities facing violence during the Colombian civil  war.   She led over 50 delegations of citizens, journalists, and public  officials to Colombia so they could fully understand the effect of the  civil war. After working with Cecilia and CSN to establish a sister  community relationship between Dane County, WI and San Jose de  Apartado, Colombia, I had the honor to accompany her on one of those  delegations in 1993.   In addition to her public service through CSN, Cecilia was a member  of the national board of directors of the Women's International League  for Peace and Freedom. She was also a member of the Latin American  Subcommittee of the American Friends Service Committee--Quakers--served  on the board of directors of the Wisconsin Network for Peace and  Justice, and, in October of 2015, received the Global Citizen of the  Year Award from the Madison Chapter of the United Nations Association.   Regardless of the cause or project, Cecilia approached everything  with unparalleled strength, courage, and a sense of selflessness. She  approached her battle with cancer with the same attitude. Over the last  4 years, while Cecilia fought against her disease, she continued to  fight for others. Her strength was truly amazing.   While Cecilia is greatly missed by her family, friends, and  community, she leaves behind a legacy for future leaders to emulate.  She will always be remembered for her courageous effort to fight for  those who could not fight for themselves.   Cecilia had an incredibly big heart and an unwavering commitment to  others. I am fortunate to have been able to call her my friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 175th  anniversary of Case IH Agriculture and Farm Equipment and to recognize  its outstanding commitment and contribution to Wisconsin's economy.   Mr. Jerome Increase Case, born in 1819 in western New York, was well  acquainted with agricultural equipment even as a young man. Case  provided threshing services to local farms and realized at the young  age of 16 that farming techniques needed improvement after witnessing a  demonstration of an early threshing machine that could thresh more in  one hour than a man could all day. After settling in Wisconsin in the  early 1840s, Case build his first thresher-separator in Rochester, WI,  but when the town refused to let Case draw electricity from the local  mill, Case loaded his invention into a wagon and headed to Racine, WI.   The J.I. Case Threshing Machine Company was founded in 1842 at a time  when Racine's tallest building was the local grain elevator. By 1848,  the company was Racine's largest employer. As a true pioneer in the  field of agricultural equipment, J.I. Case manufactured the first steam  engine tractor in 1869. The Old No. 1 is still on display at the  Smithsonian Institution. Although it was mounted on wheels, it was  still drawn by horses. The first self-propelled steam engine followed  in 1876.   Case machines were first transported beyond U.S. borders in 1871 and  won first prize at the Paris Exposition. By 1886, Case became the  largest producer of steam engines in the world.   During World War II, the company's plants manufactured aircraft  wings, aircraft towing tractors, artillery shells, and doors for the  Sherman tank. In fact, the company's 1942 centennial was celebrated 7  years late because of the war.   In 1985, Case IH became the Nation's second-largest farm equipment  manufacturer after J.I. Case purchased the agricultural division of  International Harvest and the business legacies of two major equipment  companies were united under one company. In 1999, Case IH merged with  New Holland Ag to form a parent company, CNH Global, although equipment  was still produced under the Case IH name. Since the merger, Case has  remained at the forefront of the farming industry, seeking new ways to  adapt to the changing trends. In 2010, Case IH created the world's  first tractor to meet the tier 4 emissions requirements of the  Environmental Protection Agency. Case IH Agriculture and Farm Equipment  currently works with more than 4,900 dealers and distributes products  in more than 160 countries.   As one of Wisconsin's founding manufacturers, Case has been a major  contributor to Wisconsin's farming legacy. Over the past 175 years,  this proud company has provided jobs for countless Wisconsin families  and economic growth for the State I am so proud to represent.   I offer my sincere congratulations to Case leadership and workers as  they celebrate 175 years of business, and I wish them the very best for  many more years of success in Racine and around the world.                            ____________________
