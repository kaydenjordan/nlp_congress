 Madam Speaker, today we are convening our monthly  special order hour of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to talk about a  pressing issue to our Nation, to our planet, in fact, and especially to  communities of color.   Climate change is a real global problem. It is affecting folks around  the world contributing to natural disasters and droughts that lead to  immigration and increased conflict.   We have seen how the Caribbean, which stands in the pathway of  natural disasters, has been hit time and time again from Superstorm  Maria to Hurricane Irma to the recent earthquakes in Puerto Rico. We  have seen how this region of the world, the Caribbean, which is our  third border, continually gets hammered by natural disasters.   In fact, just 2 days ago, the National Security, Military and  Intelligence Panel of the Center for Climate and Security, a  nonpartisan security policy institute, released a damning report.  Within the report it said that higher levels of warming will pose a  catastrophic and likely irreversible global security risk over the  course of the 21st century.   Last September, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change released yet another dire warning that the effects of climate  change are already irreversible, and we only have just about a decade  to act before it is too late.   One thing that is important, though, about climate change is the  disproportionate impact it has on communities of color. This is called  environmental injustice, and that is why it is important that we  address this from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus perspective, the  perspective of those representing communities of color.   Climate change affects our everyday lives in big ways and small ways.  Take my grandson, for example. He suffers from asthma and acute  allergies, and other health issues that a lot of our kids have that are  worsened by air pollution.   The issue is communities of color are not the biggest contributors to  the pollution of climate change. In fact, they contribute less but are  disproportionately hurt by climate change. We take public  transportation. We don't fill our streets with very expensive polluting  cars, but we bear the greatest burden from this and many other  pollutants. This is also called environmental injustice.   That is why I have introduced a resolution on environmental justice  to ensure that the government acknowledges and addresses the  disproportional harm that climate change has on our community and  communities of color.   Let me just take a moment to talk about some of my other work on this  issue, because I believe it is a good summary of aspects that need to  be addressed.   I was proud to support H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, which  passed the House last year and will keep the U.S. in the historic Paris  climate accord. I was able to include an amendment to that bill stating  that climate justice and environmental justice must be included in our  efforts to meet the Paris Agreement and mitigate and adapt to climate  change.   When we apply funding and when we allocate funding to address climate  change, those communities in crisis must be given the funding first.  This must be a core tenet of our policies to address climate change.  Every law we pass and every action we take to mitigate and adapt to  climate change must include acknowledgment and protections for  marginalized and frontline communities who bear the burden of climate  change.   One of my predecessors in the U.S. Congress, the late, great Adam  Clayton Powell, Jr., one of the great civil rights leaders of our  times, led year after year his Powell amendments to ensure Federal  funding did not support segregation. Every time he introduced the  amendments, they would be voted down. They would be systematically shut  down. But yet he continued to present them year after year after year.  Finally, during the 1960s in the middle of that decade when the civil  rights legislation was drafted and passed, that legislation which still  benefits many of us across America, it was the Powell amendment that  was included in civil rights legislation.   Environmental justice is my Powell amendment, and I believe we must  work to ensure that in every bill this House considers environmental  justice is upheld and advanced.   I have also introduced the Green Climate Fund Authorization Act which  commits the United States to provide climate finances to keep the  planet  [[Page H1216]]  under 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.                                time  1515    The Green Climate Fund is an independent, multilateral fund  established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change to help developing countries limit or reduce their greenhouse  gas emissions and adapt to climate change.   We often read about the migration dynamic playing out on our southern  border, and we think very often that those families are fleeing  violence. That may be the case for some families, but many of them are  also fleeing food security issues manifesting themselves in the  triangle countries because of a horrible drought caused by climate  change.   Developing countries have limited capacity to reduce their greenhouse  gas emissions, and through the Green Climate Fund, the U.S. can  contribute our fair share to enable mitigation and adaptation  activities that uphold environmental justice across the globe.   Because it is these exact nations that are also on the front line of  climate change, though they have contributed the least to these causes.  Yet, one of the most important new approaches to combating climate  change that has received a lot of traction and attention in the past  year is the Green New Deal. I was proud to be an early supporter of  this bold proposal, and many of my colleagues have since signed on to  it and support it as well.   The Green New Deal pushes us to reach net-zero emissions and a 100  percent renewable economy to stop polluting our planet and ensure a  safe climate for generations, for all of us, to come. It epitomizes  environmental justice for frontline communities, especially  underresourced groups, communities of color, Native Americans, people  with disabilities, children, and seniors.   The Green New Deal calls for a just transition for communities and  workers to ensure that there are jobs and training for a clean economy.  The Green New Deal will save American families money with investments  in weatherization, public transportation, and modern infrastructure.   We often talk about the infrastructure bill. Whether it is $1  trillion or $2 trillion, it must be built green.   It recognizes that combating climate change is an important  intersection for promoting clean air and water and providing nutritious  food, affordable and safe housing, and high-quality healthcare and  jobs.   The Green New Deal recognizes that we need to build resiliency in the  face of worsening and more frequent climate-related disasters and that  marginalized communities often bear the brunt of these disasters.   Arguably, the most important aspect about the Green New Deal is that  it forces us to think about combating climate change, not just in a  singular policy aimed at emissions, but with all the policies we  consider here in Congress, whether it is energy, education, the  economy, jobs, or infrastructure.   We need serious investments to mitigate and adapt to climate change,  but it will cost us more in the long term if we do not act now,  financially and existentially. Climate change, ultimately, is an  existential threat to all of us across America and across the planet.   By the time a child born today retires, in 2085, the U.S. will be  spending $300 billion each year on climate resiliency.   The time to invest is now. In fact, the time to invest was two  decades ago.   But here we are. We need serious investment in our infrastructure and  our transportation systems. We need to invest in green roof technology  and innovative urban agriculture to address not just the carbon  emissions of the agricultural field, but also to address intersectional  issues of food security and climate change.   Earlier this year, our Democratic majority, led by Speaker Nancy  Pelosi and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Peter  DeFazio, released a framework for infrastructure investment that takes  many components of the Green New Deal into account.   It makes bold investments in public transportation systems to harness  zero-emission technology and reduce congestion. It ensures that newly  proposed transit projects are judged on their capacity to reduce  emissions and congestion.   The framework includes provisions like those in the Transportation  Alternatives Enhancement Act, which will prioritize projects that  promote biking, walking, and other alternative, cleaner forms of  transportation and infrastructure. The plan will boost investment in  resiliency and green infrastructure to a degree that we have not yet  seen before. It will make improvements in regional water resources to  protect local ecosystems across the Nation.   In short, Democrats are proud to put forward proposals that will not  only protect our planet but will invest in America's communities,  invest in American workers, and invest in America's youth and future  generations so we are prepared to tackle this momentous task in the  decades to come. And the Green New Deal is one of the ways we are doing  just that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Barragan), my colleague, the second vice chairperson of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great  State of New York, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, and the 98 Members who  are cosponsors of the Green New Deal.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson  Lee from the State of Texas, Congresswoman Nanette Barragan from the  State of California, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from  the grea State of New York for bringing important facts to the table  that will dispel the scare tactics that are being deployed and peddled  across America about this Green New Deal. It will save lives.    I represent the district that has one of the highest asthma rates in  the State, Harlem. There is a significant number of bus depots in  Harlem polluting the air. In East Harlem, the children have one of the  highest levels of respiratory diseases and asthma. Washington Heights  is cut right through its heart by a polluting railway called the Cross  Bronx Expressway. We are surrounded by highways, and we are surrounded  by pollution, leading to a very low quality of air, which leads to  disease and leads to death.   This has been an enlightened conversation about the Green New Deal. I  hope America understands the particulars behind it and that we are  better equipped and better informed to make the right decisions in  support of this lifesaving piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to allow the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus to talk about the importance of  protecting our planet in the way in which the Green New Deal will do,  while we are also making our Nation better.   I thank everyone who was able to participate, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
