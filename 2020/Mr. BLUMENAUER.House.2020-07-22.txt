 Madam Speaker, it was sad to hear my colleague with  his recent comments. Let me tell you what it is like on the ground in  Portland.   This is a serious problem in Oregon where people are attempting to  peacefully demonstrate their opposition to a whole range of racist  practices by law enforcement. There are, to be sure, occasionally a few  people who are doing things that they shouldn't, and they should be  arrested, tried, and convicted. But the vast majority of people are  peaceful.   And it is no fault, frankly, of what has happened with the Trump  administration, who have moved in with what can only be described as an  occupying force, making the situation worse. They were unwanted,  unwelcome, and unprepared. Nonetheless, they have moved in, been  involved with episodes that people can watch on YouTube, where peaceful  demonstrators were attacked.   One of my constituents, asking a simple question, was beaten with a  baton, breaking his wrist, and pepper sprayed in the face. This is  outrageous. This is a made-for-TV initiative by the Trump  administration and should stop.                            ____________________
