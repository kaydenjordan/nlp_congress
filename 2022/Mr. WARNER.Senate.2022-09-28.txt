 Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend the Senator  from Ohio for always being willing to speak out on behalf of important  people all across the country. I agree with him that organized labor  for literally decades has always protected working people. We need to  bear that in mind as we sort through the issues that confront us on a  regular basis. So I thank him for his comments.                   Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act    Mr. President, I rise today to actually celebrate a major  accomplishment for thousands of Americans who have been trapped for,  many times, decades in exploitative joint student loans.   This is an issue that is actually near and dear to me because I have  been working on it for 7 years, since hearing from a constituent way  back in 2015.   Sara from Northern Virginia was part of a group of student loan  borrowers who entered into something called a joint consolidation loan,  which allowed married couples to combine their student debt into a  single loan. The truth was, though, that sounded good, but Congress  didn't allow anyone to unwind those loans in the event of a divorce or  an abusive relationship.   So finally, in 2006, Congress got rid of the whole program. But when  they got rid of the whole program, they didn't retroactively create an  option for those folks who had entered into these joint consolidation  loans between 1993 and 2006.   So when my constituent Sara had divorced from her husband when she  was living in Texas, she was still responsible for this loan. So all of  the debt that had originally been his suddenly fell upon her shoulders.  The divorced husband stopped paying the debt. Yet she was still  responsible, and she, Sara, had to continue facing the consequences.   Now, she was a single mom of two, a public school teacher. Sara was  financially on the hook for her defaulting husband's student debts. Her  credit suffered dramatically. She even thought she was going to lose  her teacher's license.   Now, she did a lot--great researcher. I talked to her a couple times.  After looking for a way out, she found that the only way to fix this  problem was for an act of Congress.   Well, she contacted my office, and we found out that this was not a  one-off circumstance, but, literally, there were thousands of Americans  all across the country who had fallen into this trap. A lot of them  were domestic violence survivors, who, even though they had gotten out  of an abusive relationship, were still stuck with paying off the debts  of their abuser. Many of these were people who were victims of  financial abuse and, again, completely responsible for a loan, in many  cases, that they had never even taken out.   Others were unable to save for retirement, for their kids. We had a  lot of teachers who were otherwise eligible for the public service loan  forgiveness programs, but because they had entered into the joint  consolidated student loans, they suddenly weren't eligible.   So we did some research and spent some time looking into it. In 2017,  I introduced the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act to solve this  problem and find a way for, oftentimes, innocent borrowers to get out  of these consolidations.   Now, starting back in 2015--I have got to acknowledge, it took 7  years. Something that was this much of a no-brainer shouldn't have  taken that long, but I am proud to be here today and report that we did  get it through Congress on a bipartisan basis.   Here in the Senate, I am grateful for a lot of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. I am grateful for the Presiding Officer. We  actually passed it on a unanimous basis, and in the House we passed it  with a broad bipartisan coalition.   That is a testament to what a critical, commonsense fix this is--one  that will actually change the lives of thousands of Americans,  literally, overnight.   Now, since we introduced this law the first time, my office has heard  from so many Americans who are desperate to get this done.   I remember hearing from Chris from Indiana, who said he spent over 16  years thinking about this loan every day and waking up at night trying  to create a strategy to pay this loan off.   He got back to us and he said:         For the first time, I may be able to put my mind at peace.    We heard from Sharon, who is a seventh grade teacher, whose former  partner was totally unresponsive on meeting their obligations on this  joint consolidation. Now, she said:         I don't have to do this anymore. I get to live my life.    She gets to actually retire this year because, once President Biden  signs this law, it will immediately relieve her of this obligation.   Or Jessica, who said:         I am finally about to be free . . . of one last way my ex       controls me.    Again, I can't imagine entering into this arrangement and then  getting out of a relationship, often sometimes an abusive relationship,  and that ex still trying to control this person by not meeting their  share of the obligations. It just was wrong.   Next, Amy, who falls into the category of otherwise--because, I  believe, she was a teacher, she was able to get public service loan  forgiveness and worked for years on something she should qualify for,  but if you had entered into one of these joint consolidations, you  didn't get this benefit.   So Amy said:         I've never been able to take advantage of a single debt-      relief program.    This bill will change that, obviously in terms of public service  loans but also in terms of some of the proposals that President Biden  has put forward.   All these people have been asking for is a chance to not unduly bear  the joint burden of a program that even the Congress and the Federal  Government decided in 2006 wasn't fair, but when we unwound it, we  didn't unwind it, literally, for thousands of people who had fallen  into this program between 1993 and 2006.   Now, we are through the House. We are through the Senate. We still  have to hit one thing. And while the White House has indicated that the  President supports this legislation, we have to get it signed right  away because, when we think about these teachers and nurses and other  folks who met their goal of what they have to qualify in critical areas  to qualify for public student debt forgiveness, you know, the truth is,  if they are going to get that benefit this year, they have got to make  that application by October 31.   So before Halloween, these folks and countless others are waiting for  them to simply apply for a right that, in  [[Page S5147]]  many cases, they should have been granted 5, 10, 15 years ago.   And as I said, many of the folks in this category are public school  teachers. They are government workers. They are nurses. They all have  met the otherwise, oftentimes, stringent requirements for public  service loan forgiveness, but this law has to be a law in time for them  to be able to timely apply for this relief before Halloween.   So I am hoping--the President has indicated he supports this bill,  but the President has got to sign this law as soon as possible so  borrowers can finally experience freedom from financial and domestic  abuse, freedom to control their own financial future, and freedom to  enjoy the exact same benefits that other teachers and public servants  have across the country.   I would like to close by saying that, this week, I actually had a  chance to call Sara, who originally brought this issue to my attention.  She told me that, without this law, and even if she had continued  making all of her monthly payments for her divorced husband, it would  have been impossible for her to get rid of this debt in her lifetime.  She would literally have been tied to her ex-husband, and she left  Texas to get away from that ex-husband, to move to Virginia. She would  literally be tied to that former spouse for the rest of her life.   For Sara and for literally thousands of other borrowers impacted by  this program, it is time for the President to sign this law and provide  these borrowers the relief they deserve.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
