 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my  friend, Phil Roe, Representative of Tennessee's First District, as he  chooses to end this chapter in his life and return to being a private  citizen.   On television, many Americans are left with the impression that the  U.S. House of Representatives is a place of constant combat. Naturally,  over the past two centuries, the House has seen many great debates  about the future of our Nation.   Debate at its essence is about passionately arguing for your  preferred course of action. The beauty of the people's House and the  reason that former Speaker Longworth described the House as coming  nearer reflecting at all time the popular will than does any other  individual or legislative body in this or any other country is that we  debate in earnest, yet we do so with a premium on civility. But, alas,  as I say, many Americans are left, based on the evening cable  entertainment shows, with the opposite impression.   My experience over the past 6 years is that this Chamber is, in fact,  a place where the great issues of the day are debated and where,  through that work and debate, firm friendships are established. Those  friendships extend across the aisle, across cultures, and across  generations.   Over the past 6 years, I have come to have the greatest respect for  one of my colleagues who, after 12 years, has elected to leave the  House and return to that most basic title that we all hold with honor,  that of citizen.   During the course of these years, I recognize my friend, Phil Roe,  Representative of Tennessee's First District, as a man of high  character, immense intellect, and great loyalty. His loyalty to the  people of the Tri-Cities of east Tennessee is shown in his daily  spirit.   His loyalty, passion, and care for his fellow veterans have  overflowed in his role as chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee and currently as ranking member. He has never forgotten his  service in the U.S. Army in the Medical Corps, where he was stationed  in Korea.   He has never forgotten his constituents, who enjoy a livelihood in  the thriving region in and around Johnson City, Tennessee.    For three decades, prior to coming to Congress, Phil was an OB/GYN.  He claims, Madam Speaker, that his terrific record of public service  and local office, including being mayor of Johnson City, were essential  to his preparation for and success in earning a seat in Congress. But  we all know better, Madam Speaker. We know that simply delivering the  vast majority of your constituents is a surefire way to be successfully  elected.   As a Christian, Phil sets a high standard and is a stalwart in the  annual National Prayer Breakfast preparation and our weekly Thursday  morning bipartisan fellowship, where he never hesitates to bring his  guitar and share his musical talents. There must be something in the  water in Bristol, Tennessee, home of country music.   It is true that Phil and I bonded over critical national defense  policy, accountability and excellence in care for our veterans, and his  solutions for market-based policies that would lead to more affordable  healthcare for all Americans. But we grew up as Scouts, so our real  mutual love is for the outdoors. To this day, decades later, we share a  love of backpacking, camping, and hiking in the mountains.   In fact, in 2019, both of us were so excited that Congress passed,  and President Trump signed into law, new national wilderness areas in  each our districts. For me, I was able to add acreage to Flatside  Wilderness and commence a formal study of the area. For Phil, it was  adding nearly 20,000 acres of some of the wildest pockets of Cherokee  National Forest in east Tennessee to the wilderness system.   We both share an amazing affection for that long day at high-altitude  above the treeline. One evening in Maine, after a delicious dinner, we  agreed, hey, let's get up in the morning and go climb the highest  mountain on the eastern seaboard and hike the end of the Appalachian  Trail. We will climb and retrace the steps of Henry David Thoreau's  attempt to climb Mount Katahdin.   Sure enough, we were true to our word. We got up at 3 a.m. and drove  from the coast to the trailhead, arriving at 7 a.m. We spent one of the  most memorable days on the trail that I can recall. The summit of Mount  Katahdin was pea soup, but you can tell from our smiles that the long  trek up and down was worth every step.   Congressman Roe, you have fought the good fight. You have kept the  faith. And like every good Scout, you have left your campsite cleaner  than when you found it. Now it is time for a few less cross fires and a  few more late-night campfires.  [[Page H7165]]    Martha and I wish you and Clarinda; your combined families; your  three kids, Whitney, John, David; and their families many, many happy  days on the trail in the years to come.   You will be missed here in the people's House. You will be missed by  your friends. These Halls will be a little emptier without your smile,  your voice, and your love expressed daily for the people of east  Tennessee.                            ____________________
