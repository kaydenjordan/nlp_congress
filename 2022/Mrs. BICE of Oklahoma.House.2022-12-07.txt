 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my  incredible Air Force fellow, Carol Hernandez, for her tremendous work  this past year in my office.   Carol has been instrumental in all things related to the Armed  Services Committee, especially when it came to the NDAA and looking for  ways to improve the DOD acquisitions process. Her wealth of knowledge,  experience, and expertise has been crucial in helping address issues  important to Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District.   We will miss Carol, not for only what she brought to us  legislatively, but mostly because of who she is as a person. Carol is  truly one of the most kind, thoughtful, and genuine people I have ever  met. She is also whip smart, an engineer, and an amazing mother to four  daughters.   Although I am excited for her new chapter, it has been a pleasure to  have her in my office. She will be truly missed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Carol for everything she has done for Team Bice.                            ____________________
