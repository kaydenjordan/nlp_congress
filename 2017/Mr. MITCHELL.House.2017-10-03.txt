 Madam Speaker, I rise today to do a little myth- busting. Critics of the 21st Century AIRR Act are selling a myth that  the 21st Century AIRR Act will be damaging and adverse to general  aviation. This couldn't be further from the truth.   I am a regular general aviation user and a student pilot. My brother- in-law  [[Page H7676]]  is a GA pilot. I would never support legislation that would be bad for  my rural communities and the airports in those communities.   Let's address a few of those myths.   The nonprofit service provider for air traffic control will be  prohibited from charging user fees to any segment of general aviation  in contrast to the myths that are being sold out there.   The act also prohibits the ATC provider from restricting access to  any airspace or any airport.   Further, any changes to access to airports or airspace would be  subject to extensive government review and approval.   Additional funding is provided to community airports to assist them  to continue to grow and be vibrant in our communities.   Critics would have you believe that general aviation will not have a  seat at the table. Again, not true. The nonprofit board of directors  designates a seat for community airports, as it designates a seat for  general aviation, lease pilots, airlines, and air cargo.   The FAA, in a hearing, indicated it would take another 10 years and  $30 billion to update an air traffic control system from the archaic  system we have now. When asked, they said that they hoped they would  have it accomplished in 10 years. Hope is not a plan.   The Trump administration supports the 21st Century AIRR Act. Air  traffic controllers support the 21st Century AIRR Act. Airline pilots  support it. The airlines support it, and air cargo supports it. We can  go through a long list, yet we continue to deal with myths being spun  out there that somehow this is adverse to aviation.   We have an archaic air traffic control system that is hurting our  Nation and that is damaging our economy. It is time to move beyond fear  and myths.   Madam Speaker, I urge colleagues to move beyond those myths and see  the 21st Century AIRR Act will benefit all users. Let's bring the bill  to the floor, let's have a vote, and let's move the air traffic control  system back.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 36, Micah's Law, which I  proudly cosponsored. It is said that nations are  [[Page H7689]]  judged by how we care for our weakest members. There are no more  vulnerable than a preborn child, whom, unfortunately, we fail to  protect.   The United States is one of only seven nations that allow elective  abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, when science confirms that the  babies feel pain. Accompanying us on this list are China and North  Korea, nations with disturbing records of human rights violations.   Mr. Speaker, this is not simply about a medical procedure. It is  about life. Micah Pickering was born at 22 weeks. He is now a happy,  healthy kindergartner. There is a lot of talk around here about life.  This bill is about life. It is not about being lucky enough to have a  birthday. It is about giving every child the opportunity to grow, and  we are responsible for them. We should take that action seriously.   I cosponsor the bill, I vote for the bill, and I urge everyone  support Micah's Law.
