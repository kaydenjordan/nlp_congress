 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately schedule  this important bill so we can take care of the most innocent of lives  that we have in America.
