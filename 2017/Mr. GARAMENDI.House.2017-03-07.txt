 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to cover several  very, very important points.   Tomorrow is International Women's Day, and I was going to talk about  the role of women in our society, talk about my five daughters and what  they have been doing in their life of service, and my wife, but events  intervened. And yesterday, our good friends on the Republican side  introduced a piece of legislation that will dramatically affect women,  young and old; children. They introduced a repeal of the Affordable  Care Act.   We are still trying to figure out all of the details involved in it.  It is going to be a little hard, since it was changed late in the  night. But there are some things we do know. I would like to start off  with what we do know about the Affordable Care Act so that when we come  to debate on the floor in the days ahead the Republican repeal and  replacement of the existing Affordable Care Act, we have a foundation.   If you will indulge me, I will try to lay out some facts, not  alternative facts, but facts. For example, 20 million Americans have  gained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The percentage  of uninsured in America is the lowest it has ever been. Mr. Speaker,  6.1 million young adults between the age of 19 and 25 have gained  insurance coverage by being able to stay on their parents' insurance  program--6.1 million. Of the Americans who have preexisting conditions,  and that is 27 percent of us who have some sort of preexisting  condition--heart issues, diabetes, broken legs, bad backs, whatever--27  percent of those Americans are guaranteed coverage even though they  have a preexisting condition.   I was insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and I must  tell you the battles--well, it would take several days to talk about  the battles that I had with the insurance companies who were denying  coverage because of preexisting conditions. No longer the case in  America. The Affordable Care Act said no. And by the way, the lifetime  limits, they are gone, also.   California, which I have had the pleasure of being a citizen of, 3.7  million Californians are now insured under the Medi-Cal program, and  1.4 million have gained coverage through the exchange, called Covered  California. About 1.2 million of those have received subsidies,  averaging over $300 a month. Over 5 million Californians will be  directly affected by a direct repeal.   And in the expansion of Medicaid, or Medi-Cal as we call it in  California, if that is eliminated, that is a $16 billion hit to the  State of California, and, obviously, an enormous hit to those 3.7  million Californians who have been covered under the Medi-Cal  expansion.   Secondary impacts: employment. Maybe 200,000 jobs would be lost in  California.   Individual stories: boy, they abound. Just this evening, I got a call  from my wife, and she said: You really ought to talk about that young  family in Woodland, California, whose 2-year-old son was diagnosed with  some sort of a medical illness. They were able to get coverage before  that under the covered California program. They went back a year later,  and the kid had a brain tumor.   Fortunately, it was resolved because they had insurance. They were  able to get the early diagnosis. And under the current law, the  Affordable Care Act, they will be able to keep their coverage, even  though previous to the Affordable Care Act, this young child and,  quite probably, the family would be uninsurable.    It is working. The Affordable Care Act is working. Are there ways to  improve it? Undoubtably, there are, and we could sit down and talk  about ways to improve it.   But yesterday, our Republican colleagues introduced legislation that  is going to have a profound negative impact on men and women all across  this Nation. We will spend time in the days ahead to talk about the  details, but we do know that, in general terms, there will be less  coverage at a higher cost for literally everybody, except for a few  special folks. And I would like to just put up a chart about that.  Let's start with this one.   You see, in the repeal bill that was introduced, there are very  serious tax cuts. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars  of tax cuts over the next 2 years. Well, we all want a tax cut. But  under the repeal, there are some very special people who are going to  get a really big tax cut. Take a look at this.   The top 20 percent of taxpayers will receive 74.2 percent of the  multihundred-billion-dollar tax cut, which is estimated to be somewhere  in the range of $700 billion to maybe as much as $1 trillion, depending  upon the final calculations.   By the way, the Congressional Budget Office has not had time to  score, that is to tell us what the cost, what the benefits are, of the  Republican proposal. But we do know from earlier studies of this, 75  percent of the multihundred-billion-dollar tax cuts go to the wealthy.  Wow. And where does the money come from? It comes from the poor, it  comes from the working families, the men and women who are struggling  here in America. Maybe they are making a good living--$50,000 to  $60,000 a year. They are going to see their benefit package reduced.   One more way to look at this is the famous pie chart. So who gets the  tax breaks? Not the top 20 percent. Let's just focus more clearly here  on the top one-tenth of 1 percent. What do they get? They are not a  percentage. This is not the top 1 percent. This is the top one-tenth of  a percent. What do they get? Well, they get nearly $200,000 a year in  tax reductions. That is not bad. So the top 1 percent gets 57 percent  of that 6-, 7-, $800-billion tax cut, and everyone else will get 43  percent.   So what we have here is a massive shift of wealth from the working  men and women of America, from American families, to the very top--you  know, the 1 percenters. That is who is getting the benefit in this  massive tax cut that has been proposed. I don't know if that is good  policy. It is not in my district. I don't think it is good policy for  America.   We spent a lot of this last year in the Presidential campaign talking  about the shift of wealth to the superwealthy and away from the great  majority of Americans. But, here we go. In the very first big  legislation of this year, we see the Republicans in a massive effort to  increase the wealth of the superwealthy at the expense of the rest of  Americans.  [[Page H1578]]    There are many, many more things to talk about here. But I want to  just take a deep breath, which I need, because I guess I am getting  rather excited about what is happening--or maybe angry is a better  word--and turn to my colleague from the great State of Virginia to  carry on while I take a deep breath and cool off a bit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Scott, thank you so very much. You bring to this  discussion a very important perspective as the ranking member of the  Education and the Workforce Committee. You have that perspective of  understanding the effect of this legislation on the working men and  women and families of the United States.   I was just looking at some of the early comments that have come out  about the bill, which is less than--well, it is almost 24 hours old  now. Families USA said: ``The GOP healthcare proposal would be  laughable if its consequences weren't so devastating. This bill will  strip coverage for millions of people and drive up consumer costs.''   The Catholic Health Association of the United States said: ``This  proposal would also take many backward steps in the continual effort to  improve our healthcare system. . . .''   It goes on and on, and as more and more people come to understand the  issues that the gentleman was discussing, I think they are going to  find that, no, we will take the Affordable Care Act as it presently  exists, and we will make some modifications to it to improve it.   The gentleman raised a very interesting point. It reminds me of  another conversation I had earlier this week with my wife. She had gone  to her hairstylist, who is about 29 years old, has run her own business  for the last 7, 8 years, and she told me wife: It can't be true. They  can't do it, can they? They can't kill the Affordable Care Act, the  ObamaCare?   She said: For the first time in my life, I was able to get insurance;  and now that I have insurance, there is this maternity benefit that is  in my package, and now my husband and I, we can afford to have a child.   It was directly to the point the gentleman was making. If there is an  option here on maternity coverage or any coverage for women's health,  then we are going to find a situation where people will pick and  choose; they will wait to get their insurance, and then the insurance  pool is left with very expensive cases and the cost is not spread out.   The gentleman may have some other examples that may have come along  or some other comments that he would like to make. I would be delighted  to have the gentleman share those on the floor, and I will yield to the  gentleman.    The gentleman is correct on that. I was just looking  at some statistics here a moment ago about the shifting of cost.   Under the Affordable Care Act, there are many, many benefits for  Medicare. Leaving aside the Medicaid population for a moment, the  Medicare population, available to every individual 65 and older, there  have been significant improvements.   You mentioned the doughnut hole earlier, the drug benefit. If you run  up heavy expenditures on your drugs, you would come to a point where  you had to pay 100 percent. Medicare didn't cover it. Well, that  doughnut hole is collapsing, and in another 2 years, the Medicare  program will cover all of the drug costs without limitation.   Also, there is the free annual checkup that is available to everybody  that is on Medicare. The result of these kinds of things, where drugs  are available, blood pressure drugs, diabetes and the like, has led  to--together with the additional taxes that the superwealthy are  paying--has increased the solvency of Medicare by 11 years.   Now, the fiddling that is going on with the proposal that our  Republicans have put through, it is not clear exactly what the result  would be; but we do know that one of the major tax cuts is the  elimination of this Medicare tax that the superwealthy have been  paying, and that is over--together with one other tax is almost $340  billion. So the support for Medicare and the solvency of Medicare  becomes a question mark as a result of the proposals.   We don't have all of the answers to this, but we do know that a 60- year-old presently getting an insurance policy from the Affordable Care  Act, from ObamaCare, and making somewhere around $40,000 a year-- perhaps working at Walmart--they are going to see a 57 percent  reduction in the tax credit that is currently available versus what the  Republican bill has.   So a 60-year-old making $40,000 a year under the ACA, ObamaCare, will  receive somewhere around a $9,000 tax credit to support the purchase of  insurance. Under the Republican bill, they are looking at $4,000--not  $9,000, but $4,000--so 57 percent reduction in the support that they  receive, probably leading to them not being able to afford insurance  and winding up in your emergency room example.    Well, let me make sure I understand. I was 60 a while  ago, but let's say I am 60 and I am getting a health insurance policy  under ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. I may have to pay three times  what a 25-year-old pays, but under the proposal that has been brought  to us by the Republicans, I would pay five times?    The fundamental nature of insurance is you gather a  large population of healthy, not-so-healthy, and perhaps some very sick  people into a large population, and the cost is spread across the  entire population.   What we may be ceding here in this particular proposal is the  unravelling of that fundamental insurance concept with young people,  healthy, not bothering to buy insurance, staying out of the market; and  then, eventually, when they become ill, they will get back into the  market, leaving everybody else to pay for it.   There is another piece of this shifting of cost that did occur prior  to the Affordable Care Act--significantly reduced, as a result of it-- and that is the uninsured still get sick.   The gentleman mentioned the emergency room a while ago, and for the  most part, in America, a person can get to an emergency room with or  without insurance; but if they don't have insurance, there is still a  cost associated with the visit to the emergency room and any other  thing they may need. They may need to have their leg repaired, a broken  leg, or maybe they need an appendectomy or whatever. That is still a  cost. The question is: Who picks up that cost? That is called  uncompensated care, and it was a huge problem prior to the Affordable  Care Act.   I had hospitals throughout my district and throughout California  coming to me and saying: We can't afford this because we are not able  to cover that uncompensated care for people that didn't have insurance  that showed up at the emergency room.   Now, we know that from the early analysis done of the proposed  legislation by our Republican friends that the number of uninsured is  likely to increase, perhaps as much as 11 million people--maybe more,  maybe somewhat less. Those people will still get sick. They may have  money of their own to cover their costs, but the chances are they  don't. That uncompensated cost will then be borne by the people who do  buy insurance. It is a cost shift to those who have insurance.     There are so many pieces to this healthcare system.   One thing that I want to put on the table here from my experience as  insurance commissioner in California is that there are two fundamental  parts  [[Page H1580]]  to the healthcare system in the United States, and really around the  world. One of those two parts is how we collect the money and then pay  for the services. We call that insurance. It is also Medicare,  Medicaid, veterans' programs, and the like. These are the way in which  we collect money and pay for the services.                                time  2015    The other part of the healthcare system is the delivery of services;  these are the doctors, the clinics, the hospitals, and other providers,  mental health providers, and the like. We often get confused by putting  these two things together.   There has been a lot of talk about what we are doing with the  Affordable Care Act. It is essentially a mechanism to pay for services.  It is an insurance mechanism. Using the private insurance system, these  various exchanges are set up to pool the population of people who do  not have insurance from their employer, the individual people,  individual coverage. It pools them so that you have that large  population so that the cost is spread out across that large pool and  the insurance becomes affordable. That is an insurance mechanism. That  is a pooling. It has nothing to do directly with the provision of  medical services.   The medical services are then provided out of that pooling  arrangement by the individual doctors, maybe clinics, maybe hospitals,  maybe group practices. Some of that will be capitated pay, and others  will be a fee-for-service.   We haven't changed directly the way in which services are provided,  that is, the delivery of services. And this is found in hospitals. In  the Affordable Care Act, there was a penalty for hospitals that had  readmissions for infections. What we have seen, as a result of that  provision dealing directly with the way in which services are delivered  in hospitals, is a dramatic decline in readmissions for hospital- acquired infections. What that means is some 60,000 people are still  alive today because they didn't get a hospital-acquired infection.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, that is exactly right, and I see that in  my district. I have a large rural district in California. And, even  today, there are areas where it is difficult to find a physician to get  medical services.   This is one of the things, as you so correctly pointed out, the  Affordable Care Act had a part of that. One of the titles dealt with  the education of medical personnel. And so what we have seen, at least  in California--and I suspect across America--with the Affordable Care  Act in place, we are seeing that one of the fastest growing areas for  new jobs is the healthcare sector because we are adding a lot of  people--we need more--and then the educational programs that you talked  about, which comes under the jurisdiction, I believe, of your  committee. That is an important part.   One of the things that I hope the American public comes to understand  is this is not just a sound bite that was used in a political campaign.  We are going to repeal the ObamaCare and we are going to replace it is  a nice sound bite. But we are talking about the lives of Americans, we  are talking about their health, their ability to stay healthy, their  ability to get medical services.   When you start tinkering with something that is so personal--that is  what people say in my district: This is about my ability to stay  healthy, my ability to get medical care. That is what I hear.   They are saying they are frightened. They are concerned that the  legislation and all of the discussion in the political campaigns has  been so heated that they are afraid they are going to lose what they  presently have.   A quick look at what has been presented to Congress just in the last  24 hours indicates that a couple of facts are clear. First of all,  there is an enormous tax break for the very, very wealthy, probably to  the tune of 3- to $400 billion over 10 years. That is an incredible tax  break for the superwealthy and for the health insurance industry. That,  we are pretty sure, is in this legislation. We don't know the exact  numbers; but we do know that early indications are that there is a  shift, tax breaks for the wealthy, and cost increases for everybody  else. That we know.   We also know that there are certain elements of support for  individuals that will be removed. As we go about debating this and  understanding the full import and get the Congressional Budget Office  information, I think we are going to find that Americans are going to  say: Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait. You are doing what to me? What are  you doing to me? You are taking away my health insurance?   I suspect that will lead to a rebellion of some sort. Certainly it  has agitated a lot of people in my communities about the justifiable  fear of what may be coming to Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia is absolutely  correct about that. Unfortunately, my understanding is that as early as  tomorrow--that would be Wednesday--that the committees intend to mark  up the legislation. Normally, that means the version of the legislation  that will pass out of committee is completed. And, I suspect, usually  it is associated with a vote that takes place in committee. We don't  know for sure if it is tomorrow or the next day, but we do know that if  it is this week, we will not have the Congressional Budget Office  information.   The gentleman mentioned something that I probably should have jumped  on immediately because of my rural district, and those are the clinics.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, there are now seven significant  clinic organizations that provide services to about 23 specific sites  around my district. They are providing, really for the first time in  many of the communities that I represent, immediately available  healthcare services to a variety of people, some of whom have had an  employer-sponsored health plan and others of whom are on Medi-Cal in  California.  [[Page H1581]]    The apparent reduction in the Medicaid, Medi-Cal for California,  support from the Federal Government that will occur over the next 2\1/ 2\ to 3 years will eliminate one of the principal ways in which those  clinics have been able to continue to operate and, that is, the  expansion of the Medicaid population in California.   It appears that the legislation that is proposed will shrink the  Medicaid program across the Nation and severely curtail in California  the support available for people who are currently on Medi-Cal. That  will be devastating to these clinics in these rural areas.   We have had discussions about this. They say: Watch carefully. If  this is what happens, we are going to be out of business. We are going  to shut down our doors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott) for joining us this evening. This is a fundamental part of  American life, that is, our health care. It is about 18 percent of the  total GDP, gross domestic product. It is extremely important in terms  of the total well-being of our society and our economy.   Changes to the Affordable Care Act that are being proposed will have  a dramatic effect. And what we do know about it is that there will be a  massive shift of wealth from working men, women, and families to the  superwealthy. We know that from the tax proposals that have been made  in the analysis of the tax.   We also know that there is a very, very high probability that perhaps  11 million people will lose their insurance coverage, either in the  private insurance market through the exchanges or through the Medicaid  programs across the Nation. And the effect on the providers, the  hospitals, the clinics will be profound.   So when we have something as important as this, it is just wrong. It  is wrong for the majority in this House to put this legislation before  the committees without a full hearing on what the effect will be. But  it appears that tomorrow, Wednesday, we will have the first markup in  this process.   What I want--and I think the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott)  does, too--is for the American public to hear the debate, to understand  the implications where we are today with the Affordable Care Act and  what it has brought to us in terms of quality and accessibility to  health care and what it would mean with the proposed changes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott) for expressing Virginia's view. From California, it is, whoa,  wait a minute, let's be careful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
