 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, March 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that the Senate  resume consideration of S.J. Res. 34.    Mr. President, the internet has grown at an unbounded rate  in the years since its inception, a phenomenon no one can argue with.  Much of that growth can be attributed to the light-touch regulatory  approach that the government adopted in the early days of the web.   As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over  the internet, I have worked hard to promote policies that encourage the  private sector to invest in and grow the internet ecosystem as a whole.  All of that is jeopardized, however, if government bureaucrats have the  ability to overregulate the digital world. When it comes to  overregulating the internet, one need look no further than the  Democratic-controlled Federal Communications Commission under President  Obama.   In a world that was turning away--it was literally turning away from  the legacy telecommunication services and, instead, toward dynamic  internet applications, the FCC found its role gradually diminishing.  This is an inevitable and good byproduct, I might add, of a more  competitive environment brought about by technological innovation and  successful light-touch policies.   Yet the Obama FCC fought hard against this technological progress  and, instead, pursued an aggressively activist and partisan agenda that  put government edicts ahead of real consumer desires. Over the last 2  years, the FCC has made a stunning bureaucratic power grab. First, the  FCC stripped away the Federal Trade Commission's authority to police  internet providers and seized that for itself by recharacterizing such  services as monopoly-era telecommunications.   Then in 2016, the FCC, which has little experience regulating  internet privacy, decided to turn our country's privacy laws on their  head by abandoning the time-tested enforcement approach of the FTC, the  Federal Trade Commission. These actions by the FCC ignored both common  sense and real world data and, instead, focused on hypothetical harms  of the future.   Ignoring years of internet ecosystem precedent, where everyone was  treated the same, the FCC's 2016 broadband privacy regulations would  apply only to certain parts of the internet. This is a source of  significant concern because at any particular time, consumers will not  have reasonable certainty of what the rules are and how their privacy  decisions will be applied.   Are you at home on Wi-Fi? At home on a smartphone? Using your  smartphone on a friend's Wi-Fi? Using the Internet at a library? Each  of these could have very different privacy implications for a consumer  because of the FCC's piecemeal approach to privacy, leading to more  confusion and uncertainty, not increased privacy protections, as  promised.   In enacting these lopsided rules, the FCC seems to have gone out of  its way to disregard established FTC practice by creating new  regulations that differ significantly from the FTC's tried-and-true  framework. The FTC's privacy regime is clear, easy to understand, and  applies evenly throughout the marketplace. By contrast, the FCC's rules  are complex, confusing, and often lead to the same data being treated  inconsistently online.   The FCC's action would harm consumers in other ways as well. Even  though no consumer wants to be in the dark about newer and cheaper  services, the FCC's rules actually make it more difficult for customers  to hear about new, innovative offerings from their broadband providers.  And because the FCC imposed heavy-handed data requirements on these  internet companies, they will have less ability to offer services that  are tailored to their customers' needs and interests. Furthermore, the  FCC unfairly distorted the marketplace when it imposed unnecessarily  onerous privacy restrictions on broadband providers while leaving the  rest of the internet under the strong and successful regime at the FTC.   When speaking about the economic opportunities the internet now  affords us, President Obama's last FCC chairman declared that  ``government is where we will work this out.''   ``Government is where we will work this out.''   Well, I couldn't disagree more. I believe the marketplace should be  the center of the debate over how our digital networks would function,  not the FCC. I believe consumers and job creators should be the ones  deciding about new technologies, not the government.   The resolution before us today is the first step toward restoring  regulatory balance to the internet ecosystem. The best way for that  balance to be achieved is for there to be a single, uniform set of  privacy rules for the internet--the entire internet--rules that  appropriately weigh the need to protect consumers with the need to  foster economic growth and continued online innovation.   The FCC is simply the wrong venue for that effort. Its statutory  scope is too narrow, and it lacks institutional expertise on privacy.  The current chairmen of the FCC and the FTC both recognize this, having  jointly called for returning jurisdiction over broadband providers'  privacy and data security practices to the FTC ``so that all entities  in the online space can be subject to the same rules.''   For those reasons, I support the resolution before us that would  provide congressional disapproval of the Obama administration's  misguided and unfair attempts to regulate the internet, and I encourage  my colleagues to support the resolution as well.   To those people who have heard that this resolution somehow results  in the elimination of all online protections for consumers, I can  assure you those  [[Page S1929]]  claims are simply unfounded scaremongering. If this resolution is  enacted, it will repeal only a specific rulemaking at the FCC that has  yet to be implemented. What we are talking about here hasn't even been  implemented yet. It will not touch the FCC's underlying statutory  authority. Indeed, the FCC will still be obligated to police the  privacy practices of broadband providers, as provided for in the  Communications Act. The new chairman of the FCC confirmed this when he  appeared before the Commerce Committee earlier this month. No matter  what happens with this resolution, the FTC will continue to have its  authority to police the rest of the online world.   It is my hope that once the Senate passes this resolution, the House  will move quickly to take it up and send it to the President for his  signature because, before our country can get back on the right track,  we must first move past the damaging regulations adopted in the waning  days of the Obama administration.   I thank Senator Flake for his leadership on this issue. Without his  tireless efforts, we would not be here today, standing ready to move  decisively toward a better future for the internet.   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that we will vote on  tomorrow at noon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Schatz and  Markey.
