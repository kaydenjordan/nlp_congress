 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a well-known  figure in our Orange County community, Margie Rice.   Rice served on the Westminster City Council for 22 years and as mayor  of Westminster for 12 of those years. Before that, she served as a  member of the Westminster School District Board of Trustees for 17\1/2\  years.   She dedicated her time to making life better for those she served and  was an outspoken force in our community. A cornerstone of her legacy is  the Rose Center Theater in Westminster, which she spearheaded and  secured funding for.   Rice is survived by two of her four children, 19 grandchildren, 23  great-grandchildren, and 12 great-great-grandchildren.   Margie Rice was a leader in Westminster for more than six decades,  and she will be so missed by family, friends, and our community.                            ____________________
