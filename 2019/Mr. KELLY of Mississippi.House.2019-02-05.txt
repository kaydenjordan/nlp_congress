 Mr. Speaker, today I would just like to  give thanks to be able to be here at this State of the Union to hear  about what our wonderful Nation is doing.   It is such an honor to be here, and to have the opportunity to be  present during one of these State of the Unions. But, Mr. Speaker, most  importantly, I want to recognize the men and women who are down range  today serving this great Nation, and who can't be here and probably  will never be afforded the opportunity to stand here in this great  House and hear the State of the Union.  [[Page H1356]]    Without those men and women in uniform who defend this Nation every  day, this Nation cannot exist and because of them, we will always be  the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth.   God bless you.                            ____________________
