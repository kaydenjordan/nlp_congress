 Mr. Speaker, in March, I introduced H.R. 1736, also known  as the Equality and Fiscal Accountability Protection Act of 2023.   This bill will cut off the cash faucet the U.S. Government gives away  to countries such as Uganda that persecutes, criminalizes, or  discriminates against individuals based on their sexual orientation.   Since June is Pride Month, I thought this bill would be a great way  to remind the American people and this body that the best way to  celebrate the history and achievements of gay rights is to stand up to  countries actively oppressing the LGBT community. Many countries are  light-years behind everything we have worked for to be treated civilly  and humanely in this country.   In fact, many countries are still persecuting their citizens for the  simple fact that they are gay. Uganda is just one of many countries  executing and prosecuting its people based on their sexual orientation;  however, they received hundreds of millions of dollars in 2022 alone  from President Biden's emergency plan for AIDS relief, or PEPFAR.   While waving rainbow flags and changing corporate logos is pleasant  enough lipservice and virtue signaling, we need to send a clear message  that the United States will not offer Federal aid to countries that  habitually violate basic human rights based on sexual orientation.   We, as a Nation, have a responsibility to stand up for the human  rights of all people, regardless of race, religion, or sexual  orientation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two of the best and  brightest of New York's Third Congressional District.   This week, hundreds of youth, ages 14 to 24, will gather in the  Capitol to celebrate their achievement of being Congressional Award  gold medalists.   Each gold medalist must complete over 400 hours of community service,  dedicate 200 hours to a personal development activity, 200 hours to a  physical fitness activity, and complete a 5-day, 4-night expedition or  exploration over at least 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize two from my district who rose to  meet this challenge: Namit Kapoor and Armaan Singh.   As a participant in the prestigious Senate Page Program, Mr. Kapoor  completed many of his requirements while balancing a workload of  courses beginning at 6:15 a.m. and long days on the Senate floor.   Singh is graduating next year and is looking to attend medical school  to give back to the community. His gold medal journey took him far and  wide, from a tae kwon do studio in Levittown to a glacier to the depths  of his own soul as he found his voice for writing poetry.    Both young men have bright futures, and they are stellar examples of  fine leadership in New York-03. I am proud to recognize them today.                            ____________________
