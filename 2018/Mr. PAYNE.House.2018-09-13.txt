 Mr. Speaker, this morning I met with the Prostate Health  Education Network and leaders from across the country who are on the  frontlines of the fight against prostate cancer.   It is critical for African American men and their families that  leaders like us raise awareness and funding to end the racial disparity  in prostate cancer research.   African American men are more likely to get prostate cancer, are  diagnosed at more advanced stages, and are twice as likely to die as  our Caucasian counterparts.   Fighting cancer requires sustained efforts at all levels to raise  awareness to ensure individuals and their families have quality and  affordable access to screening and treatment.   It is critical that Congress continues putting resources toward  ending racial disparity in prostate cancer and healthcare more  generally.                            ____________________
