 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3076, the  bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act.   Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to  establish post offices and to make all laws which shall be necessary  and proper for executing that task. Yes, the U.S. Postal Service, like  the Department of Defense, is a constitutionally created entity.   As a lawyer and longtime small business owner and publisher of a  direct mailed newspaper, the importance of access to our unique system  of universal mail via the United States Postal Service is a game  changer.   Affordable and reliable mail service has given small businesses and  entrepreneurs a level playing field that would be eliminated if the  Postal Service were to be replaced by other more expensive private  options.   Seniors and vulnerable citizens rely on the Postal Service for access  to prescriptions. Small businesses and farmers rely on the post office  to provide reliable and affordable daily delivery. Families across  America, and especially rural America, need the Postal Service to stay  connected here and around the world.   This bill ensures the U.S. Postal Service can continue delivering  universal mail services for years to come by alleviating financial  burdens and increasing transparency and accountability.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
