 Mr. President, today I would like  to take a moment to recognize and honor the life of a great South  Carolinian, Lt. Col. John A. Means, U.S. Air Force (Ret.), of  Summerville.   John was born on a farm in Kansas on December 11, 1918. In his  lifetime, he witnessed many remarkable social changes, technological  advancements, and international developments that transformed the  world.   He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and became a pilot in  1943. In 1950, he was called to Active Duty and was deployed to Korea  as part of the 6147th Squadron, known as the Mosquitoes. John served in  Washington, DC, with the Special Air Missions, SAM, unit, flying  dignitaries at home and abroad in Air Force Two. During his time in the  SAM outfit, he flew Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon, Charles Lindbergh,  and many others.   He then retired from the military in 1965 with the rank of lieutenant  colonel and moved his family to Summerville, SC. After returning to  civilian life, he worked as a mechanical engineer at Avcco and as a  machine operator at Bosch. He also owned and operated his own service  station.   John served his community as a member of the Masons for over 75  years, Scottish Rite, Shriners, and was also president of the Lions  Club of Summerville. He also served on the board of directors as vice  president of Charleston Mental Health, was an active booster of the  Summerville High School Marching Band, and was a founding member and  Elder of Dorchester Presbyterian Church.   Though Mr. Means has left us, his legacy will continue to live on in  the hearts of many. Mr. Means' patriotism, integrity, dedication, and  commitment to serve his country are an inspiration to us all. He will  not be forgotten, and I am certain South Carolina will continue to  benefit from his labors for generations to come.                            ____________________
