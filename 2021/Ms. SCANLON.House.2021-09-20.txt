 Madam Speaker, in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was asked what  type of government our founders had created with the U.S. Constitution,  and his response was: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''   Why? Because representative democracy is not for the lazy or the  faint of heart. American democracy relies upon an informed, engaged  citizenry. We require immigrants to pass a difficult test when they  become citizens, but we currently require little to ensure that our  children are prepared for that role.   I have been a proponent of civics education for my entire life, and  it is more important than ever to help our schools provide high quality  civic education. Our young people need to understand how government  works; how they can effectively advocate for themselves and their  communities; and how to navigate the masses of disinformation found  online.   Last Friday, on Constitution Day, I introduced a bipartisan bill with  Representative Meijer, the Teaching Engaged Citizenship Act, to promote  high-quality, evidence-based civic education and service learning  programs in K-12 public schools.   Our Constitution has a rich, complicated history. If we want to keep  it, we need to teach it.                            ____________________
