 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman  Shuster, Subcommittee Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Members DeFazio and  Larsen, and their staff for the effort and work they put in to quickly  see this measure through this committee. They do an excellent job, and  it is always encouraging to work with such bright people. I also want  to thank Leader McCarthy and his staff for their assistance in getting  this measure to the floor. I look forward to working under their  leadership to bring prosperity to the American people, including those  in the territories.   Mr. Speaker, the people of American Samoa desperately need  improvement to their access to reliable transportation between the  islands of Tutuila and Manu'a. The remote Manu'a islands are losing  residents at an alarming pace, mostly due to the lack of reliable  transportation; and it is causing a great hardship on the families and  businesses who reside on these islands which lie 60 miles from the main  island of Tutuila.   Also, the lack of reliable transportation poses a severe health risk  to those who need emergency medical care, as the only hospital in  American Samoa is in Tutuila.   My bill, H.R. 276, will help alleviate this issue by easing some of  the burdensome red tape causing the issue, and I look forward to seeing  it signed into law by the President.
