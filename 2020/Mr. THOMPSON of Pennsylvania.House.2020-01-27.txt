 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to observe  International Holocaust Remembrance Day, commemorating the 75th  anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.   The Holocaust is responsible for the systematic murder of more than 6  million Jews, and it is remembered as one of the darkest periods of  modern history.   In the wake of this tragedy, we often utter the words, ``never  forget.'' But, as time passes and memory fades, this can become a  challenge.   We have a responsibility, however, to ensure that this chapter of  history does not slip through the cracks. Through storytelling, the  teaching of history, and great organizations like the Holocaust Museum  right here in Washington, we can do our part to ensure younger  generations truly never forget.   Today, I ask my colleagues to pause and remember the pain caused by  the  [[Page H556]]  Holocaust and the Nazi regime in Europe. I ask that we recommit  ourselves to pursuing liberty and justice for all people across the  globe.   The horrors of genocide still pervade the world today. We can honor  the memory of the Holocaust victims by speaking and acting out against  the perpetrators of such evil today and for years to come.                            ____________________
