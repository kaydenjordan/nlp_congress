 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown wrestling coach,  Pat Pecora, on his recent record-breaking meet.   On Friday, February 7, Coach Pecora led the Panthers to victory with  a 22-12 win over Mercyhurst. This win was Pecora's 617th, and it  snapped nearly a five-decade-long record for most wins in college  wrestling at any level or division. Pat Pecora has led his team to two  Division II national championships over the years, as well as 22 NCAA  regional titles.   Coach Pecora's commitment to the sport has not gone unnoticed. He has  been named Coach of the Year by the National Wrestling Coaches  Association three times, most recently in 2019.   Pennsylvania is a national leader in wrestling. It is a passion that  is woven throughout the Commonwealth's history. Coach Pecora's  leadership and coaching record at Pitt-Johnstown is one to be proud of.   Congratulations, Coach, on this fantastic achievement.                            ____________________
