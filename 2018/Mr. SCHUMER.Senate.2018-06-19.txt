 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Members of both parties--and I believe  the vast majority of Americans--remain concerned about the Trump  administration's zero tolerance policy, which has resulted in thousands  of families being separated at the border. Anyone who has seen the  photos, heard the audio of small children, alone and afraid, crying out  for their parents, cannot help but feel horror and disgust about what  is going on. That is not America. That is not the America we know and  love and the generations before us have known and loved.   Clearly, no one should be allowed into this country who doesn't meet  the legal requirements, but we have an adjudication process that in the  past did not require the separation of parents from their children. The  Trump administration has decided, of its own will and volition, to take  a crueler, more callous, and indeed more expensive and time-consuming  approach.   A bipartisan group of former U.S. attorneys wrote yesterday that  ``the Zero Tolerance policy is a radical departure from previous  Justice Department policy, and that it is dangerous, expensive, and  inconsistent with the values of the institution in which we served.''   Yet President Trump acts as if his hands are tied, as if it is not up  to him, as if somehow Congress and Democrats are to blame for a policy  his administration instituted, defended, and many members of the  administration continue to defend--most recently the Homeland Security  Secretary.   The truth is that the Trump administration announced this new zero  tolerance policy at the border in April. Even they hadn't done it  before that, so they weren't required. The Trump administration decided  to criminally prosecute every single illegal border case, instead of  simply deporting them. That is what changed--Donald Trump, of his own  volition, changing the policy into a much crueler one. He was supported  by his whole administration--by much of his administration.   Chief of Staff Kelly called the policy ``a tough deterrent.''  Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielson has defended the  policy, as have Attorney General Sessions, White House Advisor Stephen  Miller, and several other members of the administration.   Last night on FOX News, Attorney General Sessions characterized the  family separation policy as a deterrent. When President Trump tweets  ``CHANGE THE LAWS'' and that his policy is the result of a law that  ``Democrats forced . . . upon our nation,'' he is ignoring reality; he  is contradicting his own administration. As commentator after  commentator--Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative--has said:  President Trump is simply not telling the truth, and in a cowardly way.   No law--no law--requires the separation of families at the border.  That is just not true.   At the Republican convention, President Trump said about the problems  of the Nation that ``I alone can fix it.'' In the case of family  separation, it is actually true.   Mr. President, you alone can fix it.   The President alone can fix this with a flick of a pen.   Mr. President, you should fix it. If you don't want to change this  cruel policy, at least admit it is your decision. Blaming others  falsely is cheap, easy, and dishonest--a cheap way out, unbecoming of  any President.   President Trump, if you are truly ashamed of what is happening at the  border, get your team together and undo this policy. If you don't want  to  [[Page S4013]]  change the policy, you need to take responsibility and own up to it.                                     ZTE    Madam President, on ZTE, last night, the Senate passed the National  Defense Authorization Act, fulfilling its annual duty to authorize  funding for our Nation's military and update our national security  policy. As a part of the bill, a bipartisan amendment to reinstate  sanctions against Chinese telecom giant ZTE passed as well.   Although many have probably not heard of ZTE, Americans of all  stripes should be cheering this news because in the views of many  experts, if we allow ZTE into this country, China and its government  will use our phones to spy on each of us, our companies, with their  great technology, and our military. That is why so many people are  against ZTE being allowed into this country. In my view, the same would  be true of Huawei, the other big Chinese telecom company.   ZTE, backed by China's Government, has flouted U.S. sanctions and  lied about it. The FCC, the FBI, and the Pentagon have all issued stern  warnings about the national risk posed by ZTE's technology. Allowing  the sale of ZTE technology in the United States could allow China to  spy on every American's private information, on American businesses,  and even on our military. It is a security risk.   Why is President Trump, in a simple call with President Xi, just  letting it continue? Fines don't matter at all to this giant company.  They will still pose the same security risk before and after they pay a  fine.   When the Trump administration reached a sweetheart deal with ZTE to  go easy on them, folks in Congress from both parties were shaking their  heads in disbelief. China is the single most significant threat to  American jobs and American intellectual property--the lifeblood of our  economy. ZTE represents that threat. There is no good reason to take it  easy on them.   It is important that Members of both parties--some of the most  conservative Members of this body, some of the most liberal Members of  this body, and everyone in between--have stood up and said that we  shouldn't be forgiving ZTE. It is now vital that our House colleagues  keep this bipartisan provision in the national defense bill as it heads  toward a conference. They should not let the pressure of President  Trump, who simply doesn't know how to negotiate--President Xi flatters  him, and he gives in on something vital to national security. They  should not let President Trump pressure them into reducing American  security, both economic and defense. They should not let President  Trump pressure them into allowing ZTE to spy on every one of us, which  they could very well do.   Before moving on, I want to take a moment to thank Senators Cotton  and Rubio for working with Senator Van Hollen and me and the rest of us  on this issue. My friends on the other side of the aisle--it is harder  for them to oppose the President than it is for us--had the courage of  their convictions not only to speak out but also to support this  legislation, despite the opposition of their party's President.   It is rare, indeed, when Schumer, Van Hollen, Rubio, and Cotton issue  a joint statement, but on this issue, we all agree. It is an issue that  transcends party and concerns the vital national security interests of  this great United States of America. I am very glad that for the sake  of the country, we were able to come together and pass this amendment.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, on healthcare, today, we expect the Trump  administration to issue a new rule that would expand junk insurance  plans that don't cover critical conditions and are far from  comprehensive health coverage. These plans may not include coverage for  maternity care, may not include coverage for mental health treatment,  may not include coverage for emergency services, newborn care,  prescription drugs. Worse still, these plans weaken protections for  Americans with preexisting conditions. Finalizing this rule is simply  the latest act of sabotage of our healthcare system by the Trump  administration and a back door to expanding junk insurance plans, which  benefit the insurance industry but hurt the average American.   That is why more than 95 percent of the healthcare groups that filed  comments about this proposed rule were opposed to it. No single group  that represents physicians, patients, hospitals, or nurses is  supportive. Not one. You are always going to find people who can make a  fast buck putting together a healthcare plan that does very little for  people as they collect money from them. Our responsibility is to not  allow that. In this Congress, we had done that. President Trump is  undoing it.   The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress should work with  Democrats in a bipartisan way to make healthcare more affordable  instead of taking actions that jack up costs on middle-class families  and those who are sick and need healthcare the most.   I yield the floor.
