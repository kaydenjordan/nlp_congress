 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add my  colleague, Senator Brown from Ohio, as a cosponsor to S.J. Res. 68.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about President Trump's  veto of S.J. Res. 68, a veto that he communicated to the Senate by a  statement yesterday afternoon. We debated this at length in February.  So there is no need to spend too much time on the substance.   I was proud of the resolution, cosponsoring it in a bipartisan way,  to assert the importance of the Senate. I very much appreciated hearing  my colleague from Oklahoma talk about the importance of the Senate. The  debate that we had in February about S.J. Res. 68 was about the  importance of Congress in one of the most important responsibilities we  have, whether or not the Nation would go to war.   We specified in that resolution that except to defend the Nation  against attack or imminent attack, the United States would not be  engaged in war with the government of Iran absent a congressional vote.  It passed this body by a healthy bipartisan margin and also passed the  House by a bipartisan margin. The President has vetoed S.J. Res. 68,  and the next vote at 1:30 will be on whether to override the veto. I  know what the votes will be because we have already voted on this once.   I want to just focus for a minute on the President's veto statement,  which I think is instructive. When he vetoed S.J. Res. 68, this was his  primary reason--the first thing he said:         This was a very insulting resolution introduced by       Democrats as part of a strategy to win an election on       November 3 by dividing the Republican Party. The few       Republicans who voted for it played right into their hands.    What I find so notable about that statement is that the President  could not see Congress expressing an opinion about war through any lens  other than himself and his reelection on November 3. As everyone in  this Chamber knows, the bill was not a partisan bill. It was introduced  with an even number of bipartisan Senators. It was not part of a  strategy to hurt President Trump. I have advocated these same  positions, as have other Members of this body, under Presidents who  were both Democrat and Republican. The Republican Senators and  Democratic Senators who voted for it and those who voted against it had  particular views about the allocation of constitutional war powers, but  in no way was this partisan, and in no way was it part of a strategy  dealing with the November 3 election.   For President Trump to look at a matter of war and peace and the  Constitutional obligations of Congress through the lens of the November  election, frankly, shocked me.   The President, later in the statement, said:         The United States is not engaged in the use of force       against Iran.    Let's be clear. The U.S. military engaged in military action that  wiped out Iran's top military commander. If any other Nation did that  to our Secretary of Defense or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  would we call that a use of force against the United States? Of course  we would. As for the strike against General Soleimani, you might say it  was a great thing. The President advocated for it. No one is sad that  General Soleimani does not exist. But rather than justifying it as a  necessity, the President says it was not a use of force against Iran.   The President goes on to say that the strike was justified by law,  citing article II of the Constitution--we had some debates about that,  obviously--but also citing the Iraq war resolution of 2002. I have not  heard anyone assert that as a justification for killing an Iranian  leader. That resolution, which is now essentially dead letter, was  designed to topple the government of Saddam Hussein, and to use that as  a resolution to attack members of the Iranian Government is a stretch.   Finally, the President says:         We live in a hostile world of evolving threats, and the       Constitution recognizes that the President must be able to       anticipate our adversary's next moves and take swift and       decisive action and response.    He concludes:         Congress should not have passed this resolution.    You cannot tell the article I branch how to do its job. We can't tell  the article II branch how to do its job. But for the President to say  it is insulting for Congress to take up matters of war and peace and  that we should not have passed the resolution, to me, demonstrates a  fundamental misunderstanding of the importance of the article I branch.   We are not an article 2\1/2\ branch, and we are not required to play  ``Mother May I'' with the President. We have our own independent  responsibilities that we swear to uphold.   S.J. Res. 68, in my view, was a great example of coming together in a  bipartisan way to uphold those responsibilities. I urge my colleagues  to vote to override President Trump's veto of the resolution    I yield the floor.
