 Mr. President, today I wish in tribute to  Lieutenant Colonel Michael Healey of the British Royal Artillery  Regiment, a great gunner, an officer of the highest quality, a British  patriot, and a beloved friend of Oklahoma and America.   On June 29, we lost Mike Healey at the age of 67 after a 4-year  battle with cancer. Just as in life, he faced his last fight with  courage and vigor, without complaint, and with that famous British  stiff upper lip. Mike was taken from us too soon, but his memory will  be with us always, and his service will live on as a testament to the  bonds of affection and friendship that still animate the special  relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.   Mike spent a lot of time in my State during the 1980s, 1990s, and  early 2000s at a little place called Fort Sill, in Lawton, OK. Many of  you know that Fort Sill is the home of the U.S. Army Field Artillery  and Air Defense Artillery.   Major Mike Healey first came to Fort Sill in January 1988 to replace  Major Ian Dowdswell as the british exchange instructor in the field  artillery advanced course, which is now called the captains career  course.   Mike was already very experienced as a major in the British Artillery  and brought that tactical and technical knowledge to share with U.S.  students and faculty. He made it through the instructor ``murder  boards'' in record time, as he had been an instructor in his own Army.  He very quickly grasped the American acronyms and organization for  combat. Mike did a fantastic job as an instructor and was respected by  his students and colleagues.   Mike came back to Fort Sill in 1997, after a promotion to lieutenant  colonel, and became the British liaison officer to the U.S. Field  Artillery. He represented the British Army exceptionally well in all  aspects of the new position. One of the main reasons he was promoted  and was allowed to return to America so soon was that he spoke  ``American'' so well.   Lieutenant Colonel Healey returned for a third time to Oklahoma in  2005 to be, once again, the British LNO to the U.S. Field Artillery  School but with the added responsibility of also serving as the British  air defense artillery liaison officer. LTG Dave Valcourt was the  commanding general of Fort Sill at the time, and specifically requested  that the British Army send Mike back to Fort Sill for yet another tour  to help guide the base through a critical period as it absorbed the  U.S. Army ADA School from Fort Bliss.   Lieutenant Colonel Healey's combat theater service gave him immediate  credibility with his American comrades in arms. Mike served in the  Falklands War with British forces in 1984 and in Iraq alongside  American units in 1991. In addition to his combat credentials, he  coordinated joint/combined Cold War exercises and security procedures,  working with Americans in Germany in 1979 and 1990 and in Turkey in  1996.   As a truly solemn and high-visibility assignment, Mike commanded the  Queen's Guard at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, marching the men down  the Royal Mile to Holyrood Castle, followed by dinner with the Queen in  1983.   Mike was a graduate of Sandhurst Military Academy, the Royal Field  Artillery School at Larkhill, and earned a master's degree at  Schrivenham. He also had a BA in economics from Manchester University.   His military awards include the U.S. Army Field Artillery Association  St. Barbara's Medal, the U.S. Army Meritorious Service Medal, the  British Gulf War Medal, and the Queen Elizabeth Golden Jubilee Medal  for special recognition during the commemoration of the Queen's 50th  year on the throne.   Lieutenant Colonel Healey's greatest satisfaction and proudest  moment, by his own admission, was when he authored, staffed, and  presented a new Ministry of Defense Command policy to House of Commons  on ensuring military members were not forgotten once they left the  military and that their sacrifices were acknowledged in the civilian  world with special accommodations.   He and his wife, Mo, were the consummate hosts at numerous official  functions they personally planned and catered at Fort Sill, to include  their memorable farewell bash in 2007 at the Polo Field.   Mike Healey loved America, Oklahoma, and the U.S. Army Field  Artillery. He was constantly amazed by the wide-open spaces in the  American West, the 300-plus sunny days per year, and how friendly the  people were.   Mike unabashedly adopted the United States as his second home and  voluntarily spent nearly a third of his military career in Oklahoma.   In fact, he thought so much of this great land that he specifically  requested Old Glory be draped across his casket next to the Union Jack  at his military funeral, which will be on July 19 in Thirsk, England. I  am personally requesting that an American flag be flown over the  Capitol in honor of Mike Healey and his service, not just to his own  country but also for his service to our country. That flag will then be  transported to England for the burial by Lieutenant General Valcourt,  Retired, who will also deliver a portion of Mike's eulogy.   With this extraordinary request, Mike performed one last act of  service by reminding his British compatriots and his American friends  of our proud history and all that we still have to achieve together.   In January 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt sent Harry Hopkins as  his personal envoy to meet Prime Minister Winston Churchill. At dinner  one night, Hopkins rose and quoted from the Book of Ruth: ``Whither  thou goest I will go, and whither thou lodgest I will lodge. Thy people  shall be my people, and thy God my God.'' He then added, ``even to the  end.'' Mike Healey lived those words. He saw firsthand why Americans  love their country, and he became a true ``forward observer'' of the  American dream. We are all better off for knowing Mike, and we will  never forget all he has done for the U.S. Army, the Field Artillery  School, the State of Oklahoma, and the United States of  America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  service of an Oklahoma native and proud Marine officer upon completing  22 years of dedicated service to our great Nation. Lt. Col. Michelle  Heath was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in  April 1997 and has dedicated her career to the selfless service of our  country.   Throughout the course of her career, Lieutenant Colonel Heath  supported numerous operations both stateside and overseas. During her  first tour at Camp Lejeune with 8th Motor Transport Battalion,  Lieutenant Colonel Heath deployed as the motor transport detachment  commander. After completion of this deployment, in May 2000, she was  assigned as the assistant logistics officer to Marine Aircraft Group- 14, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point.   Follow-on assignments included duty as the 2d Marine Aircraft Wing  Antiterrorism Officer, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point followed  by time with Mobilization Plans and Policy, Manpower and Reserve  Affairs, Marine Corps Base Quantico. During this time she was directly  involved with the mobilization of Marine Corps Reserve units in support  of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In June 2006,  [[Page S4804]]  Lieutenant Colonel Heath deployed to Iraq to serve with Marine Wing  Support Squadron-473 as a logistics officer.   In 2013, Lieutenant Colonel Heath attended the Naval Command and  Staff course at the Naval War College. Upon graduation, she served as  the operational sponsor for Marine for Life, Manpower and Reserve  Affairs in Quantico, VA. In this capacity, she sought to ensure that  all Marines maintained a connection to the Corps, regardless of their  stage in life. Lieutenant Colonel Heath continued her service to the  Nation when she joined the operational sponsor for the Readiness  Support Program, Marine Corps Individual Reserve Support Activity,  Marine Forces Reserve, New Orleans, LA.   Since 2016, Lieutenant Colonel Heath has served in the Office of  Legislative Affairs, Headquarters, Marine Corps, Pentagon. In this  capacity, she has worked tirelessly while balancing military,  political, and budgetary priorities for the Congress.   Upon retirement, Lieutenant Colonel Heath will return to the great  State of Oklahoma and will reside in Norman, OK. On behalf of my  colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I want to personally thank  Lieutenant Colonel Heath for her more than two decades of service to  the Marine Corps and our Nation, and I wish her well in her future  endeavors.                            ____________________
