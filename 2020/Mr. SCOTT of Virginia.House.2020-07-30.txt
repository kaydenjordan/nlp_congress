 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my two  amendments to H.R. 7617.   My first amendment is offered with Virginia Representatives Wittman,  Luria, and Beyer and reflects the need to adequately fund the important  work done at Jefferson Lab.   JLab conducts primary research in subatomic particles, but the $2  million included in this year's bill falls short of the $9 million  needed to move forward with the renovation and expansion to JLab, which  the Department of Energy has already approved.   I also rise in support of my amendment offered with Virginia  Representatives Wittman, McEachin, Luria, Spanberger, and Wexton in  regard to the urgent need for robust funding for the U.S. Corps of  Engineers for coastal construction projects. The Port of Virginia and  the Corps of Engineers have already undertaken the dredging, widening,  and deepening of the Norfolk Harbor to enable safe and efficient two- way passage of the new larger container ships. The project will require  additional funds and a New Start designation to keep the projected  timeline intact.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting additional funding to  keep both of these essential projects moving forward and on schedule.
