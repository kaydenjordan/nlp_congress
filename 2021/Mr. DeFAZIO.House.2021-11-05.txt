 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5376, the Build  Back Better Act. By passing this landmark legislation, House Democrats  are making lasting investments in the American people, our  infrastructure, and are lowering taxes for working families across this  country.   It fights inflation. It is fully paid for. We accomplished this by  making sure big corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share,  all while creating hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs that don't  require a college degree. It is no wonder why this bill is popular with  a strong majority of Americans and very unpopular with the Republican  minority.   As chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I  am particularly proud that the Build Back Better Act will provide a  vital down payment in the fight against climate change. The  transportation sector is the largest source of carbon pollution.  Important investments in my committee, and others, included in this  bill to decarbonize transportation will address the climate crisis with  the urgency it deserves, something I have been pushing for a long time.   The nearly $40 billion from the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure will support climate investments by reducing carbon  emissions from surface transportation, aviation, ports, and public  buildings; ensure critical transportation connections to affordable  housing and reconnect bisected neighborhoods; robustly fund high-speed  rail; supply ports as they struggle with the supply chain crisis; and  ensure climate-resilient and affordable investments in our wastewater  infrastructure.   For working families, the Build Back Better Act will provide  universal pre-K, childcare, lower healthcare costs, and establish a  permanent program of 4 weeks paid family medical leave. It makes  historic investments in housing and includes provisions to ensure  affordable pricing for certain prescription drugs. This legislation  also includes investments in tax enforcement to catch the tax cheats,  the wealthiest tax cheats in America. Again, the Republicans don't much  like that part of the bill.   It should be clear: The Build Back Better Act will lower costs for  families, put money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans,  create hundreds of thousands of family-wage jobs, and good benefits.   By passing this bill, along with the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act, we are truly catapulting Americans into the modern era,  making the largest investments to combat climate change in American  history.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  2110
