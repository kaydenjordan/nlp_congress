 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish happy birthday to Rose  Bayuk, who turns 105 on November 2. Rose served as a nurse during World  War II and dedicated much of her life to caring for others.   She grew up in Buhl, Minnesota. In 1938, Rose graduated from Khaler  School of Nursing in Rochester, Minnesota. Her diploma was signed and  presented to her by the famous Mayo brothers themselves.   Upon graduating, she moved to California to begin her career. Shortly  after moving, Pearl Harbor was attacked, and Rose decided to serve her  country by enlisting in the Army Nurse Corps.   During the war, Rose made several crossings across the Atlantic on an  English ocean liner, bringing home wounded from Italy, France, and  North Africa.   After her service, Rose continued a life of service by becoming a  school nurse, and eventually the head of a nursing home.   Rose now lives in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, where she stays active  by going to the gym and playing bridge.   Rose, thank you for your incredible service to our country, and I  wish you the happiest of birthdays.                      Celebrating Lifestone Health Care     Mr. Speaker, during National Small Business Week, I rise  to honor Dr. Chiamaka Enemuoh, the owner of Lifestone Health Care, a  business located in Proctor, Minnesota, that is dedicated to providing  compassionate and reliable medical care for clients in a home-like  setting.   Lifestone opened in 2014 as a 2,000-foot house with five employees.  Thanks to the strong leadership of its owner, Dr. Enemuoh, Lifestone  staff and capacity doubled by 2016, allowing them to serve more in the  community. In addition to her work at Lifestone, Dr. Enemuoh enjoys  serving as a mentor to young African-American women in the community  and volunteers much of her time at organizations like the Duluth Area  Chamber of Commerce and African Women's Group.   Due to the valuable services this business provides to the Northland  and the dedication of Dr. Enemuoh, the Small Business Association  recently named Lifestone Health Care as the 2020 Minnesota Minority- Owned Small Business of the Year.   Thank you to Dr. Enemuoh and the entire staff at Lifestone Health  Care for providing excellent healthcare to the residents of Minnesota's  Eighth Congressional District. Your commitment to our community serves  as an inspiration to all.   Mr. Speaker, entrepreneurs like Dr. Enemuoh are absolutely invaluable  to our society. And as we continue to celebrate Small Business Week, we  must also reinforce our commitment to empowering entrepreneurs like Dr.  Enemuoh who create jobs, provide valuable services, and help drive our  economy.                            ____________________
