 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Jerry Kang,  President Biden's nominee to serve on the National Foundation on the  Arts and Humanities.   As you know, the foundation serves sectors of our economy that  continue to face tremendous need and uncertainty in the wake of the  pandemic.   During this trying time, it is critically important that we confirm  qualified individuals who are eager to serve and support.   This nomination has been reviewed by the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions on a bipartisan basis, and we are  waiting on the Senate to confirm him so he can get to work.   It is past time that we confirm qualified nominees so that the  Federal Government has a team in place--the team that it needs to  operate and support our constituents.   As an ex-officio member of the National Council on the Arts, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 729, Jerry Kang, of California, to be a Member of the  National Council on the Humanities for a term expiring January 26,  2026; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action  or debate; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table; and that any statements related to the nomination be  printed in the Record.    Mr. President, not only did Jerry Kang get recommended  by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on a  bipartisan basis, but he is a scholar and has a very important  reputation.  [[Page S1858]]    Half of his work deals with communication and the internet on matters  such as privacy and pervasive computing and virtual communities. The  other half, by his own description, deals with civil rights and race.  And he is probably best known for his works on implicit bias.   These are critical topics, and we should be eager to have somebody of  Professor Kang's caliber and commitment on the Foundation on the Arts  and Humanities, and so I am certainly disappointed to hear the  objection from the Republican side.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations: Nos. 820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825,  826, 827, 828, 829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836, 837, 838, 839,  840, and 841, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Air  Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Space Force; that the nominations  be confirmed, en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that  no further motions be in order to any of the nominations; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 570, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  [[Page S1860]]  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 571, submitted earlier today.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3969, which was introduced  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 314, S. Res.  547.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 274, S. 442.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.
