 Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the  need to expand mental health services for children in the United  States. More than 20 percent of parents with children aged 5-12 years  reported that their children experienced worsened mental or emotional  health as a result of the pandemic. In Virginia, one in five children  experience symptoms of a mental health disorder. Schools, childcare  settings, and communities are in need of additional support to address  the needs of our Nation's children and families.   Early identification and intervention for emotional or behavioral  disorders for infants and young children may help to prevent more  severe mental health issues in later youth and adulthood. That is why  Senator Collins and I are introducing the Investing in Infant and Early  Childhood Mental Health Act to reauthorize the Infant and Early  Childhood Mental Health--IECMH--program through the Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA. First  [[Page S7254]]  authorized in 2016 under the 21st Century Cures Act, the goal of the  IECMH program is to improve outcomes for children, from birth up to 12  years of age, by developing, maintaining, or enhancing infant and early  childhood mental health promotion, intervention, and treatment  services.   Since 2018, SAMHSA has provided $20 million in funding to support  infant and early childhood mental health programs across the country.  This funding has been used to train the mental health workforce and  provide screenings and referrals for evidence-based mental health  services for children and families. To date, grantees have trained  nearly 10,000 mental health professionals and screened over 17,000  children and families.   Reauthorizing the IECMH program will allow SAMSHA to continue this  important work to address childhood mental health through fiscal year  2027. The bill also includes a $30 million increase in funding to  expand these services and would allow SAMSHA to provide technical  assistance to grantees, either directly or through grants or contracts  to nonprofit entities. Language to reauthorize the IECMH program was  included in the Supporting Children's Mental Health Care Access Act of  2022 introduced by Representatives Kim Schrier and Mariannette Miller- Meeks, which was included in the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and  Well-Being Act that passed out of the House in June 2022. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill so we can continue to address the  mental health crisis among our children.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 5274. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to reinstate  criminal penalties for persons charging veterans unauthorized fees  relating to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.
