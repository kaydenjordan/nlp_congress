 Mr. Chairman, I join Chairman Price in  strong opposition to this amendment. Two years ago, HUD removed  guidance that was meant to ensure our transgender community members are  able to access emergency housing or homeless shelters.   House Democrats stood up against this assault on LGBTQ Americans, and  HUD Secretary Ben Carson assured us that the removal of this guidance  was only temporary.   Later this spring, Secretary Carson testified that we should not be  pressing for guidance or pressing him on this issue because we wouldn't  like the answer that HUD would provide.                                time  1615    In other words, HUD stood ready to explicitly allow or promote LGBTQ  discrimination.   Discrimination in any form for any amount of time is reprehensible  and unacceptable, and now we have an amendment before us that would  make housing discrimination permanent. It would continue the  uncertainty around LGBTQ protections and make vulnerable people's lives  harder.   Let's remember what is at stake. One in three transgender people have  experienced homelessness, and we know that homelessness in the LGBTQ  community overwhelmingly impacts our young people.   Right now, there are approximately 350,000 transgender people under  the age of 25 in the U.S., and it is estimated that over 20 percent of  them lack secure housing.   Through the appropriations process, House Democrats have put in place  protections for transgender Americans and have taken the proactive step  of protecting the rights of LGBTQ individuals in emergency housing  intervention situations.   No American seeking refuge and safety should be kicked to the curb.  No one should be discriminated against, especially not in a time of  dire need.   Mr. Chairman, I urge every Member of this body to reject this  amendment, reject discrimination, and reject the Trump administration's  and Secretary Carson's cruel rollback of LGBTQ protections.
