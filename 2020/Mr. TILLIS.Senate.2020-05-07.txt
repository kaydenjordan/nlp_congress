 Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself and Senator  Coons, we honor the life and legacy of The Honorable Q. Todd Dickinson.  Todd was a great friend to our offices, and we often relied on him for  impartial counsel as we endeavored to reform patent law. Todd was  incredibly generous with his time and his intimate knowledge of patent  law, and we will greatly miss him.   Todd had an immeasurable impact on our patent system during a career  spanning more than four decades. Todd served as the first  Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of  the Patent and Trademark Office from 1999 to 2001, where he transformed  the USPTO into a more modern and independent agency. Todd also served  as executive director of the American Intellectual Property Law  Association, where he played an essential role in the enactment of the  Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.   Todd is survived by his husband, Robert Atkins, and his brother, John  Dickinson. Our thoughts and prayers are with Todd's family during this  difficult time.                            ____________________
