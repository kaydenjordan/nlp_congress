 Mr. Speaker, this bill is worse than a sham. This bill is  worse than a sugar pill. This bill is downright ugly. It is poison. As  an emergency medicine doctor, I urge you to do no harm. I urge  everybody to do no harm.   Let's be clear: a vote for this bill is a vote for 24 million people  to lose their insurance. A vote for this bill is to add an age tax to  those 55 years old and older. A vote for this bill is raise out-of- pocket costs for everyone, with less coverage. A vote for this bill is  to take away guarantees for emergency care, medicine, mental health,  and maternity care. A vote for this bill is to allow private health  insurance companies to drop patients who have a preexisting illness.   How, you may ask? Let's say I see a patient with diabetes who doesn't  have health insurance. A private health insurance company can say: No,  we are not going to cover you. Why don't you go to the high-risk, high- cost State insurance pool that is way too expensive, with no guarantees  that they will cover what they need. Therefore, they won't be able to  afford it. They won't have coverage. They are going to go into  financial ruin. All of this is in order to give $6 billion in tax cuts  to the wealthiest.   I urge everybody to vote ``no.''
