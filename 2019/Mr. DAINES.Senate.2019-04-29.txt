 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Jo Laughlin and Doris McCorkindale for their impact on  Fergus County and surrounding areas.   Jo and Doris serve their local community as volunteers at the Central  Montana Community Cupboard. Folks all over the community are grateful  for the joy and light Jo and Doris bring to the families they serve.  They have set a great example for all Montanans with their time and  dedication as volunteers.   For over 20 years, Jo has tirelessly served in various capacities at  the Cupboard, as both a board member and volunteer. Her lighthearted  attitude and selfless nature brings joy to the people she serves. At 89  years old, Jo continues to serve as head volunteer, coordinating all  food orders and overseeing the day to day operations at the Cupboard.  [[Page S2483]]    Doris has served at the Cupboard as both a board member and volunteer  for almost 20 years. As volunteer coordinator, she works to ensure an  adequate number of volunteers are available to aid in daily operations.  At the age of 91, she is still committed to the families she serves and  does not intend to slow down anytime soon.   I applaud Jo and Doris for leading a life of excellence and serving  the struggling and the hungry of their community. Their commitment to  their fellow Montanans, as well as their happy optimism towards life,  is a shining example of the Montana spirit. Fergus County is lucky to  have these two incredible women in their community as selfless  leaders.                            ____________________
