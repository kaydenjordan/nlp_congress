 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate National School Choice  Week. Allowing parents to choose the best educational outcomes for  their children gives every child a better chance to succeed and  prepares students for their futures.   School choice has greatly benefited Arizona--from charter schools to  vocational schools, to private school scholarships, to education  savings accounts. I am grateful that my State is a national leader in  diverse school choice programs.   Arizona's scholarship tax credit program gives taxpayers a dollar- for-dollar tax credit to enable low-income and disabled children to  attend private schools. In Arizona, more children per capita attend  exemplary charter schools, and, indeed, they are some of the best  charter schools in the country. We have significantly expanded the  education savings account model so students can receive the best  education possible that meets their unique needs, including those of  tribal families who live in reservation communities.  [[Page H619]]    Arizona recognizes that all children are unique, that they learn  differently, and that each child should have the opportunity to attend  the school that will help him learn to love learning and succeed. I  hope other States will look at Arizona's example as they expand school  choice. I am pleased President Trump has made school choice a priority  by nominating Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education.                            ____________________
