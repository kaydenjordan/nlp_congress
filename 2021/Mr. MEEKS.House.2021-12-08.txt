 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H7499]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1155.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1155, the Uyghur Forced  Labor Prevention Act introduced by my good friend, colleague, and  chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern.   Let me also thank Speaker Pelosi for bringing this crucial measure to  the floor, and her unwavering dedication to human rights issues in  China over the course of her public life.   This necessary and bold measure reinforces this body's commitment to  our values by responding to the PRC's human rights violations and  imposing concrete costs on the PRC for the use of Uyghur forced labor.   Since 2017, the People's Republic of China has systematically carried  out mass detention, torture, political indoctrination, restrictions on  religious attractions, and inhumane atrocities against Uyghurs and  members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.   We have seen the People's Republic of China expand its extensive  program of repression and transform it into a system of state-sponsored  forced labor. Under the guise of vocational training or poverty  alleviation, authorities in Xinjiang have forced thousands of adults  and children to work against their will and under threat of punishment  to produce goods and raw materials that are then woven into  international supply chains and into our homes.   According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, it has been  conservatively estimated that more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred  out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between the years of  2017 and 2019, with some of them being sent directly from detention  centers. Some analysts estimate that over 100,000 ex-detainees in  Xinjiang are working in conditions of forced labor today.   I have seen firsthand the benefits of the American companies engaging  in China. Most American companies pay above-market wages and have  better corporate social responsibility practices than their domestic  counterparts. It would be inconsistent with core and crucial American  values for this body not to take a stand against forced labor, and to  stand up for the persecuted Uyghurs.   Many brave companies have already spoken out and made ethical choices  detrimental to their bottom line, and this bill ensures that corporate  actors that have lived their values are not at a competitive  disadvantage in the American marketplace.   This bill, which has passed the House before, prohibits the import of  goods and merchandise from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove the  products did not come from forced labor, imposes sanctions on officials  facilitating the use of forced labor against Chinese ethnic minorities,  adds important financial disclosures for public companies that do  business in the region, and calls for a diplomatic strategy to address  forced labor in Xinjiang.   This is a straightforward bill. It signals that forced labor has no  place on this planet. It signals that products made using forced labor  in Xinjiang have no place in the American marketplace. In 2021, for any  country to utilize forced labor systematically and to oppress and  exploit a population is simply unconscionable.   With the passage of this bipartisan measure, the House would hold  accountable those responsible for perpetrating these heinous crimes  that have irrevocably threatened the lives of over 1.8 million Uyghurs  and Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and ensure Americans and American  companies are not complicit in the Chinese Communist Party's human  rights atrocities.   This legislation is critical to showing that we are putting human  rights at the center of our foreign policy and economic policy. Mr.  Speaker, I support and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of New York (Mr. Suozzi), who is on the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I proudly yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from the great State of Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I proudly yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from the great State of Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am happy that this bipartisan effort dealing with the Uyghur Forced  Labor Prevention Act is an opportunity for this body to send a  resounding message to the world that we are engaged in a strategic  competition with China around the world. And our stance on this issue,  I believe, will define why our system is better.   But I must reply to some comments.   One, the comment that President Biden is holding us up. Well, I am  the chair of this committee, he has never told me to hold up anything.  In fact, he wants to move forward.   In fact, it is President Biden who has sanctioned officials  responsible for genocide and issued supply chain advisories in  Xinjiang.   The fact of the matter is, I think our bill is far superior. You go  to the Senate side, the Senate says, this should take 300 days to stop.  Our bill says 120 days.   For me, this is a personal situation. So I would wish that some of my  colleagues who, rightfully, want to make sure that we send a strong  message to the world that we are not going to stand for genocide. We  are not going to stand for slave labor.   But it is best if they would join us about injustice in America. It  is best if we fought together to make sure that when President Trump  talked about a Muslim ban in the United States of America--that wasn't  Joe Biden--we can't do it in America. That is the best way to lead.                                time  1400    When we talk about moving, I want to condemn it everywhere. Dr. King  said: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.   We should lead by example collectively. We should lead by going  forward with voting rights. We should lead by talking about reparations  for those who were enslaved in America. We should lead by talking about  the genocide that took place to Native Americans. We should lead by  talking about the injustice in housing. We should lead by talking about  civil rights.   So we have got to come together and stop it everywhere, and that is  what this bill does. It sends a strong message. I want to be that  example.   This just happens to be personal, so I had to say it. I don't like to  put politics in these things, but I do like to tell the truth.   Mr. Speaker, we have got to work together. I want to thank especially  Mr. McCaul. I have got to say this, too, in closing. I have got to say  this in closing, because Mr. McCaul is my friend, and we work very  closely together. I know his spirit and his heart, and he stands up. I  look forward on this committee to continue to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I just have these last remarks.   I also want to thank Mr. Smith. As indicated by the Speaker, from the  time that I have been in Congress, his focus has been on human rights  around the world. As the Speaker indicated, and as I indicated with Mr.  McCaul and you will see coming up with these other bills, we have  worked collectively, leaving politics out of it, focused on leading the  world. That is what I look forward to, locking arms, sending that  message around the world that we are not going to allow slave labor to  flourish and to exist on this planet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 837) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the International Olympic Committee failed to  adhere to its own human rights commitments, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:  [[Page H7505]]                                     H. Res. 837         Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time Olympian Peng Shuai       went missing after she said in a since-deleted post on       Chinese social media site Weibo that she had been sexually       assaulted and forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang       Gaoli, who was the senior Vice Premier of the State Council       of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from 2013 to 2018;        Whereas PRC authorities have imposed a media and internet       blackout of discussions of Peng's case, and the words       ``tennis'' and the surname ``Peng'' have been censored online       within China;        Whereas, on November 14, 2021, after Peng had not been seen       or heard from for 12 days, Women's Tennis Association (WTA)       CEO Steve Simon requested a ``full and transparent''       investigation into Peng's allegations;        Whereas the hashtag ``#WhereIsPengShuai'' trended across       social media worldwide, with the exception of the PRC where       it is censored;        Whereas, on November 17, 2021, the WTA received a statement       purporting to be from Peng, recanting her abuse claim and       saying ``everything is fine'';        Whereas in response, WTA CEO Steve Simon said the response       ``released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai       only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts'';        Whereas in response, the International Olympic Committee       (IOC) said in a statement that it was ``encouraged by       assurance that she is safe'';        Whereas, on November 19 and 20, 2021, photos and videos of       Peng appearing in her home, in a restaurant, and at a youth       tennis event in Beijing emerged on Twitter accounts       affiliated with government-run media, and at the same time,       Peng has not spoken directly with the media or the WTA;        Whereas, on November 19, 2021, White House Press Secretary       Jen Psaki said the White House is ``deeply concerned'' over       Peng's disappearance and seeks ``independent and verifiable       proof'' of her location and condition;        Whereas, on November 19, 2021, Liz Throssell, the       spokesperson of the United Nations Human Rights office, told       reporters ``. . .it would be important to have proof of her       whereabouts and wellbeing, and we would urge that there be an       investigation with full transparency into her allegations of       sexual assault'';        Whereas, on November 21, 2021, the IOC said in a statement       that its President, Thomas Bach, had a 30-minute video call       with 3-time Olympian Peng Shuai, joined by a Chinese sports       official and an IOC official;        Whereas the statement said that, during the call, Peng       appeared to be ``doing fine'' and ``relaxed'', and said she       ``would like to have her privacy respected'';        Whereas the IOC did not explain how the video call with       Peng had been organized, given the difficulties other       concerned parties have had reaching her;        Whereas, on November 30, 2021, IOC official Dick Pound in       an interview with CNN defended the Chinese Government's       handling of the situation and said the ``unanimous       conclusion'' by IOC officials on the call is that Peng Shuai       is ``fine'';        Whereas the annual report of the Congressional-Executive       Commission on China for 2020 finds that gender-based violence       in China remains a serious issue, and highly publicized cases       of sexual assault continue to surface;        Whereas, on December 1, 2021, the WTA suspended all WTA       tournaments in China and Hong Kong;        Whereas WTA chairman Steve Simon stated, ``In good       conscience, I don't see how I can ask our athletes to compete       there when Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely       and has seemingly been pressured to contradict her allegation       of sexual assault. Given the current state of affairs, I am       also greatly concerned about the risks that all of our       players and staff could face if we were to hold events in       China in 2022.'';        Whereas the PRC has repeatedly detained ``#MeToo''       activists in China and censored online and public discussion       around sexual assault and harassment; and        Whereas athletes from the around the world are headed to       Beijing for the Olympic games starting in February 2022: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) the case of Peng Shuai is directly related to broader       international concerns around the freedom of speech and       safety of athletes participating in the 2022 Olympics in       Beijing;        (2) the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) role in       legitimizing the People's Republic of China's (PRC) claims       about Peng's safety raise questions about the organization's       ability and willingness to protect the rights of athletes       participating in the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic games in       Beijing;        (3) the PRC would help reduce concerns about athlete safety       at the Beijing Olympics by assuring Peng's freedom and safety       and investigating her allegations in a fair and transparent       manner;        (4) the PRC should immediately take steps to--        (A) provide independent and verifiable proof of Peng's       whereabouts and that she is safe;        (B) allow Peng to engage directly with the WTA and the       United Nations to independently verify her safety and explain       her absence from public life since making her allegation;        (C) open an independent and transparent investigation into       Peng's allegations against former senior Vice Premier Zhang       Gaoli;        (D) publicly commit to hold sexual violence abusers       accountable;        (E) cease all censorship of reporting and discussions of       Peng's case; and        (F) allow Peng to leave China if she so desires, and       prevent any retaliation against family members remaining       there;        (5) by acquiescing to the Chinese Communist Party's       narrative, the IOC failed to adhere to its own human rights       commitments and protect the safety and free speech of Olympic       athletes;        (6) the IOC's conduct has undermined the efforts by the       United States Government, human rights organizations, the       Women's Tennis Association, and other international bodies       and individuals to secure Peng's safety; and        (7) in an effort to regain lost public confidence, the IOC       should publicly call on the Government of the PRC to       undertake the actions called for in paragraph (4).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 837.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H. Res. 837, as amended, expressing the  sense of the House of Representatives that Beijing should immediately  guarantee the safety and the freedom of tennis star Peng Shuai,  introduced by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).   Last month, former Wimbledon women's doubles champion and three-time  Olympian Peng Shuai accused former Vice Premier of the State Council  Zhang Gaoli of committing sexual assault and forcing her into a sexual  relationship.   After these groundbreaking allegations were made, the first sexual  assault allegation to implicate a high-ranking Chinese official, Peng  seemingly vanished into thin air, and China's great firewall went into  overdrive, deleting the original post, censoring any mention of Peng's  name or discussion of her allegations online.   We know that here in America, sexual assault and gender-based  violence are serious problems, and it took a movement of brave women  and their allies to start changing the conversation around our  workplaces and our homes and in our schools and communities.   Due to the action of journalists, the tennis community, activists,  and social media users across the globe who started to ask about Peng's  whereabouts, there has been tremendous attention given to her case.  However, I, like many of my colleagues, remain deeply concerned about  Peng's whereabouts and well-being. It is vital that we get assurances  that Peng is safe and her ability to speak out is not constrained.   This important, bipartisan resolution calls for independent and  verifiable proof that she is safe and free to make decisions and take  actions of her own free will.   The accusations of sexual abuse by a former senior official are very  serious, and this resolution calls for the Government of the People's  Republic of China to immediately conduct a formal, transparent, and  independent investigation.   At a time when we are preparing to send hundreds of American athletes  to compete in Beijing's Winter Olympics, this resolution calls on the  International Olympic Committee to do more to ensure athlete safety and  hold the PRC Government accountable for its actions against Peng.   This is timely and is also an urgent resolution. I support it, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton), the sponsor of this bill along  with the cosponsor, Mr. Waltz.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H. Res. 837, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives  that Beijing should immediately guarantee the safety and freedom of  tennis star Peng Shuai is a timely and urgent resolution.   Peng's whereabouts and safety in China have been in question now for  several weeks, and in just over 8 weeks, the Beijing Olympic Games are  set to begin. There will be athletes from all over the world in  attendance. This body owes it not to just to Peng, but to all the  athletes participating in the Olympic Games to demonstrate that we do  not take their safety and freedom for granted.   The PRC must understand that its diplomatic and economic heft will  not allow it to get away scot-free when it silences and erases  individuals.   While this resolution is about a single athlete, it is really about  the innate dignity and freedom of every sexual assault survivor, human  rights activist, environmental advocate, artist, journalist, and  entrepreneur that has ever been beaten and broken by the Chinese  Communist Party. We owe them our voice and our support.   Let me, again, thank Congresswoman Wexton and Congressman Waltz for  their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 317) condemning the ongoing genocide and crimes  against humanity being committed against Uyghurs and members of other  religious and ethnic minority groups by the People's Republic of China,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 317         Whereas, on December 9, 1948, the United Nations General       Assembly unanimously adopted the Convention on the Prevention       and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (the Genocide       Convention) signifying a commitment in response to the       Holocaust and other crimes against humanity committed in the       first half of the twentieth century;        Whereas the Genocide Convention entered into force on       January 12, 1951, and declares that all state parties       ``confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace       or in time of war, is a crime under international law which       they undertake to prevent and to punish'';        Whereas the Genocide Convention defines genocide as ``any       of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in       whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious       group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing       serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c)       Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life       calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole       or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births       within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the       group to another group'';        Whereas the United States ratified the Genocide Convention       with the understanding that the commission of genocide       requires ``the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in       substantial part, a [protected] group as such'';        Whereas the People's Republic of China (PRC) is a state       party to the Genocide Convention;        Whereas, since 2017, the PRC Government, under the       direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),       has detained and sought to indoctrinate more than one million       Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority       groups;        Whereas recent data indicate a significant drop in birth       rates among Uyghurs due to enforced sterilization, enforced       abortion, and more onerous birth quotas for Uyghurs compared       to Han;        Whereas there are credible reports of PRC Government       campaigns to promote marriages between Uyghurs and Han and to       reduce birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims;        Whereas many Uyghurs reportedly have been assigned to       factory employment under conditions that indicate forced       labor, and some former detainees have reported food       deprivation, beatings, suppression of religious practices,       family separation, and sexual abuse;        Whereas this is indicative of a systematic effort to       eradicate the ethnic and cultural identity and religious       beliefs, and prevent the births of, Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs       and Kyrgyz, and members of religious minority groups;        Whereas the birth rate in the Xinjiang region fell by 24       percent in 2019 compared to a 4.2 percent decline nationwide;        Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Department of State       determined the PRC Government, under the direction and       control of the CCP, has committed crimes against humanity and       genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious       minority groups in Xinjiang;        Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Former       Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have both stated that what       has taken place in Xinjiang is genocide and constitutes       crimes against humanity;        Whereas Article VIII of the Genocide Convention provides,       ``Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of       the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of       the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the       prevention and suppression of acts of genocide'';        Whereas the International Court of Justice has stated that       it is the obligation of all state parties to the Genocide       Convention to ``employ all means reasonably available to       them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible''; and        Whereas the United States is a Permanent Member of the       United Nations Security Council: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) finds that the ongoing abuses against Uyghurs and       members of other ethnic and religious minority groups       constitute genocide as defined in the Genocide Convention and       crimes against humanity as understood under customary       international law;        (2) attributes these atrocity crimes against Uyghurs and       members of other ethnic and religious minority groups to the       People's Republic of China, under the direction and control       of the Chinese Communist Party;        (3) condemns this genocide and these crimes against       humanity in the strongest terms; and        (4) calls upon the President to direct the United States       Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the       voice, vote, and influence of the United States to--        (A) refer the People's Republic of China's genocide and       crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and members of other       ethnic and religious minority groups to the competent organs       of the United Nations for investigation;        (B) seize the United Nations Security Council of the       circumstances of this genocide and crimes against humanity       and lead efforts to invoke multilateral sanctions in response       to these ongoing atrocities; and        (C) take all possible actions to bring this genocide and       these crimes against humanity to an end and hold the       perpetrators of these atrocities accountable under       international law.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 317, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 317, as amended,  condemning the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity being  committed against Uyghurs and members of other religious and ethnic  minority groups by the People's Republic of China. And I was proud to  introduce this resolution alongside my good friend, Ranking Member  McCaul, and working collectively with him.   Mr. Speaker, I have said previously, and I will say this again, as an  African American who has faced the brunt end of injustice for no reason  other than the color of my skin and watched my parents suffer, I am  very sensitive to the deep wounds of intolerance and oppression that  many minority populations endure across the globe.   Again, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., famously said: ``Injustice  anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere'' and ``I refuse to be  silent,'' another statement of Dr. King because silence can be  complicity.   Dr. King called us all to be champions of human rights, not just here  in the United States, but wherever human rights are under threat.   And we have seen grave human rights abuses in China. In Xinjiang, the  Uyghur people and other ethnic and religious minority groups are  subjected to systematic human rights violations that amounts to a  genocide and crimes against humanity as defined by the Geneva  Convention.   The crimes taking place against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities  in Xinjiang are horrific in their scope and severity. And we know of  these atrocities because many survivors began speaking out at great  risk to their personal safety and that of their families. They provided  firsthand accounts confirming China's targeted campaign of repression.  Meanwhile, journalists, scholars, and activists who have tried to  uncover what is happening have been targeted and expelled.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee has heard harrowing accounts from  survivors of mass internment, forced labor, torture, political  indoctrination, suppression of religious practices, family separation,  sexual abuse, and other inhumane practices.   During a hearing on May 6 of this year, survivor Tursunay Ziyawudun  ended her testimony by imploring the members of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee and Congress to act. And we are here today to do just  that.   This resolution unequivocally declares that a genocide is taking  place in the Uyghur region. I agree with that declaration and so do  many others around the world.   This resolution is a clarion call, not just to every nation in the  world, but to every person on this planet that the United States  Congress will not remain silent, no matter how powerful the  perpetrator.   We must continue to call out the government of the People's Republic  of China for these atrocities and others all over the world and have  them take all possible actions to bring this genocide and these crimes  against humanity to an end.   I say to the world, we are starting with China. We are going all over  the world. Human rights are on the front burner in the United States  House of Representatives and clearly on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.   This is an important resolution. I close by saying I support and am  glad to work with the ranking member, Mr. McCaul.   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution. I urge my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL: Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot), ranking member of the Committee of Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank Mr. McCaul for his leadership. It is my  pleasure to work with him on this bill to get this to the floor and to  pass it on this floor, the people's House, in a bipartisan way, sending  a strong message together. That is what this does. So I thank him for  his friendship, and I thank him for standing up, as he does, and  working together in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 317, condemning the ongoing genocide and crimes  against humanity being committed against the Uyghurs and members of  other religious and ethnic minority groups by the People's Republic of  China is critical to demonstrating to those suffering in Xinjiang that  they haven't been forsaken. And to the government of Beijing, we will  speak out when it tramples the universal rights that every human being  deserves.   It gives me hope that we are not the first parliamentary body that  has deemed the PRC's action in Xinjiang a genocide. The parliaments of  the U.K., of Canada, of Lithuania, among others, have already taken the  right stand. We must support them. We must work with them and  multilateral groups. We must encourage other nations and other people  to speak out. But I am proud we are speaking out here today in the  United States Congress, in the people's House. We will not be silent.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that all my colleagues will join me in supporting  this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
