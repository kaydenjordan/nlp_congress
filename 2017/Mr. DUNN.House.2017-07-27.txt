 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a prime example of  how needless government regulation is wasting both taxpayers' time and  money.   In my district in Florida, on the beautiful Gulf Coast, we are  susceptible to hurricanes with damaging winds and flooding. Sometimes  roads get washed out.   Back in November of 2014, Panama City Beach applied for a Federal  grant from FEMA to improve drainage and alleviate flooding of Front  Beach Road. The project involves the installation of just two culverts  under the road for storm runoff. This is not building the pyramids.   Three years later, local officials have submitted more than 900 pages  of paperwork and spent countless hours working on this application. All  this is for a project that will take just 1 week to construct and  involves a grant of only $170,000.   Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the kind of crushing red tape that our  constituents face on a regular basis, and this is what we are working  to fix.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, throughout the country, there are remote areas where the  men and women of our armed services prepare for war in order to protect  the peace.   Although these places are often overlooked, our investments in  military test and training ranges are returned  [[Page H6500]]  to the Nation many times over in the projection of American military  supremacy around the globe protecting the homeland and preserving  international order.   In the Southeast, the Joint Gulf Range Complex facilities are for  testing and training of supersonic and hypersonic weapons systems,  including combat training and live-fire exercises of the frontline  fighters like the F-22 and F-35.   The 325th Fighter Wing and the 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group at  Tyndall Air Force Base, the 96th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, and  the Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field make extensive use of  the Joint Gulf Range Complex.   There is no comparable area in the United States near an established  base with instrumentation infrastructure that can support advanced  testing and joint training exercises like this. However, deployment of  the instrumentation necessary to collect the data during the training  on these fifth- and sixth-generation weapons systems is not in keeping  with the U.S. Air Force needs. Instrumentation limitations have  restricted the F-35 and F-22 training missions to the northernmost  portion of the range. According to a study by the 96th Test Wing at  Eglin Air Force Base, this limitation causes congestion and has  obstructed at least 80 missions per year.   This amendment, which I am offering with my Florida colleagues, Mr.  Tom Rooney, Mr. Matt Gaetz, and Mr. Francis Rooney, will accelerate  investments approved by Congress to deploy new infrastructure along the  Joint Gulf Range Complex. The amendment will maximize the utility of  this vast range, which is a true national treasure for combat training  and advanced testing and evaluation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Gaetz), my colleague and friend.    Mr. Chair, I have no further comments or remarks; however,  I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to  enhance military readiness and national security.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
