 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Joseph L. ``Joe'' Murchison, Jr., an extraordinary  public servant who passed away last year and who would have turned 92  on June 19, 2022.   Joe was born in North Carolina in 1930 and enlisted as early as he  could in the U.S. Army. Determined to commit himself to his Nation, Joe  eventually joined the all-Black 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion. The  members of this battalion were called the ``Triple Nickles.''   In 1947, a year before the Army was desegregated, Major General James  Gavin oversaw the troopers' transfer into the 3rd Battalion, 505th  Parachute Infantry Regiment. This was the first step toward integrating  the 82nd Airborne Division and made the Triple Nickles some of the  first Black soldiers to train alongside White soldiers.   Even after this trailblazing shift, the troopers continued to  consider themselves Triple Nickles. Despite the racial separation of  most soldiers, the paratroopers gained the respect of many units as a  result of their special airborne status. As Joe said, ``We knew we had  something to prove and we had to be better than the best.''   In 1958, Joe retired from the military as an officer. He followed his  impressive service by starting several successful businesses across the  United States and helping to found a newspaper in Greensboro called the  ``Carolina Peacemaker.'' As part of these endeavors, Joe was one of the  first Black owners of a North Carolina automobile dealership and worked  with a major car manufacturer to promote an alternative fuel vehicle.   Joe founded the 555th Parachute Infantry Association, Inc., in 1979.  The organization enables the paratroopers to stay connected. Throughout  his three terms as president of the association, Joe saw it grow to  include over 1,500 members across 26 chapters.   Throughout his remarkable lifetime, Joe dedicated himself to sharing  the importance of the Triple Nickles, even visiting the White House.  While he was alive, Joe was pleased to see Juneteenth--also his  birthday--be named a Federal holiday by President Biden. He passed away  on November 11, 2021, Veterans Day.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our best wishes to his daughter, Joelle,  along with her 10 siblings, as well as Joe's grandchildren, great- grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren as they celebrate his  outstanding life this Sunday. I hope my colleagues will join me in  recognizing Joseph L. Murchison, Jr.                            ____________________
