 Mr. Speaker, the administration is removing  healthcare workers, Federal employees, and members of the Armed Forces  [[Page H4203]]  from their jobs if they refuse to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, over  160,000 unvaccinated and untested illegal aliens crossed our border  last February, the most on record in two decades.   Now, Joe Biden and his Washington Democrat allies want to make a bad  problem worse. Last week, President Biden eliminated President Trump's  title 42, which allows DHS to deport illegal aliens if they pose a  public health danger to our citizens. In other words, according to  Washington Democrats, they believe American healthcare workers, Federal  employees, and servicemembers deserve harsher treatment than those  crossing our border illegally.   This is unacceptable. Title 42 must be reinstated immediately and  kept in place until this administration comes up with a plan to deal  with the border crisis created by the administration's policies.                            ____________________
