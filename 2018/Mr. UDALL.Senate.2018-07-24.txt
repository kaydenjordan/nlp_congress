 Mr. President, I rise to honor George B. Willie, Sr., one  of our last surviving Navajo code talkers, who passed away at age 92 on  December 5, 2017. Mr. Willie was a humble man who never bragged and  rarely talked about his uncommon feat.   Mr. Willie was born near Sawmill, AZ. He was To Dich'iinii--Bitter  Water--and born for Tabaaha--Near The Water Edge--and resided near  Leupp when he passed away.   Mr. Willie only had a seventh-grade education. He tried to enlist in  1941, but was too young. He was finally able to join the Marines 2  years later, when he was 17 years old. He served the Second Marine  Division, 10th Battalion, from 1943 until 1946.   As a marine, Mr. Willie was one of the 421 code talkers from the  Navajo Nation. The original 29 Navajo code talkers developed a code  based on their native language. At that time, there was no written  language, and only about 30 persons outside of Tribal members  understood Navajo. The code talkers were required to quickly and  accurately translate and transmit messages about troop movements,  tactics,  [[Page S5263]]  and the like through telephone and radio. At first skeptical, military  leaders quickly learned to appreciate their skill and tremendous value  to the war effort. The Japanese never broke their code.   While the Federal Government relied on the Navajo language for  military success, back home, it continued the longstanding policy of  forbidding Native students from speaking their languages at Federal  boarding schools.   Mr. Willie served in the Battle of Okinawa, one of the last and  deadliest battles of the war. In June 1945, the Americans and the  British Pacific Fleet took the island after 82 days of battle. It was  their last stop before the planned attempt to take the Island of Japan,  which was preempted when the United States dropped the atomic bomb on  Hiroshima on August 6.   After coming home, Mr. Willie married Emma Gean Willie, and they had  10 children. The code talker program was secret, and the code talkers  were sworn not to tell anyone about their work. Even after the Federal  Government declassified the program in 1968, Mr. Willie continued to  honor his promise and did not tell family members he was a code talker  until almost 30 years later. In 2001, Mr. Willie and his fellow code  talkers were awarded the Silver Congressional Medal of Honor.   Today I honor Mr. Willie, a true American hero.                            ____________________
