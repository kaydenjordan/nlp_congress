 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here today, to be on the  record in favor of this legislation.   No one should be fired from their job or evicted from their home  because of who they are or who they love.                                time  1515    This legislation will guarantee that our LGBTQ friends, neighbors,  and family will be full members of the American family with all of the  protections that come with that.   Mr. Speaker, I will just say one thing before I sit down. For anyone  who ever wondered what they would have done in those days in the early  1960s, when the civil rights legislation was being debated here, let me  just say this: Whatever you are doing now is what you would have done  then.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
