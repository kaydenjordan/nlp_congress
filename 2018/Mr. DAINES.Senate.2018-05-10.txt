 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Mary Ann and Mark Petree for their contributions to  Musselshell County as owners of Roundup's Busy Bee Cafe for almost 50  years.   For folks across Musselshell County, the Busy Bee Cafe is iconic. It  is a place for the community to gather, have a great meal, and enjoy  the best pie in Montana. The Busy Bee Cafe has grown to be a staple in  the community, and that comes as a result of their owners, Mary Ann and  Mark Petree.   Mary Ann and Mark bought the Busy Bee Cafe 49 years ago. When they  purchased the Busy Bee Cafe, they saw the restaurant's potential.  Business quickly grew, and they began expanding the size of the  restaurant. Business today remains booming, while still holding onto  the personal touches that drew them to the cafe in the first place.   With both of their children now grown, Mary Ann and Mark are able to  dedicate their time to keeping the business running smoothly. They  pride themselves on the local touch of all their food, with 95 percent  of it being homemade. Every morning, Mary Ann and Mark start their day  by serving coffee to the Busy Bee Cafe regulars.   I congratulate Mary Ann and Mark Petree on their 49 years of  dedication to the Busy Bee Cafe. As a result of their hard work and  attention to detail in every aspect of the business, the Busy Bee Cafe  is a local favorite that brings together the greater Musselshell  County.                            ____________________
