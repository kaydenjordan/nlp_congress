 Mr. President, now, I understand that there is a joint  resolution at the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the joint resolution on the calendar  under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings.    Mr. President, now, this morning the Nation grieves with  the people of Boulder, CO, the site of another horrific mass shooting  last night. A depraved gunman opened fire inside a local supermarket,  killing 10 people, including a police officer. Many more are injured.   Our hearts go out to the people of Boulder and the families of those  Americans who have lost their lives so unexpectedly.   Our thanks again go out to the brave first responders.   People kiss someone goodbye for the morning and send somebody off to  school and they are never seen again--never seen again. It is just  awful. And it has been less than 8 weeks since eight people were killed  in another series of shootings in Georgia. We cannot seem to finish  grieving one tragedy before another takes place.   It is a reminder that we must confront a devastating truth in the  United States: An unrelenting epidemic of gun violence steals innocent  lives with alarming regularity. Even amidst the pandemic, gun violence  has not receded. In fact, confoundedly, it has grown even worse, and  2020 was one of the deadliest years for gun violence in two decades--a  reminder that most gun violence doesn't even make headlines but  nonetheless causes immeasurable devastation to communities from one end  of our country to the other.   So we have a lot of work to do. I have already committed to bringing  universal background checks legislation to the floor of the Senate.  There is a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary Committee under  Chairman Durbin's leadership to examine several commonsense proposals  to reduce gun violence.   Two summers ago, the Republican leader--then the majority leader-- promised there would be a debate in the Senate on gun violence, but it  never happened. It never happened.   This Senate will be different. The Senate is going to debate and  address  [[Page S1682]]  the epidemic of gun violence in this country.   Today, our hearts are with the people of Colorado and with everyone  whose lives have been touched by gun violence.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, as I mentioned, the shooting in  Colorado comes only a week after another tragedy in the communities  outside Atlanta, GA, where eight people were killed in a string of  shootings, six of whom were women of Asian descent.   It is important to place the Atlanta area shootings in context. Over  the past year, there has been a rising tide of violence against Asian  Americans driven by fear, misinformation, and age-old prejudices  against the Asian-American community, from shouted insults and racial  slurs to outright assault.   A 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face by a box  cutter on the New York subway. An 84-year-old Thai American in San  Francisco was shoved so violently it led to his death. And now this  attack in Georgia.   Every day, Asian Americans walk down the streets looking over their  shoulders, wondering if they will be assaulted or even worse--even  worse.   The poison of racism has always existed in America, but over the past  4 years it seems to have found new life. There is no question that the  former President Donald Trump, through word and deed, fanned the flames  of racial bias in our country. It is not a coincidence that it is worse  now than it has been before. Donald Trump fanned those flames--fanned  those flames, often with glee.   With respect to the Asian-American community, specifically, the  former President encouraged rhetoric that blamed the Chinese people for  the coronavirus--an absolutely despicable notion that has led to all  sorts of verbal and physical assaults on Asian Americans. You could see  him with his chin strutted out when he called it the virus that he  named it--you know what--the China virus. So despicable. And he did it  with almost a joy.   Here in America, we all know that an attack against any one group is  an attack against all of us. So it is up to all of us now to stand up  and speak out in support of the Asian-American community in America.   Over the weekend, I joined several vigils to stand with Americans of  all ages, races, and faiths to support the Asian-American community.  There was a large turnout, and our Asian brothers and sisters were so  relieved that so many of us from the elected community were there. We  should all be doing that in every part of the country.   Here on the floor of the Senate this morning, I started the process  to make two pieces of legislation available for action by the full  Senate.   First is a bill led by my friend Senator Hirono of Hawaii, very  similar to the same bill introduced by our New York Congress Member,  Grace Meng, of Queens. This legislation by Senator Hirono will address  COVID-related hate crimes against Asian Americans head-on. It would  assign a point person at the Department of Justice to expedite the  review of COVID-19-related hate crimes, provide support for State and  local law enforcement agencies to respond to hate crimes, and work on  solutions to the problem of racially discriminatory language that has  been used to describe the pandemic.   Second is a bill led by my friend Senator Durbin to counter the  threat of domestic terrorism and violent White supremacy. This is a  bill that passed the House of Representatives last year on an  overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. As far as legislation goes, it is as  much of a no-brainer as it comes.   Every one of us--every one of us--has an obligation to speak out  against these hate crimes. One of the best antidotes--there are many-- but one of the best antidotes when hate occurs is to answer it  forcefully, strongly, and repeatedly so that no one thinks it is  acceptable, and those who perpetrate it are shunned and then, if they  have broken the law, punished.   Every one of us must do this. We must speak out. Here in the Senate,  we have more than a responsibility to just speak out; we must take  action. I hope we will have universal support for these pieces of  legislation that I mentioned.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
