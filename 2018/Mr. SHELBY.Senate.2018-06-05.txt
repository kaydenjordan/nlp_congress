 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate  Highlands Bar & Grill for winning the 2018 James Beard Foundation Award  for outstanding restaurant on May 7, 2018.   After being a finalist for 9 consecutive years, the Highlands Bar &  Grill has finally won this prestigious award. The James Beard  Foundation annually presents awards for culinary excellence, and I  cannot think of a more deserving restaurant.   Ever since the restaurant's opening in 1982, executive chef and owner  Frank Stitt from Cullman, AL, and his wife, Pardis, from Birmingham,  AL, have provided a memorable and hospitable culinary experience. Their  commitment to providing high-quality food and service have been the  foundation for their nationally recognized success.   Contributing to the triumph of the restaurant is pastry chef Dolester  Miles, who this year won the 2018 James Beard Foundation Award for  outstanding pastry chef. One of the original employees of Highlands Bar  & Grill, Dolester's 36-year career is certainly impressive and  unparalleled.   Frank Stitt's mentorship and guidance have influenced many other  chefs in the Birmingham area and beyond. His ever-changing and  inspirational menu has elevated the standard for fine Southern cuisine.   I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Highlands Bar &  Grill. This restaurant is one of the finest restaurants in the United  States and is an ambassador to the world of fine Southern cuisine.   Please join me in congratulating Highlands Bar & Grill for winning  this award and for the restaurant's nearly four decades of success. I  have no doubt that it will continue this path of excellence.                            ____________________
