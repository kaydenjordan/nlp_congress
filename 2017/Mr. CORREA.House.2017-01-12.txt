 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protect the Affordable Care  Act. Today I urge you to give the Affordable Care Act the same chance  we gave America's other great healthcare program, Medicare, way back in  1965.   Today Medicare covers over 55 million Americans and is a staple for  senior care. But let's go back in time and remember what people were  saying about Medicare in 1965. The American Medical Association said  Medicare is an ``invasion of the voluntary relationship between the  patient and the physician.''   The then-Republican leadership said the bill will cost too much. It  will never cover enough seniors. It will make taxes too high, and we  will be broke within 2 years.   Those are some of the quotes from The New York Times in 1965.   Today, 52 years later, Medicare is one of the most efficient  healthcare systems in our country. Why? Because we gave it a chance to  flourish.   Mr. Speaker, when we come together on behalf of the American people,  we get things done. I ask my colleagues today: Do not repeal the  Affordable Care Act. Instead, let's move past the politics of repealing  the ACA. Let's learn from five decades of Medicare. Let's give  Americans the healthcare coverage they want and they deserve, because  in 60 years, it won't really matter whose name is on the program. But  what will matter is that we came together and stopped the repeal. What  will matter is that we fixed the ACA and made it work for every  American.   The American people deserve good health care. If folks have issues  with the ACA, then let's fix those issues. Let's make the ACA better.  But to rip coverage from 30 million people, to destroy 2.6 million  jobs, and to add $350 billion to our deficit is not a good thing.   I ask my colleagues today to keep the ACA.                            ____________________
