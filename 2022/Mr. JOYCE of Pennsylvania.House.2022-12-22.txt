 Madam Speaker, last week, during a  telephone townhall, a woman in my district asked what Congress was  planning to do about the cost of her fuel bills. She could no longer  afford to heat her home, and she has been forced to use a wood stove  just to maintain a normal temperature in her home.   The temperature in my hometown in Altoona, Pennsylvania, tomorrow  night will be 1 degree Fahrenheit.   For months, we have warned of constituents being unable to heat their  homes when truly cold nights come this winter. And guess what, now they  are here, and the Biden administration has still refused to act.   President Biden has refused to slash red tape and get pipelines and  liquid natural gas facilities online that could address these soaring  energy prices.   That is why we need to enact in Congress our Commitment to America  and return not only to energy independence but to energy dominance.   We as Republicans will cut through government regulation. We will  work to solve permitting reform, and we will finally bring the change  that makes it possible to utilize the energy sources that are under the  feet of my constituents.                            ____________________
