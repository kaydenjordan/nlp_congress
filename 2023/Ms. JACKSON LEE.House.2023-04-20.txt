 Mr. Speaker, I first want to take a moment to honor  an esteemed pastor in my district, Pastor Ricky Bell, who has passed  away after a valiant, strong, and vigorous fight against devastating  cancer.   I offer my sympathy to the members of the Forest Lawn Baptist Church,  and to say to them, he was more than a giant in northeast Houston and  in Houston, to his first lady, First Lady Bell, and to his family.   I thank Pastor Bell for being a champion of veterans, for providing  veterans housing, for being a force for education, and for being a  spiritual leader.   As we mourn Pastor Bell, and as we attend his going-home services, we  honor the life that he led.   I ask Members of this House to honor him and mourn him in their own  silent way.   Mr. Speaker, let me also acknowledge, at this time, that I ask my  colleagues to join me in a resolution condemning the inaction by the  Islamic Republic of Iran in addressing the poisoning of Iranian school  girls--yes, poisoning the daughters of the Iranian Revolution and the  formation of the Iranian Congressional Caucus.    Over 500 people have been killed in the mass revolution of women and  girls. Let me say this: Stop the poisoning of Iranian school children.                            ____________________
