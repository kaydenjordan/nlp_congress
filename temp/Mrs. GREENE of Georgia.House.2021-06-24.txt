 Madam Speaker, I would like to just take a  minute to remind everyone that words matter, and their meanings need to  be exactly clear.   Contraception stops a woman from becoming pregnant. The Plan B pill  kills a baby in the womb once a woman is already pregnant. You see, the  Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act is not contraception, it  is providing, with taxpayer dollars, the ability for women to have an  abortion. The government should not be paying for abortion. The VA  should not be paying for abortion. The American taxpayer should not be  paying for abortion. So this is why this is very important for all of  us to do what we are called to do and not play a part in killing a baby  in the womb.   Madam Speaker, this is why I am asking all of my colleagues to vote  against the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act. It is time  to defend life in the womb.
