 Mr. President, on Saturday, October 9, 2021,  nearly 200 members of the class of 1970 of Walt Whitman High School in  Bethesda, MD, will hold their 50th class reunion, an event delayed a  year by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is my pleasure to congratulate them  on this special occasion.   This distinguished class of 1970 from Walt Whitman has an exemplary  history of contributions to society and to advancing social justice. As  children, a number of class members from the Bannockburn neighborhood  in Bethesda joined a contingent from Howard University for the first  multiracial civil rights protest in America, picketing segregated Glen  Echo Amusement Park daily for 22 weeks in 1960 after Blacks were  arrested for riding its carousel. As the result of these and other  efforts, the policy was changed, and the park reopened to all the next  year. And this year, those members of the class of 1970 will return to  Glen Echo during their 50th reunion to ride that same carousel on its  100th anniversary.   The class of 1970 came of age at an important time in our Nation's  history, a period of great change and dramatic events. When they were 8  years old in 1961, they saw President John F. Kennedy call for all  citizens to commit to work for the common good. They saw the beginning  of space exploration, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the arrival of the  Beatles, the passage by the U.S. Congress of landmark bills on voting  rights and fair housing, the Vietnam war, and the tragedies of the  assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Senator Robert  Kennedy.   This social awareness led to lifelong commitment and activism for so  many in this remarkable class. In protest of the Vietnam war, many  participated in the National Moratorium Against the War. In the  dramatic March Against Death, dozens of members of the class carried  the names of fallen soldiers whose families could not travel here to  join the protest. As the first class of students subject to a draft  lottery conducted by the Selective Service System, many classmates  participated in efforts to abolish military conscription in the U.S.  and in support of lowering the voting age from 21 to 18.   In 1970, when members of this class were in their senior year, WWHS  was named the No. 1 public high school in the Nation by ``U.S. News &  World Report,'' which also recently named Whitman the best high school  in Maryland. Whitman's first principal, Dr. Daryl Shaw, called the  class of 1970 ``the most challenging'' he ever had, in light of their  frequent questioning of authority and vigorous advocacy for social  change. Profound events that changed  [[Page S6696]]  the Nation happened during their high school years. The first moon  landing and Woodstock happened only 27 days apart. And just 5 weeks  before graduation, in a reflection of the profound tension in our  Nation, 13 unarmed students were shot at Kent State, four fatally.   Some in their generation warned, ``Don't trust anyone over 30.'' Now,  as the class of 1970 approaches 70, its members can look back on 50  years of lives well lived. This class can boast of significant  achievement, as its members include, among many other graduates of  great distinction, elected officials, physicians, lawyers, real estate  developers, orchestra conductors, musicians, magazine publishers, and  at least one juggler.   I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our very best wishes and  congratulations to the Walt Whitman High School class of 1970 as its  members gather--1 year late--for their 50th reunion.                            ____________________
