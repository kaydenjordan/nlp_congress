 Mr. Speaker, on September 12, 2017, I released a statement  to mark and recognize that the national debt had just exceeded $20  trillion.   I asked my colleagues to follow through with our commitment to reduce  expenditures and create economic stability for our future. Since that  date, Congress has not taken any action to reduce our deficit or to  balance our budget. Instead, we have increased our budget caps to  augment Federal spending by more than 10 percent above current levels.   We suspended our debt ceiling, and this week we are preparing to pass  our seventh short-term spending bill of the fiscal year. Our grossly  negligent spending habits continue with no end in sight. At this rate,  I am certain that we will see a $22 trillion national debt sometime  around the first of next year.   Mr. Speaker, this fiscal irresponsibility is not what we promised our  constituents. We are directly contributing to the bankruptcy of this  Nation that we will leave to our grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I beg my colleagues to honor the pledge to cut our  spending and reduce our debt before it is too late. We must act now  before we cross another trillion-dollar threshold.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding. I also pay my respects and give honor to Ron Johnson, the  Senator from Wisconsin who championed the bill in the Senate and gave  us a superb bill; also, Chairman Walden and his committee, who have  worked hard to give us this bill today; and my original cosponsor on  the bill that I introduced, Mr. Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address just a couple of things that I think  are really intriguing to me because it certainly seems a bit  condescending to me when I hear people say: I am not going to support  this because it gives false hope that people might be taken advantage  of by bad actors. They cannot identify the bad actors, but they might  be taking advantage of them. That is a fallacious and specious argument  to make when you are denying people who have a terminal illness, who  have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, who have gone through the  already approved FDA processes in order to get and petition a  pharmaceutical company for an experimental drug that might prolong  their life and might heal them.   False hope, that argument, is the argument that I am hearing. But the  reality is these people are individuals. They have a higher sense of  reality than virtually anybody else I know because their mortality is  there. They want the opportunity. It is not false hope. It is hope.  Support of this bill is compassionate. Support of this bill is fair.   I have also heard that there may be some liability issues on the part  of pharmaceutical companies which might impede them from providing  drugs. Yet, in order to satisfy them, the bill itself says that they  are exculpated unless their conduct is willful or criminal. That means  that they have protection.   What I am asking here today, and what everyone with whom I have met  over the years who want a right to try is asking, is simply a chance to  have some determination and control over their own lives.                                time  1345    One of the intriguing arguments I hear today and I heard last week  is, well, you know what, the pharmaceutical companies aren't compelled  to provide these drugs. So my immediate question is: Oh, so you would  be more comfortable, then, if we would have included a compulsory means  in the bill? Did you want the pharmaceutical companies to be compelled  to provide these?   The answer would be no. It is simply they don't like this bill. They  don't want the bill.   When you have 38, soon to be 39, States that want to give their  citizens, Americans all, the right to try to preserve their lives and  to be healed and have a chance, they need to get that; they need that  opportunity. We need to give it to them today.
