 Mr. Speaker, this Saturday is Veterans Day, a day to  reflect on the bravery and the commitment of our servicemembers and to  [[Page H8644]]  thank them for their dedication to our Nation.   From the Greatest Generation who served in World War II to the  veterans who traversed the harsh jungles of Vietnam, to the young  people who took up the banner and persisted in the fight against  terrorism in Afghanistan and in Iraq, we owe our veterans an endless  debt of gratitude.   It is our responsibility to provide for our servicemembers when they  heed the call to serve, as well as to care for them when they return  home.   Mr. Speaker, we must fulfill our promises to our veterans and deliver  on the promises, the benefits that they have earned. We need to make  sure that we end veterans' homelessness. Whether it be ensuring timely  access to quality healthcare, enabling the pursuit of educational  opportunities, or providing the tools to start their own business, let  us reaffirm to our veterans that they will have the support and the  services that they need following their service.   To all our veterans, thank you for your service. May God bless you,  and may God continue to bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
