 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, after today, there will be no doubt  which party is working to solve the problems in our country and which  party is accelerating us toward an unnecessary, avoidable disaster.   Let me say that again without interruption.   Madam President, after today, there will be no doubt--no doubt--about  which party in this Chamber is working to solve the problems that face  our country and which party is accelerating us toward unnecessary,  avoidable disaster.   At the end of last week, I filed cloture on proceeding to the  continuing resolution sent to us by the House of Representatives,  which, among other things, would prevent a government shutdown and  suspend the debt limit so we can pay for our debts incurred during the  previous administration.   In a few hours, we will vote on cloture on a motion to proceed to  this bill. The Democrats will do the responsible thing, the right  thing, and the thing that has been done for decades by both parties and  vote yes.   Now, if Republicans follow through with their plans to vote no, they  will be on record deliberately sabotaging our country's ability to pay  the bills and likely causing the first ever default in American  history. The consequences of a default would be, in the words of  Secretary Yellen, ``catastrophic.''   The best case scenario is--the best case under this awful situation  is--that our country would fall into another recession, potentially  erasing all the progress we have made to pull ourselves out of the  COVID crisis. That is if we are lucky. Otherwise, one analysis warned  that default could hurt Americans for generations--for generations.  Interest costs would be higher and not go down very quickly, and that  has huge effects on so many different people, and that is only one of  the effects of default.   So I want my Republican colleagues to think carefully about the  practical consequences of what they are doing. A default means, quite  simply, the government cannot pay its bills. It means that suddenly the  government is presented with unimaginable options. Do they tell seniors  they won't get their Social Security checks, or veterans that they  won't see their benefits, or tell our military that they won't be  getting paid?   And the consequences on Main Street would be equally severe. A  default would very likely send markets crashing and interest rates  skyrocketing, making it harder for small businesses to make ends meet,  for homeowners and renters to pay the bills, and for consumers to keep  our economy going.   All of the consequences--or so many of the consequences--can be  boiled down into three frightening numbers: 6 million, 9, $15  trillion--6 million jobs lost, 9 percent unemployment, $15 trillion in  squandered household wealth. Let me say that again. Those are  devastating numbers on so many households throughout America, just  about every household. That is 6 million jobs lost, 9 percent  unemployment, $15 trillion in squandered household wealth.   Yes, that is what we are potentially looking at if Republicans get  their irresponsible and reckless way. None of this needs to happen-- none of it. The only reason we are here and the only reason this is  even a possibility is because Republicans are making this a possibility  by preventing the government from paying its bills. It is an unhinged  position to take, one that not long ago only the most radical elements  of the Republican Party would have embraced.  [[Page S6684]]    There is no scenario on God's green Earth where it should be worth  risking millions of jobs, trillions in household wealth, people's  Social Security checks, veterans' benefits, and another recession, just  to score a short-term, meaningless political point. That is what  Republicans seem fixated on doing.   Now, there is a very simple step we can take today to guarantee the  government won't default and won't shut down. Both sides can come  together to vote yes on today's vote and vote to pass the continuing  resolution. Just as Democrats worked in a bipartisan fashion under the  Trump administration, Republicans must now step up to the plate. To do  otherwise is the height of recklessness and irresponsibility.   Republicans say they don't want to see a government shutdown. They  say they don't want to see our government default on our debt. Then,  they should vote yes. It is plain and simple. It is very clear. There  is no obfuscation here--crystal clear. Voting yes means avoiding  default and avoiding a government shutdown. Voting no says: Let's risk  it. Let's risk it.   By choosing to block today's resolution, Republicans are  intentionally making default more likely. By blocking an extension of  the debt limit, Republicans will solidify themselves for a long time as  the party of default.   I cannot emphasize that this isn't just another political game. We  are facing a parade of horribles that will hurt every single American  in this country. And it is important to remember that today's vote will  also advance a number of priorities besides just funding the government  and avoiding default, as important as those are. It would provide  desperately needed emergency funding for millions of people affected by  natural disasters from this summer, including hurricanes, wildfires,  and flooding across Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. It will provide  billions to help resettle Afghan refugees who risked their lives  helping our troops abroad. Both sides claim they support these  priorities. So the easy answer is to vote yes later today.   Being elected to office means sometimes you have to do things to rise  above partisan politics. It means we have an obligation to work  together when our country faces an acute crisis. Tearing the barn down  is easy. Building it up, preserving it, and keeping it standing year  after year takes hard work and cooperation. And, at the end of the day,  the only thing that matters in this Chamber is how its Members vote.   Rest assured, Democrats will vote today to do the right thing. The  American people will be watching whether or not our Republican  colleagues choose to vote in favor of preserving our full faith and  credit or vote in favor of an unprecedented default.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I enter a motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote.    Now, Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone  understands exactly what has happened here on the Senate floor. The  Republican Party has now become the party of default, the party that  says America doesn't pay its debts.   Our country is staring down the barrel of two totally Republican- manufactured disasters--a government shutdown and a first-ever default  on the national debt. The impacts of both would gravely harm every  single American in this country. Republicans would let the country  default for the first time in history.   A few moments ago, the Senate had an opportunity to begin solving  these problems right away. Democrats did their part and voted yes, but  Senate Republicans meanwhile voted to drive our country straight toward  a government shutdown and the first default in our country's history.   Let me be clear. What the Republicans in the Senate did tonight is  not normal. This isn't your typical Washington practice, and it  shouldn't be treated as such. It has far more severe consequences than  the typical political cat fight. Republicans know the consequences of  their obstruction. They know a default would likely create a recession.  They know that middle-class families will suffer immensely. They have  heard the same warnings that we have. And by many calculations, the  Republican default will raise the deficit by more than the American  Rescue Plan, and yet Republicans still obstructed tonight.   It is one of the most reckless, one of the most irresponsible votes I  have seen take place in the Senate, and it should send a signal to  every family, small business, market watcher about who in this Chamber  is in favor of endangering the economic stability of our country and  who isn't.   Let me repeat: The Republican Party has solidified itself as the  party of default, and it will be the American people who pay the price.  Social Security checks, Medicare benefits, veterans benefits, small  business--all this and more are now on the chopping block because  Senate Republicans are playing games with the full faith and credit of  the United States.   Now, despite Republican intransigence, this matter cannot be set  aside for even a moment. Before the vote, I changed my vote from yes to  no in order to reserve the option on additional action on the House- passed legislation.   Keeping the government open and preventing a default is vital to our  country's future, and we will be taking further action to prevent this  from happening this week.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 264.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 159.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, September 27, be  waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Tuesday, September 28; that following the prayer and the pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the leaders be reserved for their use later in  the day, and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Donfried nomination, with the time until 11:30  a.m. equally divided prior to a vote on the nomination; further, that  following the disposition of the Donfried nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the Medina nomination and immediately recess until  2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed on Tuesday, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    For the information of Senators, the first rollcall on  the confirmation of the Donfried nomination will be at 11:30 a.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Sullivan.
