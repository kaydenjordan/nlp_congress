 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Virginia  for yielding. I really thank him for his leadership on this issue.   The last time I spoke on this floor on immigration, I talked about  three principles: One, Americans have the right to determine who  becomes citizens through laws; two, the people who do come here should  be in the best interest of American citizens; and three, that we have  the right to enforce those choices.   The people who do come here should be in the best interest of  American citizens. That is key. What we are doing now isn't there yet.  We allow, today, one individual to get a green card. Then he is able to  sponsor his immediate family and relatives. And then the relatives can  sponsor their relatives. Then the relatives of those relatives can  sponsor their relatives and so on, until there is no one in the family  left to sponsor or no one left who  [[Page H1206]]  even wants to come to the United States.   Potentially, this could go on forever. This is called chain  migration, and 65 percent of our green cards are awarded through this  chain migration. That is about 700,000 people every year gaining  permanent residence in our country through no other criteria than that  they happen to be related to someone who lives here.   We have no idea whether these individuals are going to be  economically successful. We have no idea whether they will contribute  to our country. We don't even look at those characteristics for chain  migration. The important question is who the immigrant is related to,  not whether or not he might help America be a safer or a more  prosperous country. Chain migration does not meet that key principle.  American immigration should be in the best interest of Americans.   The Securing America's Future Act ends this chain migration. It stops  it for everyone except the children and spouses of immigrants. But  those relatives cannot bring in additional immigrants, so the chain is  broken. The Securing America's Future Act, in turn, replaces those  immigrants with skilled workers, workers who could help us build a  better future.   I think about it this way: there are 150 million people around the  world who would say that they would emigrate to the United States if  they were just given the opportunity. What a great country. We could do  what we do now and let those people enter on the basis of who they are  related to. That is what we are doing. Or we could let in the best  engineers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and businessmen. We can let in  those who could speak English well, who know our system of government,  who have gone to university. But that can only happen if we end chain  migration.   The chain migration proposal in the Securing America's Future Act  becomes even more crucial when we look at the DACA issue. If we allow  DACA recipients to get some form of residency, past history tells us  that they will potentially sponsor around 3\1/2\ immigrants each. That  is a 2- to 3-million-person increase in the immigrant population. That  is a huge incentive for future immigrants to come here illegally.                                time  1300    The notion that you will get to bring your whole family over here if  you manage to enter illegally is part of what led to the 2013-2014  border crisis. When the previous administration was rumored to be  granting amnesty, tens of thousands of Latin American families sent  their minor children north.   It was a national emergency, and it overwhelmed the Border Patrol and  the immigrant processing facilities there in the Southwest. We had to  pass emergency appropriations just to process these individuals. Any  DACA fix that does not also include additional border security and  protections against those migrating this way, they could really see a  similar crisis.   Madam Speaker, the Securing America's Future Act is an incredible  piece of legislation. And while I have dwelt on its chain migration  provisions--and there are many more worthy reforms--this bill cracks  down on sanctuary cities, which my colleague mentioned earlier. It  includes Kate's Law to toughen penalties against those who are  deported, come back to the United States, and commit crimes. It  includes mandatory E-Verify to crack down on businesses that break the  law. It ends the diversity visa lottery, one of the most senseless  Federal policies that I can think of.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his efforts on this; I thank  Representative Labrador, one of our staunchest conservative leaders in  the House, for his leadership in crafting this bill; and I thank  Representative Garrett for organizing this opportunity to discuss the  bill.
