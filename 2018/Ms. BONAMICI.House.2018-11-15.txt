 Mr. Speaker, it is National Apprenticeship Week and  Women in Apprenticeship Day, and I want to highlight the potential for  apprenticeships to get people into good-paying jobs.   When I visit communities across northwest Oregon, I hear from many  Oregonians who feel left behind and left out of the economic recovery.  Far too many families are still struggling to make ends meet.   Their wages are stagnant, and they feel overwhelmed by rising rent  prices, barriers to transportation, and skyrocketing costs of  childcare. They can't save for retirement or for their kids to go to  college. They need access to good-paying jobs so they can support  themselves and their families.   Workforce development programs can assist them, particularly  assisting those who have barriers to employment. Good workforce  policies can help them access the education, training, credentials, and  support services they need to secure living-wage jobs. Good workforce  policies create opportunities for employers to align training with the  skills they need.   As we recognize National Apprenticeship Week and Women in  Apprenticeship Day, we must commit to strengthening apprenticeships and  work-based learning programs. Investing in these programs will help  more people access better-paying, stable careers and provide our  businesses with a workforce that will improve productivity and  efficiency.   In the district I represent, the Oregon Manufacturing Innovation  Center, or OMIC, is bringing together industry leaders like Boeing with  local colleges, including Portland Community College, Oregon Institute  of Technology, Oregon State University, and Portland State University,  to develop a registered apprenticeship program. This collaboration will  result in growth, innovation, and efficiency in advanced manufacturing  and a more skilled workforce.   OMIC is a tremendous opportunity for Oregonians and exactly the kind  of partnership that brings value to our communities and to our economy.  I was proud to help secure funding for OMIC through the Economic  Development Administration, and I look forward to seeing its continued  growth and the opportunities it will bring to northwest Oregon and our  region and our future manufacturing workforce.   Although some employers recognize the importance of recruiting and  training all working people, across the country, the representation of  women in the trades remains quite low. In Oregon, we are leading the  way. Women's participation in registered apprenticeship programs is  more than double the national average, demonstrating the value of  organizations like Oregon Tradeswomen, with the mission dedicated to  promoting success for women in the trades through education,  leadership, and mentorship.   We can help increase the presence of programs like Oregon Tradeswomen  across the country by increasing funding for the Women in  Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations grants, and, of course,  by supporting the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.   To help Oregonians and many other Americans who still face job  insecurity, we must expand work-based learning to industries that lack  established apprenticeship programs, like healthcare and technology,  especially in startups.   Unfortunately, small- and medium-sized businesses often do not have  the resources to establish work-based learning programs on their own.  Industry partnerships like those at OMIC solve this challenge by  bringing together employers, educational institutions, training  providers, and local organizations to support the creation and  expansion of work-based learning programs that benefit workers and the  economy as a whole.   I have worked with my colleague from Georgia, Congressman Drew  Ferguson, to introduce the Promoting Apprenticeships through Regional  Training Networks for Employers' Required Skills, or PARTNERS, Act.   This bipartisan bill would use existing dollars to invest in industry  partnerships to help businesses recruit workers, develop training  curriculums, and provide workers with access to tools, work attire,  transportation, childcare services, and mentorship support. These  support services help businesses retain employees and help workers  balance caring for and providing for  [[Page H9530]]  their families while they are learning new skills.   The PARTNERS Act and funding for the Workforce Innovation Opportunity  Act are two pieces of the greater need to invest in apprenticeships and  other paid on-the-job training programs.   During National Apprenticeship Week, I stand ready to continue the  fight for policies that can help more people access better-paying jobs  and meet the demands of our local employers.                            ____________________
