 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and my good friend,  Mr. McGovern, for the kind words.   What we did here was simple. It is not always simple to get through  the legislative process, but what we attempted to do was reauthorize a  bill that hadn't been authorized. Appropriated dollars were being  spent.   It has been the focus of the Republican Congress to make sure we  reauthorize programs, and we do that to fix things that have gone wrong  over the years or because a changing environment has occurred.   The last time the bill was really authorized was 2002. Fast-forward  15 years, there are things changed. The authorization amount was set.  We actually spent more than the authorization amount.   People love this program, but we have got to update it to the modern  day, and we need to fix some of the items. Those are reflected in this  bill, and I appreciate the Rules Committee hearing the debate,  addressing some of the concerns, and deciding that this bill can come  to the floor. As it was stated, no amendments were offered to debate on  this floor, which I think is a great process.   Simply put, I have a friend from Houston, Texas, who is very proud of  the Houston Astros, and he will cite Minute Maid Park. Minute Maid Park  is on a brownfields. So if you looked at the World Series and you saw  that beautiful facility, well, that is the result of the brownfields  program that we are now trying to update and fix.  [[Page H9482]]    The stats are pretty clear. I mean, you get a $16 return for every  dollar we put in at the Federal level. That is a great return on  investment. Jobs are increased by every projection, and even local land  values around the brownfields, the property values increase around  them. This and more will be debated and discussed when we bring the  bill to the floor tomorrow. This rule helps us do that.    Mr. Speaker, one other thing I will end on, and I know  we will have a lot of debate and frustration and controversy, but this  did go through regular order. We had a hearing. We had a subcommittee  mark. As Mr. McGovern mentioned, we had a full committee mark. We  invested with our Democratic colleagues--they brought some ideas; some  were accepted; some were rejected; some of the ones that we had they  rejected--and we have a pretty good product to bring as part of this  rule.   I would ask my colleagues to support the rule so we can bring the  bill to the floor, and I thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for  making it happen.
