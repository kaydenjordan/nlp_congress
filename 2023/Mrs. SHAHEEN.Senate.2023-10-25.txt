 Madam President, I wish to speak against this  amendment. It would hurt low-income families and saddle them with  higher energy costs.   The updates that HUD has proposed are estimated to generate cost  savings of almost 35 percent over current standards and to reduce  carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 2.2 million tons.   That will amount to savings of $74 million a year or a total of $1  billion to $1\1/2\ billion over 30 years. Now, that is real money that  households, particularly in northern climates like New Hampshire, can  use for other needs and millions of tons of carbon dioxide that are  kept out of the atmosphere.   The fact is the current standards are outdated; and by law, HUD and  USDA are supposed to update their standards within 1 year of industry  revisions.   This amendment would prevent them from doing that. It will raise  costs. And as Rob Portman and I worked since 2011, energy efficiency is  the fastest, cheapest way to deal with our energy needs. We need to  vote down this amendment. It is no good.               Vote on Amendment No. 1237 to Amendment No. 1092
