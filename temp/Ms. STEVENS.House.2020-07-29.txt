 Mr. Speaker, we have a childcare crisis in America.   In Michigan, when our auto manufacturers had to stop producing to  address the impacts of COVID-19 and we saw production orders go to  zero, with that, our daycare centers witnessed and experienced a  dramatic drop in participation. Today, 40 percent of daycare providers  in Michigan are at risk of imminent closure.   We say, ``Let's get back to work. We are ready to get back to work.  We want to get back to work safely,'' but we need our daycare centers.  We need the Child Care Is Essential Act because of the very fact that  childcare is essential in America.   This is too much of an impediment for the hardworking people in  Michigan and across this country, and it is a long overdue and realized  endeavor that we must take on to address the coronavirus pandemic and  what we need to do to get back to work safely in America.
