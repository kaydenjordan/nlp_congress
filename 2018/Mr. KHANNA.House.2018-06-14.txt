 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a sad story of what  happens when we do not value our workers' safety.   Cynthia Palomata was a nurse from the bay area who worked in the  county jail. She complained to her supervisors that her work area had  insufficient lighting for reviewing paperwork. Rather than updating the  lighting system or providing her with a secured light fixture, she was  given a common desk lamp. One day, she was treating a patient, and when  her back was turned, the patient grabbed the lamp and hit her over the  head, knocking her into a coma. She never woke up.   Every year, thousands of Americans are killed while at work, more  than 4,000 in 2015 alone. That is why we have introduced, on a  bipartisan basis, the Healthcare Workplace Violence Prevention Act, to  stop tragedies like Cynthia's from ever taking place again. It is  bipartisan and it is common sense.   The bill requires facilities to create violence prevention plans that  address all levels of safety. Healthcare and social service workers  face high risk.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Raskin for his  leadership in putting focus on the Poor People's Campaign and his  advocacy for so many issues of economic justice and racial justice.   I want to join my colleagues in recognizing the extraordinary moment  in this country that the Poor People's Campaign has had under Reverend  Barber's leadership. There was a panel that Senator Warren had a few  days ago where Reverend Barber was there and ordinary individuals were  testifying about their experiences, the people we should be hearing in  Congress.   I want to share two quotes, and then share some testimony.   One is what Reverend Barber said, which, in my view, makes him one of  the great civil rights leaders in this country. He said:         I would rather join with you and die trying to change the       moral direction of this Nation than to live and die and it be       written on my epitaph: ``Lived in the time when moral dissent       was necessary. And he, and they, said nothing.''    That requires such courage, and it is so believable.   When Dr. Barber was with a number of others at the hearing, they had  this chant that before the Poor People's Campaign will fail, they will  go to jail. And that sense of civil disobedience for a moral cause is  part of the great tradition of our Nation and what has brought change.   I want to thank Reverend Barber for being such a moral leader and  everyone who is risking arrest, risking their life for justice.   Now, I am honored to read the testimony of Paul Boden, who is the  Western Regional Advocacy Project lead in my home State of California.  He writes:         My name is Paul Boden, and I am with the Western Regional       Advocacy Project lead. We are based out of California,       Colorado, and Oregon with core member groups doing local       organizing around poverty and homelessness issues in 10       communities. I am testifying today about the advent of       contemporary homelessness in the early 1980s and the       connection to neoliberal economics and how that has played       out over the past 35 years.        In doing this research, we found that with 2 less attack       submarines, 29 less fighter jets, and 2 less combat ships, we       would more than triple all of the funding that is currently       dedicated to public housing capital investments, public       housing maintenance, and all of the Federal homeless       programs. Clearly, these spending priorities have nothing to       do with security or the need for an investment in our       military complex.        As part of the consequence of the advent of homelessness       that this kind of approach to governance created, we've       spoken to 1,600 homeless communities, and 82 percent of them       have reported that they are getting arrested, harassed, and       ticketed. And we know the fines-and-fee-games that local       governments play. 77 percent of these people are getting that       same kind of policing activity for sitting or laying down on       a sidewalk. 75 percent for loitering. Sleeping, standing, and       sitting are criminal offenses when you are the population       that is being targeted by local government for removal from       those communities. And this is happening, unfortunately, in       communities across the United States.        My research also brought out very clearly and undeniably       that these are the same policing programs, these are the same       laws, the same racist and classist policing programs that       were used with the Anti-Okie laws, with the Sundown towns,       with the Japanese-American Exclusion Act, with the ugly laws,       and with the Jim Crow laws. The darker your skin color, the       greater your disability, the poorer you are, you are way more       likely to be a target of these policing programs, and that is       the way it has been playing out for years.        We have written legislation and gotten it introduced in       California, Oregon, and Colorado. We had introduced it 8       times. We got crushed 8 times. But we are going to keep       bringing it back until the final answer is yes. Our law, our       legislation would make it illegal for local government to       criminalize life-sustaining activities and activities that we       all commit: eating, sleeping, sitting, standing still. We all       do that. To criminalize doing it is to purposely and       maliciously create legislation specifically aimed at       enforcement only applying to some people. That is us, all of       us.    Paul Boden's words are ones I hope this entire country will hear. And  as we are listening to the voices of so many people marching in our  streets in Washington, I hope we will take some inspiration from their  courage, their courage far exceeding any of ours in this body, and be  inspired to do the  [[Page H5191]]  right thing and fight for economic justice and the policies that they  recommend that would help alleviate poverty and help the working poor  and poor people across this Nation.
