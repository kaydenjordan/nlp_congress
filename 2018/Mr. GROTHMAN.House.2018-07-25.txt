 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this bill.   As anybody who talks to the average person knows, in this country  today, we have a huge labor shortage of people ready to do the type of  jobs that industry needs.   I have more manufacturing jobs in my district than any other  congressman around the country, and the number one problem we have is  we can't find people to do those jobs. We all have medical facilities  around this country, and again and again, nurses or other skilled  people are not available for the huge number of job openings that are  out there.   Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people  getting 4-year degrees or part of 4-year degrees and not finding jobs  that pay anywhere near as good as some of the jobs you can get at a  technical school.   Earlier this morning I looked at a local technical school here in  town that had a demonstration project on some of the robotics training  that they are doing, and we had people who are starting at $25, $30,  $35 an hour, and that is before overtime. And these people, because the  degrees take only 2 years to get and frequently allow you to live at  home, are graduating without debt, unlike many people who have been  foolishly told to go to a 4-year college and are not getting a lot out  of it.   So I am pleased today to vote for the Career and Technical Education  for the 21st Century Act, which will also reduce, to a degree,  paperwork required by the Federal Government.    Mr. Speaker, I would also just like to thank those  businesses out there that are training people out there without the  benefit of government education at all, because those are also  sometimes frequently very good jobs.
