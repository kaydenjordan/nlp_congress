 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 24 million  Americans losing their health insurance, including 60,000 residents in  my home of Pinellas County, Florida. Florida is the number one State  with Affordable Care Act enrollments--number one. We stand to lose the  most with this repeal.   But what we are debating this week is far worse than just a repeal.  It is how the new bill treats the least among us. Medicaid, which the  poor and disabled depend on, would be devastated, leaving an estimated  3.5 million children and 720,000 disabled Americans without care.   There are a lot of people here today in the Nation's Capital in  wheelchairs, trying to make this point to all of us. What could be more  cruel than taking away health care for all of them?   This is a misguided proposal. We must work together to improve health  care, bring down costs, expand access, and protect the most vulnerable  in our society.   Mr. Speaker, people's lives are on the line with this vote tomorrow.  Let's do the right thing. Reject this bill.                            ____________________
