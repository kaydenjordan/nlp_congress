 Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to  this resolution of disapproval.   Clean water was not always a partisan issue, and no issue has more  support among American families than the protection of our Nation's  waters. Now is the worst time to lower our guard on protecting clean  water as over half of the United States is experiencing drought  conditions. Even though we have had rain, we are still in drought  conditions. We need to be doing everything to ensure our cities, our  businesses, and our farmers have sufficient, safe, and sustainable  supplies of water to meet our economic and agricultural needs, our  quality-of-life needs, and our day-to-day survival.   This is especially true in my home State of California. As the  Metropolitan Water District, the biggest in the area, commented at our  subcommittee last month, the definition of WOTUS is central to the  Clean Water Act's implementation and has significant implications for  water agencies' day-to-day operations and for water source protection  efforts.   That is why I support the efforts of the Biden administration to  permanently repeal the previous administration's dirty water rule, a  rule that eliminated Federal protections on a minimum of 75 percent of  streams and wetlands that have been protected by the act since its  inception.   These waters and the wetlands are critical to capturing and storing  rain and snowmelt to ensure the long-term supply of water and recharge  our underground water aquifers.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand how this resolution, which seeks to  undermine and confuse agency efforts to protect our clean water, makes  any sense to my constituents who are already making sacrifices to  protect our local waters.   This resolution would increase levels of pollution in our  waterbodies, increase risk of downstream flooding, and make it harder  for communities like mine to maintain sustainable sources of drinking  water.   Worst of all, hardworking American families would have to pay for the  horrible impacts of this resolution. The Biden rule provided the best  available  [[Page H1225]]  option to balance the need for protection of waters with the desire for  familiarity and workability within the constraints of the law and  interpretations of the Supreme Court. This resolution achieves none of  those outcomes and is only more likely to make it worse, not better.   Mr. Speaker, I very strongly oppose the resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy from the Executive Office of the President on H.J. Res. 27,  providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5,  United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of the  Army, Corps of Engineers, Department of Defense and the Environmental  Protection Agency relating to ``Revised Definition of `Waters of the  United States.' ''                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.J. Res. 27--Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8  of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department      of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Department of Defense and the    Environmental Protection Agency relating to ``Revised Definition of  `Waters of the United States' ''--Rep. Graves, R-MO, and 170 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.J. Res.       27, a joint resolution to disapprove ``Revised Definition of       `Waters of the United States' '' (``final rule''). The final       rule's definition of ``waters of the United States''       carefully sets the bounds for what activities are regulated       by the federal government under the Clean Water Act. The       final rule provides clear rules of the road that will help       advance infrastructure projects, economic investments, and       agricultural activities--all while protecting water quality.       The rule reestablishes critical protections for the nation's       vital water resources by returning to the longstanding 1986       regulations with appropriate updates, exclusions, and       streamlining clarifications. This pre-2015 approach to       ``waters of the United States'' provides regulatory certainty       and reflects the agencies' long experience, the best       available science, and extensive stakeholder engagement. In       comparison, H.J. Res. 27 would leave Americans without a       clear ``waters of the United States'' definition. The       increased uncertainty would threaten economic growth,       including for agriculture, local economies, and downstream       communities. Farmers would be left wondering whether       artificially irrigated areas remain exempt or not.       Construction crews would be left wondering whether their       waterfilled gravel pits remain exempt or not. Compared to the       kind of uncertain, fragmented, and watered-down regulatory       system that H.J. Res. 27 might compel, the final rule will       secure substantial and valuable benefits each year in       critical flood protections, enhanced water quality, and the       treasured recreational activities--fishing, swimming,       boating, and more--that fill the lives and livelihoods of       tens of millions of U.S. households that depend on healthy       wetlands and streams.        If Congress were to pass H.J. Res. 27, the President would       veto it.                                time  1300
