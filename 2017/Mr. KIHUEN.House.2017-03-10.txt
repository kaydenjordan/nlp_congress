 Mr. Speaker, I have a new name for the process  Republicans are using to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Instead of  repeal and replace, how about we name it ``we cut and gut''? Cut taxes  for millionaires and billionaires, and gut coverage for hardworking  Americans.   The bill would also undermine the Medicaid expansion in the  Affordable Care Act. In Nevada, our own Governor Brian Sandoval, a  Republican, made the decision to work with Democrats and expand the  Medicaid program. Because we expanded Medicaid, 320,000 Nevadans now  have health coverage, and Nevada's uninsured rate has dropped from 23  percent to 12 percent, one of the largest declines in the entire  country.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would ask my Republican colleagues: Do you really  want to turn your backs on hardworking families just to give  billionaires a tax cut that they don't need or deserve?   Mr. Speaker, the silence is deafening.                            ____________________
