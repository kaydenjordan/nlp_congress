 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call upon this august  body for a favorable vote on H.R. 1619. That is a very interesting  number for this legislation. This legislation is known as the Catawba  Indian Nation Lands Act.   The Catawba Indian Nation Lands Act clarifies that the Catawba Indian  Nation is subject to the well-established rules and regulations of the  Indian Gaming Regulatory Act on their modern and ancestral lands in the  State of North Carolina.   This legislation will clarify the Tribe's 1993 Land Claims Settlement  Act and reaffirm recent action taken by the Department of the Interior  to take land into trust for the Tribe.   Most importantly, this bipartisan legislation is a very significant  step toward rectifying historic injustices that have been perpetrated  against the Catawba Indian Nation.   Like, in many other instances of current effects of historical  inequities, the Catawba Nation experiences high unemployment and  poverty rates causing many of its citizens to rely upon Federal and  State governments for basic social services.   The enactment of this legislation is critical to helping the Catawba  Indian Nation secure economic self-sufficiency as Congress originally  intended when it passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988.   Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask my colleagues for a favorable vote  on this Act.
