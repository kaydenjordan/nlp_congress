 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate something that  hasn't happened in Iowa for over 110 years.   Last Friday night, two schools from the same community met in the  Boys Class 2A State Basketball Championship. It just so happened that  the two schools are from my hometown, Hull, Iowa, a community of 2,500  people. The game was an incredible game where Western Christian ended  up winning by 6 points at the end.   With this win, Wolfpack, from Western Christian, set another record,  being the first school to have 10 State championships in the State.   Congratulations to Boyden-Hull on an incredible season, and  congratulations to Western Christian on being the 2A State Champions of  Iowa. Both teams make me proud. Both teams make Iowa proud. Both teams  make Hull proud.   Madam Speaker, I can truly say this: Hull, Iowa, is the capital of  basketball in Iowa.                            ____________________
