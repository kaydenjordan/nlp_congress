 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my great friend,  Rabbi Gary Klein, who has led the Temple Ahavat Shalom of Palm Harbor,  Florida, for the past 30 years.   Temple Ahavat Shalom is a congregation that serves nearly 500  households in my district. Since coming to Pinellas County in 1987, he  served on the board of the St. Leo University Center for Catholic- Jewish studies and currently serves on the National Council of AIPAC.   Rabbi Klein is a long-time advocate on behalf of the U.S.-Israel  alliance.   As co-chair of the Congressional Hellenic Israeli Alliance, I welcome  his continued advice and counsel, especially as it relates to security  in the Eastern Mediterranean.   For several years now, I have joined Rabbi Klein and the congregation  for Passover Seder, and I very much look forward to continuing this  tradition.   I am thankful for his friendship, and I wish him many more years of  blessed leadership.                            ____________________
