Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3051, America's Conservation  Enhancement Act.   This bill is an example of Democrats and Republicans coming together  to pass legislation to benefit nature, fishermen, hunters, and nature  enthusiasts of all kinds.   Mr. Speaker, I thank and commend my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle and the Hill for their hard work on this very important piece of  legislation.   I am greatly appreciative of Representative Mike Thompson for his  leadership in the House and for Senators Barrasso and Carper for  getting this package through the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I also commend the numerous bipartisan Members of  Congress for their critical contributions to this legislation.   The ACE Act could not come at a more necessary time, as we are  reckoning with the tragic and dangerous impacts of the climate crisis.  Scientists around the world are sounding the alarm that we are on the  cusp of an extinction crisis caused by human impacts. The ACE Act  protects and enhances wildlife and habitat throughout the country, and  reduces conflicts between wildlife, humans, and livestock.   According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, three-quarters of the terrestrial  environment and about two-thirds of the marine environment have been  significantly altered by human actions.   Protecting habitat is one of the most important things we can do for  biodiversity and climate resiliency, and this bill accomplishes that in  several ways.   It conserves wetlands by reauthorizing the popular and successful  North American Wetlands Conservation Act.   It protects the largest estuary in the country, the Chesapeake Bay,  by creating and reauthorizing several programs that restore the Bay and  promote its resilience to climate change.   It also authorizes an innovative program called the National Fish  Habitat Partnership, which leverages public-private partnerships to  enhance fish habitat across the country, benefiting not only the fish,  but the strong tradition of angling in this country.   Hunters, who are some of our best conservationists in this country,  will be pleased to hear that this legislation contains provisions to  combat chronic wasting disease, or CWD, a fatal disease that impacts  animals like deer, elk, and moose, and which is spreading and has now  been found in 26 States across this country.   Invasive species are also a growing threat to biodiversity throughout  the United States, and they are managed by a multitude of agencies.  Crucially, this bill addresses this issue by requiring Federal agencies  to consult with one another and with stakeholders when developing  strategic plans for invasive species.   The ACE Act also contains a bipartisan provision that I worked on  with my colleague, Congressman   Don Young, for a long-term  reauthorization of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. This  strong, bipartisan program has a track record of success, and will  continue to play a vital role in safeguarding our environmental legacy.   Finally, the ACE Act addresses conflicts between wildlife, livestock,  and humans. The legislation creates a prize competition to spur  innovations that reduce conflicts between humans and predator species.  It also addresses losses of livestock due to depredation by federally- protected species.   With the ever-encroaching human footprint, there will inevitably be  more conflicts between us and wildlife, and these provisions offer a  responsible pathway forward.   During the pandemic, so many Americans have found respite in nature.  Whether you are a hiker, an angler, a hunter, a bird-watcher, or just a  wildlife enthusiast, it is so important that we protect the iconic  wildlife and habitat across our Nation. Particularly in the face of the  climate crisis, the time to act is now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation  to protect species and habitat.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The ACE Act is the culmination of months of bipartisan work between  the House, the Senate, committee staff, and key stakeholders.   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Wittman, who is managing this bill  today, and all of my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee. But  so many people have worked to get us here, and for me, it is almost a  special moment because decades of work have resulted--today is the  opening of the Detroit International Wildlife Refuge, which will  benefit from this legislation. It makes me kind of emotional today.   This passage will authorize critical funding for America's fish and  wildlife habitat. It is an example of what happens when we all come  together to protect our natural resources.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5126) to require individuals fishing for Gulf reef fish to  use certain descending devices, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5126         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Direct Enhancement of       Snapper Conservation and the Economy through Novel Devices       Act of 2020'' or the ``DESCEND Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that commercial and       recreational fishermen (which, for the purpose of this Act       shall include charter fishing) for Gulf reef fish are       expected to use a venting tool or a descending device       required for possession under section 3 when releasing fish       that are exhibiting signs of barotrauma. The Secretary of       Commerce (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), in       coordination with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management       Council, should develop and disseminate to fishermen       education and outreach materials related to proper use of       venting tools and descending devices, and strongly encourage       their use by commercial and recreational fishermen when       releasing fish that are exhibiting signs of barotrauma.       SEC. 3. REQUIRED POSSESSION OF DESCENDING DEVICES.         (a) Required Gear in the Gulf Reef Fish Fishery.--Title III       of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management       Act (16 U.S.C. 1851 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following:       ``SEC. 321. REQUIRED POSSESSION OF DESCENDING DEVICES.         ``(a) Require Gear in the Gulf Reef Fish Fishery.--It shall       be unlawful for a person on board a commercial or       recreational vessel to fish for Gulf reef fish in the Gulf of       Mexico Exclusive Economic Zone without possessing on board       the vessel a venting tool or a descending device that is       rigged and ready for use while fishing is occurring.        ``(b) Savings Clause.--No provision of this section shall       be interpreted to affect any program or activity carried out       by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council established       by the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist       Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States       Act of 2012 (33 U.S.C. 1321 note), or any project contained       in an approved Restoration Plan developed by any Natural       Resources Damage Assessment Trustee Implementation Group to       reduce post-release mortality from barotrauma in Gulf of       Mexico Reef Fish Recreational Fisheries.        ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Descending device.--The term `descending device'       means an instrument that--        ``(A) will release fish at a depth sufficient for the fish       to be able to recover from the effects of barotrauma;        ``(B) is a weighted hook, lip clamp, or box that will hold       the fish while it is lowered to depth, or another device       determined to be appropriate by the Secretary; and        ``(C) is capable of--        ``(i) releasing the fish automatically;        ``(ii) releasing the fish by actions of the operator of the       device; or        ``(iii) allowing the fish to escape on its own.        ``(2) Venting tool.--The term `venting tool' has the       meaning given to it by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management       Council.        ``(3) Gulf reef fish.--The term `Gulf reef fish' means any       fish chosen by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council       that is in the reef Fishery Management Plan for the purposes       of this Act.''.        (b) Civil Penalties.--Section 308(a) of the Magnuson-      Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C.       1858(a)) is amended by inserting ``or section 321'' after       ``section 307''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall       take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of this       Act.        (d) Conforming Amendment.--Title III of the table of       contents of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and       Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1851 et seq.) is amended by       striking the item relating to section 305 and all that       follows through the end of the items relating to such title       and inserting the following:  ``Sec. 305.

(d) Follow-Up Report.--Not later than 3 years after       developing minimum standards and developing the assessment       and monitoring plan under subsection (c), the Secretary shall       provide a detailed report on implementation to the Committee       on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and       the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5126, the creatively and aptly  named Direct Enhancement of Snapper Conservation and the Economy  Through Novel Devices Act, or the DESCEND Act.   This bill requires every commercial and recreational fisherman to  possess a venting tool or a descending device  [[Page H5177]]  when fishing for reef fish, like the prized red snapper, in the Gulf of  Mexico EEZ.   In addition, the bill requires the Department of Commerce to contract  with the National Academy of Sciences for a report on discard mortality  in Gulf reef fish fisheries.   The bill also requires Commerce and the Gulf Fishery Management  Council to develop guidance for reporting discards and associated  mortality and to develop a plan to assess the effectiveness and usage  of barotrauma-reducing devices.                                time  1515    The United States has some of the most sustainable fisheries in the  world, but the issue of bycatch is still a very serious concern.  Anglers sometimes catch fish that they don't want or are allowed to  keep, so they need to be returned to the ocean. According to some  estimates, global bycatch may amount to 10 percent of the world's total  catch.   However, deepwater reef fish like snapper and grouper experience  pressure changes when they are brought to the surface. This can damage  the fish's swim bladder and even cause death, and it can also leave  injured fish exposed to predators at the surface. If the fish are just  thrown back, it is very likely that they will die, which is both a  waste and unhelpful for promoting healthy fish populations.   Fishers can help reduce this mortality by using a venting tool or a  descending device, which is inexpensive, and ease the pressure changes  in these fish. Similar requirements exist in other parts of the country  but have been held up in the Gulf.   The DESCEND Act would get around the bureaucratic roadblock and  implement this commonsense, proconservation practice. This bill offers  a simple path forward for reducing the mortality of some of the most  prized reef fish in this country, which will serve to create the more  sustainable, profitable, and enjoyable fisheries for anglers in this  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  would inquire whether my colleague has any remaining speakers.    I am prepared to close if the gentleman is, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Graves, for all of the work that he  has done.   There was a lot of discussion that we had in committee on snapper. I  want to thank both of my Republican colleagues and suggest that we go  fishing, because there was a trip with several colleagues here who all  thought I would catch nothing, and I caught more than they all caught  together, so I think we need a bipartisan fishing trip.   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of, again,  the leadership of the Natural Resources Committee, the sportsmen's  groups, and everybody who worked on this to try to find consensus on  something that does matter.   The DESCEND Act will help safeguard our reef ecosystems and help  eliminate bycatch in a sustainable way.   I thank my colleagues for the good work. Some of it got tense. I also  want to thank Representative Huffman for his work on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5068) to authorize the Women Who Worked on the Home Front  Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5068         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women Who Worked on the Home       Front World War II Memorial Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The Women Who Worked on the Home Front       Foundation may establish a commemorative work on Federal land       in the District of Columbia and its environs to commemorate       the commitment and service represented by women who worked on       the home front during World War II.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of women who worked on the home front       foundation.--The Women Who Worked on the Home Front       Foundation shall be solely responsible for acceptance of       contributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the       establishment of the commemorative work under this section.

(2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation shall       transmit the amount of the  [[Page H5179]]       balance to a separate account with the National Park       Foundation for memorials, to be available to the Secretary of       the Interior or Administrator (as appropriate) following the       process provided in section 8906(b)(4) of title 40, United       States Code, for accounts established under section       8906(b)(2) or (3) of title 40, United States Code.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5068, the Women Who  Worked on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act, introduced by  Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. H.R. 5068 would authorize the  establishment of a memorial to commemorate the nearly 19 million women  who worked on the home front during World War II.   With mass male enlistment leaving significant vacancies in the  industrial and defense industries, women across the country filled  thousands of jobs that were historically held by men to support the war  effort and to keep America running.   I am proud of the fact that my district is home to Rosie the  Riveters, which were a good example of women being able to do it.   As the men fought abroad, these women worked in defense plants, flew  military aircraft, delivered mail, and performed countless other duties  necessary to keep the home front running.   In addition to the women working on the home front, nearly 350,000  women served in uniform, both at home and abroad, directly supporting  the war effort as code breakers, as Air Force service pilots, and as  volunteers for organizations such as the Army Nurse Corps.   The work carried out by women on the home front during World War II  opened the door for women to hold more types of jobs than ever before,  and it is long past time that Congress recognized their contributions  to our Nation.   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Norton, for  introducing this important legislation. I would also like to extend my  gratitude to Ms. Raya Kenney, who developed the idea for this memorial  when she was in fifth grade, for her tireless efforts to ensure that  the millions of women who worked on the home front during World War II  are recognized and celebrated.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5068, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and all the leadership on the  Committee on Natural Resources, again, for making this a reality. I  thank my colleague, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, for the work that she  did.   Mr. Speaker, as we are talking about this bill, several years ago  with my then-Republican colleague, Candace Miller, we did the first  honor flight of the Rosie the Riveters. We went to the World War II  Memorial, and it was incredible. But to have a place to take them will  be very special, and I hope we are able to do it while some of them can  appreciate what we are doing.   This bipartisan legislation will honor the 18 million American women  who  [[Page H5180]]  played a key role in our Nation's war effort during World War II  through their efforts on the home front.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3758) to amend the Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act  of 2000 to make certain technical corrections.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3758         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. KLAMATH BASIN WATER SUPPLY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000                     TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS.

SEC. 2. CONTINUED USE OF PICK-SLOAN MISSOURI BASIN PROGRAM                     PROJECT USE POWER BY THE KINSEY IRRIGATION                     COMPANY AND THE SIDNEY WATER USERS IRRIGATION                     DISTRICT.         (a) Authorization.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law and subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of the       Interior (acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation)       shall continue to treat the irrigation pumping units known as       the ``Kinsey Irrigation Company'' in Custer County, Montana       and the ``Sidney Water Users Irrigation District'' in       Richland County, Montana, or any successor to the Kinsey       Irrigation Company or Sidney Water Users Irrigation District,       as irrigation pumping units of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin       Program for the purposes of wheeling, administration, and       payment of project use power, including the applicability of       provisions relating to the treatment of costs beyond the       ability to pay under section 9 of the Act of December 22,       1944 (commonly known as the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'')       (58 Stat. 891, chapter 665).        (b) Limitation.--The quantity of power to be provided to       the Kinsey Irrigation Company and the Sidney Water Users       Irrigation District (including any successor to the Kinsey       Irrigation Company or the Sidney Water Users Irrigation       District) under subsection (a) may not exceed the maximum       quantity of power provided to the Kinsey Irrigation Company       and the Sidney Water Users Irrigation District under the       applicable contract for electric service in effect on the       date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3758, which addresses two issues  regarding Bureau of Reclamation water and power management.   First, the bill amends Klamath Basin Water Supply Enhancement Act of  2000 to support water conservation and efficiency measures in the  Klamath Basin. This bill provides additional authorization for  Reclamation to work with Klamath Basin irrigators on activities that  align water supplies and demand.   Further, this legislation would extend the use of drought relief  funding to certain conservation measures, land idling, and groundwater  uses.   Second, the bill also carries provisions to make two irrigation  districts in eastern Montana eligible to continue to receive project  use power rates from the Bureau of Reclamation.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts from Senators Merkley and Wyden  to advance this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, commend my colleague, Mr. Walden, for his  leadership and trying to bring this together with Mr. Gianforte and  finding an answer. I am going to miss my friend deeply so he better  stay engaged to make sure we do this right.   I thank Mr. Wittman for working with him this afternoon on the  passage of this and several other critical bills. And all the  leadership of the Committee on Natural Resources. And, again, what  happens when Republicans and Democrats work together, we can really get  things done.  [[Page H5183]]    Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help address water conservation  and the power challenges in the Klamath Basin.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545
