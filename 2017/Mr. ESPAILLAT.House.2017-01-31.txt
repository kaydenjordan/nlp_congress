 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to President  Trump's Muslim ban because that is exactly what it is. It is a mean- spirited ban against members of a religious faith. I love my country,  and I am saddened by these divisive and hateful actions being  wrongfully taken in the so-called name of national security.   Mr. Trump's actions make us less secure as a nation. They take a  sledgehammer right through the founding principles of our Nation.  America is not this nonsensical, antirefugee Nation. Quite frankly, Mr.  Trump's actions are un-American, beneath us, and downright dangerous.   Let me remind my colleagues, there has been a protest every day since  Mr. Trump took office. The people have hit the streets. We will  continue to march, and we will keep demanding what is right. We will  keep fighting to ensure American values are upheld and that our civil  rights are not trashed like yesterday's news.   To our Muslims, LGBT, immigrants, women, and all our brothers and  sisters hurt by Mr. Trump's garbage, I mean executive orders, I am with  you.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which will rescind President Trump's executive order to ban  Muslims. Having been at JFK Airport this weekend, I stand in support of  military soldiers who risked their lives and whose family members were  unlawfully detained and questioned, even after their service to our  country. This is un-American.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.                                time  1330
