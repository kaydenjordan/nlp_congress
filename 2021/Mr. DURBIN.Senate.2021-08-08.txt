 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the random violence on the streets of  Chicago results in Monday morning reports that break your heart: 100  people shot on the Fourth of July weekend; the following weekend, 50;  the weekend after that, 70.   It never stops. These mass shootings have become part of life in many  cities across America, and it is a heartbreaking reality.   There are many ways to look at it. I have tried my best to understand  it and to respond from a legislative point of view, but as we kind of  play the possibilities and debate the opportunities we have to change  things, the killing just goes on and on.   The city of Chicago, like many cities in the United States, is awash  in guns--awash in guns. Police--I believe the statistic is--have  confiscated 16,000 so far this year and still counting; thousands and  thousands and thousands of guns.   In the roughest parts of Chicago, you wave a couple of $20 bills and  you have a handgun in a matter of minutes. And there really is no age  check involved; and young kids, as much as older folks, buy these guns  right and left, claiming they are for self-defense and many times just  putting them into the machinery of crime and death that has become such  a predictable part of life in that great city.   Chicagoans across every possible demographic this morning are shocked  and grieving to learn that another Chicago police officer was killed in  the early morning hours.   The slain officer was just 29 years old--29. She was assigned to the  Community Safety Team, a special unit of officers from various  districts who are pooled and sent to the meanest, most dangerous ``hot  spots'' in the city. Her name has not been released.   She and another Chicago police officer were shot last night when they  pulled over a car in the Englewood neighborhood on Chicago South Side.  The second officer is hospitalized as well and fighting for his life.   Two suspects have been arrested, and a third is being sought.   Gun violence and gun deaths are daily threats in many neighborhoods,  neighborhoods where it is easier to find a gun than to find a job.  Sadly, it is increasingly a mortal threat to the Chicago police  officers who work in these neighborhoods.   Several months ago, I had an impromptu, unreported meeting with the  Chicago police force and invited anyone in who wanted to sit with a  Senator and try to explain what is going on. Eight of them showed up  and were pretty well representative of the Chicago police department-- Black, White, Brown; male, female; Hispanic, African American; young  and old--and they talked about the world they lived in and how the odds  were against them on the streets of Chicago.   The bad guys just have too damn many guns, and that is a reality.  They don't buy those guns in the city of Chicago, incidentally. They  buy them outside of Chicago--northwest Indiana, at gun shows, with no  background checks. The gangbangers just take a 15-, 20-minute trip over  the Indiana-Illinois border to a gun show and load up their truck with  more guns, bring them back in, and sell them on the streets of Chicago.  That is a reality.   Guns come from unlikely places. Too many guns come from States like  Louisiana and Mississippi, where they have gun standards that are  weaker than some other places. But they also come from downstate  Illinois. I am not going to try to sugarcoat that. Those are the  reports.   It troubles me, too, because when I talk to the police, they say: We  need Federal help.   What they would like to be able to do is try to track these guns, try  to determine their sources and cut them off. The Agency that does it is  the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Agency.   We are trying now--desperately trying now to get the approval in the  Senate for a person to head that Agency, and, no surprise, the ranks  are closed against this person on the other side of the aisle.    Those who are listening closely to the gun lobby are trying their  best to make sure ATF, this Federal Agency, doesn't have strong  leadership, doesn't exercise all its authority under the law to make us  safer. That doesn't make it any easier for the Chicago police, and they  end up paying the price.   The latest fallen hero is the first Chicago police officer killed by  gunfire in more than 2\1/2\ years. But nearly 40 Chicago police  officers have been shot, or shot at, in the line of duty this year.  That is part of the duty, the responsibility they face as they prowl  the streets and alleys of the great city.   Chicagoans mourn for the police officer who lost her life. We are  going to pray desperately for recovery of the wounded officer. Thoughts  and prayers are not enough to end gun violence in Chicago and nearly  every community in America. We all know that. We need better laws to  keep guns out of the hands of criminals and also out of the hands of  people with serious mental illness and others who shouldn't have them  either.   America's families and police officers deserve our best effort to  make the streets safer in Chicago and many other American cities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have been listening to criticism from  the other side of the aisle about our plan to improve American  families' economic security and the long-term strength in our economy.   And I have to wonder, why do Republicans never worry about deficits  when they are passing trillion-dollar tax cuts that shower nearly all  of the benefits on millionaires and wealthy corporations?   Why do Republicans only rediscover a concern about the debt when they  are asked to support policies to help middle-class, working families,  low-income  [[Page S6033]]  individuals--people struggling to get into the middle class?   Or when someone proposes a long-term solution to make America's  economy resilient and more prosperous for everyone, they are opposed to  that. That is ``big spending.''   Republican welfare for the rich has always been a bad investment.  Forty years of trickle-down economics has given America the greatest  income inequality since the Gilded Age in our history and the largest  national debt in our history. Republicans' devotion to trickle-down tax  cuts has given us a shrinking middle class, a hollowed-out industrial  base, and crumbling infrastructure. It has made a small sliver of  America lavishly wealthy and left the rest behind.   The Republican economic agenda has left the majority of Americans  asking: How are we supposed to pay for childcare, our kids' college  education, medical bills, or for the skilled nurses that mom and dad  are going to need? Will we ever be able to retire?   Trickle-down economics doesn't have answers for those real-life  questions, but our Republican colleagues keep doubling down on them.   I predict, without fear of contradiction, now that we have a  Democratic President, someone on the Republican side of the aisle will  come around again with a balanced budget constitutional amendment. It  happens without fail. Republicans always turn to that whenever there is  a Democratic President, even though the debt that President inherited  was historic.   But when their trickle-down tax cuts add trillions to the national  debt, are they really worried?   They never say a word about deficit and debt until they are in the  minority.   Donald Trump proposed more than a trillion dollars in tax cuts, with  most of the benefits going to wealthy corporations and individuals.   Did the Republicans complain about the national debt then? No.   Did they insist that such an expensive gift must have bipartisan  support? No.   They passed their trickle-down tax cut through reconciliation without  a single Democratic vote.   Donald Trump promised that his tax cut would be ``rocket fuel for the  economy.''   That may be a rare Trump boast that turned out to be true, although  not exactly the way he meant it. We now have a handful of billionaires  who have decided to launch their own personal space programs. They are  so wealthy they are racing each other into space while regular working  people worry about rent, childcare, and getting on here on Earth.   The Trump tax cut gave the wealthiest Americans a fat windfall.  According to Americans for Tax Fairness, the Nation's 651 billionaires  saw their net worth spike by more than $1 trillion during the first 9  months of the pandemic while the rest of America worried about how to  pay the bills with a smaller paycheck or no paycheck at all.   After Donald Trump signed his tax bill, surrounded by quite a few of  my Republican colleagues in the Senate, he headed to a Christmas Eve  dinner at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and like Santa Claus, he announced to  the wealthy members at his own private club at Mar-a-Lago: ``You all  just got richer.'' That was the real effect of the Trump tax cuts--the  real intent.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that Trump tax cuts  will add $1.9 trillion to the national debt over 11 years. Where is the  Republican outcry over that? The notion of $3 trillion to help working  families pay less for the essentials of life, to cut their taxes, and  give them an opportunity to be in an economy creating jobs really pales  in comparison to the $1.9 trillion of tax cuts to the wealthy.   Economists at the London School of Economics analyzed the effects of  trickle-down tax cuts over 50 years, 1965 to 2015. They found that  trickle-down tax cuts consistently benefit the wealthy but had no  meaningful effect on employment or economic growth, and they led  inevitably to wider economic inequality.   The authors of the study were asked why some politicians still  continue to push for these tax cuts for wealthy people. They pointed to  one reason: the power of wealthy individuals and corporations to set  policy agendas through their lobbying and campaign contributions.   You know what is going on, the fabulously wealthy people, who are  contributing to politicians and causes that support their lifestyle,  but they don't want us to know.   Is that why no Republican Senator supports President Biden's Build  Back Better plan to help American families and our economy, because  billionaires have more lobbyists and deeper pockets than struggling  kids and families?   Two renowned economists from Princeton University--Alan Blinder,  former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Mark Watson--looked at  the major economic indicators of America's economy for every President  back to Franklin Roosevelt.   They found by almost any major indicator--gross domestic product,  employment, incomes, productivity, even stock prices--America's economy  has grown significantly faster under Democratic Presidents than  Republican. On jobs, since 1933, the six Presidents who presided over  the fastest job growth have all been Democrats--the four Presidents  with the slowest job growth, Republicans.   Donald Trump campaigned, promising to be the ``greatest jobs  President God ever created.'' There were 3 million fewer jobs when he  left office than at the beginning of his term. He is the first  President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs on his watch.   The Democrats are once again cleaning up the Republican mess. With  the help of the American Rescue Plan, which not a single Republican  Senator or Congressman supported, America's economy has added 4 million  jobs during the first 6 months of Joe Biden's Presidency. That is the  fastest growth for the start of any President ever in American history.   Here is another fact from the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Between 1953 and 2020, America's economy was in a recession for 23  percent of the time that the Republicans held the White House, compared  to just 4 percent of the time that a Democrat sat in the Oval Office.   For the past 40 years, Republican Presidents have run up larger  deficits than Democrats. Let me say that again. In the past 40 years,  Republican Presidents have run up larger deficits than Democratic  Presidents.   Donald Trump promised to get rid of the national debt in 8 years  through trade policy. Instead, his trade policies were a costly  disaster, and the national debt skyrocketed by more than $7 trillion  during his tenure.   A ProPublica-Washington Post analysis found that growth in annual  deficit under Donald Trump is the third-biggest increase relative to  the size of the economy of any U.S. President, with his tax cuts being  the major culprit.   I could go on citing facts and figures. Democrats look at human  priorities like quality childcare, medical research, renewable energy,  and climate resilience, investments that grow the economy and raise  wages and living standards for everyone.    We should have no apologies as Democrats for the programs that we  support, particularly when it comes to climate change. That is a fact  of life, sadly, in America, and we see the results reported every night  on the news. Whether it is fires or extraordinary weather events, they  are happening with increased frequency. It seems that Republicans  ignore that reality. We cannot afford as a nation to do that any  longer.   History shows that our approaches work in responding to many of these  challenges. Our solutions produce stronger, more sustainable economic  growth that benefits everyone. Stronger economic growth allows us to  pay down our debt rather than continuing to add to it with more tax  cuts for the top 1 percent.   Republicans can refuse to support our plan to Build Back Better; that  is their choice. But please spare us lectures about fiscal  responsibility. There is nothing responsible about repeating the same  trillion-dollar mistake over and over and making small businesses and  working families pay for it.   I always thought the Laffer curve, which is the inspiration to the  Republicans for trickle-down economics, was the most appropriately  named economic device in history--it is a ``laugher''--and we see over  and over again  [[Page S6034]]  why that is. Giving tax breaks to the wealthy might make for a happy  Christmas at Mar-a-Lago but not for the rest of the country.   The real test is not whether we put votes on the board--and that is  the bottom line in the Senate--but whether the center will hold,  whether or not we have a strong enough center in the Senate dedicated  to responsible investment and infrastructure and can overcome the  forces outside.   Former President Trump has been making all these speeches about how  bad it is to have an infrastructure program. Well, I would just like to  remind the former President: He had no infrastructure program. Talked  big. Delivered nothing. Now, we have a chance under President Biden to  have one that is bipartisan in nature and truly will help this economy  and this country over the long run.   In addition, I believe that we have to move further--and we certainly  will with the budget resolution--in investing in America. The notion of  having childcare--quality childcare--available and affordable to  families is something that, unless you are a grandparent or a parent  and know the reality, you may overlook and shouldn't. It is a critical  factor in family welfare and good outcomes for children.   In addition, 2 extra years of education beyond the 12th grade,  provided by our quality community colleges across America, is the  ticket for better jobs and better training and better workers in the  21st century.   As we stand here, our major challenge, I suppose--our nemesis, foe-- is China. Some of us can remember something called ping-pong diplomacy,  which occurred roughly when I came out of college. That was opening up  what we called ``Red China'' then to the world and giving them an  opportunity to compete and to be part of the world conversation, and it  happened dramatically.   I remember visiting China several times and the first time, watching  them in their Mao jackets on their bicycles, taking their kids to  school. What I found in later visits was a really developed economy.  The Chinese have a plan. They are mercantilists first, and they are  marketing around the world successfully--successfully--because they  have a plan. We don't have a plan, not until this President arrived.   President Joe Biden has started this plan by saying: First, we invest  in our people and make certain that their lives are easier and  successful. I support him completely in that effort. I hope many will.  It should be bipartisan. If we have sympathy for the wealthiest in our  country, I beg my Republican friends: Have some sympathy for the  middle-income families, who are struggling every day to get by.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, since the beginning of our history, U.S.  Marshals have protected our Federal judicial process and defended the  integrity of our Constitution. Today, the Marshals Service oversees  thousands of deputy marshals and investigators across America, who  guard Federal officials and witnesses, track down fugitives, and  transport Federal prisoners. They are an invaluable part of our law  enforcement system.   This afternoon, the Senate has an opportunity to confirm a proven,  trusted law enforcement professional to lead the U.S. Marshals Service,  Ronald Davis.   In June, the Judiciary Committee approved Mr. Davis's nomination on a  bipartisan basis. Three Republican members of the committee, including  Ranking Member Chuck Grassley of Iowa, joined every Democrat to support  his nomination as Director of the Marshals Service.   With Mr. Davis's experience in the military, the Justice Department,  and as a police officer on the beat, he is an outstanding nominee. But  despite his bipartisan committee vote, decades of law enforcement  experience, and the support he enjoys from virtually every major law  enforcement organization in America, some of my Republican colleagues  are blocking him from being confirmed by unanimous consent.   Unanimous consent is the expedited process that the Senate has used  to confirm every other Director of the Marshals Service for as long as  this position has been subject to Senate confirmation. We have always  confirmed the Marshals Service Director by unanimous consent because  the position is so important and, up until now, has been considered to  be above partisan politics.   I hope my Republican colleagues will reconsider their position. At a  time when our Federal judges and court officials face a growing number  of threats, the Marshals Service needs Mr. Davis's experience and  leadership now, and the American public deserves his steady hand at the  helm.   Let me briefly speak to Mr. Davis's qualifications and the support he  enjoys from law enforcement.   After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Mr. Davis joined the Oakland,  CA, Police Department, serving for 20 years in uniform, ultimately  attaining the rank of captain. He then went on to serve as chief of the  East Palo Alto Police Department, implementing crucial initiatives that  curbed gang violence.   In no small part because of his work in East Palo Alto, Mr. Davis was  tapped by President Obama to serve as Executive Director of President  Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. President Obama also  selected Mr. Davis to head the Justice Department's Office of Community  Oriented Policing Services, known as the COPS Office.   As the COPS Office Director, he disbursed hundreds of millions of  dollars in grant money, enabling State and local police departments to  retain and hire thousands of police officers. In other words, he was in  charge of funding police across the United States.   As a police officer with nearly three decades of experience, and as  the husband of a 31-year veteran of the police force who was the first  Black woman to serve as a permanent police chief in California, Mr.  Davis has a deep and abiding respect for the men and women of law  enforcement.   Understanding the risks that officers face every day, he said:  ``There is no greater or more noble profession than policing.''   And he has been emphatic that police officers deserve our highest  praise for keeping neighborhoods safe, families secure, and dangerous  criminals behind bars.   Mr. Davis also has the backs of members of law enforcement. He earned  their respect and trust. Numerous law enforcement organizations are  asking the Senate to move--and move quickly--to confirm his nomination  as Director of the U.S. Marshals Service. Listen to this group of law  enforcement professionals that has supported him: the Hispanic American  Police Command Officers Association; the Federal Law Enforcement  Officers Association; the International Association of Chiefs of  Police; the National Black Police Association; the National  Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; the Police Executive  Research Forum; the Major Cities Chiefs Association; the Major County  Sheriffs of America; the National Association of Women Law Enforcement  Executives; the National Sheriffs' Association; and, yes, the Fraternal  Order of Police.   Notably, these organizations didn't just support him; they support  his immediate confirmation and urge us to move quickly.   Consider this letter from the Fraternal Order of Police sent on  August 3. It says: ``At this time in our history, the U.S. Marshals  Service needs the leadership we're confident that Mr. Davis can  provide. No doubt he understands first-hand the issues facing women and  men in law enforcement, and we believe President Biden has made an  excellent decision to have him lead the Marshals Service.''   I couldn't agree more. There is simply no basis for delaying this  bipartisan choice out of the Senate Judiciary Committee any moment  further. If my Republican colleagues really want  [[Page S6055]]  to stand up for law and order and funding the police, they can start by  confirming a nominee who has devoted his entire career to doing just  that. That nominee is Ronald Davis.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the Davis nomination, Calendar No. 174;  that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I am disappointed. At this point, this is  an issue involving Vanita Gupta, who was approved by the Senate and now  is serving in the Department of Justice and has been for months. What  this has to do with the person to lead the U.S. Marshals Service, I  cannot imagine.   But I don't have to imagine the importance of filling this position  quickly. It was over 10 years ago when a judge--a woman that I helped  to win appointment in the Federal district court in the Northern  District of Illinois--learned tragically that a disgruntled client at  somebody's firm went to her home, killing her mother and her husband,  in Chicago. It was a tragedy, an unspeakable tragedy.   Because of that terrible event, we turned to the U.S. Marshals  Service and said: You have a special obligation to protect the men and  women who serve in our judiciary. We are counting on you to make  certain that they are safe at work and they are safe at home.   And it is a 24/7, 365-days-a-year responsibility that the Marshals  Service has.   Sadly, that wasn't the last of the tragedies involving judges. It was  just a few years ago when a judge in New Jersey lost her son. Another  person, a demented person, went to her home and killed him.   So when we are talking about filling this position, it is more than  whether the Attorney General has sent a timely response to a letter; it  is a matter of life and death--and now, more than ever, because we are  in transition and many of the marshals are in a lameduck status or  moved on to other positions, and you need someone to head up the U.S.  Marshals Service during this period when we do our work here in  Congress to approve the new U.S. Marshals across the United States.   It is hard for me to imagine that we would risk the lives of judges,  court personnel, and their families, along with many others, by leaving  this critical law enforcement agency unfilled.   No one questions this man's qualifications. He is a humble man who  has an amazing story, an incredible story. He is asking to serve this  Nation again in a capacity, when it comes to security and safety, that  is really one of the most important in our government.   I am sorry that the Senator feels this way. I wish he would  reconsider and just reflect for a moment on the importance of this  position.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, let me say that this issue about  this corporation--I believe the Senator said it was known as Avantor-- it was a corporation which was once under the control of Vanita Gupta's  father. She had no--no--active role whatsoever in the administration of  this corporation. She was a shareholder as the daughter of the chairman  of the board, her only connection. It was a stock portfolio. That was  it. That is the reason why these suspicions and charges went nowhere.  There is just no connection between Vanita Gupta and this company.   It was my understanding at the time that this company had  discontinued its business in Mexico and had already done that long  before her hearing. That was a matter of public record.   Secondly, when members of the Judiciary Committee on both sides of  the aisle said they wanted quicker responses to the letters sent to the  Department of Justice than they received under the Trump  administration, I said that was a perfectly legitimate request, and I  invited the members of the committee to join me in a conference call  with the Attorney General to discuss it. Several did. I am not sure  whether the Senator from Texas was part of it or not. But the message  to the Department of Justice was, provide a timely response to all  inquiries. The Attorney General gave us his personal assurance that he  would do that.   I know this letter is very important to the Senator from Texas, but I  think that the safety of our judges is even more important.   So let's press on if you wish for a reply to this letter as soon as  possible. But today, let's do the right thing and put the person in  charge who keeps safe the judges and their families all  [[Page S6056]]  across the United States from terrible things that have happened to  them in the past.    Mr. President, I believe I made it clear that her father  was the chairman of the board of the company and she was a stockholder,  not in the management of the company. So whatever choices they made to  sell whatever chemicals anywhere in the world was not her personal  decision.   I just find it very difficult for a person who has already been  appointed to the job, Vanita Gupta--and that happened months ago--for  us to be holding up this critically important position over a letter  that wasn't answered. I hope we can satisfy the Senator from Texas and  anyone else who is objecting. It is important to put Mr. Davis on the  job.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
