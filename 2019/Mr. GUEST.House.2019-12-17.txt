 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Representative Ray  Rogers as he completes his distinguished service in the Mississippi  House of Representatives.  [[Page H10605]]    Representative Rogers has served his hometown of Pearl and Rankin  County with honor and integrity for 36 years. In that time, he was  appointed chairman of the Military Affairs Committee and vice chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee, and he served as a member of the  Management and the Education Committees, to name a few.   Earlier this year, Representative Rogers was presented the  Mississippi Meritorious Civilian Service Award by the Mississippi  National Guard for his distinguished career in public service.   Known as a man of wisdom, kindness, and selflessness, Representative  Rogers has made a positive impact on our State that will last  generations.   I am grateful for the example Representative Rogers has set for those  serving in elected office, and I wish him many years of happiness in  his much-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
