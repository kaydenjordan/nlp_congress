 Mr. President, I think it is going to be a very robust  conversation about taxes. When we look into the eyes of working  Americans, I hope my Republican colleagues are ready to answer this  question, and that is, Why do they, the Republican Party, want to send  $3.5 trillion of tax benefits to the top 1 percent? Why not spend the  tax benefits on the middle class?   Well, my colleagues keep coming to the floor and saying this is all  about the middle class, but they don't mention that, in fact, every  single major change is all about benefits for the richest 1 percent.   Changing the dynasty tax to create a dynasty loophole, wow, that  really doesn't benefit anybody in the working class. Lowering the top  bracket while raising the bottom bracket, well, that doesn't help  anybody in the working class. Providing a special passthrough for those  who can put their business activities into limited liability  corporations and have a special low rate, well, that certainly doesn't  help anybody in the middle class.   One provision after another, after another is targeted at the richest  Americans, while coming and preaching help for the middle class. Oh,  the American people will see right through this scheme. They are going  to ask: Why is it you do so little for those at the bottom? In fact,  you do nothing for those in the bottom third. Why is it you do so  little for those in the middle class? In fact, many of them will see a  tax increase. Why do you send the vast bulk of the benefits to the  richest Americans when the richest Americans are already so much richer  than anyone else?    The debate we are going to have is important. For my colleagues who  think they can fool the American people by talking about the middle  class and instead are targeting the richest to be richer, I have news:  It is not going to work.
