 Madam Speaker, this is a great day in America. I am so  proud to say that as the Congress considers these bills that protect  and advance human rights.   I rise today, specifically, to talk about the Paycheck Fairness Act,  because men and women should be able to be paid the same for doing the  same work.   I thank my colleagues, Rosa DeLauro and the committee chairman,   Bobby Scott, for their advancement of this great legislation.   Madam Speaker, I want to tell you a story, the story of a young  lawyer who worked in the public defender's office. Her job was to  represent people accused of crimes like murder and robbery. She was a  free lawyer for them. It was very high pressure, and it was very  grueling, but she loved it.   When she got the job, she was told a rule: Nobody talks about salary  in this office.   But one day, she found out that a male colleague was doing the same  job, and he had similar credentials, but he made much more money. She  was making $18,000 a year. He was making $20,000.   When she asked her boss why, she was told that he, the male attorney,  had a wife and children to take care of.   Madam Speaker, that was me. That happened to me 40 years ago.                                time  1245    It was then and still today is a very common experience to millions  of women who are still earning 80 cents on the dollar that men make,  and actually much less for women of color. It still makes me angry to  think about my own experience, but I am not complaining about my own  life journey. Fortunately, I have a job now that pays me the same as my  male colleagues. I am so happy I am in a position to do something about  this today.   As a result of lower lifetime earnings and different work patterns,  women are hit hard in retirement.    I am too excited, Madam Speaker.   This is why so many women end up in poverty. I want to just say this  over and over: women go to work for the same reason men go to work, and  that is to take care of their families. Regardless of the  circumstance's agenda, we deserve to be paid equally. This Paycheck  Fairness Act is going to allow workers to talk openly about their pay.  It is going to prohibit asking about salary histories. It is going to  require bosses to prove disparities exist for discrimination.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill because when  women succeed, America succeeds.
