 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I rise  [[Page H576]]  in support of this resolution, which, again, rejects white nationalism  and white supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance that are  contradictory to our values that define the people of the United  States.   I call on my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to denounce  racial and religious bigotry of all stripes.   Like many, I do have some personal insight into this problem. It  doesn't come as a surprise to many that, being from Utah, I am a  Mormon. And my church, as many know, was founded in New York in the  early 1800s. We were driven further and further west as members of my  church were targeted, harassed, and killed for their sincerely held  religious beliefs, culminating in the murder of our founder and  subsequent decision to relocate to Utah.   My own ancestors were targeted in this bigotry. They lost their  possessions. They lost their lands. They lost their freedom. And in  some cases, they lost their lives. Unfortunately, such hatred still  exists today.   Three years ago, we witnessed the tragedy in Charleston, where a  deranged individual motivated by white supremacy shot and killed nine  Black worshipers and injured many others.   We remember the riots in Charlottesville, where a white nationalist  struck and killed a White woman who was protesting, once again, white  supremacy.                                time  1430    But the problem is more widespread than just these individuals who  advocate for white supremacy. We also need to condemn anti-Semitism,  anti-Zionism, and those who enable it.   Last October, a perpetrator shot and killed 11 Jewish worshippers at  the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, which we all remember.   All of these should be condemned by all of us here in this body:  Black, White, rich, poor, Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. We are all, I  believe, children of the same God.   I hope that the majority is sincere in ushering in this resolution to  the floor not as just an opportunity to shame one party as irredeemably  racist, but as a united statement against bigotry.   When bigotry goes unchallenged, it festers and rears its ugly head in  ways that test our Nation's greatest triumphs in shedding these  shameful practices of slavery and other types of racial and religious  intolerance. This is something that must unite this body. I hope that  it does, and I believe that it will.
