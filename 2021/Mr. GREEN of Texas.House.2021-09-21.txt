 Madam Speaker, and still I rise, as a liberated  Democrat, unbought, unbossed, in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm. And I  rise, not as a part-time freedom fighter, but a full-time freedom  fighter. I don't do it just because it is convenient, just because it  is the issue du jour. I do it because I was born into the struggle. I  didn't enlist at a later time in life.   As a full-time freedom fighter, I rise today, Madam Speaker, because  Black lives still matter; and they matter, Madam Speaker, wherever they  happen to be. They matter, not because they happen to be in the United  States. They matter if they are in Haiti. Black lives matter.   I have been to Haiti. I have seen the conditions there. We need to do  something about our friends in this hemisphere. And if they matter in  Haiti to me, surely they matter at the southern border.   Black lives matter wherever they are. Black lives matter regardless  as to who is in power. They still matter. Changes in the power  structure don't change the circumstances. And as long as the  circumstances exist, Black lives still matter.   And as a 74-year old Black man, when I see men in uniforms, acting  under the color of law, on horses, using the reins of the horses to do  what was comparable to that which was done when you were trying to  capture a runaway slave, or you were herding slaves in a given  direction, Black lives matter. When I see that, I find it more than  appalling. It is sinful. It is something that we cannot tolerate.   And you just can't say, well, the circumstances are so bad that we  have to use horses now to run down Black people. Black lives matter.  That kind of behavior is intolerable. And when I see it, I am going to  speak up and speak out.   So here is what I am going to do about it. I am not just going to say  Black lives matter. I want justice for the Haitians.   I remember when we had a policy to help the Cubans come into this  country. By the way, I never opposed it. But the policy was wet foot,  dry foot. You get one foot on dry land, your other foot could be in the  Gulf of Mexico, and you had the right to take that other foot out of  water, go on into Miami and start a life in this country and eventually  become a citizen. I never opposed that policy. We didn't have a similar  policy for the Haitians.   And I remember when Castro opened up the jails and let the criminals  come down to Florida, we didn't send them back.   Black lives matter. It is not just a slogan for me. So here is what I  am going to do. I am going to draft a resolution condemning what we  saw.   We need to know whether Black lives matter to this Congress. We need  to know. I am going to draft a resolution.   And for those who don't understand the rules, these kinds of  resolutions are not privileged, so I can't just bring it to the floor  and demand a vote. So I am going to ask that it be allowed to come to  the floor because Black lives matter.   And we need to vote. We need to know where people stand on the great  issues of our time. This is an issue of all time; it is not just today.  We need to know where people stand. We need to vote.   There are a lot of things that we need to vote on. We need to know  where people stand when it comes to Black lives, and all lives, I might  add, but this is the Haitian issue that we are dealing with now.    I have fought for the other persons who have come to the border. I  spoke up when little girls were being ripped away from their mothers'  arms, so I am not new to this fight.   And I want to assure you that I am going to bring the resolution to  my colleagues, and we will find out whether Black lives matter to this  Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  me the time. I also am most appreciative to the members of the Rules  Committee, who have devoted an inordinate amount of time to bringing  this legislation to the floor.   I am also appreciative for the consideration of three amendments that  we will have in the NDAA.   Our first amendment, Homes for Heroes, requires the Department of  Housing and Urban Development, as well as public housing agencies, to  improve consideration of and reporting on the status of veterans.   Friends, outside of my office in Houston, there is an overpass. There  are persons living under that overpass, some of whom claim to be  veterans.   We need to know what is happening to our veterans in this country. We  want to make sure everybody is given equal opportunities and equal  access to the opportunities that we have in this country. But I  especially am concerned about the veterans because, quite frankly, it  hurts my heart to hear someone say, ``I served my country, risked my  life,'' and we find them sleeping under bridges. This will give us an  opportunity to get more information on what is happening to them.   The second amendment is the Universal Residential Loan Application.  This amendment will require housing enterprises to include a military  service question on the Universal Residential Loan Application in a  prominent position on the form.   This is done because many of our veterans are not aware of the VA  loans that are available to them, and we want to make sure that before  they sign that loan application, they understand that there are other  opportunities available to them.   We also have an amendment that will deal with our merchant mariners.  This amendment requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  distribute a payment to the U.S. merchant marines who engaged in  qualified service during World War II and who have not received their  just desserts, in the sense of something positive, for something that  they did for this country.    Mr. Speaker, finally, the private student loan  borrowers amendment, I am a cosponsor of this amendment with  Representative Alma Adams. This would extend the private student loan  forbearance period to January 31, 2022, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as  the rationale.   I think these amendments are exceedingly important. They are in this  NDAA, and I will be supporting it in large part because these  amendments are there, as well as for other reasons that I have not been  able to discuss today.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, and still I rise. Tonight, I rise  to express my gratitude to many persons who have caused us to have this  opportunity. I thank Chairman Smith for his service and what he has  done and Ranking Member Rogers, the members of the Committee on Rules,  and the members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs.   Madam Speaker, I rise to say that I do support the NDAA. I understand  the need for a strong military, but I also rise tonight with an appeal  for some compassion, compassion and, to a certain extent, mercy for our  veteran merchant marines. I ask for this compassion because they didn't  get some of the benefits that others did.   Let me just read the words, if I may, of President Roosevelt. On June  22, 1944, these are his words when signing the GI Bill: ``I trust  Congress will soon provide similar opportunities to members of the  Merchant Marine who have risked their lives time and time again during  war for the welfare of our country.''   Congress did not provide similar benefits for the merchant marines.  As a result of Congress not doing so, most people don't know that the  merchant marines were denied benefits within the GI Bill, denied the  stipend for the cost of living, books, and supplies as it relates to  education, denied tuition-free education, denied unemployment benefits,  denied medical benefits, denied low-cost guaranteed loans, denied  opportunities.   Madam Speaker, I appeal tonight for those who are still surviving,  all of whom are in their nineties. I had the privilege of being with  Mr. Charles Mills, 101 years young and still making the appeal for help  for these veterans, who literally won a lawsuit to have themselves  declared as such.   I make the appeal for compassion for our merchant marines, who had a  very high casualty count during World War II.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, tuition benefits in today's  dollars would be about $8,000. The stipend for the cost of living,  books, and supplies would be about $1,200. The unemployment benefits-- and I am low-balling--would be about $16,000.   The medical benefits we can't measure. The loss of opportunities  because of the loans that they could have received we cannot measure.   But we can do this: We can do what General Eisenhower asked us to do.  We can do what President Roosevelt asked us to do and President Truman  asked us to do.   This is our opportunity, a unique moment in time to correct an  injustice. And I appeal to you to do so.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, to take this through regular order  at this time would mean that we would call on witnesses who have long  since gone to glory. It would mean that many of those who live today  would not live to see the day that the justice would be served that  they richly deserve.   So I make an appeal on behalf of the those who have earned this  compassion, they risked their lives for their country, and many of them  died. This is our final opportunity for many of them, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
