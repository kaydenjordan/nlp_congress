 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  but let's just step back a second. Here is the reality.   America and the entire world will be relying on fossil energy for  years to come. The Energy Information Administration estimates that, in  2040, fossil energy will still make up 78 percent of the energy used in  the world.                                time  1745    Let's look at two examples of what America stands to lose if this  amendment is adopted.   The fossil R&D program has put America on the cusp of producing zero  carbon emissions from electric generation using the innovative and  unique Allam cycle.   The innovative NET Power plant in Texas was funded by DOE in its  research. It is amazing what they are doing using CO2 to  spin a turbine instead of as an emission.  [[Page H4935]]    To this end, Congress should be putting more money into this program  on research, not reducing it.   Secondly, the fossil R&D program also has had tremendous success in  extracting rare earth elements from coal and mine drainage. But,  currently, China controls over 90 percent of the world's rare earth  elements. These minerals are critical to our national defense and are  used in hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, fuel cells, and portable  electronics.   By adopting this amendment, we would be unnecessarily putting the  environment at risk and lose a potential key supply of rare earth  minerals.   Fossil fuels will be around for the foreseeable future. We should be  utilizing them in the cleanest, most efficient manner through research,  and all of that requires more research at the Federal level.   The House has soundly defeated a similar amendment in the past, and I  urge my colleagues to do so now as well.
