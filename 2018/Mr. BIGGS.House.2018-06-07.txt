 Mr. Speaker, last September, America's national debt  topped $20 trillion for the first time in history.   Almost 3 months ago, the debt exceeded $21 trillion, and we have an  annual structural deficit in the hundreds of billions of dollars.   Mr. Speaker, the United States faces no greater menace than our  inability to eliminate our debt and balance our budget. Our  grandchildren will pay the price for our dereliction of duty and our  seniors will soon see Social Security and Medicare funds depleted.   This internal, bipartisan recklessness endangers all Americans.   It is past time for us to become serious about balancing our budget  and making significant cuts to Federal spending. If we do not change  our course, we will one day see the crash of the American economy and  the demise of a super power.   Mr. Speaker, let's change our course before our debt reaches $22  trillion. The time for conversation is over. The time to act is now.                            ____________________
