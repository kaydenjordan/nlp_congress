 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman LaMalfa for his years  of work on the extraordinary problems in the Klamath.   Let me, again, by talking briefly about drought and what it means. I  select this as a starting place because many out here in the East have  the opposite problem--too much water.   Sadly, to those of us in the West, the term drought is all too  familiar. We know what the word means because we have lived in drought  conditions for years. Drought means no water. It means bankruptcy. It  means catastrophe. It means the death of trees, plants, animals, and  dreams. In anticipation of drought, out in the West, we have developed  means of surviving when droughts occur. We have built reservoirs, dams,  canals, pipelines, drains, wells, and legal systems to deal with the  supply and allocation, legally and practically, of water--this most  precious, essential, and life-giving resource.   These systems, legal and hydraulic, provided the essential and  irreplaceable foundation of communities in the West. These laws, and  the water divided under them, provided a reliable and dependable system  upon which futures were planned, families were raised, and rural towns  with churches, schools, and hospitals were built. Droughts were  expected, but Western communities were prepared--or at least they  thought they were. But change has come. Change has come in the form of  the Endangered Species Act and in the form of even hotter and drier  weather. This law and these warmer, hotter conditions have upset--some  would say, destroyed--the systems that entire communities have relied  upon for well over a century.   Let me be clear: The Endangered Species Act is the law, and I am not  suggesting we break or violate it. Recently, I called for unity in the  Klamath basin urging calm and cooperation in the face of this  incredible and damaging challenge. But if ever there was an example of  the need to refine and better implement the Endangered Species Act,  what is happening to the Klamath basin this year is that reason.   But it is simply not possible to change the way the ESA is  implemented in time to help this year. As I mentioned, and all of us  know, there is another thing happening: it is getting hotter and drier,  and all of our systems, manmade and natural, are under stress--the  stress of severe drought and an ever-increasing demand for water:  demand from fish, demand from wildlife, demand from agriculture, and  demand, soon, from rural homes which rely on wells for their water.   What can we do?   First, we must do our best to tell the Nation that some 60 to 70  million people across the Western United States will be suffering this  year from the cost and the loss of severe drought. The Klamath basin in  Oregon and California unfortunately is the poster child for this  disaster.    Secondly, we must call out clearly and loudly that our laws, as  written and enforced, when faced with the choice of instream use for  ESA purposes on one hand or the community on the other, will allocate  all of the water to instream use, letting other needs go begging.   It must be noted that the water being given by the law and the means  of enforcing it operates to give all of the water to the instream  interests, even though this allocation is in excess of that which would  have naturally flowed down the river during summer months.  [[Page H2534]]    Once again, I want to be clear that this allocation of stored water  for instream purposes is a choice of what to save and what to let go.  That choice has costs--incredible costs.   Now, it is not my goal today to attack the administration, the  Department of the Interior, or the Bureau of Reclamation. It is my goal  to call out that this country has, through its government and its  laws--the Endangered Species Act--made a decision to take water from a  community and to use it for another purpose, placing the burden of that  choice on people and other less fortunate creatures not protected by  the ESA.   What is that cost?   Some have said at least $400 million will be lost in the Klamath  community this year. But that hardly tells the story. So let me  elaborate.   The average farmer has mortgage payments, property taxes, irrigation  district assessments, equipment payments, and most important of all,  the need to house and take care of his or her family. Without water,  there are no crops, no income, and no ability to pay the bills all  families have.   Many producers in the basin have supply contracts that they have  worked for years and years to achieve and retain. If producers cannot  deliver on those contracts, for example, with Safeway and Whole Foods  Market, those contracts are lost to other competitors, and many times  to other countries, such as Mexico, Chile, Australia, and Brazil.  Oftentimes, these contracts can never be recovered.   Beef and dairy producers lack grass for cattle because there has been  no rain and they cannot irrigate. Hay is in short supply and prices for  hay have increased dramatically. Beef and dairy producers are forced to  sell their cattle because they cannot afford the cost of buying hay.  Rebuilding these herds will require years and years and much more debt.  In addition, the increased supply of cattle to market causes immediate  reduction in prices, adding insult to injury.   Then there are jobs. Thousands of agriculture-related jobs will be  lost. People who have been employed in the farming area for years will  move away, and many will never return.   Then there are farms. This is the second consecutive year of what may  be many years of too little water to meet the many needs of the  community. As the level of uncertainty regarding the future becomes  ever more pronounced, more and more young people raised on farms lose  faith in the future of farming and ranching and choose other careers.  The average age of the American farmer is now late fifties, and it  keeps going up. This trend means that we will become more and more  dependent upon foreign countries to sell us food. But everyone agrees,  in principle, we should grow our food here at home. The pandemic and  more recently the shipping crisis have shown us that a global supply  chain is not always dependable.                                time  2030    This choice, along with many others, to treat farmers and ranchers as  though they are expendable, is bad for our Nation and bad for our  future.   When we talk about infrastructure, let's not forget that those who  know how to operate farms and ranches are part of the essential  infrastructure of our Nation. These choices that don't balance the  needs of our environment and the community are driving food production  into other countries, putting us all at risk.   In addition, this drought will create and is creating extraordinarily  negative environmental, public health, and safety impacts. The  waterfowl, reptile, and amphibians mentioned by Congressman LaMalfa  that rely on our canal system, ditch banks, and irrigated fields will  simply not be there. They will die, as there is no water in the canals  or on the fields for them.   There have been and will continue to be dust storms--think dust bowl.  And this is no exaggeration. Two national wildlife refuges rely  exclusively on the Klamath Project for water. They will receive no  water for those wetlands and habitats this year. They will dry up. The  waterfowl that use them will be hurt.   There are 1,800 domestic water wells in Oregon within the geographic  area served by the project. These will be affected.   The drought comes with another side effect, increased wildfire risks.  Last summer, my district was devastated by once-in-a-generation,  supposedly, fires that burned over a million acres in Oregon, destroyed  thousands of homes and businesses, wiped away two entire towns, and  killed 11 people. Dry vegetation and forests, combined with poor  management, are the perfect storm for out-of-control wildfires. Those  fires will damage the Klamath watersheds, making this bad situation  worse.   What can we do? In the short term, Representative LaMalfa and I are  proposing a $47 million critical aid package to help those hit hardest  by the drought in the Klamath. Congressman LaMalfa will go through it  in more detail.   Long term, we strongly believe there are critical legal issues that  need to be addressed. Farmers in irrigation districts have strong  objections to the reallocation of stored water. Dams and reservoirs  were built to capture water during the wet time of year to have water  available during the dry time of year. We have done that in the Klamath  Project, and irrigation districts pay for the infrastructure that  provides that storage. But now the government is requiring that we  direct the release of stored water away from farms to artificially  increase the amount and flow in the Klamath River.   During the irrigation season, the Klamath Project will be providing  much more flow in the Klamath River than ever would have occurred  naturally before the project existed. This is a legal problem, and it  needs to be addressed.   More water storage is needed. A future of hotter, drier summers means  this problem is not going to go away. In the Klamath and across the  West, we need better infrastructure and a long-term plan so we have  enough water for farms, cities, fish, and refuges. As snowpack  decreases, and it is, water storage is critical, to have a reliable  store of water when these droughts occur.   For long-term stability, we need the community to come together and  figure out how to escape the zero-sum game that gives all the water to  one use, ignoring others. There are critical parties to make this  happen, and we need support of that work from the State, the Federal  Government, and our community. Agreement can be reached. This has been  done elsewhere.   As mentioned earlier, we need to protect and improve our watersheds.  This means our forests. Each year, all stakeholders face uncertainty  and risk. This fight over water has fractured the Klamath community and  will fracture others.   To address these extraordinarily difficult problems, we must work  together toward a long-term solution because this situation is not  sustainable.   Next year's weather may well be worse than what we are facing now.  Everybody is being harmed. There are no winners in this situation. Fish  populations are not recovering; farms are not receiving enough water;  refuges are going dry.   In the short run, perhaps, we can get through this year with the  government's help. But in the long run, the Klamath community will have  to decide what kind of future they want.   Congressman LaMalfa and I stand ready to work with everyone in the  Klamath Basin to come up with real long-term solutions. It is time to  sit down together and figure this out.
