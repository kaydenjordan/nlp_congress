 Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on two  subjects. I don't have prepared remarks so I am going to speak from the  heart.   Let me talk first about the CHIP program. One of my favorite people  in the U.S. Senate is my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey,  and he just spoke very eloquently about a program called the Children's  Health Insurance Program, which is part of our Medicaid Program. It  provides health insurance for the children of America who are too poor  to be sick.   That bill will pass. The Children's Health Insurance Program will be  renewed. I want to look the American people in the eye right now and  tell them: Do not worry. Do not worry.   This is an extraordinarily able program that has served the people of  this country and our country well, and I don't want anybody to be  unnecessarily frightened at Christmas. If you are a mom or a dad or a  child or concerned citizen out there today and you hear that CHIP is in  danger, with all the respect I can muster, I want to say it is not.  Don't believe it. The CHIP program will be renewed.
