 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with our  brothers and sisters of the United Auto Workers as well as America's  auto manufacturers.   Every day, nearly a million hardworking Americans go to work on  factory floors across our country building the finest vehicles in the  world, but our workers and manufacturers cannot compete on the global  stage without a robust inventory of the semiconductor chips that help  power the auto industry.   The CHIPS Act will invest $2 billion to turbocharge domestic  production of legacy auto chips and unleash America's 21st century  innovation. The CHIPS Act will support good-paying jobs for the  American middle class, including tens of thousands of auto workers  across Ohio at Jeep, Ford, and GM.   Intel just announced a $20 billion investment in semiconductor  factories in Ohio, but that is just the beginning. Let's revitalize  America's manufacturing might, re-shore production here in the United  States, and create thousands of new living-wage jobs for our workers  and families.   Madam Speaker, it is time to pass the CHIPS Act and move America  forward by freeing us from foreign chip domination.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the Chairwoman for yielding and  thank her for her dutiful service to our country. What a legacy to  leave for the American people. Congratulations.   I rise today to highlight two amendments I have offered to the  America COMPETES Act. The first will ensure that innovative startups in  our Great Lakes region, our freshwater industrial heartland, are  prioritized when Federal support is awarded to accelerate the  commercialization of clean energy technology.   The second will allow economically distressed communities throughout  the industrial heartland to receive fair consideration for new  investments in domestic solar facilities. This is vitally important  when our Nation is competing against China, which constantly hacks our  technology and takes outsourced jobs paying penny wages to their  workers.   The America COMPETES Act offers a remarkable opportunity to stimulate  21st century growth in America. We must make sure these investments  reach down to the communities that have been outsourced of jobs and not  always received their fair share in compensation.   My amendments will allow Great Lakes communities to receive the  resources they deserve as they labor to make, build, and grow that  which makes, builds, and grows America. I ask for support of these  amendments.
