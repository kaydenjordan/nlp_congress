 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Justice in Policing Act.   Over the past few weeks, we have seen tens of thousands of Americans  take to the street demanding justice not only for George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, but also for the countless unnamed Black  Americans across the country who have been killed by the police.   The stark reality is that police brutality is a symptom of a larger  problem, and that problem is systemic racism.   Mr. Speaker, Black lives matter.   While we cannot legislate away what is in the hearts of people, we  can work to ensure that those in power are held accountable for their  actions.   The Justice in Policing Act is bold, transformative legislation that  will change the culture of law enforcement, and it would also help  build trust between law enforcement and our communities by addressing  systemic racism.   Mr. Speaker, the streets are crying out for bold and transformational  change.   Let's make sure that the people know that we see them, that we hear  them, and that at last we are doing something about it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
