Sec. 6.  The following resolutions are hereby adopted:         (a) House Resolution 176.        (b) House Resolution 177.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 179, providing for consideration of H.R. 1,  the For the People Act of 2021, under a structured rule. It self- executes a manager's amendment by Chairperson Lofgren and makes in  order 56 amendments.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on House Administration  and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1280, the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, under a closed rule. The rule  provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary and provides  for one motion to recommit.   The rule also deems as passed H. Res. 176, which directs the Clerk of  the House of Representatives to make a correction in the engrossment of  H.R. 1319, and H. Res. 177, which authorizes candidates for election to  the House and Members of the House to file statements with the Clerk  regarding the intention to participate or not participate in the small  donor financing system for such elections created by H.R. 1.   Mr. Speaker, the House will be considering two pieces of critically  important legislation this week that are a long time coming.   H.R. 1, the For the People Act, will expand voting rights, limit  partisan gerrymandering, improve election integrity, and revise rules  for political spending and government ethics. The 2020 election brought  out unprecedented turnout, even in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thanks in large part to voting by mail, more than 159 million Americans  voted, the largest total vote turnout in United States history.   What followed was the most heavily scrutinized election in modern  history, with our airwaves filled with horrific and dangerous lies that  fundamentally damaged many people's faith in our democracy. Yet,  through that entire ordeal, not a single shred of evidence of any  systemic fraud was ever discovered--none at all.   Voting in this country, however, is far from perfect. Many people,  particularly Americans of color and those from low-income families,  face tremendous barriers to making their voices heard, from long lines  at the polls to discriminatory ID laws.   I believe, and the Democratic majority believes, our national effort  should be aimed at eliminating barriers to the ballot. We believe true  participatory democracy can only be achieved when everyone--everyone-- is afforded the opportunity to vote. We believe it is better for  America that every voice be heard here in Washington, in State  capitols, and in city, town, and village halls across our Nation.   It is better for all of our citizens when each and every citizen has  a stake in what their government says and what their government does.  And we believe it is better for us on the world stage when our  democracy shines as a beacon of hope and success for others to emulate.   It is becoming increasingly clear that not everyone believes our  national interest is served by greater voter participation. It is held  in some quarters that, rather than seeing greater participation as a  sign of our democracy's enduring strength, it is instead seen as  evidence of a dark, sinister plot. Or perhaps, more cynically, they  express that view because suppressing votes, particularly of those with  whom they disagree, will improve their chances for electoral success,  even though it weakens our democracy.   Rather than trying to build on the successes of record voter turnout,  many of my friends on the other side of the aisle would rather turn  their backs on those successes and begin an organized effort to change  the rules because they didn't like the outcome.   The minority has put forward a narrative that suggests we must choose  between two separate paths, accessibility and security. But that is a  deliberately false narrative. We can, and we must, achieve both. H.R. 1  is the vehicle to advance both.   The For the People Act places a significant emphasis on election  security, in everything from voter registration to ensuring all voting  systems are secure with paper ballots and robust election result  audits.   The outrage we have heard from Republican leaders in Congress  demonstrates how out of touch they are with their own voters. More than  two-thirds of likely voters, including 57 percent of Republicans, said  they would back the proposals in H.R. 1. Americans want more  accountability from their leaders, not less.                                time  1930    They want the influence of money out of politics. They want an end to  gerrymandered districts. They want voting to be a celebration of our  civil duty, not a constant battle to overcome administrative hurdles.   We owe it to those Americans to create the ethical and accessible  democracy that they so richly deserve.   The House will also take up H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act. This legislation represents the work of hundreds of  legislators and millions of American advocates who have fought for  decades for a more equitable future.   This fight is especially personal for me, as my own community of  Rochester, New York, has grappled with two recent tragedies that  underscore just how necessary police reform truly is.   Just one block from here, on the west pediment of the United States  Supreme Court, is a promise to every American: ``Equal justice under  law.''   Sadly, we know that for too many Americans, that promise is an empty  one. It was an empty promise for Daniel Prude, who, while naked and  unarmed, faced a mental health crisis in the streets of Rochester when  police arrived on the scene last March. He needed a warm blanket and  treatment by a mental health professional. He got neither and died in  police custody just days later.   It wasn't true just a month ago for a young girl in my community, who  was forcibly restrained and pepper sprayed as she called out for her  father. She is 9 years old. A police officer on the scene, impatient  with her pleas to see her dad, urged her to stop acting like a child.  Her response: ``I am a child.''   It would be laughable if it were not heartbreaking.   Equal justice under law was an empty promise for George Floyd,  Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, and for countless others in every corner  of America and for countless more still to come unless we take bold,  decisive action.  [[Page H866]]    Indeed, it is up to each of us to make the changes necessary to  finally fulfill the promise of equal justice.   The time for incremental change has passed. It is clear that we need  a cultural paradigm shift and massive reimagining of our public safety  protocols, and that starts with the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act.   The bill prohibits religious, racial, and discriminatory profiling by  every police department in America, supported by improved training for  officers and comprehensive data collection and tracking to ensure  departments are following the law.   It will save lives by banning dangerous police practices, like choke  holds and no-knock drug warrants. It will ensure that law enforcement  uses deadly force only when absolutely necessary and only after  exhausting deescalation tactics.   This legislation would limit the transfer of military-grade equipment  to State and local law enforcement because peace, safety, and community  trust cannot--cannot--be realized with weapons of war.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will create desperately  needed accountability by expanding the use of body-worn cameras and  dashboard cameras and eliminating the qualified immunity protections  that allow bad actors in law enforcement to stay on the force.   As a whole, this legislation addresses police misconduct, creates  greater transparency, and affords victims meaningful avenues for  redress. With these policies, we can build trust and we can begin to  build cooperation between law enforcement and the communities they are  supposed to serve and protect.   We passed both the For the People Act and the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act in the previous Congress, and it is my hope that this year  represents a real opportunity to move both bills forward to the  President's desk so that we can build stronger democracy and justice  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this rule and to support both  underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just a brief comment. As much as it pains me, because I  have nothing but incredible admiration and respect for my distinguished  colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma, but when it comes to  the question of voting in the United States, the fact is that States  right now are working--many of them overtime--to restrict ballot  access. That is why it is necessary for the Congress to step forward,  as is given us, the power in the Constitution, to make sure that we  pass laws that fulfill the dream of voter access for all Americans.    I do also note that I think it would be much easier for us to believe  that there is good faith on the other side of the aisle to negotiate  some of these items and to perhaps reach compromise, but I find it hard  to believe--and I stated this in the Rules Committee--given what  happened over the last several months, that we would be in this  position, that there is any ability to have a belief in good faith.   It is hard to imagine 60 lawsuits were brought against decisions made  by States--not the Federal Government, but States--on the electoral  college. Two-thirds of the members of the House Republican Conference-- two-thirds--objected to the results of the electoral college, and, in  many cases, States that had Republican leadership and Republicans  serving as secretaries of state or as elections commissioners.   So I would suggest that since--for the first time since 1800, when  John Adams turned over the keys to the White House to President  Jefferson and we observed the first peaceful transfer of power from one  party to another, that since that foundational moment in American  history over two centuries ago, this is the first time that people in  this House have objected so strenuously and systematically to the  results of the free and fair election of the American people.   So we are for the people. We want to continue to expand ballot  access, and we want nothing more than those wishes of the American  public to be respected by their elected officials.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren), the chair of the Committee on House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oregon an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Illinois,  and I may not agree with him very much on this subject. But I really  disagree if he thinks the Committee on Rules today was fun. He must be  a heck of a cheap date.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), my good friend, and distinguished colleague from the  Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to again just note, although it has been said  ad nauseam for the last several months, that while we clearly respect  States' roles in these elections and that it is the States who run  elections and organize them, we do have the power in the Congress given  to us in the Constitution. But more importantly, this year, while the  voters in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona cast ballots in free and  fair and open elections, and those were certified repeatedly despite an  onslaught of lawsuits brought by the former President and his  advocates, all of which were denied going all the way up to the Supreme  Court, our colleagues didn't respect those States' elections even  though they were certified and even though, as we all met on what will  be one of the darkest days in American history on January 6 to accept  and certify those results given to us by the States, my colleagues and  friends objected to them.   I am not sure what that says about their respect for State elections  since they didn't respect the results of those elections, in many cases  run by Republicans in their respective States.   Mr. Speaker, I must say I find this a most curious discussion. If we  are not going to abide by the results of elections, and if we are not  going to trust those various States to submit elections unless they  agree with the outcome that we want, why we would be arguing so  strenuously for the continuation of State control and no involvement by  the Federal Government, despite the fact that the Constitution clearly  vests that power here in the Congress?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I indicated when I began my comments this evening, I  have nothing but the greatest admiration and respect for the  distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee.   I don't want to be argumentative, but I would note that I think there  is a significant and substantial difference between a symbolic  objection made by one or two Members to the electoral college results  of a single State versus the objection of 140 Members of this House,  particularly as it follows a violent, unprecedented attack on what I  consider the sacred cathedral of democracy, the United States Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much, as always, the thoughtful  comments by my colleague and friend, the distinguished gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).   Mr. Speaker, as it relates to the question of matters before us here,  we do have significant differences in how we view access to the ballot.   I would note that, historically, parties change. They evolve.  Typically, because this is in keeping with American democracy, we  evolve to reflect the needs and concerns and wishes and results of  American elections and their expression of the will of the people of  this country.   Mr. Speaker, what I find troubling right now is that friends across  the aisle seem to be focused not so much on learning the lessons given  to us by those voters, by the American public, as expressed in the  first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.   But instead, conscientious, by-design work to limit those who would  want access to the ballot so that they can choose the voters, as  opposed to the other way around--disenfranchising those, and setting up  barriers, as we see happening in State capitals across the country, is  troubling indeed. And, I think, it demonstrates the clear division  between the two parties on this particular issue.                                time  2015    We seek, and we will always seek, to expand access to make sure that  every single American, every single citizen who wants to participate in  our democracy has the right, because that is how we end up with a  better America, and we fulfill the promise of moving toward a more  perfect Union.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for their words in support  of the rule before us today. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a  ``yes'' vote on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 179         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. House Resolution 178 is hereby adopted.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
