 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It would bring billions of  dollars to much-needed infrastructure projects in my home State, from  bridges to broadband, and it does so without raising taxes on people  who make less than $400,000 a year.   As I have said before, this bill is not absolutely perfect, but it is  absolutely necessary. It is a product of compromise. That is, at the  end of the day, what legislating often means.   In the district I represent, this bill has received a remarkable  amount of support, including everyone from labor unions to local  chambers of commerce to climate groups. They are joined by national  organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, and hundreds of labor and trade associations.   I urge my colleagues to listen to their communities who are calling  for these investments and not to give in to the Washington machine that  so often turns shared bipartisan goals into political games.    This bill reminds me of the last time that we saw this level of  investment in America's infrastructure, when President Eisenhower, who  was from Kansas, recognized an opportunity to rebuild the economy and  create jobs through infrastructure. We were then, as we are today, in a  challenging time defined by a national crisis and economic difficulty.   I believe, as Eisenhower did, that infrastructure is key to building  long-term economic growth. At the end of the day, infrastructure is  made up of many everyday systems that connect us to one another and  broaden opportunities.   If we don't invest in the health of those systems, whether it is the  safety of highways like U.S. 69 in the district I get to represent, or  access to high-speed internet in areas across Kansas, both urban and  rural, we pay the price, and it is not just in the ways we might think.   We feel the impact of past decades of underinvestment in  infrastructure, in our economy, in our educational systems, in the  health of our kids, and in the health of our planet.   That is why this bill is absolutely necessary because infrastructure  touches so many parts of our lives and the lives of our future  generations. This bipartisan bill boosts American competitiveness,  tackles climate change, and advances equity now and into the future. It  is projected to create 2 million jobs per year for the next decade,  with fair wage requirements written into the text.   Independent studies have shown that the investments in this bill will  have multiplier effects on the economy, improving productivity and  boosting economic output without increasing inflation. This  infrastructure bill is large, but so is the problem.   There are immediate infrastructure needs, from roads and bridges to  public transit and rail, waterways, and airports. All of these need  attention. This bill will undoubtedly bring the Federal funding needed  to address those issues here in the near term, and it makes significant  progress toward longer-term goals, like replacing lead pipes so that  every child can have access to clean drinking water or promoting Buy  American provisions that create good-paying jobs for both construction  and production of materials or modernizing our electric grid to prevent  blackouts, like the ones we saw in Kansas and those we saw in Texas  earlier this year.  [[Page H5558]]    For people sitting in traffic on U.S. 69 or waiting for the bus in  Wyandotte County or wondering why that one road floods every single  year no matter how many times we fix it, this cannot wait. Not to  mention, if we fail to act, critical surface transportation  authorizations are going to run out by Friday.   I urge my colleagues to set aside gamesmanship and not see this as an  opportunity for political points but instead an opportunity to deliver  for our communities, the opportunity that our communities have been  asking for us to deliver on.                            ____________________
