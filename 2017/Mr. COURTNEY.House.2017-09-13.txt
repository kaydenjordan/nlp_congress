 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc  amendment which contains an amendment offered by myself and the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), which directs that funding at  the Department of the Treasury shall be used to develop a revenue  procedure related to a deduction for casualty losses for homes that are  suffering crumbling foundations in north-central and eastern  Connecticut and western Massachusetts. It is related to a pyrrhotite  material which cropped up in a quarry that was used for aggregate in  concrete foundations and is sweeping the area. Thousands of homes are  affected by it.   Mr. Larson and I are actively working with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  for this purpose.    I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.
