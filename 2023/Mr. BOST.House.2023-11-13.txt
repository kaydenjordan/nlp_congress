 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 848) encouraging the connecting of members of the  Armed Forces in the United States to support structures necessary to  transition from the battlefield.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 848         Whereas the number of suicides of members of the Armed       Forces serving on active duty increased to 377 in 2020, an       increase from 348 in 2019;        Whereas the suicide rate for veterans has steadily       increased since 2006, with 6,261 veterans taking their own       lives in 2019;        Whereas, after adjusting for sex and age, the rate of       veteran suicide in 2018 was 27.5 per 100,000 individuals,       higher than the rate among all United States adults, which       was 18.3 per 100,000 individuals;        Whereas more veterans have died by suicide in the last 10       years than members of the Armed Forces who died from combat       in Vietnam;        Whereas many of the veterans who take their own lives have       had no contact with the Department of Veterans Affairs;        Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic       can lead to increased isolation and disconnection, further       exacerbating mental and physical ailments such as post-      traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury;        Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note       that law enforcement officers and firefighters are more       likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, and       emergency medical services providers are 1.39 times more       likely to die by suicide than members of the general public;        Whereas invisible wounds linked to an underlying and       undiagnosed traumatic brain injury can mirror many mental       health conditions, a problem that can be addressed through       appropriate medical treatment; and        Whereas additional research is needed to highlight the       connection between traumatic brain injury as a root cause of       invisible wounds and suicide by members of the Armed Forces       and veterans: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) encourages all individuals in the United States,       especially members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty       and veterans, to call a warrior, have an honest conversation,       and connect them with support, understanding that making a       warrior call could save a life; and        (2) implores all individuals in the United States to commit       themselves to engaging with members of the Armed Forces and       veterans to promote solutions and treatment for the invisible       scars that members of the Armed Forces carry.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.  Res. 848.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 848, and I thank my  fellow veteran, Representative Van Orden, for his leadership on this  resolution.   As the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I believe that  we should celebrate the service of our veterans every day, not just  like we did this weekend for Veterans Day. Every day, I am grateful to  our veterans for their service to our country.   That is why this resolution is so important. Too many of our veterans  are suffering in silence. Too many of our veterans are struggling to  find their way. We owe it to them to do our part and reach out to let  them know they are not alone.   This resolution encourages all Americans to connect with the persons  in their lives who have served and offer a listening ear.  Representative Van Orden's resolution implores all Americans to help  servicemembers and veterans find solutions and treatment for the wounds  of battle that may not be visible. This resolution also highlights the  importance of taking care of our brothers and sisters in arms before,  during, and after their service.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleague for introducing it, and I  urge all Members to support it.   To any veteran who may be watching, please reach out to talk. Hope  and help are available by dialing 988 and pressing 1. We need you, and  we want to help you.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, while I understand the concerns of the minority, I would  remind the minority that both sides of the aisle on this committee are  committed to this legislation. The Colmery Act and reducing veteran  homelessness is a priority for us, and now that the House is back in  business, I hope to see it on the floor very soon.   Mr. Speaker, if 208 Democrats had put their country first and not  voted for the chaos of the 3 weeks of being without a Speaker, then  maybe they have a complaint. Nonetheless, now, because of that chaos,  maybe we would have already had these things picked up. I disagreed.   I look forward to working with both leadership and the minority to  pass it out of the House with bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I also respectfully remind the ranking member that  Speaker McCarthy's proposal to increase the grant per diem rate during  the COVID pandemic would have helped address this problem. However,  Democrats, who were in the majority at the time, made us reduce the  rate and put veterans homelessness providers in the situation we are in  today with GPD. Rates are not in line with rising inflation.   We have been very successful in making smart investments in the VA  program in recent years to reduce veteran homelessness. I agree with  the minority that now is not the time to take our foot off the gas. I  will agree with them on that.   Important legislation, such as Representative Chavez-DeRemer's bill,  is one of the best ways to build our success and get veterans housed,  which is why we are not going to stop improving these programs now.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I will get back to the resolution we have  in front of us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Van Orden), who is the sponsor of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the ranking member knows that H.R. 542, the  Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act of 2023 has my full support, but in spite  of the incredible efforts to get a realistic CBO  [[Page H5707]]  score, the bill still comes with a cost and the cost is one that we  need to resolve, along with the Toxic Exposure Fund, or the TEF issue.   We are working closely with our Senate counterparts to get this bill  and several other high-priority pieces of legislation through both  Chambers by the end of the year, and you know that I support them.   Mr. Speaker, let me talk about the resolution that is in front of us.  I do know and understand that this is an excellent bill, and I  encourage all Members to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 593) to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based  outpatient clinic in Hinesville, Georgia, as the ``John Gibson, Dan  James, William Sapp, and Frankie Smiley VA Clinic.''   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 593         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-                    BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, HINESVILLE, GEORGIA.          The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic in Hinesville, Georgia, shall after the       date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as       the ``John Gibson, Dan James, William Sapp, and Frankie       Smiley VA Clinic''. Any reference to such clinic in any law,       regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the       United States shall be considered to be a reference to the       John Gibson, Dan James, William Sapp, and Frankie Smiley VA       Clinic.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 593, a bill to rename  the Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Hinesville,  Georgia, as the John Gibson, Dan James, William Sapp, Frankie Smiley VA  Clinic.   I would take a moment to tell each of these Americans' stories of  service.   John Gibson was born in Riceboro, Georgia, and later joined the  Marine Corps where he rose to the rank of private first class. He  deployed to Vietnam in 1967, served 100 days in-country, 65 of which  were in combat. He was killed by small arms fire on February 7, 1968,  in Quang Nam, South Vietnam, during the Tet Offensive at just 21 years  old.   Dan Ninkey James was also a native of Riceboro, Georgia, and deployed  to Vietnam in 1968. He was an SP4 in the Army's 25th Infantry Division.  While in Vietnam, out of a total of 100 days in theater, he also saw 65  days of combat. Dan James was killed in action by small arms fire on  December 29, 1968, in Hua Nghia, South Vietnam. He was recently married  and was just 20 years old.   Their fellow Georgian, William Edward Sapp, was born on March 12,  1943. He joined the Army's 4th Infantry Division during the war,  reaching the rank of SP4. While deployed in Vietnam, he served 114 days  in combat out of a total of 175 days in theater. William Sapp was  killed in action on June 7, 1968, in Kon Tum, South Vietnam, at the age  of 25.   Last, but certainly not least, Frankie Lee Smiley was born in Miami,  Florida. He joined the Marine Corps and rose to the rank of lance  corporal in the 1st Marine Division.   He deployed to Vietnam in 1968. He served 205 days in theater, with  133 days of combat. Lance Corporal Smiley was killed by small arms fire  on August 25, 1968, in Quang Nam, South Vietnam, at the age of 24. He  is buried in Cay Cemetery in Dorchester, Georgia.   All of these men rose to the call of the Nation and made the ultimate  sacrifice. All of these men were 25 years old or less. To give your  life for your country at the dawn of your life is an incredible  sacrifice and one we can't forget. By naming the clinic after these  men, they will continue to be remembered and honored in the place they  called home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Buddy Carter for introducing this  bill and his work in making this happen.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 593, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), a very close friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that, as the chairman of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs, along with working with the leadership, several  times during this time here since January, certain things have been  said: One, that we were going to cut funding for veterans back whenever  the caps were increased, and that proved out that we did not do that.   I have told the ranking member and the Democrats who work with the  committee that these two bills are vitally important, but we must be  wise. We must move forward, and we must make sure they get across the  threshold.   Now, also know this: On Elizabeth Dole, I want the bill. As my  colleague from the other side of the aisle made a statement, she loved  working with Elizabeth Dole. Well, I am going to tell you, I have been  working with Elizabeth Dole for about 30 years on most things that she  brought up back when she was a Senator, back when her husband was  running for President.   We are going to be working to try to figure it out. It was said from  the other side of the aisle that the CBO score came back, but there is  still a cost. That cost has to be calculated.   I explained, when we passed the PACT Act, that there was a problem,  not that we weren't going to provide exactly everything that the PACT  Act said, but the TIF had some language problems that actually double- counted some of the things we are providing for our veterans already.   Now, if someone will work with me, let's get this working with this  side of the aisle and across the rotunda to try to figure this out so  that we can make sure we can provide all of these other things that we  want to provide.   As far as the fact of how fast we brought them forward, let me say  this: Whether you want to admit it or not, when the other side of the  aisle joined with the eight to remove the Speaker of this House and  then caused the chaos that occurred for 3 weeks, that is 3 weeks we  have lost and can't get back. We are going to work very hard to try to  get it back, and we are going to try to pass everything that they have  talked about.   The ranking member quoted some Scripture, so let me quote some, and  then I am going to shift to something else. Proverbs 29:11 said: A fool  gives full vent to his feelings, but a wise man holds them back.   At this time, I am going to hold those feelings back about the things  that were said. Let me say that what we are really talking about here  is the naming of a CBOC for four amazing people who made a sacrifice.   For those of us with more gray hair who have seen the nightly news  when we sat around the dinner tables back in the time when these  valiant soldiers and marines fell, we remember what it was like to see  Walter Cronkite come on and give a list of where the battles had been  and a list of how many people were dead, how many were wounded, where  the next battle was looking like it was going to come up.   Later on, right after you followed up with your local news, there was  a list of young servicemembers who wouldn't be coming home, at the  local level.   Good heavens, with that war for the first 13 years of my life, I  thought you were born, raised, got out of high school, and then went to  Vietnam. If you survived Vietnam, you could actually go home and live a  real life. These guys didn't get the chance to do that.   Mr. Carter has worked very hard on making sure that we are going to  name this in tribute to them, as we should.   I will still continue to have the other debates and discussions. I am  sorry we had to do that now, that we had to at the sacrifice of what we  were debating here, that all of this floor time couldn't have been  given to those four heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the  gentleman's resolution and this bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
