 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the gentleman for his leadership as well as the author, Mrs.  Brooks, for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting Young Victims  from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act. In the wake of the  horrendous revelations of sexual abuse brought to the forefront by the  recent USA Gymnastics case, it is clear that measures do need to be put  in place to protect young athletes and keep them safe.   No child should ever be put in the position of having their innocence  robbed from them, which is why we need to have the highest protections  of the law from those looking to exploit them and take advantage of  their vulnerability.   I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan bill which will require amateur athletic-governing bodies to  immediately report sex abuse allegations to local or Federal law  enforcement and also to make it safe and easy for victims to report  that abuse.   As the Olympics approach, there is no doubt, we will all be reminded,  unfortunately, of the recent sexual abuse case that took place with the  gymnastics team. But this is our opportunity to take action, to do  everything in our power to make sure that this does not happen again,  and to protect all of our young and future athletes, giving them the  confidence that they will never be put in a situation where an adult or  someone who may have inappropriate intentions does not have the ability  to do so.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Beau Allen, a  Minnetonka High School graduate and defensive tackle for the  Philadelphia Eagles, who is now on his way to play in the Super Bowl  after a strong performance in the NFC Championship Game just a week  ago.   Beau graduated from Minnetonka High School in 2010, and he is the  only Minnetonka student in history to start all 4 years. After  graduating, he went on to play for Wisconsin and didn't miss a game in  his 4 years on that team. And then, in 2014, Beau was a seventh-round  NFL pick and joined the Philadelphia Eagles.   He is a key member of the team's defensive line rotation. The Eagles'  defense is now ranked first against the run, the fourth in the points  allowed, and fourth overall.   As a Vikings fan, I was crushed that our season ended the way that it  did, but it is exciting to see someone from our community now being  able to play in the Super Bowl. I look forward to seeing Minnetonka  represented on the field this Sunday.   Good luck, Beau.                            ____________________
