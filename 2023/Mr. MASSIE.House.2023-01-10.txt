 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the very words expressed by those opposed to this  committee demonstrate the dire need for this committee. We have gone 4  years without oversight, and to quote Shakespeare, ``The lady doth  protest too much, methinks.''   Those who argue against transparency may have something to hide. So I  listened very closely when I heard the former chairman of the  Intelligence Committee give the reason that maybe we shouldn't ask for  this information from the intelligence community.   He said that the intelligence community after this committee may be  reluctant to share information with Congress and that Congress needs to  craft legislation.   I would suggest if they are reluctant, then they are disqualified  from holding  [[Page H142]]  these positions. If they have grown so big that they are no longer  accountable to the branch of government that created them, that funds  them, and that is responsible for their oversight, then they need to be  hemmed in.   I implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to populate  this committee with serious Democrats. I know there are some over  there. I have worked with them. We have cosponsored amendments on  privacy over the past decade. Some of them have passed.   Please populate it with serious Members.   Please, to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, give us the  resources we need to do this job.   If I may rebut one thing that man said on the other side of the aisle  about ongoing criminal investigations, he said that it is unprecedented  that Congress would engage in an investigation that involves an ongoing  criminal investigation.   What was the January 6 Committee?   This is not unprecedented. It is what you wasted millions of dollars  on over the past 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this rule and support for the  committee that it will create.
