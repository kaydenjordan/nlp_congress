 Mr. President, I rise this morning, of course, to support  the nominations of Pete Buttigieg to be Secretary of Transportation and  Alejandro Mayorkas to head the Department of Homeland Security. They  are both exceptional choices by the administration to fill critical  positions.   This afternoon when we vote on Mr. Mayorkas, it will be the  completion of three of the four national security elements of the  Cabinet for President Biden, having previously voted for the Secretary  of State and Secretary of Defense.   The post remaining, of course, after today's actions--if they are  favorable, and I believe they will be--is the office of Attorney  General, and I would like to address that directly.   First, let me say this. When you feel that you are the target of  terrorists--a personal target of terrorists--you will never forget the  moment. It has only happened twice in my life. On 9/11/2001, as a U.S.  Senator, I was in a meeting in a room just several feet away from the  Senate Chamber when the attack on the World Trade Center took place and  the attack on the Pentagon. Those were terrorists at work, killing  innocent people.   There was one more plane in the air. We didn't know where it was  headed. It was early in the morning on that day that we were told to  evacuate the Capitol Building, the first time I had ever faced that as  a Member of Congress.   We quickly ran out the doors and down the stairs and stood on the  lawn outside of the Capitol, wondering what was next, for fear that  this building--this symbol of America and its greatness--was the next  target of an attack. It could have been.   We are not sure. We never will be. But thanks to the heroic efforts  of passengers on an airplane--they attacked the attackers, went after  the terrorists, personally, and brought that plane down in Pennsylvania  at the cost of their own lives--in a way, many of us were spared of  being targets of terrorism that day.   When we reflect on those 3,000 innocent Americans who lost their  lives in New York, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon, I will never  forget the feeling that I was spared that act of terrorism and the hope  that no one in America would ever have that fear again.   Fast forward to January 6, 2021, fewer than 4 weeks ago, here in the  U.S. Capitol. Again, I felt I was the target of terrorists. That was  the day when an insurrectionist mob stormed the Capitol, broke through  the doors, beat down the windows, and came marching toward the Senate  Chamber. I will never forget that moment, and I don't think anyone who  was here at the time could possibly forget it.   It was 2:15 in the afternoon when the Vice President of the United  States was removed from the chair that you are sitting in, Mr.  President. He was whisked off the platform to a safe room so he could  be spared from anything that might come from this mob.   The rest of us were told to sit at our desk. We would make a safe  Chamber--one safe room in the Capitol. We lined the walls with staffers  to protect them against this insurrectionist mob, and we waited, but  only for a few minutes.   The order was reversed quickly: Leave the Chamber. What had happened,  we came to learn, was that the same mob of terrorists continued to  advance through the Capitol, despite the valiant efforts of the Capitol  Police and other law enforcement.   It was during that period of time when this mob of terrorists was  attacking this building, the United States Capitol, when Officer Brian  Sicknick of the Capitol Police lost his life.   We honor him tomorrow by bringing his remains to the Capitol for him  to lie in repose, a place of honor, for all of us to thank him and his  family and to thank all of the men and women who risk their lives--and,  certainly, one who gave his life--in the service of our Nation.   These men and women who stand in silen service every single day are  often overlooked by visitors, but they are literally risking their  lives. In the time I have served in the House and the  [[Page S218]]  Senate, this is at least the third occasion when members of the Capitol  Police have given their lives to protect me, and Brian Sicknick will  not be forgotten.    For those who want to take this insurrectionist mob and the  incitement of this mob as just another political protest, I ask them to  reflect for a moment, please, on the graphic video evidence of what  happened on that day, as people who were part of this mob took baseball  bats, sticks, everything they could get their hands on, and beat up  against those law enforcement agents. It was a sad moment.   Yesterday's New York Times spelled out what led up to it: a big lie  that the former President of the United States actually won the  November 3 election.   He did not. The votes were counted and he lost, but he has never been  able to accept that reality, and what he has done in the meantime is to  foment a revolt against our government at the grassroots level across  America.   That is the reason why a new Attorney General brought to the position  of leadership as quickly as possible is so important. I regret that,  once again, I need to come to the floor to call on the Senate  Republicans to stop blocking Merrick Garland from receiving a hearing  before the Senate Judiciary Committee.   We all remember the way Merrick Garland, a judge in the Circuit Court  of the DC Circuit, was treated by Senate Republicans in 2016 when he  was nominated by President Obama to the Supreme Court. I am not going  to recount the entire history today, but I will tell you, it was not a  proud moment for the U.S. Senate when Senate leaders on the other side  of the aisle announced they would not give him a hearing. They  literally would not even meet with him to give him the dignity of such  an opportunity to discuss his nomination for the Supreme Court.   But I do want to talk about the urgency of putting President Biden's  national security team in place, including Merrick Garland, the  President's nominee for Attorney General. Our country faces, as we  learned on January 6, challenges of great importance at this moment in  our history.   As we faced that mob assault on the Capitol Building for the first  time since the War of 1812, our Capitol was breached by attackers,  domestic terrorists. Domestic terrorists were part of a coordinated,  comprehensive effort to stop the Government of the United States. That  situation needs to be carefully reviewed and examined by the Department  of Justice and the Attorney General as quickly as possible.   There is no person better qualified to lead this investigation, to  bring these perpetrators to justice, and to prevent future domestic  terror attacks than Merrick Garland. When he previously served at the  Justice Department, Judge Garland oversaw the investigation and  prosecution of the largest domestic terrorism attack in recent  history--the Oklahoma City bombing. His qualifications and experience  are well suited for the moment we face.   As our Nation's top law enforcement officer, the Attorney General is  a key part of the President's national security team. The Attorney  General oversees our Nation's law enforcement response to threats both  foreign and domestic.   My Republican colleagues frequently talked about letting the new  President get his national security team in place at the start of his  administration. Despite the unresolved nature of the Senate's  organizing resolution, other subcommittees have come together on a  bipartisan basis to schedule prompt hearings and votes for nominees,  including the Secretary of Defense, Director of National Intelligence,  Secretary of Homeland Security, and Secretary of State. We need to do  the same when it comes to the nomination of Merrick Garland to serve as  Attorney General.   Why would we allow partisanship to get in the way of national  security?   I have urged my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee-- current Chairman Graham and incoming Ranking Member Grassley--to  consent to start the hearing for Merrick Garland as soon as possible.   I proposed February 8, next Monday, as a hearing date, in part to  accommodate Senator Graham's request to avoid holding a hearing during  the impeachment trial. A February 8 hearing date gives the committee  sufficient time to review Judge Garland's record. It would follow the  same timeline--the very same timeline--that Senator Graham used for  Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court last year.    Remember, the committee has already received the vast majority of  Judge Garland's record, including his speeches, interviews, and  publications, that less than 5 years ago was presented when he was  nominated to the Supreme Court. We have had this material in the  committee for years. Senator Graham claims that important paperwork for  Judge Garland is still missing. The only thing that has not been filed  is Judge Garland's FBI background investigation. As important as it is,  the Judiciary Committee has scheduled hearings for previous Attorney  General nominees before the FBI background investigations had been  submitted. For example, the committee received then-Senator Jeff  Sessions' FBI background investigation just 5 days before his hearing,  and we are still 6 days away from a proposed hearing date. So what we  are asking is not unprecedented or unrealistic.   Senator Graham points out that Attorney General nominees typically  have 2-day hearings--1 day to question the nominee and the other day to  question outside witnesses. This isn't always the case. For example,  the Republicans held a 1-day hearing to consider Alberto Gonzales's  nomination to be Attorney General. Yet, if the goal is to ensure there  is sufficient time to question the nominee and to hear from outside  witnesses, I am willing to do just that--allow for two rounds of  questions of the nominee and an outside witness panel.   I also find it surprising that Senator Graham objects to committee  business on the eve of an impeachment trial. Just remember the history.  On January 16, 2020--the same day that the previous impeachment trial  of this President started--Senator Graham held a committee markup  during which the committee considered 11 judicial nominees. There was  nothing sacred about the day before or day of an impeachment trial  then, when Senator Graham was chairman.   Judge Garland is a consensus pick. As even Senator Graham has  acknowledged, the Senate should generally be deferential to a  President's Cabinet nominees, and that is particularly true for  national security positions. There is an even greater urgency to move  swiftly to confirm Judge Garland, given the events of January 6 and the  Justice Department's role in investigating and responding to those  events and other national security threats.   I hope Republicans will consent now to notice a hearing for February  8. It would show real bipartisanship and fairness. Under our committee  rules, we can still notice the hearing with less than 7 days if my  Republican colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee agree to do so.  We need to get the Attorney General confirmed, and there is no  justification for any further delay.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
