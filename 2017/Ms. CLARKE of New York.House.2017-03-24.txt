 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this sham American Health Care Act.   I am from Brooklyn, and in Brooklyn we know: Men lie; women lie; the  numbers don't. Here are the numbers:   This reckless and destructive bill leaves 24 million Americans  without coverage. It will cause the uninsured rate for my district to  skyrocket over 12 percent and leave over 400,000 Brooklynites without  coverage.   Because of age discrimination in this bill, the age tax, it will put  our seniors in the terrible position of having to choose between  eating, visiting their doctors, or purchasing medication.   Which one do you, Mr. Speaker, suggest they choose?   I also vehemently oppose the Empire State kickback language put in  this bill as an attempt to get Republican votes. This language is a  dressed up earmark that specifically targets New York City. It targets  my home.   This would further reduce Medicaid funds for New York by an  additional $2 billion. The trade-off, raising city taxes to cover the  gap.   For most Americans, Medicaid benefits are not the end goal but rather  [provides] temporary support, but for our seniors Medicaid can mean the  difference between nursing home care, family home care and dying alone.   I urge my colleagues to consider the harmful real life impact of this  legislation and to oppose it. Brooklyn Resists . . . America must  resist.  [[Page H2422]]    Thank you and I yield the balance of my time.
