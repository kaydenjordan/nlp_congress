 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Texas Congressional  District 12's very own TCU Horned Frogs on a memorable college football  season.   Even though last night's result was not the one we were hoping for,  the Horned Frogs proved to be the ultimate underdog story of the year.   TCU was the smallest college or university to ever play a national  championship in the modern era. They have shown great resolve and  resiliency this year, which has inspired people across the Nation.   I congratulate Coach Sonny Dykes, quarterback Max Duggan, and all the  staff and players on a tremendous season. The whole Fort Worth  community is incredibly proud of TCU's accomplishments.   It is a privilege to represent Texas Christian University in  Congress, and it was a pleasure to cheer on the team all season. Go  Frogs.                            ____________________
