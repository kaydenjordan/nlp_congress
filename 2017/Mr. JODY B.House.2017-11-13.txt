 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2331) to require a new or updated Federal  website that is intended for use by the public to be mobile friendly,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2331         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Amendment.--Subchapter II of chapter 35 of title 44,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``Sec. 3559. Federal websites required to be mobile friendly.         ``(a) In General.--If, on or after the date that is 180       days after the date of the enactment of this section, an       agency creates a website that is intended for use by the       public or conducts a redesign of an existing legacy website       that is intended for use by the public, the agency shall       ensure to the greatest extent practicable that the website is       mobile friendly.        ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Agency.--The term `agency' has the meaning given that       term in section 551 of title 5.        ``(2) Mobile friendly.--The term `mobile friendly' means,       with respect to a website, that the website is configured in       such a way that the website may be navigated, viewed, and       accessed on a smartphone, tablet computer, or similar mobile       device.''.

HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2331, introduced by the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly). The bill requires all Federal  agencies to ensure any Federal Government website intended for use by  the public is mobile friendly. Services offered by the Federal  Government should be effective but also accessible to the public.  Agency websites are one of the most important tools for taxpayers to  observe services and information from the government.   The U.S. Government runs more than 6,000 websites on over 400  domains. One recent study estimated that approximately 40 percent of  government websites either are not accessible or are difficult to  access on a phone, yet nearly 80 percent of Americans own a smartphone,  and at least 1 in 10 American adults rely exclusively on a smartphone  for access to the internet, according to a Pew survey. The data clearly  points to the utility of making all government websites mobile  friendly.   Another study found that more people accessed the internet on their  mobile devices than a desktop computer for the first time last year. It  is clear that Federal agencies must emphasize mobile accessibility to  effectively serve the American people. The Connected Government Act  will require agencies to do just that.   This bill requires Federal agencies to ensure their websites are  mobile friendly during the course of creating new websites or updating  existing ones. A mobile-friendly government is a necessary step in the  modernization of the government's IT infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, the gentlewoman from Illinois,  for her work in sponsoring this bill. I am proud also to support this  bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her great work on this bill, I urge adoption of it, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 3071) to require executive agencies to consider  equipment rental in any cost-effectiveness analysis for equipment  acquisition, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3071         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Acquisition Savings       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF EQUIPMENT RENTAL.         (a) Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Equipment Rental.--        (1) In general.--With respect to any cost-effectiveness       analysis for equipment acquisition conducted on or after the       date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the head of each executive agency shall consider       equipment rental in such cost-effectiveness analysis.        (2) Federal acquisition regulation.--The Federal       Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to implement the       requirement under paragraph (1).        (b) Study of Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.--Not later than       two years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a comprehensive report on       the decisions made by the executive agencies with the highest       levels of acquisition spending, and a sample of executive       agencies with lower levels of acquisition spending, to       acquire high-value equipment by lease, rental, or purchase       pursuant to subpart 7.4 of the Federal Acquisition       Regulation.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Equipment rental.--The term ``equipment rental'' means       the acquisition of equipment by contract from a commercial       source for a temporary period of use with no fixed duration.        (2) Executive agency.--The term ``executive agency'' has       the meaning given that term in section 102 of title 40,       United States Code.     HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3071, introduced by my  colleague from Georgia (Mr. Carter), and which I have cosponsored.   The Federal Acquisition Savings Act of 2017 would require the  government to consider renting equipment over buying or leasing that  equipment. The Government Accountability Office reported that agencies  annually spend an average of more than $200 billion on purchasing or  leasing equipment, with purchasing accounting for almost all of that  spending.   The Federal Acquisition Savings Act of 2017 provides an opportunity  to save money when obtaining equipment. The current rules encourage  agencies to consider the most cost-effective way to obtain equipment,  but only between purchasing or leasing. Renting is not an option.   H.R. 3071 requires agencies to consider renting equipment as a cost- saving measure over purchasing or leasing. The bill also directs that  the Federal Acquisition Regulation be revised to implement this policy.  Renting equipment can provide a more cost-effective and flexible  alternative to buying or leasing.   When purchasing equipment, the purchaser makes a long-term investment  and assumes the total cost of ownership for that equipment. However,  some short-term needs can be met without assuming the cost of  purchasing and maintaining equipment. Leasing or renting are options in  such cases. Leasing should be considered, but, depending on an agency's  needs, leasing may not be the best low-cost option. Typically, leases  involve defined leasing periods and are specific to a single piece of  equipment.   In addition, leasing may require a large upfront outlay of capital,  and, under a lease, the government is generally responsible for the  cost of maintenance, insurance, and storage of the equipment.  Alternatively, rental for a temporary period with no fixed duration may  fit the need and provide a more flexible option.                                time  1630    Renting equipment may be cost-effective because rental agreements  typically cover costs such as storage, maintenance, insurance,  transport, and licensing.   Other State and local governments have used the equipment rental  option with great success, but the Federal Government has not widely  adopted this low-cost option. For example, the Texas Department of  Transportation reported saving $10.8 million due to a rental program.  They reported renting more than 1,200 pieces of equipment at a cost of  $18.9 million and purchasing 931 assets costing more than $40 million.   The Mississippi Department of Transportation commissioned a study on  their equipment management processes and systems, and that study found  that renting equipment, such as bulldozers and motor graders, to  supplement their fleet was the most cost-effective option. In fact,  that study found that Mississippi could realize over $13,000 in annual  cost savings and $180,000 in lifecycle cost savings per bulldozer unit.   H.R. 3071 presents an opportunity to realize cost savings in  obtaining equipment by directing agencies to consider the rental  option.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Buddy Carter for his  leadership on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and  privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), the sponsor of the bill.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this  bill, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 3739) to amend the Act of August 25, 1958,  commonly known as the ``Former Presidents Act of 1958'', with respect  to the monetary allowance payable to a former President, and for other  purposes, as amended.

HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3739, a bill I introduced to limit  the allowances paid to former Presidents.   Congress passed the Former Presidents Act of 1958 to maintain the  dignity of the Office of the President and assist former Presidents who  did not have sufficient financial resources. It is a noble purpose, but  times have changed. When the Former Presidents Act was passed, Herbert  Hoover and Harry Truman were the only two former living Presidents.  Unlike the more recent former Presidents, they did not earn millions of  dollars from speaking fees and book deals after leaving office.   For example, President Clinton earned more than $100 million in  speaking fees between 2001 and 2013. President George W. Bush received  $10 million for his book deal. In April 2017, President Obama spoke at  a Wall Street firm for a fee of $400,000, and he and the former First  Lady also reportedly signed a joint book deal worth over $65 million.   It is a fact of the modern Presidency that these lucrative financial  opportunities are available now as they were not to former Presidents.  Because of these opportunities, it is no longer necessary to provide  taxpayer-funded support to former Presidents in the same way as  envisioned in 1958.   H.R. 3739 presents a fair way to reduce taxpayer support to those  former Presidents who no longer need such assistance. Furthermore, with  our Nation facing $20 trillion in debt, we must find ways to save  taxpayer money, and our former Presidents will lead by example in  cutting costs under this bill.   The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act reforms pensions and  allowances provided to former Presidents and surviving spouses and  reduces unnecessary costs to the taxpayer.   This bill sets a former President's pension at $200,000, compared to  current law where the pension is linked to the Cabinet Secretary's pay  level, currently at $204,700. Surviving spouses of former Presidents  will be eligible for a pension of $100,000, a more realistic amount  than the $20,000 pension available under current law.   Currently, former Presidents are also eligible for other benefits  paid through annual appropriations. These include  [[Page H9147]]  office space and leases, furniture and supplies, and staff salaries.  Such additional benefits provided to former Presidents totaled $2.84  million in fiscal year 2017 and $2.43 million the year before.   Instead, this bill will provide a $500,000 lump sum allowance for  each eligible former President to cover such expenses. This allowance  will be reduced dollar-for-dollar for any earned income in excess of  $400,000. For example, a former President making $900,000 in earned  income would not be eligible for the allowance.   For former Presidents eligible for the allowance, the allowance will  decrease over time. Five years after the former President has left  office, the allowance is reduced to $350,000, and then 10 years later,  the allowance is reduced to $250,000.   In the 114th Congress, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act  of 2016 was passed, but it was not signed into law. Senator Joni Ernst  and I have worked with other stakeholders to improve the bill in 2017.  This 2017 bill advances the same principles of accountability and  modernization as the 2016 legislation but makes some key changes.   First, the bill provides a 6-month period after the date of enactment  before the bill takes effect to ensure current former Presidents have  time to plan for the changes.   Second, the bill increases the allowance amount from $200,000 in the  previous bill language to $500,000. However, as described earlier, this  allowance decreases over time, but it is not entirely eliminated should  a former President be eligible for the allowance.   The office of the former President is an important institution to  support in a nominal way. We were all recently reminded of the  importance of this institution by the joint effort of former Presidents  to raise hurricane relief funds.   The third change made in this version of the bill is the pension and  allowance are terminated 30 days after the death of a former  President--instead of immediately upon death. This change was made to  accommodate the work that must be done to wrap up the affairs of a  former President.                                time  1645    Finally, I want to assure my colleagues that this bill does not  impact funding for the security or protection of a former President.   Again, I want to thank Senator Ernst for her work on this bill in the  previous years and this particular bill in 2017. It has been a real  pleasure to work with her and her staff.   I want to acknowledge Members such as Mr. Cummings, Mr. Grothman, and  the former chairman, Mr. Chaffetz, whose work on this bill last year  positioned us to be successful this year. I also want to express my  gratitude to the professional staff on the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee, who have put in so many hours of work on  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this  bill,  [[Page H9148]]  and I yield back the balance of my time.
