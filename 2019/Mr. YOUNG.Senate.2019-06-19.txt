 Mr. President, having served in the Navy and as a Marine  Corps officer, I am sensitive to the many challenges facing our  veterans. The VA was established almost 90 years ago, so when the VA  MISSION Act was passed, it was time for a wide-scale reform to  modernize and improve the system.   I was proud to support and vote for the VA MISSION Act, which was  signed into law 1 year ago this month. This new program could  dramatically change the way our veterans receive care. For the first  time, veterans can walk into a local urgent care clinic, like most  Americans can--as long as it is in network--and receive care that day,  at no cost to them, up to three visits per year. They can even get a  flu shot now at urgent care rather than having to visit the VA for such  a simple procedure.   The VA MISSION Act is already at work back home in Indiana. In fact,  a Hoosier veteran recently approached me while I was traveling  throughout the State, and he said there was an appointment he could not  get scheduled with the VA until August or September. Now, we had this  conversation some weeks ago, but when the VA MISSION Act went into  effect at the beginning of this month, he tried again, and he was able  to get an appointment right away. So I am sure this is just the first  of many positive stories I am going to be hearing as I travel around  the State in coming days and even years to come.   It is also important that we in Congress listen to those whose  experience with the VA has not improved. If there is a part of this act  that isn't working or isn't being implemented as intended, then we have  to revisit it. We have to work with the VA to get it right--removing  barriers within the system and streamlining access to care. This is  going to help veterans of all eras live happy and healthier lives. So  that is what matters the most.   I will continue to fight for the proper care and treatment of our  veterans because they deserve nothing less.   I yield back.
