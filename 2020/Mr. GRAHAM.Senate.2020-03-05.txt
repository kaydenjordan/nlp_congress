 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later in the day, I will be making a  motion to table the Paul amendment that would require offsetting the  $7.76 billion for the coronavirus against the foreign operations  account.   Senator Paul is at it again. He is consistent. I respect his view; I  just reject it. What he would be doing is basically upending the fiscal  year 2020 agreement on foreign assistance spending passed by Congress  and signed into law by President Trump. He would be putting our Nation  at risk if this amendment actually passed.   One percent of the Federal spending is foreign assistance in  different fashions and ways, including our commitment to our friends in  Israel and other programs we have that I think are national-defense  oriented.   The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition--consisting of 500 businesses,  NGOs, military, and faith leaders--has warned that ``cuts of this  magnitude would have devastating consequences on our ability to  confront unprecedented global challenges--including countering China's  growing influence around the world, supporting partners in the fight  against extremism, and addressing the impacts of the Venezuelan refugee  crisis on key allies like Colombia.''   I would even go further: This cut would devastate the foreign  assistance account in terms of being able to deal effectively with the  effects of the virus overseas.   David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme, warned in an AP  article, which I would like to make part of the Record, that ``if the  coronavirus continues to create panic around the world, and there is an  economic downturn, I have been telling European leaders, and leaders  around the world, you don't have enough money set aside to address the  needs in Africa, East Africa, West Africa, in the Middle East right  now.''   We are only beginning to understand the cost associated with the  virus.   I want to compliment Senators Shelby and Leahy for putting this  package together. I compliment the White House, the Senate, and the  House. There was a huge vote in the House.   If we accept Senator Paul's offset amendment, we will be devastating  our ability as a nation to deal with this matter overseas.   As to Senator Paul's world view, I have consistently rejected it.  When it comes to international terrorism, I have no desire to go back  to the pre-9/11 footprint of where we ignore problems over there,  hoping they will not come here. When it comes to fighting disease and  containing viruses, I think we understand that we have to be present  over there, and in an effective way, to control the spread of the  coronavirus, Ebola, and other diseases that can make their way to  America.   We have always rejected these types of offsets by Senator Paul. I  think the best thing we can do is have an overwhelming bipartisan vote.  Count me in for dealing with the deficit, but this is penny wise and  pound foolish because the $7.6 billion, if it is taken out of the  foreign operations account, makes this country less safe on multiple  fronts.   I will be making a motion to table at the appropriate time. And I  urge my colleagues to understand that what happens over there matters  to us over here. This would devastate programs like the Benjamin Gilman  International Scholarships and participant schools like Berea College  and Western Kentucky University. There is a ripple effect of enormous  proportions. It is not going to do much for the debt, but it will do a  lot to make us less safe.   I yield to Senator Leahy.    I would like to again compliment you and Senator Shelby.  You always deliver. You always seem to be able to do things that other  people can't do at a time when we need you to deliver for the body and  the country.   Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the Record an article,  ``UN food aid chief fears for Africa, Mideast amid new crises,'' and a  U.S. Global Leadership Coalition letter, dated March 5, 2020.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        UN Food Aid Chief Fears for Africa, Mideast Amid New Crises                              [March 5, 2020]         Amman, Jordan (AP)--The head of the U.N.'s food aid agency       warned of ``absolute devastation'' in Africa and parts of the       Middle East in coming months if wealthier nations grappling       with an economic downturn linked to the new coronavirus don't       step up aid efforts in countries in need.        David Beasley, head of the World Food Program, told The       Associated Press that the convergence of several crises could       further destabilize conflict-scarred regions.        ``If the corona virus continues to create panic around the       world, and there is an economic downturn, I have been telling       the European leaders, and leaders around the world, you don't       have enough money set aside to address the needs in Africa,       East Africa, West Africa, in the Middle East right now,''       Beasley said during an interview in Jordan late Wednesday,       after a visit to Syria.        ``If there is an economic downturn, on top of the economic       downturn that exists now in Syria and Lebanon, it absolutely       could be a catastrophe,'' he said. ``I mean absolute       devastation. I am very concerned about what would happen in       the next six months. You  [[Page S1514]]       could see destabilization unlike any time period, maybe in my       lifetime.''        In the Middle East, Iran has been hardest hit by the new       virus which has spread around the globe after first being       detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. There       are over 3,740 cases of the virus across the Mideast, with       most linking back to the Islamic Republic which also       confirmed dozens of deaths. Only a small number of cases has       been reported in Sub-Saharan Africa so far.        Beasley did not give an amount for additional aid needed,       but suggested it would be in the billions of dollars. Beasley       spoke after a tour of Syria's northwestern ldlib province,       the country's last rebel stronghold, where hundreds of       thousands of civilians have been displaced in recent weeks by       a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive.        U.N. agencies, including the WFP, are distributing aid in       ldlib, but are often hampered by logistics problems,       including shifting front lines, access restrictions and roads       clogged by large numbers of people on the move.        The leaders of Russia, which backs the Syrian government,       and Turkey, which backs the rebels, were meeting in Moscow on       Thursday to try to avert further calamity. But any deal will       likely bring only a temporary halt in the punishing offensive       by the military of Syria's President Bashar Assad, which       threatens continued suffering for the 3 million people       trapped in ldlib.        Beasley appealed to leaders on all sides of the Syrian       conflict to end the war, which has raged for nine years.       ``Enough is enough,'' he said. ``Too many people have       suffered too long.''                                   ____                                 U.S. Global Leadership Coalition,                                                      March 5, 2020.      Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Subcommittee on State-Foreign Operations, Committee           on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on State-Foreign Operations,           Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf of       the more than 500 business and NGO members of the U.S. Global       Leadership Coalition USGLC), including business, military,       and faith-based leaders in all 50 states, I write in strong       opposition to an amendment proposed by Senator Rand Paul that       would offset emergency funding to address the growing       coronavirus threat by canceling over $8 billion in       congressionally approved funds for the International Affairs       Budget.        If enacted, this amendment would cancel critical funding       for State Department, USAID, and other development programs       around the world, undermining our national security and       economic interests and placing America's global leadership at       risk. Cuts of this magnitude would have devastating       consequences on our ability to confront unprecedented global       challenges--including countering China's growing influence       around the world, supporting partners in the fight against       extremism, and addressing the impacts of the Venezuelan       refugee crisis on key allies like Colombia.        There is a strong bipartisan legacy in the Senate of       rejecting deep and dangerous cuts to America's development       and diplomacy programs. I urge the Senate to once again take       decisive action and reject Senator Paul's shortsighted       amendment. Doing so will ensure that resources already       approved by Congress can be fully deployed to support cost-      effective programs that advance America's interests.        Thank you for your unwavering support of America's       international affairs programs and your commitment to       strengthening the critical resources needed to advance       America's global leadership.            Sincerely,                                                      Liz Schrayer,                                            President & CEO, USGLC.     Mr. President, I wrap up by saying that Senator Paul is  consistent. Every time he wants to pay for something, he comes to the  foreign assistance account. I understand the argument: Why are we  spending over there when we have problems here? That sounds good until  you realize how the world is.   On September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11, we didn't have one  soldier in Afghanistan, not an embassy, not an ambassador, not a dime  of aid. The Taliban were in charge, and they gave al-Qaida safe haven.  That is where the planning of the attacks and 9/11 originated. Looking  back, wouldn't it have been nice to have had some influence in  Afghanistan on September 10?   All I can say is, I will never go back to that pre-9/11 mindset of  ignoring the world, because I have learned, like most Americans, the  world can come here in a very bad way or very good way, depending on  how we defend ourselves.   This 1 percent of the budget--foreign assistance to deal with  problems over there--is absolutely essential in terms of global health.  He exempted the global health component of the foreign assistance  account, but the money--$7.76 billion--will destroy other things in the  account that I think are vital to our public health here and our  national security and our alliances. You cannot fight problems like  this by yourself. You need partners. You need to get involved over  there so the virus doesn't spread any more here than necessary.   I hope that people will listen to what Senator Leahy just said, that  this was a negotiated agreement. We all came together to get a budget.  Senators Shelby and Leahy did a wonderful job working with the House  and the White House to get us to where we are today. This amendment  would upset everything. I am going to move to table it at the  appropriate time.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all debate  time be considered expired.    Mr. President, I move to table the Paul amendment, and I  ask for the yeas and nays.
