 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition, of course, to H.R. 5, the so-called Regulatory  Accountability Act.   Under the guise of improving the regulatory process, H.R. 5 will, in  truth, undermine that process and jeopardize the ability of government  agencies to safeguard public health and safety, the environment,  workplace safety, and consumer financial protections.   It is not a pleasant picture. The ways in which this legislation  accomplishes this result are almost too numerous to list here, but, of  course, I will mention a few.   For example, title I of the bill would impose more than 70 new  analytical requirements that will add years to the rulemaking process.   Is that what we want to do? I don't think so.   Worse yet, many of these new requirements are intended to facilitate  the ability of regulated entities--such as well-funded corporate  interests--to intervene and derail regulatory protections they oppose.  And it would function as a ``super-mandate,'' overriding critical laws  that Congress specifically intended to prohibit agencies from  considering costs when American lives are at stake.   Additionally, the bill creates numerous procedural hurdles in the  rulemaking process, further endangering American lives through years of  delay and increasing the likelihood of regulatory capture.                                time  1400    For example, H.R. 5 dramatically expands the use of formal  rulemaking, a time- and resource-intensive process, requiring formal,  trial-like hearings for certain rules. Formal rulemaking has long been  roundly rejected for good cause as being excessively costly and ill- suited for complex policy issues.   The administrative section of the American Bar Association noted that  ``these provisions run directly contrary to a virtual consensus in the  administrative law community that the Administrative Procedure Act  formal rulemaking procedure is obsolete.''   I am also concerned that H.R. 5 would impose an arbitrary, one-size- fits-all, 6-month delay on virtually every new rule. Specifically,  title V of the bill will prohibit agency rules from becoming effective  until the information required by the bill has been available online  for 6 months with only limited exception.   Clearly, H.R. 5 fails to take into account a vast array of time- sensitive rules ranging from the mundane, such as the frequent United  States Coast Guard bridge closings regulations, to those that protect  public health and safety, such as forthcoming updates to the Lead and  Copper Rule by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the lead  in public drinking water.   Finally, title II of H.R. 5 would eliminate judicial deference to  agencies and require Federal courts to review all agency rulemakings  and interpretations of statutes on a de novo basis. The unfortunate  result of this requirement is that the bill would empower a generalist  court to override the determinations of agency experts, regardless of  the judge's technical knowledge and understanding of the underlying  subject matter.   By eliminating any deference to agencies, H.R. 5 would force agencies  to adopt even more detailed factual records and explanations, which  would further delay the finalization of critical lifesaving regulatory  protections.   The Supreme Court has recognized that Federal courts simply lack the  subject-matter expertise of agencies, are politically unaccountable,  and should not engage in making substantive determinations from the  bench. It is ironic that those who have long decried judicial activism  now support facilitating a greater role for the judiciary in agency  rulemaking.   These are only a few of the many serious concerns presented by H.R.  5, and, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this  dangerous legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                                          AFL-CIO                                              Legislative Alert,                                   Washington, DC, January 10, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing       to express our strong opposition to H.R. 5, the Regulatory       Accountability Act of 2017. This sweeping bill, which       packages six anti-regulatory measures passed by the House in       the last Congress, would upend 40 years of labor, health,       safety and environmental laws, threaten new needed       protections leaving workers and the public in danger. The       AFL-CIO urges you to oppose this harmful legislation.        The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) is drafted as an       amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but it       goes far beyond establishing procedures for rulemaking. The       RAA acts as a ``super mandate'' overriding the requirements       of landmark legislation such as the Occupational Safety and       Health Act and Mine Safety and Health Act. The bill would       require agencies to adopt the least costly rule, instead of       the most protective rule as is now required by the OSH Act       and MSH Act. It would make protecting workers and the public       secondary to limiting costs and impacts on businesses and       corporations.        The RAA will not improve the regulatory process; it will       cripple it. The bill adds dozens of new analytical and       procedural requirements to the rulemaking process, adding       years to an already slow process. The development of major       workplace safety rules already takes 8--10 years or more,       even for rules where there is broad agreement between       employers and unions on the measures that are needed to       improve protections. OSHA's silica standard to protect       workers from deadly silica dust took nearly 19 years and the       beryllium standard 15 years. The RAA will further delay       needed rules and cost workers their lives.        The RAA substitutes formal rulemaking for the current       procedures for public participation for high impact rules and       other major rules upon request. These formal rulemaking       procedures will make it more difficult for workers and       members of the public to participate, and give greater access       and influence to business groups that have the resources to       hire lawyers and lobbyists to participate in this complex       process. For agencies that already provide for public       hearings, such as OSHA and MSHA, the bill would substitute       formal rulemaking for the development of all new rules,       overriding the effective public participation processes       conducted by these agencies.        H.R. 5 would subject all agencies--including independent       agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the       National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Consumer Product       Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau (CFPB) to these new analytical and       procedural requirements. It would be much more difficult for       agencies to develop and issue new financial reform rules and       consumer protection rules required under recently enacted       legislation.        This radical legislation doesn't just apply to regulations;       it would also require agencies to analyze the costs and       benefits of major guidance documents, even though these       documents are non-binding and have no legal force. Guidance       documents are an important tool for agencies to disseminate       information on significant issues and hazards quickly in       order to protect the public and workers. For example, in       response to the Ebola virus threat, the Centers for Disease       Control (CDC) issued critical guidance documents in order to       prevent the spread of disease, including recommendations for       infection control and protections for healthcare workers and       emergency responders. Similar guidance was issued was issued       to prevent transmission of the Zika virus. Under the RAA's       provisions, CDC would be required to assess the costs and       benefits of these major guidance documents, making it       virtually impossible to provide information and       recommendations in a timely manner.        H.R. 5 also includes a grab bag of other harmful anti-      regulatory measures that thwart, weaken and undermine       protections. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act       abolishes judicial deference to agencies' statutory       interpretations in rulemaking requiring a court to decide all       relevant questions of law de novo, allowing courts to       substitute their own policy judgements for the agencies'       expert policy determinations. The Small Business Regulatory       Flexibility Improvements Act (SBRFIA) imposes numerous       unnecessary new analytical and procedural requirements on all       agencies. It gives the Chief Counsel of the Small Business       Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy, which in practice       operates largely as a mouthpiece for large business       interests, new broad powers to second guess and challenge       agency rules. The Require Evaluation before Implementing       Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act) would automatically stay       the implementation of any rule with an estimated annual cost       of $1 billion that has been challenged, precluding courts       from making this decision, and delaying protections. Other       titles add even more unnecessary requirements to the       rulemaking process.        The Regulatory Accountability Act would gut the nation's       safety, health and environmental laws, stripping away       protections  [[Page H326]]       from workers and the public. It would tilt the regulatory       process solidly in favor of business groups and others who       want to stop regulations and make it virtually impossible for       the government to issue needed safeguards. The AFL-CIO       strongly opposes H.R. 5 and urges you to vote against this       dangerous legislation.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                                                 Consumer Reports,                                                   January 10, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumer Reports and its policy and       mobilization arm, Consumers Union, urge you to vote no on       H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. This       dangerous proposal would do severe damage to protections       consumers depend on for health, safety, and honest treatment.        Congress has charged federal agencies with protecting the       public from threats such as tainted food, hazardous products,       dirty air and water, and predatory financial schemes. It       established these agencies, such as the Food and Drug       Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission,       Environmental Protection Agency, and Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau, so that public protections could be       overseen by professional civil servants with specific       technical and scientific expertise. In developing       regulations, agencies must act in accordance with the statute       and with established rulemaking procedures that require       transparency and full opportunity for public input, including       input from the industry that will be subject to the       regulation.        We agree that the regulatory process can certainly be       improved. We stand ready to support constructive efforts to       reduce delays and costs while preserving important       protections.        However, rather than streamlining and improving the       regulatory process, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017       would make current problems even worse. Under H.R. 5,       agencies would be required to undertake numerous costly and       unnecessary additional analyses for each rulemalcing, which       could grind proposed rules to a halt while wasting agencies'       resources. Collectively, these measures would create       significant regulatory and legal uncertainty for businesses,       increase costs to taxpayers and businesses alike, and prevent       the executive branch from keeping regulations up to date with       the rapidly changing modern economy.        One of the most damaging effects of H.R. 5 is that it       would, with only limited exceptions, require federal agencies       to identify and adopt the ``least costly'' alternative of a       rule it is considering. Currently, landmark laws like the       Clean Air Act, Consumer Product Safety Act, and Securities       Exchange Act require implementing agencies to put top       priority on the public interest. H.R. 5 would reverse this       priority by requiring agencies to value the bottom-line       profits of the regulated industry over their mission to       protect consumers and a fair, well-functioning marketplace.        H.R. 5 also includes several other damaging measures that       have not been included previously as part of the Regulatory       Accountability Act. These measures would add unjustifiable       costs and uncertainty to the rulemalcing process, and greatly       impair regulatory agencies' work.        Contrary to its name, the ``Separation of Powers       Restoration Act'' (Title II of H.R. 5) would disrupt the       carefully developed constitutional balance between the       legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Courts giving       appropriate deference to reasonable agency interpretations of       their own statutes, as reflected in Chevron U.S.A., Inc., v.       NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), is a well-settled approach that       promotes sound and efficient agency enforcement, with       effective judicial review. Under the Chevron doctrine, courts       retain full judicial power to review agency legal       interpretations, but do not simply substitute their own       judgment for an agency's. Chevron recognizes that agencies       accumulate uniquely valuable expertise in the laws they       administer, which makes deference from reviewing courts--      which do not have that expertise--appropriate.        Overturning this approach would lead to disaster. It would       severely hamper effective regulatory agency enforcement of       critical protections on which consumers depend. As the       Supreme Court stated in City of Arlington, Tex. v. F.C.C.,       133 S. Ct. 1863, 1874 (2013): ``Thirteen Courts of Appeals       applying a totality-of-the-circumstances test would render       the binding effect of agency rules unpredictable and destroy       the whole stabilizing purpose of Chevron. The excessive       agency power that the dissent fears would be replaced by       chaos.'' Such a move also would needlessly force the courts       to repeatedly second-guess agency decisions that the courts       have already concluded the agency is in the best position to       make.        The REVIEW Act and the ALERT Act (Titles IV and V of H.R.       5) would cause additional needless and damaging delays to       public protections. The REVIEW Act--which would block ``high-      impact'' rules until every industry legal challenge has run       its full course--would tie up agencies in court indefinitely,       potentially making it impossible to address pressing national       problems. The ALERT Act would subject most new rules to a       delay of at least six months, and require agencies to waste       resources complying with repetitive reporting requirements.        Like the bill's proponents, we believe regulations should       be smart, clear, and cost-effective. However, H.R. 5 does not       accomplish this objective. Instead of improving the       regulatory process, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017       would make it dramatically slower, more costly to the nation,       and far less effective at protecting health, safety, and       other essential consumer priorities.        We strongly urge you to stand up for critical public       protections and vote no on H.R. 5.            Sincerely,      Laura MacCleery,        Vice President, Consumer Policy and Mobilization, Consumer       Reports.      George P. Slover,        Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.      William C. Wallace,        Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.                                   ____                                   Consumer Federation of America,                                                   January 10, 2017.      Re Oppose legislation on House Floor to undermine crucial           consumer protections: H.R. 5.         Dear Representative: The Regulatory Accountability Act of       2017 (H.R. 5) would handcuff all federal agencies in their       efforts to protect consumers. H.R. 5 is a vastly expanded       version of previous versions of the Regulatory Accountability       Act (RAA). H.R. 5 not only significantly and problematically       amends the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) which has       guided federal agencies for many decades but also now       incorporates five additional bills that thwart the regulatory       process: the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility       Improvement Act; the Require Evaluation before Implementing       Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act); the All Economic       Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act); the Separation       of Powers Restoration Act; and the Providing Accountability       Through Transparency Act. These titles make an already       damaging bill even worse.        Specifically, the RAA would require all agencies,       regardless of their statutorily mandated missions, to adopt       the least costly rule, without consideration of the impact on       public health and safety or the impact on our financial       marketplace. As such, the RAA would override important       bipartisan laws that have been in effect for years, as well       as more recently enacted laws to protect consumers from       unfair and deceptive financial services, unsafe food and       unsafe consumer products.        For example, the RAA would likely have prevented the       Federal Reserve from adopting popular credit card rules under       the Truth in Lending Act in 2008 that prevented card       companies from unjustifiably increasing interest rates and       fees on consumers. This is because these far-reaching changes       to abusive practices that were widespread in the marketplace       were not the ``least costly'' options that were considered,       although they were arguably the most cost-effective.        The RAA would have a chilling impact on the continued       promulgation of important consumer protections. Had it been       in effect, for example, the RAA would have severely hampered       the implementation of essential and long-standing food safety       regulations, such as those requiring companies to prevent       contamination of meat and poultry products with deadly       foodborne pathogens. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention has credited the implementation of regulations       prohibiting contamination of ground beef with E. coli O157:H7       as one of the factors contributing to the recent success in       reducing E. coli illnesses among U.S. consumers.' But such       benefits are impossible to quantify before a rule is enacted.        Further, had the RAA been in effect the necessary child       safety protections required by the Consumer Product Safety       Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) may have never been       implemented. For example, between 2007 and 2011 the Consumer       Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled 11 million       dangerous cribs. These recalls fol owed 3,584 reports of crib       incidents, which resulted in 1,703 injuries and 153 deaths.       As a direct result of the CPSIA, CPSC promulgated an       effective mandatory crib standard that requires stronger       mattress supports, more durable hardware, rigorous safety       testing, and stopped the manufacture and sale of drop-side       cribs. If the RAA were implemented, such a life saving rule       could have been delayed for years or never promulgated at       all, at countless human and financial cost.        The RAA also would add dozens of additional substantive and       procedural analyses, as well as judicial review to the       rulemaking process for every major rule. It would: expand the       kind of rules that must go through a formal rulemaking       process; require agencies to determine ``indirect costs''       without defining the term; require an impossible-to-conduct       estimation of a rule's impact on jobs, economic growth, and       innovation while ignoring public health and safety benefits;       and expand the powers of the White House's Office of       Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory       Affairs to throw up numerous rulemaking roadblocks, including       requiring them to establish guidelines for conducting cost-      benefit analysis. This would further delay or prevent the       promulgation of much needed consumer protections.        The new titles of H.R. 5 also add numerous roadblocks to       the promulgation of necessary consumer protections. The       Separation of Powers Restoration Act (Title II) eliminates  [[Page H327]]       judicial deference that agencies are granted when rules are       challenged in court. This allows judicial activism and       political considerations to trump agency expertise. The Small       Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act (Title III)       would increase regulatory delays and create new opportunities       for court challenge to regulations. The Require Evaluation       before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act)       (Title IV) would encourage frivolous legal challenges and       infuse the regulatory process with years of delay by       requiring courts reviewing ``high-impact'' regulations to       automatically ``stay'' or block the enforcement of such       regulations until all litigation is resolved. The All       Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act) (Title       V) would also blatantly and purposefully lengthen the       regulatory process by requiring a six-month delay in the       development of regulations.        We urge you to oppose this significant threat to consumer       protection, a fair marketplace, health, and safety posed by       H.R. 5. If adopted, this proposal would waste federal       resources, minimize the ability of federal agencies to do       their jobs, grind the regulatory process to a halt, and       infuse the regulatory process with roadblocks preventing the       protection of the public and ultimately putting American       consumers at risk.        We strongly urge you to oppose this harmful bill.            Sincerely,                                                  Rachel Weintraub,      Legislative Director and General Counsel.                                   ____                                Coalition for Sensible Safeguards,                                                   January 10, 2017.      Re Floor vote of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of           2017.         Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards       (CSS), an alliance of over 150 labor, scientific, research,       good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and       public interest groups, strongly opposes H. R. 5, the       Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA), which will be       voted on this week.        H.R. 5 is a compilation of radical and harmful legislative       proposals that will permanently cripple the government's       ability to protect the public by rigging the regulatory       process against new regulatory safeguards in favor of       deregulation or regulatory inaction. The bill is just as       dangerous and extreme as the REINS Act (H.R. 26) and the       Midnight Rules Relief Act (H.R. 21).        All of these bills are designed to make it as difficult as       possible for federal agencies to implement existing or new       laws that ensure our access to clean air and water, safe       workplaces, untainted food and drugs, safe toys and consumer       goods, and a stable financial system free of Wall Street       recklessness. On the other hand, deregulatory actions that       repeal existing rules are exempt by virtue of the       legislation's myopic focus on ``costs'' to corporate special       interests instead of ``benefits'' to the public. In short,       the legislation will create a double standard in our       regulatory system that systematically favors deregulation       over new public protections and ``fast-tracks'' the repeal of       rules while paralyzing the creation of new ones.        The new version of the RAA, introduced in this Congress,       takes the previous RAA legislation and folds in several       destructive pieces of other so-called regulatory reform bills       including: the misleadingly named Small Business Regulatory       Flexibility Improvements Act, the Require Evaluation before       Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act), the All       Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act), the       Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the Providing       Accountability Through Transparency Act. These pieces of       other bills seek to worsen an already destructive bill and       add several more corrosive layers intending to dismantle our       public protections.        The current rulemaking process is already plagued with       lengthy delays, undue influence by regulated industries, and       convoluted court challenges. If passed, Title I of this bill       would make each of these problems substantially worse and       would undermine our public protections and jeopardize public       health by threatening the safeguards that ensure our access       to clean air and water, safe workplaces, untainted food and       drugs, and safe toys and consumer goods.        Rather than enhancing protections, it does the exact       opposite. It adds 80 new analytical requirements to the       Administrative Procedure Act and requires federal agencies to       conduct estimates of all the ``indirect''costs and benefits       of proposed rules and all potential alternatives without       providing any definition of what constitutes, or more       importantly, does not constitute an indirect cost. The       legislation would significantly increase the demands on       already constrained agency resources to produce the analyses       and findings that would be required to finalize any new rule.       Thus, the RAA is designed to further obstruct and delay       rulemaldng rather than improve the regulatory process.        This legislation creates even more hoops for ``major'' or       ``high-impact'' rules i.e., rules that provide society with       the largest health and safety benefits. It would allow any       interested person to petition the agency to hold a public       hearing on any ``genuinely disputed'' scientific or factual       conclusions underlying the proposed rule. This provision       would give regulated industries multiple opportunities to       challenge agency data and science and thus further stretch       out the already lengthy rulemaking process.        H.R. 5 would also create a restrictive mandate of a ``one-      size-fits-all'' directive that every federal agency adopt the       ``least costly'' alternative. This is a profound change and       effectively creates a ``super-mandate'' for all major       regulatory actions of executive and independent agencies       which overrides twenty-five existing statutes, including the       Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety       and Health Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement       Act. These laws prioritize public health, safety, and       economic security, not the cost concerns of regulated       entities.        Title II of H.R. 5 is the Separation of Powers Restoration       Act piece which seeks to destroy the Chevron deference       principal. It would remove the judicial deference that       agencies are granted when their regulations are challenged in       court. This would be a radical change that upends one of the       fundamental principles in administrative law, namely that       courts should not second-guess scientific and technical       expertise at federal agencies. Overly intrusive judicial       review is one of the primary reasons for regulatory delay and       paralysis and this legislation would make those problems much       worse.        The misleadingly named Small Business Regulatory       Flexibility Improvements Act (Title III) is a Trojan horse       that would expand the reach and scope of regulatory review       panels, increase unnecessary regulatory delays, increase       undue influence by regulated industries and encourage       convoluted court challenges all in the name of helping       ``small business,'' but so expansively applied that mostly       big businesses would benefit. Because the bill mandates that       these panels look at 'indirect costs,' which are defined very       broadly, it could be applied to virtually any agency action       to develop public protections.        The REVIEW Act (Title IV) would make our system of       regulatory safeguards weaker by requiring courts reviewing       ``high-impact'' regulations to automatically ``stay'' or       block the enforcement of such regulations until all       litigation is resolved, a process that takes many years to       complete. It would add several years of delay to an already       glacially slow rulemaking process, invite more rather than       less litigation, and rob the American people of many critical       upgrades to science-based public protections, especially       those that ensure clean air and water, safe food and consumer       products, safe workplaces, and a stable, prosperous economy.        The ALERT Act (Title V) is designed to impede the       government's ability to implement critical new public health       and safety protections by adding a six-month delay. This       amounts to a six-month regulatory moratorium, even after the       often lengthy period required for developing and finalizing       these regulations. Such delays could extend well beyond that       initial six-month period should the OIRA Administrator fail       to post the required information in a timely manner.        This new version of the RAA would override and threaten       decades of public protections. The innocuous-sounding act is,       in reality, the biggest threat to public health standards,       workplace safety rules, environmental safeguards, and       financial reform regulations to appear in decades. It acts as       a ``super-mandate,'' rewriting the requirements of landmark       legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the Occupational       Safety and Health Act and distorting their protective focus       to instead prioritize compliance costs.        We strongly urge opposition to H.R. 5, the Regulatory       Accountability Act of 2017.            Sincerely,                                                Robert Weissman,                                    President, Public Citizen Chair,      Coalition for Sensible Safeguards.                                   ____                                                             AFSCME,                                          We Make America Happen,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million working       and retired members of the American Federation of State,       County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge       you to oppose the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (H.R.       5). This reckless legislation would severely undermine the       nation's ability to ensure that workers are safe on the job       and in the marketplace. If enacted, H.R. 5 would effectively       end the federal government's ability to enact new protections       on behalf of the American people. Instead, the Regulatory       Accountability Act looks to protect businesses from people as       a platform for policymaking.        The Regulatory Accountability Act would upset the       constitutional balance between branches of the government and       impose new burdens on an already cumbersome regulatory       process. In rulemaking, federal agencies must adhere to the       requirements of the statue being implemented, and are often       given a roadmap from Congress. From there, federal agencies       must also follow the robust procedural and analytical       requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the       Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act,       the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review       Act,        The Regulatory Accountability Act adds more than 70 steps       to the regulatory process while giving corporate interests       more opportunities to influence and weaken standards. It       would require unnecessary Advance Notices for a large number       of rules, and impose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as       a condition of rulemaking. It would subject the regulatory       process to unneeded rounds of litigation.  [[Page H328]]         The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 will prevent       agencies from growing and addressing new issues for       environmental, public health, workplace safety and consumer       financial security protections. We urge you to oppose this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott) who is a very active former member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the ranking member of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a senior member of our committee who has  followed this matter very closely.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a senior member of our committee who has  followed this matter very closely.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman and  the distinguished ranking member for convening us. It reenforces my  commitment to the importance of the House Judiciary Committee for  important, innovative, and groundbreaking, in some instances, work that  we have done.   In this instance, I find fault because this legislation does not meet  that criteria. Just a few days ago, we read the  [[Page H332]]  Constitution, and some might make the argument that H.R. 5 fits very  comfortably into the Bill of Rights, Amendment V and Amendment XIV.  Both frame themselves around the question of due process. I make the  argument that this legislation is sorely lacking.   I want to take up, first of all, a point made by my colleague, a  member of the Rules Committee. This legislation, to my recalling, has  been circulated for many years. It seems that I have been in the House  when a bill like H.R. 5 has passed over and over again.   This bill appeared in the 114th Congress. Many Members left since  that time. New Members are here. New Members, Republicans and  Democrats, will be added to the House Judiciary Committee and to the  Senate Judiciary Committee. None of them will have had the opportunity  for regular order, to be able to ensure hearings and to be able to  engage in input with amendments that I would agree or disagree with,  but to have a vigorous debate in our Judiciary Committee as well as in  the Senate. It did not happen. We are now on the floor of the House. So  that is one fracture of what we are doing, one Achilles' heel to this  legislation.   In the last 24 hours, I heard a news account of a little boy who  swallowed magnets that were produced by a particular company. It went  through the process. It was designated dangerous; and then,  unfortunately, that dangerous status was pulled back, and the company  is excited about producing those magnets again.   The little boy who swallowed the magnets, I think, was about 2 years  old. A happy little boy, of course, that is how children are. He had  major intestinal surgery, and most of his intestines were removed. He  is now 6 years old, and he must now be fed intravenously.                                time  1445    His devastation is our failure. That is what we are facing with H.R.  5.   I don't know if my colleagues agree, as boring as the Administrative  Procedure Act was in law school, I liked the course. I had a great  professor who made me understand the life of the APA and its value.  This legislation attempts to rewrite the Administrative Procedure Act  to the detriment of the American people.   Consider this, hardworking agencies should have oversight; that is  what our committees are all about. They should have oversight. They  will now have to jump through hoops of 70 new criteria. I didn't say  10; I didn't say a quarter of 100, 25; I didn't say a half of 100, 50;  but 70 when issuing rules, including alternatives to any rule proposal,  the scope of the problems the rule meant to address, and potential cost  and benefits of the proposal and alternative.   I want to see small businesses thrive. Part of that includes a  reasonable healthcare package like ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act,  for its employees, a reasonable new structure dealing with taxation  that helps small businesses and does not give a mountain of benefit to  major corporations.   Maybe we should address the needs of small businesses in that manner,  or, as my minority constituents tell me, access to credit which is  generally denied to women, Hispanics, in some instances, and certainly  African Americans. That may help our small businesses get them back on  their feet. But that is not what H.R. 5 does. It stifles the work of  our agencies of which we have attributed to them, the Small Business  Administration, Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade  Commission, the FCC, and, in some instances, the Department of Justice  articulating regulations dealing with funding of juvenile issues.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman.   These are agencies that are depended upon to give regular order.  Oversight is important, but I would make the argument that stifling,  denying, demolishing, or destroying is not order.   Now, I had an amendment that I think is crucial. It is to provide an  exception under this bill for regulations that help prevent cyber  attacks on election processes or institutions. Mr. Chairman, not only  have we found with much profoundness that a foreign entity, in this  instance Russia, maybe it might be Iran, maybe it might be some other  country, intruded into the democratic process of elections. I am glad  Senator Graham said this is not Republicans or Democrats. This is about  the integrity of the election system. And why we were hesitant to make  this amendment in order, because there is no stopping of the peaceful  transfer of government. The American people see to that process. Thank  God for our love of democracy. We are able to express our opposition in  many different ways.   But there is no doubt there was not only intrusion, there was skewing  from one candidate versus another. There are prints--this is public  knowledge--that have been able to be tracked to suggest who, what, and  what country, and how far up the chain to Mr. Putin that it went to.   So my amendment, I think, was constructive. Why would we be reluctant  to debate it? Why would we be reluctant to acknowledge the intelligence  report assessing Russian activities and intentions in the recent U.S.  elections? And why would we be reluctant to find out who was involved?   H.R. 5 is not doing what it is supposed to do. It is, in fact,  undermining the Constitution and eliminating the protections for a  little boy who now lives his life completely different because maybe we  didn't intervene in the regulatory manner of oversight over that  product that we should have, and maybe now we have given them a pass so  that other children might suffer the same consequences. I ask my  colleagues to vote against the underlying bill and send it back for us  to do the work of the people in regular order.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of the  Judiciary Committee.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, this has been an enlightening discussion  because we have determined that H.R. 5 is based on the faulty premise  that environmental and public safety protections kill jobs, result in  economically stifling costs, and promote uncertainty.   In fact, regulatory protections that ensure the safety of American- made products unquestionably foster job creation and protect the  competitiveness of our business and global marketplace. This explains  why so many organizations--more than 150--strongly oppose this  legislation.   Mr. Chairman, our constituents and the American citizens deserve  something better than H.R. 5. We need legislation that creates middle  class financial security and opportunity. We need sensible regulations  that protect American families from economic ruin, that bring predatory  financial practices to an end.   We need workplace safety protections that ensure hardworking  Americans can go to work each day without having to risk their lives as  a result of hazardous work environments.   Unfortunately, the measure before us does nothing to advance any of  these critical goals, and so I must, therefore, oppose H.R. 5 and ask  my colleagues to support a negative vote on this matter.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
