 Madam Speaker, incredibly, President  Biden said Tuesday: ``We're making progress.'' And ``American people  are paying their fair share for gas.''   However, the reality is Americans are paying 61 percent more for gas,  and home heating oil costs will jump 54 percent.   The disastrous Biden agenda has put America in an energy crisis. He  killed the Keystone pipeline with 11,000 jobs lost. And executive  orders have paused new oil and gas leasing, costing over 1 million  jobs. Annual Biden inflation is the highest in 40 years, destroying  jobs.   The Democrat elite think they are better than everyone, and they  believe Democrat voters and Democrat media are ignorant to accept $4.5  trillion ``costs zero dollars.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops who have successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism now is moving from  the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Congratulations, Norma and John Jett and Roxanne Wilson on their new  grandson born yesterday, Hunter Taylor Wilson, Jr., of West Columbia,  South Carolina.                            ____________________
