 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.   First and foremost, can we please stop misrepresenting Representative  Tlaib's words? She does not want to kill Jews. She is not in support of  Hamas. She is speaking as someone who is the only Palestinian American  in U.S. history to serve in this body.   Without her voice, we would lack even more empathy for the people of  Palestine. We would not have someone with direct personal experience  speaking against the siege that is happening now in Gaza.   This body needs empathy and compassion for all people, not just  people who look like the majority of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle. Maybe because of your lack of diversity, you lack the  cognitive and emotional ability to recognize diverse opinions when they  speak truth to power. You absolutely need to open up your mind to other  people and other experiences, especially when they are Muslim, when  they are women, and when they are people of color.  [[Page H5502]]    You had a Member of your party call my colleague a terrorist and  didn't censure her, but we are having this conversation now about your  interpretation of words.
