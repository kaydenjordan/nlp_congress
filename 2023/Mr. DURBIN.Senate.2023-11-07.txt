 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Kenly Kato to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of  California.   Born in Los Angeles, CA, Judge Kato received her B.A. from the  University of California, Los Angeles and her J.D. from Harvard Law  School. She then clerked for Judge Robert M. Takasugi on the U.S.  District Court for the Central District of California. Judge Kato began  her legal career at the Federal Public Defender's Office for the  Central District of California, where she served for 6 years. She then  entered private practice and spent 10 years as a solo practitioner,  representing clients in both civil and criminal cases. During this  time, she tried approximately 15 cases to verdict. In 2014, she was  appointed to serve as a magistrate judge on the U.S. District Court for  the Central District of California. Judge Kato currently handles both a  civil and criminal docket, and she has presided over several cases that  have gone to verdict. In addition, she is heavily involved with  diversionary programs within the Central District of California that  focus on treatment, rehabilitation, and reentry issues for justice- involved individuals.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Kato ``well  qualified'' to serve on the district court. The late Senator Feinstein  strongly supported her nomination, and Senator Padilla does as well.  Judge Kato has the experience, temperament, and qualifications to serve  on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. I  will be supporting this outstanding nominee, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, you are aware of the fact that I announced last week in the  committee that we would vote to authorize subpoenas to Harlan Crow,  Robin Arkley, and Leonard Leo as part of the Judiciary Committee's  continuing investigation into the ethical situation at the U.S. Supreme  Court.   I do not make this decision lightly. Seeking authorization to issue  subpoenas is a relatively rare occurrence in the committee. So today I  come to the floor for a few minutes to explain why we have taken this  significant step.   Over the last several months, it has become clear that the Supreme  Court is in desperate need of a binding code of ethics as we learned of  lavish gifts and luxury travel that certain Supreme Court Justices have  accepted from a gaggle of fawning billionaires.   Let's start with Justice Clarence Thomas. The sheer number and value  of gifts accepted by Justice Thomas is staggering, and the  shamelessness with which he accepted them is stunning. For decades,  Justice Thomas has accepted lavish gifts from Harlan Crow, a  conservative billionaire with business before the Supreme Court. These  gifts have ranged from a $19,000 Bible once owned by Frederick Douglass  to a $15,000 bust of Abraham Lincoln. Justice Thomas also accepted  private jet trips and free lodging at Bohemian Grove, an exclusive all- male, invitation-only retreat in the redwoods of California. And these  are only examples of what Justice Thomas disclosed.   After the Los Angeles Times reported on these disclosures, Justice  Thomas, in 2004, 19 years ago, promptly stopped disclosing gifts as  required by law.   We learned this year that he continued to accept expensive gifts for  the past 19 years and that these billionaire benefactors have been part  of a growing list.   There isn't time to detail all of the undisclosed gifts, which the  press has discovered, and luxury travel that Justice Thomas has  accepted, but for the sake of a record, I am going to give a few  examples.   In 2019, Justice Thomas and his wife flew to Indonesia on Harlan  Crow's private jet and boarded Crow's 162-foot superyacht, the Michaela  Rose, to island hop with Harlan Crow and his wife.   The total cost of that trip alone could have exceeded half a million  dollars if Justice Thomas had chartered the jet and yacht. Lucky for  him, Harlan Crow was happy to cover the costs.   Justice Thomas also continued to join Crow on trips to Bohemian Grove  in California. He visited Crow's ranch in East Texas, spent summers at  Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks.   But there is more. Crow paid thousands of dollars to cover tuition  for Justice Thomas's grandnephew. He purchased real estate owned by  Thomas and his relatives, including Thomas's mother's home, where she  continues to live rent-free. And Crow donated half a million dollars to  a conservative advocacy group founded by Justice Thomas's wife.   I could go on and on and on because the list of gifts Justice Thomas  has chosen to accept and failed to disclose goes on and on and on.   Justice Thomas is not the only Supreme Court Justice who has accepted  lavish gifts from billionaires and refused to disclose them. In 2008,  Justice Samuel Alito boarded a private jet bound for Alaska to enjoy a  luxury fishing trip, a trip that should have cost him over $100,000,  but it didn't cost him one penny because of the man who organized the  flight and joined Alito on the luxury fishing trip, Leonard Leo.   Mr. Leo arranged Justice Alito's free flight to Alaska and his free  lodging once he arrived. Their host at the luxury fishing lodge was a  gentleman named Robin Arkley. Over the next few days, Justice Alito and  his travel companions enjoyed guided fishing trips, flights on bush  planes, meals of Alaskan king crab and Kobe beef, and wines costing  upward of $1,000 a bottle.   Justice Alito did not disclose any of this, and when challenged, for  example, on the jet ride--why that should be disclosed--he said he  didn't view it as a gift because if he didn't go, the seat on the plane  would have gone empty.   That is an interesting analysis of a gift from a strict  constructionist.   This kind of scandalous behavior cannot continue. One former Federal  judge who served for years on the judicial committee that reviews the  Justices' financial disclosures had this to say about the gifts to  Justice Thomas:         In my career, I don't remember ever seeing this degree of       largesse given to anybody.    When referring to the cascade of gifts from Harlan Crow to Justice  Thomas, the former chief White House ethics lawyer for Republican  President George W. Bush said:         This is way outside the norm. This is way in excess of       anything I've seen.    And renowned conservative jurist, Judge J. Michael Luttig, stated in  testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:         The Supreme Court should want to lead by the example that       only it can set. It should want to conduct itself in its non-      judicial activities in all ways such that it is beyond       reproach.    Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has not lived up to this  expectation. That is why our Senate Judiciary Committee is exercising  its constitutional authority to investigate. Months ago, I, along with  my Democratic colleagues on the committee, sent letters to Crow,  Arkley, and Leo, among others, seeking details about what exactly  [[Page S5387]]  has been provided to Supreme Court Justices. Our goal has been to  understand how specific individuals and groups with business before the  Court have used undisclosed gifts to gain private access to Justices-- access not afforded to others.   For months, Crow has refused to fully comply with the committee's  requests, and Leo has completely stonewalled the committee. Only now,  under threat of subpoena, Mr. Arkley has stepped forward, and we are  looking forward to continuing our conversation with him this week.   The fact that we have to go to this length is unacceptable but  necessary. The Senate and the American people deserve to know the full  extent of how billionaires with interests before the Court use their  immense wealth to buy private access to our Supreme Court.   That is why, on Thursday, the Judiciary Committee will vote to  authorize subpoenas for these individuals. The vote is a critical step  in the committee's exercise of its constitutional right and duty to  conduct oversight of the Federal judiciary. It is critical to the  committee's effort to restore the Court's reputation. The highest Court  in the land should not have the lowest standard of ethics.   This is not a fight I wanted, but now that it has come to this, the  Judiciary Committee will not back down.   Most Americans are shocked to know or to learn that the nine Justices  on the Supreme Court are the only high-ranking Federal officials in the  United States of America who are beyond the reach of a code of ethics.  How do you explain that?   How can you explain that every Federal judge in America is bound by a  code of ethics except for the nine Supreme Court Justices?   What is so special about them? The Constitution makes it clear that  we don't have royalty in this country. They are acting like they belong  to some legal fraternity or sorority. That has got to come to an end.   When you look at the situation, Members of Congress are held to  standards--and I am not complaining. I knew what I was getting into  when I signed up for this job--held to standards of disclosure and  limitation on gifts.   I cannot tell you how many times I have said to a person: Is this  worth more than 50 bucks? If they answer: Well, maybe, it might be, I  say: Well, keep it and thanks for thinking of me.   That is the kind of thing that just becomes a routine part of public  service. These lavish gifts, particularly from individuals who have  business before the Court, are just unacceptable and inexplicable.   It is important for us to have a response when people ask: What are  you doing to clean up things at the Supreme Court?   The first thing we did, I think, was the responsible and respectable  thing to do. We invited the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to  appear before our committee and tell us his thoughts on the subject and  what he believes should be done to deal with this bad publicity and  these disclosures. He declined the invitation. I don't hold it against  him. He explained, in my presence, a few weeks ago why he did. I  understand it. I disagree with it, but I understand it.   But 11 years ago, was the first time I contacted the Chief Justice  and said: This has got to come to an end. Tell us what you are going to  do about establishing a code of ethics on the Supreme Court. Eleven  years ago and nothing--nothing--has happened since.   I want to salute and commend my colleague Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  of the State of Rhode Island. He has been a leader on this topic in the  subcommittee which he chairs on the Judiciary Committee, and we have  cooperated in this effort.   We will meet this week. This is not the first time the Judiciary  Committee will be asked to issue subpoenas. They happened before under  Republican leadership as well in a much different type of case. But the  fact of the matter is, we have tried carefully and studiously to come  up with this information the right way, and, unfortunately, we have not  gotten the kind of results we wanted. A subpoena, we hope, will jar  loose the information to explain exactly what happened with the gift- giving by several individuals.    Mr. President, here is the situation reported from the  hospital in Gaza: They will be out of fuel and electricity in 24 hours.  Dr. Hussam told Dr. Sahloul that at this point, five children will die.  The ventilators that are keeping them alive will be turned off. They  cannot be transported to a better or a safer place. Turning off the  electricity in some areas of the hospital will cause great hardship and  pain. There is no fuel at the other hospitals either. In the north,  they have basically been cut off from any assistance. It is impossible  to transfer to the south because they don't have transportation, and  they don't have the wherewithal--the ambulances and such--to do so. The  desperate situation they have reached includes performing amputations  with no anesthesia--performing amputations with no anesthesia.   I asked Dr. Sahloul: What do they use?   He said: Tylenol.   Can you imagine? Tylenol? They use vinegar because they don't have  any access to iodine to be able to clean the wounds before the  operations. Vinegar.   Every day, 200 people show up at their hospital, sick from the  contaminated water which they are forced to drink. They are begging for  help. They are asking for a pause so that basics can be provided: food,  electricity, fuel, medicines--the basics. I don't think that is an  unreasonable request, and I am sorry that they have been turned down in  their efforts to get this kind of help. There are 150 patients in this  hospital--twice the number as usual--with many of them sleeping on the  floor. And surgeries are performed on the floor.   I read this article last Friday and kept a copy of it. Now I will  enter it into the Record for others to read as well.   At one point, Dr. Abu Safiya said:         We wish for death. It is easier than seeing the horrific       scenes we're witnessing.    Twice now, this refugee camp, Jabalia, has been attacked by the  Israelis as a site of Hamas terrorism. Unfortunately, on the first day  of the attack, 40 people did not survive and 250 others were brought to  the hospital. Then the attack took a second day but, basically, was the  same as the last.   The doctor said: I've never in my life seen injuries this bad. He  added: We saw children decapitated as a result of these attacks.   Asking for a pause in the war for the purpose of humanitarian relief  is not unreasonable; it is humane and civilized. The United States is  begging both sides to take that step. I will join that effort. I hope  that this ends well and soon.   In the meantime, these innocent, helpless victims need to have a  helping hand from the rest of the world. We need to provide the basics  so they can survive. I will do my best to follow this closely. I  encourage the United States to continue its efforts to ask for this  pause in the actions for relief of the victims. This sort of situation  in any part of the world cannot be ignored.   I yield the floor.   (Mr. MARKEY assumed the Chair.)    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Julia Kobick to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Massachusetts.   Ms. Kobick is an accomplished litigator whose credentials and breadth  of experience make her well-suited to serve on this court. After  receiving her A.B. from Harvard College, her M.S. from Pace University,  and her J.D. from Harvard Law School, Ms. Kobick began her legal career  with prestigious clerkships for judges appointed by Presidents of both  political parties: Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV on the District of  Massachusetts, Judge Michael A. Chagares on the Third Circuit, and  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.   After her clerkships, Ms. Kobick joined the Office of the  Massachusetts Attorney General, serving first as an assistant attorney  general and currently as the deputy State solicitor. During her tenure  in that office, Ms. Kobick has practiced in Federal and State courts-- handling cases defending State laws, regulations, and Agency actions,  as well as affirmative cases brought by the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts. Over the course of her career, she has argued more than  20 dispositive motions in trial courts and delivered oral arguments in  19 appeals.   Ms. Kobick has the strong support of her home state Senators, Ms.  Warren and Mr. Markey. In addition, she received a rating of ``well  qualified'' from the American Bar Association. Ms. Kobick's  credentials, breadth of experience, and deep ties to the Massachusetts  legal community will serve the district court well. I urge my  colleagues to support her nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.
