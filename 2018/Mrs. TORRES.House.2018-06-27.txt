 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this rule makes in order 29 amendments to H.R. 6157, the  Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2019. The  underlying legislation is the product of bipartisan negotiations, which  have been going on for months. Bipartisan negotiations are a really  good thing, and I am glad that, on this one issue, we are finding ways  to work together.   In particular, I want to recognize the work that Representative  Aguilar, Representative Hurd, and many of our colleagues on both sides  of the aisle have been doing to create a path forward and look for a  solution to President Trump's self-created Dreamer crisis. That is what  we are supposed to be doing here: working together to solve problems.   Unfortunately, this Republican leadership doesn't believe in working  with the other side. They are only interested in negotiating with their  own. So it is not surprising that it isn't going very well. That is why  they pulled their own immigration bill last week.   Maybe the Republican leadership, which has blocked the bipartisan  Dream Act time and time again, and which has blocked the bipartisan USA  Act time and time again, should trust their Members to craft and vote  on compromise legislation.                                time  1230    But they don't have the courage or the vision to do that, do they?   Now we have another crisis, which, again, the President has created,  a crisis that has outraged our constituents. Thousands of children,  even infants and toddlers, are ripped from their parents at our  southern border, children who have done absolutely nothing wrong,  children who did not choose to come here on their own, kids too young  to know the name of the country that they came from, too young to know  what asylum is, too young to know what illegal entry means. Some of  these kids only know two words: ``mom'' and ``dad.''   We have heard the recordings of these children crying out for their  parents while being made fun of. Many of us have visited the detention  centers, and it is heartbreaking and it is unnecessary.   So, while I congratulate the Appropriations Committee for their hard  work on the defense bill, I have to remind the Speaker that we have 95  days to finish our work for funding the Federal Government. But I would  challenge my colleagues to imagine one day, a single day, without their  child, unsure if they would ever see them again.   We have some time to do the defense bill, but on the issue of family  separation, we cannot afford to wait another day. Congress should be  addressing this crisis today. It is not going to be easy. This  administration clearly did not think through this policy that they have  created.   Right now, we have children in HHS care, but where are their parents?  Some are in custody of the U.S. Marshals or ICE, already deported, or  maybe some are free on bond.   HHS said yesterday that they were not reuniting kids with their  parents who are in detention. What does that mean? Are they going to be  free? If not, what is the plan?   Let's look at the best-case scenario: a parent who gets out on bond  and goes to HHS and asks for their child is told, ``Show us your  documents. Prove you are really the parent,'' and this parent who has  been in custody has nothing.   Where is the plan to help these parents obtain their documents? Where  are these plans to help these children reunite with their parents?   Does the administration even know where all the parents are and how  they are supposed to be reunited with their kids?   How are they keeping track of the babies, the babies who are simply  too young to even know their name?   We have many unanswered questions. We should be making sure those  kids get to their parents, making sure that every single one of those  children is accounted for. That is doing our job.   Instead, we are passing another appropriations bill with the full  knowledge that we will probably do what we have done every year that I  have been here: We will pass a CR at the end of  [[Page H5761]]  the fiscal year, and then we will probably pass another CR, and then  another, and then another, and then another, because we can't legislate  together.   This rule makes in order 29 amendments, but not a single one of them  deals with the issues of the kids. Why not allow a vote on the  amendment I offered with Representative Schiff to prohibit detaining  children at military facilities?   Why not allow a vote on my amendment to block certain Cabinet members  from using military aircraft until the children are reunited? Is it  more important for Scott Pruitt to get on a plane than for a baby from  El Salvador to get back into his mother's arms? or the amendment  offered by my colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. Polis?  Representative Polis' amendment would have prohibited the Department of  Defense from transferring resources to the Department of Justice to  carry out prosecution of migrant families.   Don't our troops need these resources? Shouldn't our military be  focused on keeping us safe from ISIS and North Korea, not toddlers and  babies?   And why is the Republican leadership afraid to allow us to have a  vote? I guess babies are too controversial for the Republican caucus. I  guess keeping families together is a poison pill amendment.   By refusing Congress a vote, this House is giving up its  responsibility to make immigration laws, plain and simple. This House  should be a check on the administration. That is the way the system is  supposed to work. But we are not doing that. Instead, by refusing to  let us have a vote on the floor, the Republican House majority is  endorsing President Trump's family jails.   Mr. Speaker, this House majority owns this crisis. Let me be clear: A  vote for this rule is a vote for more of President Trump's cruelty to  these babies. It is a vote to keep innocent children from their  parents.   This House has the power to reunite these families. This House has  the power to end separation. This House has the power to stop hateful  immigration policies.   But this House won't act. Because of that, thousands of families may  be destroyed forever. We must defeat this rule and give this House an  opportunity to act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I absolutely agree that a primary duty of this Congress  is to fund the military, absolutely. There are military families  serving in our Nation and abroad that deserve to get paid.   So I would like to take this moment of privilege to remind this  Congress that, before I got here, my son, who joined the United States  Air Force, was going to have his pay withheld. I remember him telling  me, Mr. Speaker:         Mom, I signed up to serve our great Nation in the United       States Air Force, and I signed up to defend and protect my       country. I did not sign up to defend and protect the men of       my country, but I signed up to protect all of the people in       my country. And I resent Congress withholding my pay or tying       my pay to the reproductive rights of women.   [[Page H5762]]     So let's keep all of those things in mind when we talk about the  priorities of this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to add that I absolutely agree with my  colleague from the other side of the aisle on one thing, and that is  that we should be absolutely focused and work together on the issues on  which we agree, such as the USA Act.   Mr. Speaker, why aren't we allowed to have a vote on the floor when  that is bipartisan legislation created by a bipartisan group of  Members?   If we want to talk about the rule of law, Mr. Speaker, we can't talk  from both ends. Either we support the rule of law or we don't. Yet this  Republican Congress, time and time and time again, has been complicit  with President Trump and his family's conflicts of interest when it  comes to dealing  [[Page H5763]]  with China, when it comes to dealing with our trade agreements, when it  comes to dealing with Russia and now possibly North Korea.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration has ripped thousands of  children from their parents' arms at the border, sending them all over  the country. Separating children from their parent poses ongoing  psychological harm and trauma, yet the government has no clear plans to  reunite those families. For that reason, if we defeat the previous  question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Bass' bill, H.R. 6236, the Family Unity Rights and  Protection Act, which would require the Federal Government to reunite  families which have been forcibly separated at the border.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass) to discuss this proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me remind this body of a brief history of our Nation.   During World War II, this country chose to round up Japanese American  citizens and put them in internment camps across the country.                                time  1300    Some were held in my hometown at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds,  in Pomona, California.   In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled in Korematsu v. United States that  the government had every right to incarcerate families in the best  interest of our national security. It was wrong and immoral then, and  it is wrong and immoral now, and we look back at Japanese internment as  a dark moment in our history.   Just yesterday, the Supreme Court finally rejected the ruling and  admitted that it was clearly unconstitutional to forcibly place  Japanese Americans in concentration camps--74 years later. That is how  long it took for our court system to catch up with the reality and to  right a horrible wrong.   We are facing a similar dark period in our country now with what is  happening at our southern borders. How long will it take this time for  us to realize that what this administration is doing at our southern  borders is morally repugnant, wrong, and illegal?   How long before we realize that what we are doing is causing  emotional harm to families, especially to the children? How long before  we consider how history will remember this moment and judge us?   What national security threat are we facing today that warrants such  a barbaric response towards families and children? They are exactly  that: children, families, babies.   They are coming to our borders pleading for help and protection. They  are fleeing kidnapping, rape, murder, and threats. They are not MS-13;  they are fleeing MS-13. They want to work and raise their children in  peace. Is that so terrible?   This administration is deliberately choosing to inflict trauma onto  thousands of children, holding children hostage, using child abuse as a  scare tactic to deter families from coming here seeking refuge.   There are still more than 2,000 children separated from their  families at this present moment. President Trump may have signed his  executive order last week, but he failed to implement a plan to reunite  these families--no plan to reunite these families.   We are doing nothing to fix this problem today. And let's be clear:  Speaker Ryan's bill, which we may or may not consider this week, does  nothing to fix this problem either. All his bill does is pave the way  for long-term incarceration of families in prison-like facilities. It  would be replacing one form of child abuse for another.  [[Page H5764]]    I visited some of these detention centers at our borders. The  horrendous conditions we are exposing families to are completely  unacceptable.   Where are we, as a nation, when we place children in cage-like cells,  inside warehouses, with nothing but an emergency thermal blanket and a  thin mat between them and the cold concrete floor, with a toilet in the  middle of the cell? Criminally prosecuting every individual, every  child, who crosses between a port of entry, who poses no threat to our  country, is not only inhumane, it makes us less secure.   We have a limited number of prosecutors. We have to make choices. If  you prosecute one crime, it means you are not prosecuting another. So  when we send our prosecutors after every single border crosser, who  benefits? Let me tell you who benefits. The murderers, the rapists, the  drug traffickers, the drug dealers, the pimps, the muggers, and the  human traffickers, that is who will benefit from this. We are taking  away from where law enforcement agencies need the most and are wasting  by traumatizing defenseless families. How does this make us safe?   This administration's impulsive zero-tolerance policy is harming our  moral credibility. It is harming our national security. Most of all, it  is harming innocent babies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
