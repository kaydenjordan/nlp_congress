 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Vegas Golden  Knights for their monumental accomplishments this past season.   Mr. Speaker, who knew there would ever be a winning hockey team in  the desert? Never underestimate the people of Las Vegas and the State  of Nevada.   The story of the Vegas Golden Knights is truly inspiring and symbolic  of the strength and perseverance and unity in the Las Vegas community.   Following the October 1 shooting, a unique bond was created between  Nevadans and the Golden Knights that helped mend a city that was torn  apart by a devastating massacre. The community rallied around a hockey  team made up of players from teams around the country. They called them  the ``Golden Misfits.''   These players fostered relationships that led to a magical season  that will never ever be forgotten. The Golden Knights set an NHL record  for an expansion team with 51 wins, along with a trip to the Stanley  Cup finals.   I would like to congratulate and thank the owners, the players, the  coaches, and the fans, as well as the Washington Capitals on their  first Stanley Cup championship.   Mr. Speaker, Las Vegas and the Golden Knights will always be Vegas  born, Vegas strong. Go Knights go.                            ____________________
