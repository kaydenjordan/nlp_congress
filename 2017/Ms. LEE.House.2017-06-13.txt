 Mr. Speaker, last night the world watched my home team, the  Golden State Warriors, end a historic season by bringing home their  second national championship in 3 years.   The Warriors, led by unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant and legendary  players Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson, showed the  power of teamwork both on and off the court.   The team is an example for young people, showing that if you can work  together and trust one another, you can accomplish anything.   Mr. Speaker, these finals against the talented Cleveland Cavaliers  were a thrill to watch. We saw basketball at its best--incredible  talent and a real passion from both sides. Thank you to the Warriors  team for making our dreams of another championship a reality.   This remarkable team has made history as one of the best ever,  winning a record 15 straight games in the playoffs and clinching a 16- to-1 postseason record.   Thank you to Coaches Steve Kerr and Mike Brown, the entire Warriors  staff, and all of the talented players on their well-deserved victory.   Throughout this journey, Warriors fans have stayed loyal and  faithful, and they deserve this victory as well.   My dear late mother, Mildred Massey, was the Warriors' biggest fan,  and I know she is smiling from above. I can't wait to celebrate with  all the Warriors fans and players back in Oakland. Go Warriors, go  Oakland, go Dub Nation.                            ____________________
