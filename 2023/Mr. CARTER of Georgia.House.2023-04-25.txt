 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1343, the ITS  Codification Act.   This legislation would codify the Institute for Telecommunication  Sciences, which plays a critical role in making spectrum available for  commercial use.   As we examine how Federal and commercial spectrum is allocated, it is  our job as Members to ensure the agencies tasked with managing spectrum  have the technical resources they need to be successful in their  missions.   ITS is an essential part of the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration, and we must strengthen its statutory  authority to ensure it continues informing important spectrum policy  decisions.   This testing center will also play an important role in America's  ability to stay ahead of international competitors like China on  spectrum policy. I am confident ITS will continue to contribute to  innovative advancements that are crucial for our global  competitiveness.   This bill also directs ITS to establish an initiative to support the  development of emergency communication and tracking technologies for  use in locating trapped individuals in confined spaces. This is an  important initiative that has the potential to protect and save  American lives.   Last Congress, this bill went through regular order and enjoyed  unanimous support on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Steve Waters, athletic director at Glynn County for being named State  Athletic Director of the Year for Class 6-A.   Steve has a long history of success in high school sports. He won a  State championship in basketball at Christian Renewal Academy and  turned around a losing program at Monroe Academy where he took them to  the Elite Eight.   Steve has been the athletic director in Glynn County for the last 11  years. During his tenure, he has been responsible for large expansion  projects centered around the high school football field. He has also  been able to add 14 new sports programs to the school system.   Outside of work, Steve has a passion for service. He created a  foundation that raises money for Morquio research, a rare genetic  condition that affects a child's bones, spine, organs, and physical  abilities. He recently held a golf tournament and silent auction  fundraiser and was able to raise $330,000.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Steve on this great honor and all he has  done for our community.                            ____________________
