 Mr. Speaker, if we don't act boldly, we will spend the next  decade recovering from this crisis, and many families and many  communities may never recover.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are right about one  thing: This is our vision for America, an America where people can pay  their rent and mortgage and buy food for their children; where  businesses will reopen and create jobs; where our cities can pay our  firefighters, our paramedics, and our teachers next month; and where  people can vote without risking their health and their lives.   America is great because, in times of crisis, we come together to  meet the challenge. We do big things. Let us meet this moment. Let's  pass this bill.
