 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the suffering of  Ethiopian Israelis. A couple of weeks ago, a young Ethiopian Israeli  man was killed by an Israeli police officer.   After this tragedy, there have been massive protests against police  brutality. Unfortunately, these protests have turned violent. While I  do not condone violence, I believe people have the right to protest  systemic racism.   The Ethiopian community in Israel has been treated like second-class  citizens for decades. In the 1990s, Ethiopian Israelis had their  donated blood secretly disposed of by Israeli officials because they  believed it may contain the HIV virus.   Just 4 years ago, an Ethiopian Israeli IDF soldier was brutally  beaten by an Israeli police officer, setting off another wave of  massive demonstrations.   Now, there are reports that the protests against police brutality are  being cast as anti-Israeli. This is nothing more than an attempt to  delegitimize their suffering. I will not tolerate it, and neither  should any Member of this body.                            ____________________
