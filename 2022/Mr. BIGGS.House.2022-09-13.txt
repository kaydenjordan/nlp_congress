 Mr. Speaker, I address you and this body because I know  that you know more than most what it is like to have the impacts of  illegal immigration in your State and across the border.   In the town of Yuma, a town of about 100,000 people, every day in  their hospital, they get 11 people who go into the emergency room. They  get an additional four or five women every day in Yuma, Arizona, who go  into the maternity ward. Mr. Speaker, $20.4 million in uncompensated  care was provided by that hospital in just the first 6 months of this  year.   Mr. Speaker, you and I both know that when the Vice President said on  Sunday that our border is not open, she was not telling the truth. Our  border is wide open, and it has inherent dangers and problems for the  United States of America.   We can close it today. I encourage Members of this House to join me  in getting my discharge petition out. We need to close this border.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
