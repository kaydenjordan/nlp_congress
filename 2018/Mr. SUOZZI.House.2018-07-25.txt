 Mr. Speaker, on August 14, it will be 6 months since the  Parkland shootings. It has been 5 years since the Sandy Hook shootings.  It has been 25 years since the Long Island Railroad massacre. And it  has been 37 years since President Reagan was shot.   We need commonsense gun legislation in this country, legislation that  the vast majority of Americans support, legislation to plug some of the  holes in our commercial background checks.   The good news is that high school students and college students in my  district are calling attention to this very important issue. I have  been meeting with them throughout the year. They come to me and tell me  what it is like when there is a fire alarm in their district.   When I was a kid and there was a fire alarm at school, we would be  excited to go outside and see our friends and talk to people. Instead,  when they hear a fire alarm, they figure out: Where can I hide? Where  can I go if this turns out to be a catastrophe?   These students deserve our attention from this body, Democrats and  Republicans working together to try to address this very real problem  in our country. I am committed to doing it. I hope my colleagues will  as well.                            ____________________
