 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Murray and I be allowed to complete our remarks before the scheduled  rollcall votes.    Mr. President, for the past 2 years, our Nation's kids  have suffered. They have suffered socially, academically, and  psychologically at the hands of Democratic politicians, the Biden  administration, and their political bosses in the teachers unions.   Although kids are at the lowest risk of hospitalization and death  from the Wuhan coronavirus, they have endured and they continue to  endure some of the most excessive, extreme, and suffocating COVID  restrictions of any population in our country. This treatment has been  nothing short of cruel. The politicians and the neurotic public health  obsessives who enforce these policies should all hang their heads in  shame.   There are few things in a kid's life, outside of family and church,  that are more important to them than their school. For them, open and  happy schools are precious. But for teachers union bosses like Randi  Weingarten, they are just useful hostages.   For the better part of a year, teachers unions shut down our schools  while they shook down politicians for more funding and benefits that  they promised would allow them to reopen safely. Yet they kept schools  closed. They kept kids masked.   Desperate parents watched their socially isolated kids fall behind  while they engaged in Zoom schools, but the unions still dragged their  feet.   When schools finally reopened, our kids faced insane coronavirus  protocols. They weren't allowed to sit with friends at lunch. They  weren't allowed to play at recess. They had to eat outside on freezing- cold days. And every moment of every day at every school, they were  forced to wear a mask.   Confused and hyper kids naturally often rebelled, and they have been  reprimanded and they have been punished for simply trying to play,  trying to make friends, trying to breathe a little easier.   Some parents may think that masks work for their kids, and that is  fine. If they want to, they can put their kids in a mask. They should  be able to choose. But under Democratic-forced masking policies,  parents have no choice at all. Tragically, but predictably--not just  predictably--predicted--these absurd policies have had severe  psychological effects on our kids. Suicide and mental health problems  have skyrocketed in the past 2 years. Grades have plummeted, while  depression has surged. And as is so often the case, those with the  least have suffered the most.   But when parents dared to complain on behalf of their kids, they were  condemned by teachers union bosses and by Democratic politicians as  anti-science and extremists. They were investigated when Attorney  General Merrick Garland sicced the Feds on parents who were simply  going to school boards to protest these stupid policies. The Secretary  of Education threatened to withdraw Federal funding from States and  schools who did not have mask mandates.   Thankfully, the tide has begun to turn. Sometimes I hear the phrase  ``the science changed.'' The science hasn't changed. What has changed  is that there is an election coming and Democrats have seen the polling  on this question. Now they are running scared, and they want to pretend  that they didn't force your kid to wear a mask for 2 years.   You see it in States that are run entirely by Democrats: California,  New Jersey, New York, the President's own Delaware. Just yesterday,  across the river in Virginia, the State senate, to include many  Democrats, voted not just to allow parents a choice but to prohibit  mask mandates by local schools.   Yet, in many places, forced masking remains. Kids as young as 2, 3, 4  are still being forced to wear hot, restrictive, and ineffective masks  for hours on end. Yes, ineffective because almost all those kids are  wearing cloth masks, which don't even work. And that is not me  speaking; that is the CDC speaking. These masks don't even work. Yet  the kids are forced to wear them all day long.    I can tell you that most Democratic politicians don't think they work  either. How do we know that? Look at the candidate for Governor in  Georgia, Stacey Abrams--or maybe I should say the Governor of Georgia,  since she still refuses to concede the 2018 election and many of my  Democratic colleagues have endorsed her view that she is somehow the  shadow Governor of Georgia. Just last week, photos emerged of her  sitting in classrooms with masked kids grinning ear to ear, the only  person not wearing a mask in the classroom.   Also, Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, was yucking it up at  SoFi Stadium when the Rams played the 49ers, taking pictures--without a  mask--with Magic Johnson and a bunch of other celebrities, while he  enforced one of the most onerous mask mandates in the country.   What about Eric Garcetti, whose nomination to be the Ambassador to  India is in front of the Senate right now, who said that pictures of  him without a mask on are fine because he was holding his breath--I  guess like Bill Clinton, who didn't inhale.   Barack Obama, pictures recently emerged of him standing outside-- outside--on the beach, without a mask, while all the peons who are  building his multimillion-dollar beach compound were forced to wear a  mask in front of him.   And I will let you in on something. The same goes for Democratic  Senators. I was in a hearing this week. It was in a small, closed room.  Not a single Democratic Senator wore a mask in that hearing in that  room. The catch is, the TV cameras weren't on, so there wouldn't be  video of them sitting in that closed room without a mask on.   But masks in school have become symbols of control and fear. They are  not instruments of public health. It is past time for the mask mandates  to end and for parents across this country to have a choice. That is  why I am asking the Senate to pass my legislation today to require  schools that receive Federal funding to give parents a simple choice on  whether their kids should wear a mask.   If my Democratic colleagues will join me, we can get this done now,  today. That is why I urge them to support this bill. And I ask, as if  in legislative session, unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of S. 3604, which is at the desk; further,  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I would simply reply to the remarks of the  Senator from Washington, she asserted that I or others who oppose these  mask mandates think that we know better. That is the whole point,  though. It is not that we think we know better; I think that you, as a  parent, know better. You know what is best for your child--not some  Democratic politician, not some liberal superintendent, not some  neurotic public health obsessive.   And, apparently, the Democrats have no problem using these Federal  funds when it suits their neurotic policies. After all, the Department  of Education last year threatened Federal funding for States and  schools that did not permit mask mandates. The whole point of this  exercise is this: the Democrats who think they know better than parents  to make the choices for the parents' kids.   I am disappointed today that my Democratic colleagues want to  continue to see kids forced to wear masks in schools across America,  but, trust me, change is coming one way or another. It will be because  Democratic politicians, like Gavin Newsom, run for the hills or because  the American people repudiate them all in November.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
