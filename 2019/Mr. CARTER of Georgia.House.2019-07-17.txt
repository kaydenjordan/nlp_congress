 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Abe Brown.   In 1984, Mr. Brown was the first African American to be elected Glynn  County coroner. This was not only important to Brunswick, but he was  the first African American coroner in the entire State of Georgia.   His service to the Brunswick community was exceptional. He made it a  point to treat each case like it was his own family.   Before his remarkable 8 years of public service, Mr. Brown owned a  funeral home in town and built friendships with nearly everyone  residing in Brunswick. Citizens there remember him as loved by anyone  who came in contact with him and as a man who had a special way of  encouraging people to work together.   Mr. Brown passed away earlier this year at the age of 77. This past  June, the Brunswick City Commission named a park in his honor.   I am proud that Brunswick could celebrate his work with this park, an  honor that is truly well deserved.                           Recognizing Shakema Deal     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Shakema Deal for her dedication to her country, her community, and her  own education.   A native of the First Congressional District of Georgia, Ms. Deal is  currently serving in Afghanistan as part of the Georgia National Guard.  However, while at home, she works as a police officer with the Savannah  Police Department.   Through all of her hours spent keeping the Savannah area a safe place  to live, as well as her time dedicated to serving the United States  Armed Forces, Ms. Deal has been studying for the last 7 months to earn  a degree in criminal justice administration from Columbia College.   In late June, her fellow soldiers and police colleagues took part in  something truly unique: a graduation ceremony in Afghanistan.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Ms. Deal on her graduation. She is an  inspiration to all of us, and I wish her the best of luck with her  career.                      Remembering Dr. Raymond Allen Cook     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Dr. Raymond Allen Cook, who passed away on June 29 at the age of 99.   Dr. Raymond Allen Cook dedicated his life to sharing his love for  English language literature with not only countless university students  in the State of Georgia but also students all over the world. He taught  for over 30 years at multiple Georgia universities and even traveled  the world to share his knowledge when he was appointed as a Fulbright  lecturer in American literature at the University of Shiraz in Iran.   Highly accomplished in academic circles, he published numerous papers  and even five books on some of the authors who developed the canon of  our language's literature, including Walt Whitman, Geoffrey Chaucer,  Jane Austen, and more.   Through all of this, he never forgot where he came from. In 1964, Dr.  Cook returned to his and my alma mater, Young Harris College, to serve  as its president.   I am thankful that both the State of Georgia and also my alma mater,  Young Harris College, could partner with a scholar as distinguished as  Dr. Cook for the last 30 years.   His family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  most difficult time.              Saluting Chief Anthony Tanner Upon His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief  Anthony ``Tony'' Tanner, who has dedicated his entire professional  career to protecting the city of Waycross from crime.   Chief Tanner began his career over 30 years ago with the Waycross  Police Department in the First Congressional District of Georgia. A  testament to both his hard work and commitment to the city of Waycross,  he worked his way from patrol officer to chief of police, holding every  single rank within the department during different points of his  career.   Of the 12 men who have been chiefs of police in Waycross beginning in  1906, Chief Tanner has held the position longer than any of them.   His work in his community doesn't stop there, though. Outside of the  police force, he continued dedicating time to the community through the  Exchange Club, Red Cross blood drives, the Domestic Violence Task  Force, and much more.   Chief Tanner retired from the Waycross Police Department on June 28,  and his work in the First Congressional District of Georgia will be  deeply missed.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chief Tanner on his retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coastal  Middle School in the First Congressional District of Georgia for being  distinguished as a Lighthouse School to Watch.   Organized by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform,  the Lighthouse Schools to Watch program celebrates high-performing  middle schools based on four factors: academic excellence,  developmental responsiveness, social equity, and organizational  structure.   In Savannah, Coastal Middle School has been surpassing the norm in  all of these areas, while also taking the initiative to go the extra  mile in others. The school teaches classes in both Arabic and Chinese,  values quality writing skills, embraces students with disabilities,  serves students from abroad, and provides opportunities for students to  serve the local community.   While Coastal Middle School continues to excel, schools across  Georgia are also raising the bar. Georgia was the first of three States  in the Nation to qualify for the National Forum Schools to Watch  program.   Congratulations, Coastal Middle School. Keep up the good work, and  thank you for your commitment to providing students in our area with an  exceptional education.                            ____________________
