 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a longtime good  friend of mine named Jimmie Lee Mason from Lubbock, Texas.   Jimmie Lee was a CPA, a consummate professional, and someone who took  his profession very seriously and helped create the firm Mason Warner,  which is in existence today.   Jimmie Lee passed away on April 5, 2019. He was 89 years old and  leaves a giant hole in the hearts of his family, as you might expect.   I first met Jimmie Lee when I joined the State Board of Accountancy  in Texas. Jimmie Lee, for whatever reason, and I will now never know,  chose to take me under his wing. He mentored me. He was a wise  counselor.   As a result of his friendship and his help, I was able to chair the  State Board of Accountancy, and I was able to chair the National  Association of State Boards of Accountancy. I did that work much better  and more professionally because of my friendship and his leadership and  help throughout that process.   My story is only one of many, many like it. Jimmie served the Texas  State Society of CPAs throughout his entire career. There are countless  other CPAs who could have the exact same conversation with you that I  am having this morning as a result of his friendship and his  leadership.   Jimmie leaves behind a wife of 66 years, Wanda; son Jimmie Lee Mason,  Jr.; daughter Kristi Killion and her husband, Jerry; son Greg and his  wife, Areace; and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   Jimmie Lee, everywhere he touched got better, whether it was a not- for-profit organization in Lubbock that he served or his profession  that he served diligently for all those years. Countless individuals  whom he came in contact with are much better off, none more so than the  fellow who stands in front of you here today.   My life is better as a result of my friendship with Jimmie Lee Mason,  and I miss my friend.                            ____________________
