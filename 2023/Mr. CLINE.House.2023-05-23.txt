 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the Strasburg High  School wrestling team for their Class 2 State championship victory, the  Rams' second State title in a row.   The four individual State champions who led this victory include  junior Heath Burks with 126 points and his third State title, senior  Ethan Asher with 138 points and his third State title, junior David  Burks with 150 points and his second State title, and senior Chuck Fake  with 215 points and his second State title.   Additional top Strasburg Rams performers were Conner Miller placing  sixth, Jadon Shanholtz placing third, Donovan Burks placing sixth,  Braden Stern placing fifth, and Hutson Conrad placing third.   This was a remarkable performance by the whole team, and I wish the  best of luck to the seniors on the team in their future endeavors.   Congratulations again to all these talented athletes, parents,  coaches, and staff on this well-deserved victory.                            ____________________
