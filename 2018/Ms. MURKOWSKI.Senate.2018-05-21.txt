 Mr. President, when Alaska Native youth gather  with Alaska Native elders, they often talk about the difficulties of  ``living in two worlds'': the modern world driven by careers,  technology, busy all the time; and the traditional Alaska Native world:  beadwork, subsistence, preparing traditional foods, carrying on Native  languages, teaching your children stories handed down across the  generations that explain the relationship between humans and other  living beings, native dance and ceremonies. The elders explained that  it is possible for Native youth to live in the modern world while  staying true to who you are. It is said that the modern world gives you  wings, but the traditional world gives you roots. The answer to the  challenge of the modern world is to always be mindful of your roots.   In each of the regions of Alaska, there are very special elders who  are highly regarded as mentors and guides for the youth. Some are  traditional chiefs of their tribes or regions, others Native people who  are well known for their wisdom and their integrity.   Among the Athabascan peoples of interior Alaska, two names stand out:  Hannah Solomon and Poldine Carlo. Among Native people when one spoke of  Hannah and Poldine, everyone knew who you were talking about, no need  to use last names. When they spoke at Native gatherings, others stopped  what they were doing and listened. Both spoke with eloquence and  passion. Neither held back.   Hannah Solomon passed away at the age of 102 on September 21, 2011.  Poldine Carlo left us on May 9, 2018, at the age of 97. She was buried  in the Athabascan village of Nulato this week. Both of these women were  regarded as matriarchs and culture bearers. Both will long be  remembered for their loving kindness to their Native people and  especially to the youth. Both were in a league of their own, so to  speak.   I would like to take a few moments to share Poldine's story with my  Senate colleagues and to pay tribute to this remarkable woman.   Poldine was born December 5, 1920, in Nulato, a traditional community  on the Yukon River. She was raised by Joseph and Anna Stickman, her  grandparents. She credited her grandmother with instilling the  traditional Athabascan ways of life in Poldine. She met her husband,  Bill, in Tanana, at the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon Rivers, the  place where the rivers meet. Poldine married Bill in 1940, and they  raised their eight children along the Yukon River in the traditional  ways. Poldine and her husband Bill also operated a mine outside of  Rampart in the summers for 20 years. Poldine's sons and husband  operated the mine, while she did the cooking and fishing. It was a true  family operation.   In 1957, Bill and Poldine relocated in Fairbanks so that their  children could attend high school without leaving home. In those days,  Native children in the village were sent off to boarding school for  high school. Even though they had a full house with eight children,  there was always room for more. They took in many village children so  that they too could benefit from educational opportunities in  Fairbanks.   Their home became a gathering place for the Fairbanks Native  community. From those gatherings came the decision to create the  Fairbanks Native Association, which has grown and grown over the years.  Life was not so easy for Native people in Fairbanks in the early 1960s.  Poldine was committed to justice for her Native people. The Fairbanks  Native Association administers many important wellness programs, but  first and foremost, it ensures that Native people are treated fairly.   She was active in the Tanana Chiefs Conference and in the regional  Native Corporation, Doyon. Poldine's son Wally today serves as chairman  of the board of directors of Doyon. Poldine shared her wisdom in many  ways. She was an elder in residence at the University of Alaska  Fairbanks. She authored the book, ``Nulato: an Indian life on the  Yukon.'' Her beadwork was breathtaking. People loved her singing. Eagle  Island Blues was a song people loved to hear her sing, but Blueberry  Hill was her and Bill's song. She sang about Denali in Athabascan to  greet President Obama when he traveled to Alaska. She composed songs  for her husband, daughter, and son when they passed away.   Poldine humbly accepted many awards during her lifetime of service to  Alaska and the Native community. She was awarded an honorary doctor of  law degree by the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Hannah Solomon  ``Woman of Courage'' award from the Alaska Federation of Natives. She  was a Girl Scouts Woman of Distinction, a Golden Citizen Chieftain, and  a Howard Rock Alaska Native Leader. She was recently inducted into the  Alaska Women's Hall of Fame, joining her friend and contemporary Hannah  Solomon.   Poldine's son Wally was kind enough to share some of his mother's  final words with me, knowing that they would be part of her tribute.  Poldine told Wally that she lived a full life and loved everyone. She  offered a few words of advice: ``You need to be happy. All that matters  is how you raise your family and to be happy.''   Yes, Poldine was proudest of family, and she had much to be proud of,  those children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great- grandchildren who are making their own contributions to our Native  people and our State in her image, like Dr. Nikoosh Carlo, who is one  of the Nation's most influential figures on Arctic science and policy.  Poldine asked that her survivors and friends in the community ``carry  on,'' and I have no doubt that they will.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I extend my condolences to  Poldine's exceptional family, her huge extended family, and the Native  people of interior Alaska who took inspiration from her example. A  traditional woman, a community leader, writer, artist, singer, we shall  all miss Poldine Carlo. She connected us to our roots and encouraged  our wings.                            ____________________
