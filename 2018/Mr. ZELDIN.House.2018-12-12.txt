 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our 9/11 first  responders and their families, urging all Members of Congress to  support passage of the Never Forget the Heroes Act, H.R. 7062, which  would permanently fund the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund and extend  its authorization to 2090.   Regardless of party affiliation and regardless of which district or  State you come from, it is imperative that right out of the gate of the  next Congress, starting next month, that this legislation is  immediately passed and sent to the President to become law.  [[Page H10111]]    First responders who worked on the pile day and night, aiding in the  search, rescue, and cleanup efforts, were breathing in toxic debris and  ash that are now known to have caused over 50 different types of  cancer.   James Zadroga was one of those fearless leaders. He was also the  first NYPD officer whose death, in 2006, was connected to toxic  exposure at the World Trade Center site. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health  and Compensation Act was later signed into law in 2011 to help our 9/11  first responders.   Mr. Speaker, 5 years later, the Zadroga Act was permanently  reauthorized and included $4.6 million for the 9/11 Victims  Compensation Fund over 5 years, which was established to provide  compensation for the victims of 9/11 and their families. However, we  are hearing from the special master of the fund that this funding ``may  be insufficient to compensate all claims.''   Representing a district just over 50 miles from Ground Zero, fighting  for the Americans affected on September 11 isn't just my job--it is  personal. Whether it is losing a loved one or knowing someone who  volunteered on the pile, each and every one of my constituents,  including myself, has been affected.   Before Congress passed the permanent reauthorization of the Zadroga  Act, I vividly recall so many first responders who had fallen ill were  forced to come to our Nation's Capitol and beg for the benefits they  rightfully earned. These 9/11 first responders lived not only in New  York, but in 433 of the 435 congressional districts across this  country.   This isn't just a New York issue. This isn't a Democratic or  Republican Party platform or political football. This is a  responsibility we all shoulder as Americans, first and foremost. It is  the spirit of our Nation, and it is who we are as a people.   These were the very men and women who, in the face of evil, were  willing to put it all on the line to help save their fellow Americans  who ran into the towers while everyone else was running out. It is  unconscionable that time and again they have been forced to come  crawling to Washington, D.C., to plead their case as to why they are  worthy of our support. It was heartbreaking and sickening, and I hope  we have learned our lesson.   We must pass this legislation at the beginning of the 116th Congress  so these first responders don't have to go through all of this again,  so they can focus on their health and not be forced to travel to  Washington, D.C., on their own dime dozens of times for the benefits  they have more than earned.   This past September 11, 17 years since the attacks, we came together,  as we always do, to remember those who were taken from us on that day.  But this year marked an especially harrowing occasion. By the end of  this year, it is anticipated that more people will have died from 9/11- related illnesses than were killed on 9/11, and over 175 of those  deaths occurred just this year.   Jimmy Martinez was one of those 175. Diagnosed with bone marrow  cancer, he went into remission in 2016, a year after the Zadroga Act's  permanent reauthorization. He responded to the 1993 attack on the World  Trade Center, again on 9/11, and came to the aid of so many in the  aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. This August, he died a 26-year veteran  of the FDNY.    Just as there were so many who fought for the Zadroga Act who were  not here to fight for its reauthorization in 2015, Jimmy is just one of  the so many who are unable to continue this fight today. That is why it  is up to us--to fight for others like Jimmy, for those who risked so  much for us but they need our help. Congress must take action to ensure  every family receives the compensation they are entitled to as soon as  possible. They have earned nothing less.   On that horrific day, in the face of the worst of humanity, these men  and women were the best of it. In honor of them and their families who  carry on their memory, Congress must do its job and permanently fund  the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.   In the aftermath of 9/11, we vowed we would never forget, and I am  going to make sure of it.                            ____________________
