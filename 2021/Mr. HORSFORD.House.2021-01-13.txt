 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Article of  Impeachment. Last Wednesday's events were not just a breach of a  building, but a breach of our democracy, a threat to our Republic and  to who we are as Americans.   Donald Trump incited insurrection against America and attempted to  overturn the will of the people. We must send a clear message that  committing sedition disqualifies a President from serving another day  in office. I urge this body to vote for impeachment. I will.
