 Reserving the right to object.    I am deeply grateful to my colleague and friend, the  Senator from Arkansas, for bringing this to the floor of the U.S.  Senate.   There is an urgency he described that I agree with. One hundred  Senators here, and not one State has not been touched, devastatingly,  by the fentanyl epidemic. These analogs present a crisis to our  country. Lives are at stake so I share his sense of urgency.   I am hoping we can work together to find a way to stop, as he put it,  these cartels and these drug labs from wreaking such havoc on our  country. I believe that together we can find a solution. In fact, there  has been constructive talk across the Capitol--bipartisan talk about  finding a way to come to some kind of accord.   In addition to that, I am hopeful that there are other bills out  there that have the same ambition, the same goal, the same sense of  urgency that I believe should be part of the discussion; for example,  policies like the ones in the STOP Fentanyl Act, which I understand  Senator Markey will be introducing in the Senate very soon. I believe  we should have time in the Judiciary Committee to work on a longer term  solution that cannot just deal with the international cartels, not just  deal with these horrific drug labs but also empower people who are  addicted to begin not to be punished simply with the criminal justice  system but to find ways to provide treatment and support to people who  are struggling with addictions to this horrific drug.   So with that, I would like to object.    Madam President, I want to say, in conclusion, before I  switch to another topic, that I appreciate the willingness of the  Senator from Arkansas to look not just at his bill but a powerful  potential bipartisan extension however we can deal with this. The  urgency does exist. We are in a crisis.
