 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Dr. Clifton Ganus, Jr., who passed away earlier this month at the age  of 97 after dedicating 73 years to his alma mater, Harding University,  in Searcy, Arkansas.   Dr. Ganus began his journey at Harding College in 1939, majoring in  Bible and history. Soon after graduating, he began teaching at Harding  in 1946, ultimately chairing the History Department and serving as  Dean.   In 1965, he was elected as Harding's third president, leading the  then college to university status and significant growth. He served in  this role for 22 years, becoming the university's first chancellor in  1987 and then chancellor emeritus in 2013.   Throughout this admirable life, Dr. Ganus traveled to 117 countries,  was an Eagle Scout, and served on the Quapaw Area Council board. He was  an active member in the Searcy Lions Club for 70 years and an elder at  the College Church of Christ.   He was admired across our State, and I extend my prayers to his  family and friends across our great State of Arkansas.                            ____________________
