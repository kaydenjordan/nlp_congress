 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of  critical importance to California: doctor shortages.   First, I want to express my deepest appreciation and gratitude to the  entire medical community, particularly the doctors, nurses, and support  staff who have been on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.  Amidst a severe shortage of protective equipment, they nevertheless  continue to work around the clock to save countless lives. I--and my  colleagues--are eternally grateful.   I have heard from countless Californians who have said the same  thing: we need more doctors.   That is why Congress established the Public Service Loan Forgiveness  Program in 2007 to encourage doctors to pursue careers at public and  nonprofit facilities, especially in areas experiencing physician  shortages. As a result, physicians who provide care in a nonprofit or  public hospital can have their student debt forgiven by the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness Program after making 120 qualifying monthly  payments under a qualifying repayment plan.   However, when the Department of Education issued implementing  guidance for the program, it unintentionally excluded California and  Texas physicians from being eligible to receive loan forgiveness by  requiring that borrowers be classified as employees in order to be  eligible for loan forgiveness.   The problem is that under state law in California and Texas, doctors  are prevented from being directly employed by corporations, including  nonprofit organizations. As a result, physicians in California and  Texas who provide medical services at nonprofit hospitals do not  currently qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.   To make matters worse, the United States is facing a shortage of  physicians, especially in California.   The Council on Graduate Medical Education recommends 60 to 80 primary  care physicians per 100,000 people. However, statewide in California,  the number is already down to just 50 per 100,000 people. And in some  places, it is even lower: down to 35 primary care physicians per  100,000 people and 39 per 100,000 people in the Inland Empire and San  Joaquin Valley, respectively.   During this difficult and challenging time, it is clear that more  medical professionals are needed. And long after this pandemic ends, we  will still need more doctors to provide high-quality care, in both  rural and urban areas.   That is why I am pleased to introduce the bipartisan ``Stopping  Doctor Shortages Act.'' This legislation would help attract more  doctors to public service and address the looming physician shortage by  fixing a loophole that prevents thousands of doctors from participating  in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.   According to the California Medical Association, this bill alone  could bring as many as 10,000 physicians to California over the next  ten years.   Similar legislation, soon to be introduced in the House by  Representatives Josh Harder, Jay Obernolte, Joaquin Castro, and Van  Taylor, also enjoys bipartisan support.   I would like to thank Senator John Cornyn for his support on this  critical issue and for cosponsoring the bill.   I ask my colleagues to join us to pass the ``Stopping Doctor  Shortages Act'' in a timely manner as we continue to find ways to  combat the coronavirus pandemic and save lives.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr.          Tillis, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cramer, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Wicker):   S. 312. A bill to expand eligibility for and provide judicial review  for the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program, provide for compassionate  release based on COVID-19 vulnerability, shorten the waiting period for  judicial review during the COVID-19 pandemic, and make other technical  corrections; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
