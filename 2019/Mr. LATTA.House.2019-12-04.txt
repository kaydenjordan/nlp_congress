 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), the Republican leader of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bipartisan legislation  to combat illegal robocalls. With an estimated 48 billion robocalls  each year, it is time for Congress to take swift action against illegal  robocalls and give Americans the security of knowing their incoming  calls are legitimate.   That is why we introduced the bipartisan STOP Robocalls Act, which is  included in the legislation before us today. Our bill would give phone  companies and the Federal Communications Commission the tools they need  to fight back against illegal robocalls. Private companies will be able  to block fraudulent calls before they get to your phones, all with  consumer control and no additional line-item charges.    Our provision also provides and improves information-sharing to  enhance the FCC's ability to track and stop illegal robocall spoofing  operations. As technology continues to evolve, so do the tactics that  bad actors use to spoof numbers illegally to make fraudulent robocalls.  We must allow these companies and the FCC to keep pace.   While we are all tired of annoying and illegal robocall scams, there  are also legitimate users of autodialing technologies that must be  preserved. The bill before us today rightly recognizes those important  proconsumer messages. From school closures to bank fraud alerts, there  are voice and text messages that consumers want, and those should not  be blocked.   This is strong bipartisan legislation, and I am pleased to have  worked with Chairman Pallone, Republican leader Walden, and  subcommittee Chairman Doyle on this bill to improve consumer trust in  our phone system.   I urge all of our colleagues to support this measure.
