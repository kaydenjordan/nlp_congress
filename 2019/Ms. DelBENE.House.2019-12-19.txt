 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  rise in support of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the  implementing legislation.   Congressional Democrats worked hard to secure labor-specific  enforcement tools and robust environmental provisions that make this  agreement a substantial improvement over the original NAFTA.   Most importantly, this new agreement helps many of my constituents.  Now, our dairy farmers will have greater market access to Canada, and  our wineries will have an easier time selling their wine in British  Columbia.   When this new agreement is in place, it will be the first U.S. trade  agreement with a digital trade chapter. It includes provisions on data  localization, cross-border data flows, and other requirements that  preserve a free and open internet. That is important to all segments of  our economy.   My district is home to a vibrant technology industry that is  responsible for thousands of good-paying jobs and helps power America's  large trade surplus in digital services.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  agreement.
