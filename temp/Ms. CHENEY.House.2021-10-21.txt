 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, a year ago today, the election was still a couple of  weeks off. We knew it would be a tight race. Most of us did not  anticipate that President Trump, or any President, frankly, would ever  simply reject the outcome of the vote.  [[Page H5759]]    President Trump had the right to challenge the outcome in our State  and Federal courts, which have an appropriate and constitutional role  in resolving election claims. But what he did thereafter has no  precedent in our history. He rejected the courts' rulings in dozens of  cases, including the rulings of judges President Trump himself  appointed.   He rejected what his own Department of Justice officials told him  over and over again, that they found no evidence of widespread fraud  sufficient to overcome the election. He rejected the conclusions of  both the Department of Justice and the intelligence community that the  Dominion Voting machines had not secretly changed the election outcome.    President Trump had no factual or constitutional basis for his  claims. And the lawyers he found who would carry his false claims  forward have paid the consequences. Rudy Giuliani's license to practice  law has been suspended, and Sidney Powell has been sanctioned by a  Federal judge.   But Donald Trump persisted, attempting through every manner he could  imagine to try to overturn the outcome of the election. We all saw what  happened. The people who attacked this building have told us on video,  on social media, and now before the Federal courts exactly what  motivated them. They believed what Donald Trump told them, that the  election was stolen and that they needed to take action.   Today, Madam Speaker, we are here to address one witness, Mr. Steve  Bannon. I urge all Americans to watch what Mr. Bannon said on his  podcast on January 5 and 6. It is shocking and indefensible. He said,  ``All hell is going to break loose.'' He said, ``We are coming in right  over the target. This is the point of attack we have always wanted.''   Madam Speaker, there are people in this Chamber right now who were  evacuated with me and with the rest of us on that day during that  attack; people who now seem to have forgotten the danger of the moment,  the assault on the Constitution, the assault on our Congress; people  who you will hear argue that there is simply no legislative purpose for  this committee, for this investigation, or for this subpoena.   In fact, there is no doubt that Mr. Bannon knows far more than what  he said on the video. There is no doubt that all hell did break loose.  Just ask the scores of brave police officers who were injured that day  protecting all of us. The American people deserve to hear his  testimony.   Let me give you just four examples of the legislative purpose of this  investigation.   First, the plot we are investigating, involving Mr. Eastman, Mr.  Giuliani, Mr. Bannon, President Trump, and many others, their plot  attempted to halt or delay our count of electoral votes and reverse the  outcome of the 2020 election. The 1887 Electoral Count Act is directly  at issue, and our investigation will lead to recommendations to amend  or reform that act.                                time  1445    Second, while the attack was underway, President Trump knew it was  happening; indeed, he may have been watching it all unfold on  television, and yet he took no immediate action to stop it. This  appears to be a supreme dereliction of duty by President Trump, and we  are evaluating whether our criminal laws should be enhanced to supply  additional and more severe consequences for this type of behavior.   Third, we know from our investigation to date that President Trump  was pressuring the Department of Justice in late December 2020 to  support his false claims that the election was stolen. Several brave  and honorable Trump appointees at the department flatly refused to go  along with this fraud and threatened to resign. We are evaluating what,  if any, additional laws may be required to prevent a future President  from succeeding in such an effort.   Fourth, we know that President Trump made efforts to persuade State  election officials to ``find votes'' to change the election outcome in  his favor. We are evaluating whether the criminal laws of the United  States should be enhanced to make the penalty for this type of behavior  even more severe, and, if so, in what manner.   Mr. Bannon's own public statements made clear he knew what was going  to happen before it did, and thus he must have been aware of and may  well have been involved in the planning of everything that played out  on that day.   The American people deserve to know what he knew and what he did.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to correct the Record. The gentleman from  Indiana asserted that the FBI has found there was no coordination. That  is just simply not true.   The gentleman also said that he is not on the committee. He noted  that the Speaker had determined that he wouldn't be on the committee.   Madam Speaker, I have a number of letters the gentleman from Indiana  has been sending to Federal agencies, and I include in the Record one  dated September 16, 2021, for example, signing his name as the ranking  member of the committee he has just informed the House he is not on and  that, in fact, he is not on.                                       House of Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, September 16, 2021.      Hon. Deb Haaland,      Secretary, Department of the Interior,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Haaland: You are receiving this letter       because the House of Representatives Select Committee to       Investigate the events of January 6th may have sent you a       request for information. The House Republican Leader Kevin       McCarthy appointed me to serve as the Ranking Member of the       Select Committee. Yet, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to       allow me to fulfill my duties as Ranking Member.        Pursuant to the rules of the House of Representatives, the       minority party in Congress retains rights to the same       information that is provided to the majority party. For those       reasons, I ask that you provide me any information that is       submitted to the Select Committee. Additionally, please       include me on any update or briefing that you provide. If you       have questions, please do not hesitate to contact my staff.            Sincerely,                                                         Jim Banks,                                                    Ranking Member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, just outside this Chamber, over the north door in  Statuary Hall, which was the old House Chamber, stands a statue of  Clio, the muse of history. She is one of the oldest works of art in our  Capitol. She stands in a winged chariot, the chariot of time, and she  takes notes in her book, reminding all of us that our words and our  actions will be judged by history. History will particularly judge  those of us in positions of public trust for what we are doing today.   In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Madam Speaker, we all  recognized how profoundly wrong January 6 was. The gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan), who just suggested that we were here because we opposed  President Trump's policies, seems to have forgotten that actually on  January 6 he, himself, said, ``What happened today is wrong and is not  what America is about.''   The next day Mr. Jordan said, ``What happened Wednesday is a tragedy.  Everyone knows that. It is as wrong as wrong can be.''   And today, Madam Speaker, the former President suggested that the  violence was justified.   My colleagues in the Republican Party, the Republican Members of this  body, have to understand, have to recognize, that there is a moment  when politics must stop if we want to defend and protect our  institutions.   A violent assault on the Capitol to stop the constitutional process  of counting electoral votes is that moment. They all knew that on that  day.   In fact, the minority leader himself stood in this Chamber and said,  ``The President bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress  by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he  saw what was unfolding.''   Mr. McCarthy was right then. The President bears responsibility.   We need to know what happened. This body must have the ability to  understand what caused the attack, to understand who was responsible,  and to take legislative action to ensure that it never happens again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion for  contempt for Mr. Steve Bannon. I urge them to do so because it is  right; it is morally right; it is constitutionally right; and it is all  of our duty.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
