 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of Robert Kresse, a western New York champion for those who had  none. Bob Kresse combined his lawyerly skills for estates and historic  preservation to become a powerful force for good in Buffalo for 70  years.   Bob Kresse knew well that his vision went beyond the bricks and  mortar of preservation; it was the restorative power of preservation on  the hearts of the people and the community that he loved that mattered  most.   Bob Kresse is survived by his beautiful family, including his beloved  wife of 56 years, Mary Ann. Bob would often say that Mary Ann didn't  just love him back; she was his chief collaborator and best friend  always, especially in those last, most difficult days.   The Niagara River Greenway, the King Urban Life Center, the Roycroft,  and the Darwin Martin House, among so many others, have a common  thread, and that is Bob Kresse's uncommon vision, love, and  perseverance.                            ____________________
