 Mr. Speaker, as I have repeatedly warned, the fiscal  state of our Nation is in decline. Our financial health is rapidly  deteriorating, and our national debt is unsustainable, and, by the way,  both parties bear some blame.   One thing is for sure, Mr. Speaker. We didn't get here overnight, and  we won't get out of this mess with just one piece of legislation.   Here is my admonition to my colleagues. This can't just be a one-off  deal. It must be the beginning of a movement to restore fiscal sanity  in our Nation's Capitol. We must end the era of Big Government funded  on the backs of our children and change the culture in Washington to  continuously and repeatedly rein in our out-of-control deficit  spending.   Today, there is only one deal on the table, and only one question for  me and my colleagues to answer: Do the biggest cuts to the wasteful and  bloated bureaucracy, record rescissions of Federal funds and reforms to  welfare and environmental regulations constitute a meaningful step in  the right direction?   Mr. Speaker, the answer is unequivocally, yes. As I have said all  along, we will pay our bills. We will protect the good faith and credit  of the United States, but we will not give politicians a blank check to  bankrupt our country.   The American people gave Republicans the majority in the House to  stop our Democratic colleagues' unbridled spending and reverse Biden's  failed economic policies, and I believe the Fiscal Responsibility Act  is certainly a good start, which is why I support this piece of  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
