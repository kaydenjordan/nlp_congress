 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have two items I would like to speak  for a few moments on today, but first I want to rise to say how pleased  I am that the Senate voted to confirm Judge Hala Jarbou to serve as the  Federal judge in the U.S. District Circuit for the Western District of  Michigan.   Both Senator Peters and I supported her, returned our blue slips, and  were very pleased to support her confirmation. I think she will do an  excellent job.   Her story, Judge Jarbou's story, is really an American story. She was  born in Iraq and came to this country as a young girl. She was the  first person in her family to earn her college degree from the  University of Michigan and  [[Page S5534]]  her law degree from Wayne State University.   She is the first Chaldean judge to serve at the circuit court level  in Oakland County, MI, and she is now the first Chaldean-American to  serve on the Federal bench. So I am very, very pleased that she was  confirmed today.   Judge Jarbou greatly values the opportunity she has been given, I  know, and has worked to extend those opportunities to others during her  career.   She is active in the Michigan legal community and in the Chaldean  American Chamber of Commerce and other cultural organizations.   She served as a mentor and has worked to increase the diversity of  clerks in her own courtroom. Again, I am just very pleased that she was  overwhelmingly confirmed by the U.S. Senate today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise now on behalf of the more than 19  million people in our Nation and half a million people in Michigan who  show us every day what service and sacrifice and love of country is  really all about.   These patriots landed on beaches in Normandy and the Pacific theater,  crept through jungles in Korea, shed blood in Vietnam, survived attacks  in Iraq, and fought terrorists in Afghanistan. These people are heroes.  They love our Nation so much. They are willing to put their lives on  the line for our democracy, our people, and our way of life.   That is why it is so incredibly shocking and infuriating to hear the  President of the United States, the Commander in Chief of our Armed  Forces, disparage our veterans. President Trump called them losers and  suckers--losers and suckers. He said he couldn't understand why anyone  would join the military because ``What is in it for them?''   He said veterans who had lost limbs shouldn't be in parades. Why?  Because he couldn't handle seeing them. He didn't think people would  want to see them. People in Michigan want to see them and thank them  and do so every day.   We all remember what he said about our former colleague and friend,  the late Senator John McCain. President Trump said that he prefers  veterans who didn't get captured.   My own dad served in the Navy during World War II. He signed up  because he believed in a cause bigger than himself. Perhaps President  Trump doesn't understand, but my dad was a sailor, not a sucker.   About one in four people who have served in our armed services now  live with a service-connected disability. President Trump, these  veterans are leaders; they aren't losers.   President Trump wonders what is in it for them. Well, maybe he should  ask them because we all know what they would say. We all know what they  would say: pride, duty, honor, the feeling that comes from putting  something or someone above yourself. It is becoming increasingly clear  that these aren't feelings that the current occupant of the Oval Office  understands.   My dad once told me something I have never forgotten. In fact, it has  influenced my whole life as an elected official. He said that a veteran  should never stand at the back of any line for a job, for healthcare,  for education, or for the military recognitions they earned. My dad  came home after World War II and went to school on the GI bill, and I  don't know what would have happened to our family if he had not had  that opportunity. So my dad said over and over again that a veteran  should not stand at the back of any line. They certainly shouldn't be  put at the end of the line by their own President. It is appalling that  this even needs to be said, actually.   When I heard these comments and heard them verified over and over  again in every media outlet from right to left, verifying that, in  fact, these were his comments, it was stunning. It was appalling. It  made me very angry.   Our veterans deserve a place of honor at the front of the line--at  the front of the line. They deserve a Commander in Chief who respects  them, who honors their service, and, frankly, who gets it. Thank  goodness we have people who believe in things beyond themselves. Thank  goodness we have people who are willing to stand up for all of us, to  keep us safe and stand up for our values and our country.   So on behalf of the people of Michigan, I want to say thank you to  everyone who has served and everyone who is currently serving our  country in our armed services. We are truly grateful for your sacrifice  and service and your willingness to stand up and support and defend our  country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
