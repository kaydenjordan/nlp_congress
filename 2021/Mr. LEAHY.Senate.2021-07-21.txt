 Madam President, I rise on the floor today to honor the  legacy of one of the country's most cherished heroes and a very dear  and close friend of mine, John Lewis.   This past Saturday marked 1 year since we said goodbye to Congressman  Lewis. The pain of his loss is still very fresh for both my wife  Marcelle and me, as it is for millions of Americans.   He wasn't just a moral giant and a guiding light for the world, he  was, as he always told me, my brother, and I still have such a sense of  emotion when I think of the time he introduced me as his brother.   For more than six decades, John Lewis served the United States with  an unyielding belief that we could be better; that we have a  responsibility to each other and the world to live up to our founding  ideals.   John didn't spend his life fighting for Democrats or Republicans; he  fought for the rights of all Americans and the dignity of all human  beings.   John's principles were so much bigger than party and politics. When  he saw suffering, he tried to end it; whenever he saw injustice, he  tried to correct it; and wherever good trouble was needed, he delivered  it.   I knew John as more than just a generational leader; I knew him as a  friend. And I can tell you that his dedication to justice was matched  only by his fundamental decency as a person.   John and I served in Congress for more than 30 years. In those years,  I witnessed a tremendous humility and empathy that defined his lifetime  of public service.   Every day, John embodied the ideals he fought for through his  unfailing generosity and dignity. So I consider John Lewis a brother,  and it was an honor of a lifetime to have him consider me one too.   It is--I think when we walked down the street in Vermont, I just felt  suddenly so much a person because I was walking beside John Lewis.   But people are seeing where he had walked. Many Americans know the  stories of John's bravery in the face of brutality. He was beaten  bloody, his bones broken, in the heroic efforts to bolster the ballot  box for millions of Americans.   John wasn't just on the frontlines of our Nation's great civil rights  movement; he was the frontline. John was there when the Freedom Riders  were dragged off their buses and beaten and arrested; John was there to  lead the march from--for freedom from Selma to Montgomery, AL; and John  was there when millions of Americans gathered in Washington to proclaim  to the country that the time for justice and equality was now. John  Lewis put his body and soul on the line for the mighty movement that  changed the world.   What fewer Americans may know is that John was beloved and respected  by Members of both parties. It is because he believed in his heart that  our Nation's greatest challenges must be faced together, regardless of  party. When he stood there beside Lyndon Johnson as he signed the  landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, he was flanked by Democrats and  Republicans. In that moment, he absorbed the lessons that reaching  across the aisle wasn't just a political necessity, it is the way to  change--everlastingly change society.   And throughout his career in Congress, John embraced bipartisanship.  He built friendships with Members of both parties. For years, John led  bipartisan groups of Members of Congress, including some of my  Republican friends in this body, down to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in  Selma, AL. He wanted to commemorate Bloody Sunday and the American  struggle for equal rights.   I will never forget the iconic photo of John. He is flanked on either  side by Presidents Obama and George W. Bush; the three of them, heads  bowed in silent reflection, arms and hands linked on the Edmund Pettus  Bridge for Bloody Sunday's 50th anniversary.   John Lewis didn't just cross bridges; he built bridges. By bringing  people together, he helped us forge a more perfect Union.   So it is in John's spirit today that I fervently urge my Republican  friends to join me in restoring and reauthorizing the Voting Rights  Act. I would remind everyone in this body that reauthorizing the VRA,  the Voting Rights Act, on a bipartisan basis is the way we have always  done it. I say always done--the core provisions of the VRA have been  reauthorized five times, and every single time it was with overwhelming  bipartisan support in Congress.   Look at the Presidents who signed it: President Nixon, President  Reagan, George W. Bush. They all signed the Voting Rights Act  reauthorizations into law because they spoke of the profound importance  of the landmark law for our democracy.   I was here in 2006 for the most recent VRA reauthorization. Do you  know what the vote was in this body in 2006? It was 98 to 0 in the  Senate. In fact, many of the Republican Senators still serving today  voted yes; 98 to 0. You can't do much better than that.   So let's honor John Lewis's legacy the way he would want to be  honored, with solid justified action. I am committed to working with my  Republican friends to find a bipartisan compromise around my John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act, which I proudly renamed in his honor  last Congress.   For those who knew John Lewis and for those who did not, I can say  John would want us to come together and find a path forward to  addressing the many threats facing Americans' foundational right to  vote. I will tell you what he wouldn't accept. He wouldn't accept  inaction. So let's put in the hard work and let's try to live up to the  memory of John Lewis, our hero and our colleague.   Let's remember the person who took me by the arm and walked me on to  the floor of the other body one day and said to everybody: I am here  with my brother.   Every one of us thought of John as our brother, and we were proud of  that. Let us be proud of our brother. Let's be proud of his memory.  Let's be proud of America. Let's be proud of our right to vote. Let's  pass and reauthorize the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
