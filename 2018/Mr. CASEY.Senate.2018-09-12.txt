 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise before you today to express the  importance of freedom of the press both around the world and here at  home. Journalists take risks--often great risks--to tell the stories of  war, genocide, hunger, poverty, and corruption around the world while  facing unprecedented rates of intimidation and violence.   Freedom of expression is the bedrock of our democracy, but we must  not take it for granted. It is how we hold ourselves to the standards  set by the Founders and hold ourselves accountable and how we protect  our institutions from falling into traps set by those who seek to abuse  power.   Earlier this year, I introduced S. Res. 501, a resolution recognizing  threats to freedom of the press and freedom of expression. This  resolution was introduced with Senators Rubio and Wyden, and I thank my  colleagues for their leadership on this important issue.    This resolution highlights the importance of the freedom of the  press, condemns attacks against journalists, and reaffirms press  freedom as a priority  [[Page S6119]]  for the U.S. Government. This resolution is in honor of the 46  journalists who were killed in 2017 for their reporting, for the 262  journalists who were imprisoned around the world last year, and, as  part of that 262, the 21 journalists who were jailed just in 2017 for  ``false news,'' which more than doubled the 2016 record.   These journalists are mothers and fathers and sons and daughters who  put their lives and, indeed, their freedom on the line to shed a light  on some of the world's toughest stories. I would like to tell the story  of one of the journalists who lost his life last year, Chris Allen,  while he bravely reported from a conflict area. I acknowledge Chris's  parents, Joyce Krajian and John Allen, who are here with us today.   Chris grew up in Narberth, PA, and graduated from the University of  Pennsylvania. Chris's parents say he was an explorer from an early age  and had a keen interest in history. He went on to pursue his master's  degree at Oxford. He was encouraged to go to places where history was  being made. Chris embraced this calling and became a freelance  journalist--first in eastern Ukraine, where he embedded with pro- Ukranian forces and reported for outlets like the Independent and the  Guardian, in order to help give his audience a glimpse of the conflict  up close.   His mother Joyce and his father John have shared this memory of  Chris:         This desire to bring to light untold stories from uncovered       regions of the world and the plights of their peoples--that's       what motivated Chris. He wanted to know the thoughts and       feelings of those encountering conflict firsthand.    So said his parents.   After 3 years in Ukraine, Chris decided to embed with the South Sudan  opposition forces near the Ugandan border. On August 26, 2017, we  understand that Chris walked overnight with these fighters and two  other journalists to the town of Kaya. Chris was killed shortly after  dawn while he photographed a gun battle between opposition and  government forces. Chris was just 26 years old.   In the early years of his professional life, Chris had already  committed himself to the vital job of covering dangerous places and  exposing stories of vulnerable people whose countries were embroiled in  war. In the year that has passed since his death, despite commitments  from the South Sudanese Government to investigate, Joyce and John have  no official information about how he was killed, and no one has been  held accountable for the loss of their son. They have seen South  Sudanese Government officials smear Chris's reputation and threaten  other foreign journalists with the same fate. This is unthinkable for  any parent to have to endure.   Chris Allen's parents have more questions than they have answers.  Chris and others like him have lost their lives in the pursuit of  truth, with no accountability or justice. Other journalists sit in  prison today for daring to speak truth to power. We have a  responsibility to advance these core American values--the values of  freedom of expression and freedom of the press. These values continue  to serve as an example to the world.   As I mentioned earlier, our bipartisan resolution reaffirms press  freedom as a priority for the United States. What does this mean  exactly?   First, advocating for media freedom should be a feature of the U.S.  Government's interactions with other governments where the media is  censored, silenced, or threatened. I have had tough conversations over  the years, as I know many of my colleagues have had, with foreign  government officials about human rights and the rule of law. I know it  can be difficult to advance these values while always cooperating on  other issues like security or other political issues, but we must press  these issues. Whether it is advocating for the release of two Reuters  journalists who were detained under antiquated laws in Myanmar,  pressing for an investigation into Chris Allen's death, or pushing for  reforms to allow media workers to operate more freely, the U.S.  Government must be consistent and persistent.   Perhaps more importantly, we must model the respect for free  journalism and empower journalists here at home. Investigative  journalism helps to hold accountable government officials, elected  representatives, business leaders, and others. It exposes fraud and  waste and corruption, which corrode our society. It helps us to connect  with the men and the women in uniform who serve our Nation overseas and  to understand the conflicts in which they fight. It shows us the  atrocities of terrorist groups like ISIS and the abuses of dictatorial  regimes like that of Bashar al-Assad's. Journalists amplify the voices  of the most vulnerable among us and provide for us a window into the  homes and into the hearts of people a world away.   Instead of respecting these professionals, President Trump has called  them the ``enemy of the people.'' When we hear powerful voices  denigrate tough reporting as ``fake news'' or bar reporters from doing  their jobs by blocking access, we all must condemn it. Reporters,  writers, photographers, and media workers in the United States have not  been intimidated and will continue to carry the torch of core American  values like freedom of the press. On both sides of the aisle, we have a  responsibility to rebuke any anti-press narratives by any public  officials. This narrative is not only antithetical to the values our  Founders laid out in the Bill of Rights, but it is dangerous.   I urge my colleagues to support S. Res. 501 this week and to speak up  for media freedoms every day.   I yield the floor.
