 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome  Reverend Josh Smith as our guest chaplain here at the U.S. House of  Representatives, and I greatly appreciate his leading us in prayer this  morning. He has been serving in ministry for nearly 20 years.   Josh has faithfully dedicated his life to the Gospel and currently  serves as senior pastor of my home church, Prince Avenue Baptist Church  in the Athens, Georgia, area.   In addition to earning a bachelor's degree in cross-cultural studies,  a master of divinity, and a doctorate of ministry in expository  preaching, he has worked to spread God's Word on both a national and  international level.   As a pastor myself, it gives me absolute pleasure to recognize Josh  for his spiritual leadership and guidance.   I also welcome, today, his wife, Andrea, to the people's House; and  we send our best wishes to their five children, Lily, Gracie, Josie,  Annalee, and Josiah, back home in Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask everyone to join me in thanking Pastor Smith  for leading us today and opening this session in prayer. It is my deep  privilege to not only be a member of his church, but also be a co- laborer with him for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for his  outstanding spiritual leadership to the Athens community and the world  abroad.                            ____________________
