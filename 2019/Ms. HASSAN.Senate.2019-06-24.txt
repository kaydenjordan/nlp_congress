 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the  students of Gilford High School's introduction to engineering class as  June 2019 Granite Staters of the Month. These students successfully  applied their engineering knowledge to create personalized, easy-to-use  mobility devices for three young students in their community who  experience disabilities.   The idea for this project came from Troy Gallagher, who just  graduated from Gilford High School and will attend Texas Tech in the  fall. Last summer, Troy participated in an advanced studies program at  St. Paul's School, where he took a 5-week engineering course that  introduced him to the University of Delaware program GoBabyGo!, which  works with communities around the world to modify ride-on cars for  children with disabilities. The vehicles can be used in physical and  occupational therapy sessions, in speech therapy as a means to increase  a child's expressive and receptive language skills, and to help the  children better socialize with their peers.   Troy thought this would be an excellent engineering project to bring  to Gilford High School, as did his introduction to engineering teacher,  Dan Caron. After petitioning the parent teacher association, PTA, to  provide the class money to buy the necessary parts and selecting the  students that would receive these vehicles, the students in Gilford  High School's, introduction to engineering class got to work.   The GoBabyGo! project was the students' final engineering assignment,  and to successfully build these mobility devices, the students used  everything that they had learned about the engineering design process.   First, the students visited with the three children, preschoolers  George and Morgan, and first-grader Chloe, to take their measurements  and determine how to best modify the Power Wheels to fit the specific  needs of the children. For instance, the students noted that Chloe's  left hand was weaker than her right, so they knew that they would need  to move the button that accelerates the vehicle to the left side of the  steering wheel, which allows her to accelerate with her weaker hand  while steering with her dominant hand.   The students also modified the headrest using pool noodles and  refitted the hard plastic seats with softer materials with a design  from the popular children's show, ``Paw Patrol.'' Since some of the  children have difficulty using their legs, the students rewired the  pedal functions to the steering wheel, so that the children could  easily start and stop the device with their hands.   After the vehicles were completed, Mr. Caron's class visited the  elementary school to present the children with their new mobility  devices. The Gilford Police and Fire Department helped by bringing the  two vehicles over to the school, which was fitting since the mobility  devices were designed to look like a police car and a fire truck. One  of the students even customized the vehicles with Gilford Elementary  School license plates in the front and New Hampshire plates in the back  with the students' names and made Gilford Fire and Police logos for the  front grills of the trucks.   The students presented the devices to two of the children in front of  almost the entire elementary school. Troy gave a presentation about the  project to the school in the hopes of inspiring more elementary school  students to get interested in the STEAM fields of science, technology,  engineering, art, and mathematics.   I congratulate these students for their ingenuity, hard work, and  compassion. I thank them for demonstrating that, by being inclusive, we  unleash the talent and energy of our friends and peers, strengthen our  communities, and bring joy and dignity to those who have been  marginalized.                            ____________________
