 Madam Speaker, this economic relief package is for small  businesses, finally.   I am proud that we also secured $25 billion to expand testing, with  $11 billion to increase State and local testing capacity; $1 billion  for the CDC, $1.8 billion for the NIH, $1 billion for BARDA, money for  the Food and Drug Administration and money for community health  centers. This is not everything we wanted.   Next, we need relief for States and localities, SNAP benefits, paid  family leave and paid sick days, and the expansion of the Child Tax  Credit. Vote ``yes'' to continue working for people.
