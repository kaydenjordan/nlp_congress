 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 8 weeks ago, the administration sent  Congress an urgent request for humanitarian money for the border. For 8  weeks, we have seen evidence nearly every day that the conditions have  been getting worse. Yet, during all of this time, our Democratic House  colleagues have been unable to produce a clean measure to provide this  humanitarian funding with its having any chance of becoming law.   The proposal they finally passed this week was way to the left of the  mainstream. The President made it clear it would earn a veto, not a  signature. Even so, in an abundance of fairness, the Senate voted on  Speaker Pelosi's effort--poison pill riders and all. It earned just 37  votes. The House proposal earned 37 votes here. Fortunately, we do have  a chance to make  [[Page S4588]]  law this week on a hugely bipartisan basis.   The Senate advanced a clean, simple humanitarian funding bill  yesterday by a huge margin. Thanks to Chairman Shelby and Senator  Leahy, this bipartisan package sailed through the Appropriations  Committee 30 to 1, and it passed the full Senate yesterday--now listen  to this--84 to 8. We sent that clean bill over to the House by a vote  of 84 to 8. The Shelby-Leahy legislation has unified the Appropriations  Committee, and it has unified the Senate. The administration would sign  it into law.   So all that our House colleagues need to do to help the men, women,  and children on the border this week is to pass this unifying  bipartisan bill and send it to the President. For weeks, we have heard  our House Democratic colleagues speaking a lot about the poor  conditions, the overstretched facilities, the insufficient supplies.  Our bill gives them the chance today to actually do something about it.   Now, I understand that instead of moving forward with this bipartisan  bill, the Speaker is signaling she may choose to drag out the process  even more and might persist in some variety of the leftwing demands  that caused the House bill to fail dramatically in the Senate  yesterday. I understand that some of the further changes the House  Democrats are discussing may be unobjectionable things the Trump  administration may be able to help to secure for them administratively.   Yet it is crystal clear that some of these new demands would drag  this bipartisan bill way back to the left and jeopardize the Shelby- Leahy consensus product that unified the Senate and that is so close to  becoming law--this close.   For example, I understand that the House Democrats may ask the  Speaker to insist on--listen to this--cutting the supplemental funding  for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Defense.  In the middle of this historic surge on the border, they want to claw  back some of this badly needed money from the men and women who are  down there on the frontlines. It looks like these cuts would represent  pay cuts to ICE staff, including pay that people have already earned,  and cuts to the money for investigating child trafficking.   Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy have already reached a bipartisan  agreement. Both sides have already compromised. We are standing at the  5-yard line. Yet, apparently, some in the House want to dig back into  that ``abolish ICE'' playbook and throw a far-left partisan wrench into  the whole thing.   Let me be perfectly clear. I am glad the Speaker and the  administration are discussing some of these outstanding issues, but if  the House Democrats send the Senate back some partisan effort to  disrupt our bipartisan progress, we will simply move to table it. The  U.S. Senate is not going to pass a border funding bill that will cut  the money for ICE and the Department of Defense. It is not going to  happen. We already have our compromise. The Shelby-Leahy Senate bill is  the only game in town. It is time to quit playing games. It is time to  make it law.   I urge my colleagues across the Capitol to take up the clean,  bipartisan bill that the Senate passed 84 to 8 and, without any more  unnecessary delays, send it on to President Trump for his signature.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, just last month, I  introduced legislation, along with my colleague from Virginia, Senator  Kaine, to address a serious and growing public health issue. As Senator  Kaine and I laid out in May, the growing popularity and accessibility  of tobacco products like e-cigarettes and vapor products are  endangering America's youth.   The CDC estimates that in 2018 youth e-cigarette use in America  increased by 1.5 million. So we introduced legislation that would  accomplish something very important--raising the minimum age for  purchasing tobacco and vapor products to 21 nationwide. We want to put  a huge dent in these pathways to childhood addiction and help get these  products out of high schools altogether.   Now, as a Virginian and a Kentuckian, neither Senator Kaine nor I  lack an appreciation for the history of tobacco in America. For  generations, this hugely important cash crop helped to build our States  and, indeed, the whole Nation's early prosperity. Yet new doors are  open today to Kentucky's growers and producers, and parents back home  are rightly worried that e-cigarettes and vapor products pose new  threats to the young people at a critical stage in their developments.   So I was proud to take the lead on this, and I am proud my colleague  from Virginia has joined me in leading this effort to give this cause  the strong bipartisan momentum it richly deserves. Our measure cleared  an important milestone yesterday. The HELP Committee approved our  Tobacco-Free Youth Act and advanced it here, to the floor, along with  other legislation.   I thank Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and all of our  colleagues on the committee for including our legislation in this  package and advancing it. I look forward to continuing to work with  them, with Senator Kaine, and with all of our colleagues as we work to  get this important proposal signed into law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter entirely, later  today, the Senate will vote to fulfill a solemn responsibility. For the  59th consecutive year, we will pass the National Defense Authorization  Act. I hope and expect we will do it by a wide, bipartisan margin.   It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this legislation  to the ongoing missions of our Nation's men and women in uniform. The  NDAA is simultaneously a target to guide the modernization of our all- volunteer force; a supply line to restore readiness and keep U.S.  personnel equipped with the most cutting-edge, lethal capabilities; a  promise of critical support services to military families; and a  declaration to both our allies and adversaries of America's strategic  resolve.   This year's bill authorizes the investments that will support all  these bills and a major pay raise for military personnel to boot.   I am especially proud that it supports the ongoing missions of  Kentucky's installations and the many military families who call my  State home.   The NDAA is a product of a robust, bipartisan process that has  consumed our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for weeks.  Nearly 300 amendments were adopted during markup. So today, once again,  I would like to thank Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed for their  leadership throughout this process. They produced legislation that each  Member of this body should be proud of. Particularly in these troubled  times, this is exactly--exactly--the message the Senate needs to send.  I look forward to passing it today.   Passing the NDAA itself is not the only important message the Senate  will send this week on national security. On Friday morning, we will  vote on a badly ill-conceived amendment that would literally make our  Nation less secure and make American servicemembers less safe. I  respect my colleagues, but this amendment from Senator Udall and others  is a half-baked and dangerous measure--about as half-baked and  dangerous as we have seen on the floor in quite some time. It should be  soundly rejected.   We know that our Democratic colleagues have political differences  with President Trump--I think the whole country has gotten that message  pretty loud and clear--but they have chosen a terrible time and a  completely irresponsible manner to express themselves. Rather than work  with the President, who shares the goal of avoiding war with Iran, they  have gratuitously chosen to make him the enemy.   Let me repeat that. Rather than work with the President to deter our  actual enemies, they have chosen to make him the enemy.   At the very moment that Iran has been stepping up its aggression  throughout the Middle East, these Senators are proposing radical new  restrictions on the administration's ability to defend U.S. interests  and our partners.  [[Page S4589]]    The Udall amendment would require the administration to secure  explicit authorization from Congress before our forces would be able to  respond to all kinds of potential Iranian attacks. That would include  attacks on American civilians.   Let me say that again. Some of our colleagues want us to go out of  our way and create a brandnew obstacle that would block the President  from swiftly responding if Iran attacks American civilians, our U.S.  diplomatic facilities, or Israel, or the military forces of an ally or  partner, or if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz. In all of these  scenarios, the Udall amendment would hamstring the executive branch  from reacting quickly. In modern warfare, time is of the essence. The  War Powers Resolution explicitly recognizes the reality that  administrations may need to respond quickly and with flexibility.   This amendment could even constrain our military from acting to  prevent an imminent attack. As written, it appears to suggest they must  absorb the attack, take the attack first before defending themselves.  And even then, for how long would they be allowed to conduct  retaliatory strikes? Completely absurd. Totally dangerous.   Let's take an example. Iran attacks Israel. No timely response from  the United States, especially if Congress happens to be on recess. Iran  attacks American citizens. The President's hands would be tied. This is  never how the American Presidency has worked, for a very good reason.   So I would ask my colleagues to stop obsessing about Donald Trump for  a moment and think about a scenario involving a future or past  President. Hypothetically, then, would it be appropriate for Congress  to tie a President's hands with legislation preventing military action  to defend NATO allies from a Russian attack without explicit  congressional approval? If conflict came in August and the United  States and its NATO allies didn't act decisively, frontline states  could be gobbled up before Congress could even convene to consider an  AUMF.   The Udall amendment would represent a huge departure from the basic  flexibility that Presidents in both parties have always had to take  immediate military steps, short of a full-scale war, to respond to  immediate crises.   This ploy is being advertised as some kind of courageous reassertion  by Congress of our constitutional authority, but it is nothing of the  sort. It is a departure from our constitutional traditions and norms.   Nobody is talking about a full-scale war with Iran--not the  President; not the administration. Heaven forbid, if that situation  were to arrive, consultation with Congress and widespread public  support would, of course, be necessary. The Udall amendment is  something completely different. It defines self-defense in a laughably  narrow way and then in all other situations proposes that President  Trump should be stripped of the basic powers of his office unless  Democrats in Congress write him a permission slip. I don't think so.   This would be a terrible idea at any moment, let alone as Iran is  escalating its violence and searching for any sign of American  weakness.   So I would ask my colleagues: Do not embolden Iran. Do not weaken our  deterrence. Do not undermine our diplomacy. Do not tie the hands of our  military commanders. Reject this dangerous mistake when we vote on the  Udall amendment tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
