 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 12th  Congressional District and the State of Michigan to say to Norfolk  Southern: Don't dump your toxic waste in our State.   Late last Friday, we learned that shipments of solid and liquid toxic  waste from the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio were being  transported to Michigan for disposal.   Norfolk Southern chose to dispose truckloads of hazardous materials  at multiple sites, including one operated by U.S. Ecology, one of our  region's most negligent and notorious corporate polluters. These  companies treat poisoning our communities as the cost of doing  business, and we are done with it.   I am so proud of our residents who spoke up and who helped halt  further shipments into our State. I want to thank every single one of  them from the bottom of my heart for speaking the truth and demanding  better from all of our officials from the State and the Federal EPA.   We will never give permission for corporate polluters to continue  sacrificing the health and well-being of our communities and our  families.   Our environmental regulators State and Federal must aggressively  protect all of us from this threat and hold these polluters  accountable.                                  DTE Energy     Madam Speaker, I rise today to say that DTE Energy, an  investor-owned utility monopoly in my district, charges some of the  highest rates in our Nation while providing some of the most unreliable  service and performs hundreds of thousands of utility shutoffs per  year.   Right now many of my residents are in the seventh day of no power: no  gas, heat, or electricity.   This past week has been yet another nightmare for more than close to  1 million DTE customers as well as 200,000 consumer energy customers in  our State who have endured days on end without power and heat after a  completely foreseeable winter storm.   Why?   Because DTE doesn't invest in reliability. It invests in profits and  pays for shareholders and executives. The company made $1.1 billion in  profits last year alone.   Investor-owned utilities like DTE will always put profits over the  people whom we serve in this Chamber.   During the worst of the pandemic in 2020, Madam Speaker, DTE shut off  power to customers more than 80,000 times despite being subsidized by  our Federal Government to the tune of $268 million in CARES Act  funding.   The reason?   They paid out $807 million to shareholders instead of keeping the  power on for our residents who were struggling through the pandemic.                                time  1015    Since 2015, DTE has received over $775 million in rate hikes, the  second highest rate of increase in our Nation, and they just announced  their intention to seek another massive rate hike.   DTE has failed to invest in the infrastructure upgrades necessary to  prevent outages, instead choosing to maximize profits for its  shareholders and spending millions on campaign contributions to avoid  real accountability.   I am sick and tired of wealthy corporate executives lining their  pockets while our communities suffer and continue to be exploited.   That is why, last year, I introduced the Resolution Recognizing the  Human Rights to Utilities with Representatives Cori Bush and Jamaal  Bowman.   Madam Speaker, access to utilities is not a privilege; it is a  fundamental human right. People depend on it for medical and for  safety, again, in their  [[Page H921]]  own homes. In the richest country on Earth, every single family should  have access to electricity, heat, and water. We need public power for  all.                       Honoring the Life of Eva Alvarez     Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Eva Alvarez, a  community activist who worked to improve the lives of countless  immigrant families across southeast Michigan. Her life was suddenly cut  short this past weekend in a tragic accident.   Eva worked on public policy advocacy for the Michigan Immigrant  Rights Center, one of the State's strongest immigrant empowerment  agencies, where she championed policies to improve the lives of  immigrants, Dreamers, farmworkers, and TSP holders.   She was an incredible leader. Eva will be missed. She is known for  her spirit of hope and optimism, which helped her persevere and remain  steadfast in her work. She could always be counted on to offer a kind  word to uplift others.   Eva's sudden passing will be felt deeply throughout our communities.  Please join me in honoring the life of Ms. Eva Alvarez, and please  extend our condolences to her family as we mourn her loss. May she rest  in power.                            ____________________
