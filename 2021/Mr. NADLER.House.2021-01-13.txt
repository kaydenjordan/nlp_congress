 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 41, I call up  the resolution (H. Res. 24) impeaching Donald John Trump, President of  the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 24         Resolved, That Donald John Trump, President of the United       States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and       that the following article of impeachment be exhibited to the       United States Senate:         Article of impeachment exhibited by the House of       Representatives of the United States of America in the name       of itself and of the people of the United States of America,       against Donald John Trump, President of the United States of       America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment       against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.                    article i: incitement of insurrection          The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives       ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and that the       President ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for,       and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors''. Further, section 3 of the 14th Amendment to       the Constitution prohibits any person who has ``engaged in       insurrection or rebellion against'' the United States from       ``hold[ing] any office . . . under the United States''. In       his conduct while President of the United States--and in       violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute       the office of President of the United States and, to the best       of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the       Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his       constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully       executed--Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and       Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of       the United States, in that:        On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th Amendment to the       Constitution of the United States, the Vice President of the       United States, the House of Representatives, and the Senate       met at the United States Capitol for a Joint Session of       Congress to count the votes of the Electoral College. In the       months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump       repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the       Presidential election results were the product of widespread       fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or       certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the       Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd       at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false       claims that ``we won this election, and we won it by a       landslide''. He also willfully made statements that, in       context, encouraged--and foreseeably resulted in--lawless       action at the Capitol, such as: ``if you don't fight like       hell you're not going to have a country anymore''. Thus       incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had       addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives,       interfere with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty       to certify the results of the 2020 Presidential election,       unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and       killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of       Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel,       and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and       seditious acts.        President Trump's conduct on January 6, 2021, followed his       prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of       the results of the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior       efforts included a phone call on January 2, 2021, during       which President Trump urged the secretary of state of       Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to ``find'' enough votes to       overturn the Georgia Presidential election results and       threatened Secretary Raffensperger if he failed to do so.        In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the       security of the United States and its institutions of       Government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic       system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and       imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed       his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people       of the United States.        Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has       demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national       security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to       remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly       incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. Donald       John Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from       office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of       honor, trust, or profit under the United States.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H. Res. 24.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, we all saw it coming. Months in advance, President  Trump was baselessly and deliberately whipping his supporters into a  frenzy.   Weeks before the riot, he used his bully pulpit to spread lies about  the election. He told his supporters that the results were fraudulent.  He implored them again and again to help him stay in power, and he  convinced them that accepting the outcome of the election posed an  existential threat to their families and their freedoms.   We have a duty to observe, Madam Speaker, that racism played a direct  role in this incitement. The President's violent rhetoric is always at  its most fevered pitch when he is talking about the civil rights and  civic aspirations of Black Americans and other minority communities.   On January 6, at a rally that was large, angry, and widely reported  to be armed, the President's lies and violent rhetoric reached their  crescendo. At that rally, the President took the stage. After  reiterating the falsehood that ``we won this election, and we won it by  a landslide,'' he told the crowd that ``if you don't fight like hell,  you are not going to have a country anymore.'' And then he urged the  mob to ``walk down Pennsylvania Avenue'' to prevent the Congress from  confirming the election of ``an illegitimate President.''   On that day, President Trump unleashed the force of a mob on this,  the people's House. He encouraged that attack with the explicit intent  to disrupt the joint session of Congress, an attack that threatened the  safety of the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the  President pro tempore of the Senate, the next three officers in the  line of succession.   And look at what that violence has wrought: at least six dead,  offices ransacked, the sanctity of our Capitol breached for the first  time in two centuries, our hallways littered with broken glass, the  battle flags of a long dead Confederacy, and the debris we have come to  associate with the Trump campaign.   Madam Speaker, I have faith in the resiliency of our government. We  will bring the rioters to justice. Their accomplices in this House will  be held responsible.   But today we must focus on the gravest threat first: President Trump,  who incited this riot and who remains a grave danger to the Nation.   As we warned the Senate when we tried him for his first impeachment:  ``President Trump has made clear in word and deed that he will persist  in such conduct if he is not removed from power. He poses a continuing  threat to our Nation, to the integrity of our elections, and to our  democratic order. He must not remain in power one moment longer.''   Not one moment longer. The danger is too great. We must impeach.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).
