 Mr. Speaker, today is the 6-month anniversary of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act. And few would have thought that 6 months ago we  would have seen such progress so fast because of tax reform, and the  results are significant: bigger paychecks and employers giving workers  pay raises; we have got faster economic growth; we have got 1 million  new jobs that have now been created since the beginning of the year  already; unemployment is at one of its lowest rates ever, under 4  percent; and we actually now, for the first time in history, have more  job openings than jobseekers.   This is a good thing, with more business investment, record optimism  among small businesses and manufacturers, and consumer confidence  nearly at an all-time high.   Mr. Speaker, tax reform was just the shot in the arm that our economy  needed to put Americans back to work and get our economy back on track.                            ____________________
