 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Con.  Res. 9--Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism''.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 2, 2023, on page H643, in the second column, the  following appeared: Let's end these cynical debates about  socialism and get back to the work our constituents sent us to  Washington to do.  Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Con. Res.--Denouncing  the Horrors of Socialism''.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      It is not a logical response to policies that help Americans i.e.  Social Security.   Republicans don't want to take action to raise wages for workers or  reduce costs of living for Americans.   Instead, they are spending valuable floor time on meaningless  resolutions that will do nothing for the American people with the goal  of dividing Democrats with ``gotcha'' votes.   Let's be clear: no matter how Democrats vote on this resolution,  Republicans will not stop condemning Democrats for being  ``socialists.''   This resolution will not change that.   The Republicans' resolution ends with a resolve clause that denounces  ``socialism in all its forms.''   This is a direct insult to many countries the United States counts  among its allies--including NATO member states Spain, Germany and  Portugal--which are governed by parties or heads of state that identify  as social democratic or socialist.   Many Nordic countries, as well as Canada and New Zealand, have  adopted socialist ideas and policies to various degrees.   The resolution ``opposes the implementation of socialist policies in  the United States of America,'' which Republicans themselves have tied  to the core policy goals of the Democratic Caucus.   This is a bad-faith attempt to smear our agenda and crudely conflate  Western European-style social democracy with antidemocratic,  totalitarian regimes of Stalin and Kim Jong II.   Democrats should not dignify this deeply unserious and blatantly  disingenuous effort and politicalized stunt.   Throughout history, every effort by Democrats to advance a fairer  society for working people has been attacked as ``socialism,'' from the  New Deal to the advent of Medicare.   Libraries, K-12 public education and the Postal Service could also  fit within Republicans' denunciation of ``socialism in all of its  forms,'' and would be painted as ``fundamentally and necessarily  opposed'' to the foundation of the United States according to this  resolution.   Republicans still routinely brand wildly popular policies that  Democrats advance as ``socialism,'' ``collectivism,'' and ``anti- American,'' including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion,  lowering prescription drug prices, expanded Social Security, tax  fairness for the wealthy and large corporations, a $15 minimum wage,  and climate action.   The ``-ism'' that the House should be condemning is  authoritarianism--but Republicans are too busy worshiping at the altar  of Donald Trump, who called for the ``termination'' of the  Constitution, to do that.   This resolution is nothing but a shallow attempt by Republicans to  distract the American people from their own far-right, authoritarian  leanings, complicity in the January 6 insurrection, and coziness with  white supremacy and antisemitism.   Republicans are showing us who they are: by gutting Social Security  and Medicare and protecting billionaire power.   The American people know that the ``threat'' of socialism is not  real. Real threats to America include an insurrection against our  democracy and attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election,  abetted by House Republicans, as well as economic hostage-taking with  the risk of triggering a recession by letting America default on its  financial obligations.    Mr. Speaker, as we begin the month of February that  has been designated to not only educate but to embrace and confirm the  wonderment of America's diversity, as we would in every single  important aspect of American life, and it is from our Native Americans  to our immigrants of the 1800s and 1900s and even today.   African Americans have their own special history, and so it is very  important to rise today to speak specifically about H.R. 40, the  Commission to Study Slavery and Develop Reparation Proposals for  African Americans Act. That legislation should be passed. It should be  an executive order. It connotes the trajectory of the history of those  who fought in every war, who shed their blood for this Nation, but  walked in a second-class citizenship, but yet come today to educate and  to have people embrace the richness of their history so that we can  reconcile and heal.   That is what the Commission to Study Slavery and Develop Reparation  Proposals is. It is about repairing. Added to that is the Emancipation  National Historic Trail, which would create a historic pathway from  Galveston to Houston to talk about the pathway of slaves.   Mr. Speaker, we are one country with many voices. Let us all be  heard.                            ____________________
