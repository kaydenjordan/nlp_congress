 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for the opportunity  to talk about this important legislation.   Millions of Americans experience mental health issues and struggle to  find adequate care. We all agree on that in this Chamber. This is  especially true among our Nation's youth due in large part to the  prolonged school closures championed by the Democrats.   Republicans have continually stressed the mental health toll students  have shouldered because of these school closures. But closures were led  by Democrats in Democrat-run States that were allies with the teachers  unions.   That is why I have also introduced H.R. 787, the Expanding Student  Access to Mental Health Services Act, which would authorize State and  local educational agencies to use student support and academic  enrichment grants to improve mental health services available to  students by allowing funds to be used for identifying and disseminating  best practices for mental health first aid, emergency planning,  coordination of services, and telehealth services.   I would have loved to have introduced this bill as an amendment to  H.R. 7780, but, unfortunately, the Democrats did not allow any  amendments to this legislation on the floor today. Rather than working  in a bipartisan manner to reform our current mental health care  systems, Democrats are pushing a bill that will punish employers for  offering mental health benefits to their employees and incite brash  litigation against benefit plan sponsors.   Let me repeat: Democrats are pushing a bill that will punish  employers for offering mental health benefits to their employees and  incite brash litigation against benefit plan sponsors.   To add insult to injury, H.R. 7780 recklessly spends 275 million  taxpayer dollars under the guise of mental health parity enforcement,  but the Department of Labor hasn't even clarified what mental health  parity means.   So, we are going to pass it and then figure out what it means. We  have heard that before.   How can it be enforced if no one understands what it is? How can we  authorize this funding without vetting how it will be spent?   Additionally, H.R. 7780 prohibits arbitration clauses, class action  waivers, and discretionary clauses from employee benefit plans under  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. In short,  this bill will only benefit trial lawyers and will lead to a reduction  in mental health benefits as employers will have to divert money to pay  attorney's fees.   This is precisely why I tried to submit an amendment to the bill on  the floor today, almost the same amendment I offered during its markup  in the Education and Labor Committee, which the Democrats failed to  pass.   My proposed amendment would have made the Department of Labor's  ability to bring civil action against ERISA plans offering mental  health benefits conditional on the Department issuing additional  guidance on these vague mental health parity requirements. It would  also strike the $275 million in funding that has been allocated to the  Department of Labor. But, again, Democrats blocked our ability to offer  amendments.   Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Democrats  exempt unions from some of the most damaging provisions of the bill.   It is imperative that we address the mental health crisis that is  plaguing our society, but we should do that by ensuring access to  reliable, high-quality, and affordable mental health services.    Mr. Chair, I emphasize it is imperative that we address  the mental health crisis that is plaguing our society. We all agree  here in the House on that. But we should do that by ensuring access to  reliable, high-quality, and affordable mental health services, not by  punishing employers with undue litigation for offering these benefits  to our workers.   I remain committed to finding solutions to combat the mental health  problem in this country, especially for our youth. It is my hope that,  in the future, as my chairman said, House Democrats will work in a  bipartisan manner to address this crisis, rather than bringing damaging  legislation such as H.R. 7780 to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about one of the great  competitions here in our sports and bipartisan competitions in the  House.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about the outcome of this year's  Congressional Ryder Cup, which is a match between the Republican Ryder  Cup team and the Democratic Ryder Cup teams.   I have had the privilege to captain the Republican Ryder Cup team for  the past four competitions. The Ryder Cup--what we do is we raise money  for charities that benefit the game of golf, obviously, First Tee and  the National Links Trust, and we have raised over $2 million in this  effort.   This year, I am pleased to announce that the Republican team was  victorious. We celebrate that, our team here; I thank my team.   But I want to take this moment to talk about the captain of the  Democratic team. He is the best player in the United States Congress,  Number 1. All my best players want to take this guy on because if you  beat   John Yarmuth, you have done something, okay? But he is one of  the finest players in the game.   Of course, John came to Congress in 2007, and when he hit here, he  became captain of the Democratic Ryder Cup team. And I say to the  gentleman, I think y'all won four in a row immediately. But the  gentleman is retiring this year. I thank him for his sportsmanship, his  leadership on this competition, and his dedication to the game that we  all love. Let's give John a round.   But it has been a true honor to compete with the gentleman as  captain. It was a great competition this year. It is great to see  Members of Congress actually come together and compete and talk to each  other and enjoy the day. It was a great day for both teams.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Yarmuth).    We think we are going to change the rules and let former  Members come back and play. I think that would be appropriate.   But anyway, let's give John a big round of applause.    Well, it is election time. You need to recruit golfers.  That is what I do. I say, who are the golfers here on the campaign  trail?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege to represent Augusta, in  the 12th District of Georgia, which is home to the Masters Golf  Tournament.   The Georgia Golf Hall of Fame was founded in Augusta, and among the  very first inductees were Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts, founders of  the Masters.   I rise today to congratulate the newest inductee into the Georgia  Golf Hall of Fame, PGA Master Professional Tommy Brannen.   Tommy has served as our head pro at Augusta Country Club for the past  22 years. In that time, I have come to know Tommy and his family well,  not only through golf, but through our church, club, and community  projects.   There is a quote which Tommy lives by: Whatever you are, be a good  one.   Among his many accomplishments, Tommy has won the State title at  Marietta High School. He was an All-American at Columbus State  University, and in the decades since, he has qualified and played in  multiple PGA professional competitions.   Tommy has already raised nearly $100,000 through an annual golf  tournament benefiting area veterans.   Over the years, Tommy has been many things: A husband, father,  friend, and mentor. In all these things, he has endeavored always to be  a good one.   Congratulations, Tommy, on this momentous and well-deserved  achievement. Well done, my friend.                            ____________________
