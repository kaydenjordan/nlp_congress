 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of a New York City icon, the honorable Albert Vann.   After four decades of service as a progressive New York State and New  York City legislator, Councilmember Albert Vann passed away 1 year ago  today.   His contributions have enshrined him as a multigenerational champion  of equity and justice for those needing it most.   He understood the importance of progress and the fight for justice.  He understood what it meant to challenge the White-male-dominated  political machine of his day. He understood where real power comes  from. It comes from the beloved community.   This led him to becoming the first president of the African American  Teachers Association, the first Black teachers' union in New York  State.   He was a friend, a colleague, a mentor, but most importantly, he set  the standard for what it means to serve your community.   To those who are underprivileged, overlooked, left out, or  marginalized, it is with great honor that I stand as a direct  beneficiary of a great man, Councilmember Albert Vann, a true  trailblazer in New York State politics.                            ____________________
