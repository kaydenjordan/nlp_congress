 Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for yielding.   Whenever our economy is hurting, my congressional district in the  heart of Las Vegas is always among the hardest hit. This time is no  different. The people who work at restaurants in Chinatown, clean hotel  rooms on the strip, and entertain visitors downtown are struggling to  pay rent and feed their children. I want them to know that this  recovery package was put together with them in mind.   The bill will provide direct payments to most Americans, expand  unemployment insurance, and give small businesses increased access to  low-interest loans. It will add more oversight to corporate borrowing,  while helping make sure that southern Nevadans will have a job to  return to when this is over.   The bill will also send more resources to hospitals to make sure that  our heroic healthcare workers on the front lines of this epidemic have  the resources they need. We have all been inspired by the example they  have set in this difficult time.
