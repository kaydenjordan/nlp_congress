 Madam Speaker, 58 years ago this week,  President John F. Kennedy signed an executive order establishing the  United States Peace Corps. Since then, more than 200,000 Americans have  participated in international service opportunities through the Peace  Corps.   International service organizations like the Peace Corps and student  exchange programs operated by the Department of State play an important  role in promoting the image of America around the world. These programs  provide American volunteers with a chance to learn about their host  country's society and values, and, in turn, volunteers share American  culture and values with the people of their host country. This fosters  a great understanding of and strong friendship between our country and  those around the world.   The Peace Corps was created with the strong belief that Americans are  willing to contribute part of their life to the country. President  Kennedy said that we must not merely aim to have an economic advantage  in life, but we must strive for a greater purpose. Madam Speaker, for  58 years, the United States Peace Corps has provided thousands of  Americans with that greater purpose.                            ____________________
