 Mr. Speaker, today is a great day in our Nation as we  live up to our most noble and altruistic ideals.   Today, by passing the American Dream and Promise Act, we will again  reaffirm that we are still a Nation of immigrants.   Today, we follow a great tradition that goes back even before Ellis  Island, when hundreds of thousands of, mainly European, immigrants from  humble, poor beginnings reached our shores in an attempt to better  their lives. They made us a more perfect union, strengthening the  notion that we are still a nation of immigrants.   With H.R. 6, young people and others who are students, teachers,  nurses, caregivers, and members of our Armed Forces will be able to  fully embrace the potential and live the American Dream, reaffirming  that the United States of America is still a nation of immigrants.   No one but two of our colleagues can say otherwise. Whether from red  States or blue States, we all share an immigrant heritage in one way or  another. Some came by force, shackled to their destiny, while others  came fleeing violence, poverty, hunger, or in search of liberty and  religious freedom. So many came to our Nation, and we are still, Mr.  Speaker, a Nation of immigrants.
