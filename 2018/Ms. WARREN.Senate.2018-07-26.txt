 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking Senator Brown  for organizing time for our speeches today and, of course, for his  tireless fight on behalf of working people in this country.   I rise today to join Senator Brown and my other colleagues in  standing with Federal workers in Massachusetts and all around the  country--Federal  [[Page S5417]]  workers who are under attack from all sides by the Trump  administration.   There are nearly 30,000 Federal workers in Massachusetts alone, and  almost a quarter of them are veterans--thousands of men and women who  have put themselves in harm's way to protect us and then come home and  continue serving their communities in the Federal workforce. These  Americans work at agencies like the Social Security Administration, to  help older Americans receive the benefits they have earned, and they  work at the VA, where they help us fulfill the promises that we have  made to our veterans. They help to keep our communities safe, and they  help them recover after a disaster hits. They fight deadly diseases and  work day in and day out to improve the health of our fellow citizens.  Those are just a few examples.   But ever since taking office, President Trump has attacked these  public servants, attacked their paychecks, attacked their working  conditions, and attacked their retirement security in just about every  way he could think of--freezing their pay and proposing draconian cuts  to their wages and their hard-earned retirement benefits.   His latest assault, in the form of three Executive orders, undermines  collective bargaining rights that have protected Federal workers'  voices in their workplaces since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978  passed this Senate 87 to 1. These orders disrupt the bargaining  processes that Federal workers have used for decades, and they  interfere with the ability of unions to represent their members. For  example, one of President Trump's Executive orders severely cuts down  on the time that unions can spend helping their workers navigate the  process for filing a workplace sexual harassment claim or getting  whistleblower protections in order to report fraud and corruption in  the government.   President Trump's attacks on these public servants and their rights  undermine important government services and the rights of all American  workers, and they are part of a clear pattern. Despite his campaign  rhetoric from 2 years ago, the President's track record on standing up  for workers has been absolutely miserable. From the day he nominated  Andrew Puzder, an executive who delighted in mocking and belittling his  own low-wage workers, to run the Labor Department, this administration  has delivered one gut punch after another to American workers.   But that was only the beginning. In the Trump administration, workers  in all sectors and all industries and in all parts of the country are  under repeated attack. President Trump has signed laws, ended  commonsense protections, and nominated anti-union and anti-worker  judges--all of which undermine the rights of American workers in more  ways than I can possibly count.   He has rolled back rules designed to make sure that Federal  contractors don't cheat their workers out of hard-earned wages. He has  delayed safety standards that keep workers from being exposed to lethal  carcinogenic materials, and he has made it easier for employers to hide  injuries and deaths that their workers suffer on the job.   He has opened the door for shady financial advisers to cheat hard- working Americans out of billions of dollars in retirement savings.   He has put anti-worker corporate attorneys on the National Labor  Relations Board, which has now mowed its way through a giant wish list  of areas where giant companies were begging to be left off the hook for  violating workers' rights.   For the Supreme Court, he nominated Neil Gorsuch, a union-busting  judge who was the deciding vote in the 5-to-4 Janus case, which was  also an attack on public servants, nurses, teachers, firefighters, and  police--the culmination of a years-long campaign by rightwing  billionaires to damage unions.   The list goes on. After a year and a half of corporate tax cuts and  rolling back commonsense protections for workplace safety, collective  bargaining, retirement security, and more, we know that President  Trump's promises to fight for American workers aren't really worth much  of anything.   Like all of the attacks on working families that we have seen from  this administration, President Trump's rolling back the rights of  Federal workers will lower wages, worsen conditions, hurt retirement  security, and squeeze middle-class families all around the country even  tighter than before. But that is not all. By attacking the Federal  workforce, President Trump is making it harder for them to do their  jobs. That means he is undermining services that our seniors, our  veterans, and Americans from all backgrounds rely on every single day.   In Massachusetts and here in Washington, Federal workers are saying:  Enough is enough. So they are joining together, standing up, speaking  out, and they are refusing to back down. Like so many Americans, I am  grateful for their service to our country and to our communities, and I  am proud to stand and fight shoulder to shoulder with these dedicated  public servants, with their families, and with their communities all  around the country. I am proud to stand with them. Powerful interests  have been trying to break the backs of working people and their unions  for decades, but we are here to say: We are not going away. We are  going to fight, and we are going to win.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
