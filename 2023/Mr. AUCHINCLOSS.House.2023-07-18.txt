 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding and  for convening this critically important Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the plague of gun violence in  our country.   I was asked recently whether January 6, 2021, was my worst day in  Congress, and I answered truthfully that no, it wasn't, actually. My  worst day in Congress was the night of the Uvalde shooting when I  tucked my children into bed knowing that families in Texas would never  get to do the same again, when at that very moment, they were  identifying them by their shoes.   I am sad to say that since then, my Republican colleagues have  continued to bow to the will of the gun lobby instead of listening to  families across the country who are begging for action.   This uniquely American suffering is a policy choice. It doesn't have  to be this way. We know what we need to do to fix it. We need to pass  the assault weapons ban. I slept, ate, trained, and patrolled with an  assault weapon for 4 years as a marine officer.   Weapons of war have no place on our streets or near our schools. We  also need to adopt commonsense gun safety measures like universal  background checks, red flag laws, safe storage requirements, and  evidence-driven violence intervention policies. All of these are  supported by a supermajority of Americans and, indeed, by a majority of  gun owners.   My home State of Massachusetts is a good example of how strong, sound  policy can save lives. Research suggests  [[Page H3689]]  that if our State's gun safety legislation were adopted nationwide,  tens of thousands of children could be saved every year. Congress would  do well to follow that lead.                                time  1900    It is time for Republicans in Congress to find a backbone, stand up  to the gun lobby and NRA, and work with Democrats to keep our  communities safe.   We cannot continue to allow our schools, our places of worship, and  our grocery stores to become scenes of terror because of a lack of  political courage.
