 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution  to recognize September as Workforce Development Month.   As technological advances reshape traditional fields and fuel the  emergence of new industries, it is imperative that our workforce  development system remain agile and flexible in order to educate and  train the next generation of workers and those needing additional on- the-job training skills to stay competitive.   In addition, it is vital that we recognize the importance of all  career pathways and professional development whether an individual  pursues a 4-year degree or seeks to further their education at a  community college, through an industry recognized certificate program,  or as an apprentice.   In an effort to face this challenge head on, Congress passed the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in 2014 with overwhelming  bipartisan support. WIOA was signed into law by President Obama and has  helped streamline the workforce development system while increasing and  strengthening partnerships between regional businesses, workforce  development boards, and educational institutions.   In fact, it is these partnerships that have proven to be key to  regional success at addressing the workforce needs of businesses. By  working together, local businesses and educators can ensure that not  only do businesses have access to the talent they need to grow but that  those seeking work can find it.   Nationwide, the more than 550 workforce development boards and 2,500  American Job Centers have become a driving force behind growing  regional economies by providing training, resources, and assistance to  workers aiming to compete in the 21st century economy.   These workforce development boards and American Job Centers work with  job seekers and employers across industries ranging from healthcare and  information technology to manufacturing and construction.   There are currently nearly half a million registered apprentices  across the country, including nearly fifty thousand in California  alone.   Bipartisan support for earn-and-learn approaches such as  apprenticeships and paid internships is critical for helping future  workers gain the skills and experience they need while being able to  provide for themselves and their families.   In recognition of workforce development month, Congress reaffirms its  support for a comprehensive approach to workforce development,  encourages partnerships between industry leaders and educators, and  emphasizes the importance of all career pathways in pursuit of economic  prosperity.   In closing, during this month it is essential that we acknowledge and  commend the professionals who work every day to make these efforts a  reality. America's workforce is the backbone of our economy and it is  the expertise, dedication, and knowledge of these professionals that  has helped develop such a robust system.  [[Page S5889]]    Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  resolution and encouraging the continued growth of our workforce  development system.                            ____________________
