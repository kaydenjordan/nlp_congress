 Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of  Stephen Vaden to be the next General Counsel of the U.S. Department of  Agriculture. I know this is a position that you care about deeply as  the Presiding Officer. Having been brought up and worked on a family  farm that has operated for generations in West Tennessee, Stephen has  critical insights into the issues facing the agriculture community. His  experience in law and understanding the needs of farmers will be an  important asset at the USDA and in Congress's work to help rural  America prosper and grow.   Under Stephen's tenure as Acting General Counsel since March of last  year, the Office of General Counsel has promoted Department  accountability and improved its responsiveness to civil rights issues,  and it is my belief that Stephen will continue to do so once confirmed.   I am pleased to see that the Senate is acting on Stephen's  nomination, and I urge my colleagues to support his confirmation.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The       estimated value is $320.5 million.        This proposed sale supports the foreign policy and national       security of the United States by increasing the flexibility       of Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece,       Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain       and the United Kingdom--twelve NATO nations and one       Partnership for Peace nation--to contribute to overseas       contingency operations. This sale increases the quantity of       precision-guided munitions within NATO and allows for their       pre-coordinated transfer in support of national and NATO       requirements.        The proposed sale improves NATO's capability to meet       current and future ground threats with precision. NATO will       use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional       threats, and to increase interoperability within contingency       operations. Many of the purchasing nations already have       precision-guided munitions in their inventories; and they       will all have no difficulty absorbing these kits.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractors for production are the Boeing       Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri, and Raytheon Missile       Systems of Tucson, Arizona. The principle contractor for       integration is unknown and will be determined during contract       negotiations. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to NATO.        There is no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a       result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 18-39       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a Joint Service       weapon that uses an onboard GPS-aided Inertial Navigation       System (INS) Guidance Set with a MK 82, MK 83, MK 84, BLU-      109, BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-117, BLU-126 (Navy) or BLU-129       warhead. The Guidance Set, when combined with a warhead and       appropriate fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU). The       JDAM Guidance Set gives these bombs adverse weather       capability with improved accuracy. The JDAM weapon can be       delivered from modest standoff ranges at high or low       altitudes against a variety of land and surface targets       during the day or night. After release, JDAM autonomously       guides to a target, using the resident GPS-aided INS guidance       system. JDAM is capable of receiving target coordinates via       preplanned mission data from the delivery aircraft, by       onboard aircraft sensors (i.e. FLIR, Radar, etc) during       captive carry, or from a third party source via manual or       automated aircrew cockpit entry. The KMU-556 F/B, KMU-557 F/B       are the tail kits for the GBU-31, the KMU-572 is the tail kit       for the GBU-38. The JDAM as an All Up Round is UNCLASSIFIED;       technical data for JDAM is classified up to SECRET.        2. Detector Sensor Unit (DSU)-38A/B is a laser-illuminated       target detector that adds a Precision Laser Guidance Set       (PLGS) to inventory JDAMs, giving the weapon system optional       semi-active laser guidance in addition to its other GPS/INS       guidance modes. The DSU-38A/B is a DSU-33 (proximity fuze)       form-factored passive laser seeker that can be easily       installed in the field to the front of existing JDAM weapons       and is connected to the Guidance Set via an externally       mounted strap-on harness kit. The DSU-38 provides an       additional capability to engage mobile targets moving up to       70 mph. The addition of the DSU-38 Laser sensor combined with       additional cabling and mounting hardware turns a standard       GBU-38 JDAM into a GBU-54 Laser JDAM. The DSU-38 hardware is       UNCLASSIFIED; technical data and other documentation are       classified up to SECRET.        3. Enhanced Paveway II (EPII), a Laser Guided Bomb (LGB),       is a maneuverable, free-fall weapon that guides to a spot of       laser energy reflected off of the target. The ``enhanced''       component is the addition of GPS guidance to the laser       seeker. This dual-mode allows the weapon to operate in all-      weather conditions. The LGB is delivered like a normal       general purpose (GP) warhead and the semi-active guidance       corrects for many of the normal errors inherent in any       delivery system. Laser designation for the LGB can  [[Page S7080]]       be provided by a variety of laser target markers or       designators. An LGB consists of an Enhanced Computer Control       Group (ECCG) that is not warhead-specific, and a warhead-      specific Air Foil Group (AFG) that attaches to the nose and       tail of a GP bomb body. The EPII can use either the FMU-152       or FMU-139 fuze. The overall weapon is classified       CONFIDENTIAL.        GBU-48 is a 1,0001b (MK-84 or BLU-117 B/B) GP bomb body       fitted with the MXU-667 AFG, and MAU-210 F/B ECCG to guide to       its laser-designated target.        GBU-49 is a 500 lbs (MK-82 or BLU-111 BB) GP bomb body       fitted with the MXU-650 AFG, and MAU-210 F/B ECCGs to guide       to its laser-designated target.        4. Paveway II (PWII), a Laser Guided Bomb (LGB), is a       maneuverable, free-fall weapon that guides to a spot of laser       energy reflected off of the target. The LGB is delivered like       a normal general purpose (GP) warhead and the semi-active       guidance corrects for many of the normal errors inherent in       any delivery system. Laser designation for the LGB can be       provided by a variety of laser target markers or designators.       A LGB consists of a MAU-209 C/B or MAU-169 L/B Computer       Control Group (CCG) that is not warhead-specific, and a       warhead-specific Air Foil Group (AFG) that attaches to the       nose and tail of a General Purpose bomb body. The PWII can       use either the FMU-152 or FMU-139 fuze. The overall weapon is       classified CONFIDENTIAL.        GBU-12 is a 5001bs (MK-82 or BLU-111 B/B) GP bomb body       fitted with the MXU-650 AFG, and MAU-209 C/B or MAU-169 L/B       CCGs to guide to its laser designated target.        5. Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) FMU-152 is a Multi-Delay,       Multi-Arm and Proximity Sensor Compatible with General       Purpose Blast, Frag and Hardened-Target Penetrator Warheads.       It is cockpit selectable in-flight (prior to release) when       used with JDAM weapons. It can interface with the following       weapons: GBU-10, GBU-12, GBU-15, GBU-16, GBU-24, GBU-27, GBU-      28, GBU-31, GBU-32, GBU-38, and AGM-130. The JPF hardware is       UNCLASSIFIED.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtained       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures which       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that NSPA and the       participating countries can provide substantially the same       degree of protection for the sensitive technology being       released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in       furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security       objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       NATO Support and Procurement Agency, Belgium, Czech Republic,       Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands,       Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.                                   ____                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

Also included are containers, weapon support and       support equipment, spare and repair parts, U.S. Government       and contractor engineering, technical and logistical support       services, and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The total estimated program cost is $63       million.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security of the United States. Japan is one of       the major political and economic powers in East Asia and the       Western Pacific and is a key partner of the United States in       ensuring peace and stability in that region. It is vital to       U.S. national interests to assist Japan in developing and       maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability.        The proposed sale of these missiles will provide Japan a       critical air defense capability to assist in defending the       Japanese homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there. Japan       will have no difficulty absorbing these additional missiles       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems       of Tucson, Arizona.        There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be       defined in negotiations between the Purchaser and the prime       contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of additional U.S. Government or contractor       personnel in Japan.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 18-45       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120C-7 Advance Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMRAAM) is a radar guided missile featuring digital       technology and micro-miniature solid-state electronics.       AMRAAM capabilities include look-down/shoot-down, multiple       launches against multiple targets, resistance to electronic       countermeasures, and interception of high flying, low flying,       and maneuvering targets. The AMRAAM All Up Round is       classified CONFIDENTIAL. The major components and subsystems       are classified from UNCLASSIFIED to CONFIDENTIAL, and       technology data and other documentation are classified up to       SECRET.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary obtained       knowledge of the specific hardware or software in the       proposed sale, the information could be used to develop       counter-measures which might reduce weapons system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Japan can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Japan.                            ____________________
