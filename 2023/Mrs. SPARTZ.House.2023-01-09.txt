 Mr. Speaker, I will clarify what exactly this bill is  doing. Last year, Congress gave an additional $80 billion to the IRS on  top of $12 billion of existing funding, which increased the IRS' budget  by almost eight times.   This bill still keeps almost $10 billion in additional funding to  modernize IRS, which is still almost doubling their $12 billion budget  but eliminates over $70 billion of wasteful and egregious aggression  against the American taxpayer by the Federal Government.   As someone who spent over a decade in public accounting and also  started my own businesses, I never felt that we didn't have enough  government. On the contrary.   I hear the same message when I go all across my district--small  businesses and entrepreneurs have a hard time surviving.   I hope my Democrat colleagues will also support this commonsense  adjustment to relieve the undue burden on American families.
