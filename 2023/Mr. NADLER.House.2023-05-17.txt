 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, Federal regulations for the management of Federal property  currently prohibit an agency from disposing of functional or repairable  firearms by selling them. Under these regulations, when an agency no  longer has a need for a firearm, it can transfer it to another law  enforcement entity or destroy it.   This regulation has served the important goal of ensuring that  federally owned firearms do not fall into the wrong hands, but it also  misses an opportunity to save money by selling an unneeded firearm to  the law enforcement officer who has been using it.   Last Congress, our colleague and former Orlando Police chief  Congresswoman Val Demings recognized the opportunity for improvement in  these regulations. She introduced the original version of this  legislation, which allows a Federal agency to sell a retired handgun to  the law enforcement officer who had been using it, transferring it from  a service weapon to a weapon in the hands of a responsible gun owner  who is trained to use it.   Congresswoman Demings' legislation included two improvements that,  unfortunately, have been removed from the current version of the bill.    Her version required the law enforcement officer who was purchasing  the gun to undergo a background check. This is a commonsense  requirement, given that an officer would undergo a standard background  check to purchase the weapon from any other sellers.   Most background checks are practically instantaneous, often about 30  seconds. I do not think that 30 seconds is too long to wait to ensure  that a gun does not fall into the wrong hands.   While I think it is notable that the majority stripped this  reasonable and effortless requirement, the current version of the bill  does require a purchasing officer to be in good standing.   While this is not as thorough as Congresswoman Demings' legislation,  the good-standing requirement should prevent unlawful transfers in most  cases.   Ms. Demings' bill also included a sense of Congress that the funds  received by the government from selling a retired service weapon should  be used to support evidence-based gun violence prevention or gun safety  education and  [[Page H2390]]  training programs. Again, this is a thoughtful provision that would  have directed these funds toward a critical need in our communities and  would have improved public safety.   This provision should be totally noncontroversial, but our Republican  colleagues have stripped it from the bill. The only logical conclusion  is that they do not want a single additional dollar to go to gun  violence prevention, even as it continues to tear our communities apart  and imperil the lives of law enforcement officers.   While I wish the majority had left Congresswoman Demings' bill  intact, I nonetheless support this weakened version of her work.   I want to make it very clear that if any of the Republican poison  pill amendments pass, I will have to encourage my colleagues to vote  ``no.''   The base text of this bill allows limited transfers of handguns to  active Federal law enforcement officers in good standing for fair  market value. The amendments subvert this purpose by allowing those who  are not active law enforcement to purchase a weapon without a  background check, allowing the government to sell military-style  assault weapons without a background check and forcing taxpayers to  subsidize these gun sales by selling them below their fair market  value.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge all Members to oppose these amendments.   I note, however, that I support Ms. Jacobs' very helpful amendment to  further define the good-standing requirement and help ensure that  retired weapons are only transferred to those who can be trusted with  them.   This bill had bipartisan support in committee, so it is unfortunate  that the majority would rather politicize National Police Week with a  radical gun agenda than pass a reasonable bipartisan bill.   If the poison pill amendments fail, I will continue to support the  bill. If any of them pass, I must urge my colleagues to oppose this  legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this legislation improves government efficiency by  allowing a Federal agency to sell a retired handgun to the law  enforcement officer who had been using it. This was a good idea when it  was introduced last Congress on a bipartisan basis by former  Congresswoman Val Demings, and it continues to be one.   I am disappointed that Republicans have chosen to move forward with a  weaker version of her bill. Nonetheless, I support its passage unless  it is further weakened by the Republican poison pill amendments I  referred to in my opening statement.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, when Congresswoman Demings introduced her  superior version of this legislation last Congress, it would require  the law enforcement officer who is purchasing the gun to undergo a  background check. This is a commonsense requirement, given that an  officer would undergo a standard background check to purchase the  weapon from any other sellers.   My colleagues submitted amendments that would add this background  check requirement back in. It is unfortunate that that strong and  reasonable amendment was not made in order.   This amendment, the Jacobs amendment, does the next best thing. It  would further define the good-standing requirement and help ensure that  retired weapons are only transferred to those who can be trusted with  them.   This amendment will help close the gap between what a NICS check  would reveal and what an employing Federal law enforcement agency would  find in making a determination that an officer is in good standing.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, when Congresswoman Demings introduced a superior version  of this legislation last Congress, it was premised on the principle of  making the most of taxpayer dollars and recouping the values of weapons  that were not at the end of their usable life.   This amendment would require these weapons not at the end of their  usable life to be sold at their salvage value, which by its terms, is  below the fair market value of these weapons. This prevents the agency  from recouping the full value of the weapon.   The effect of this amendment is to sell firearms at a discount funded  by taxpayers. Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize gun sales,  which is contrary to the intended purpose of this bill that was  introduced last Congress and is also contrary to the intent of the bill  in the form it unanimously passed in the Judiciary Committee.   Taxpayers should be funding the government, not subsidizing gun  sales. This amendment is contrary to the intent of the bill, and I urge  my colleagues to vote against the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think the gentleman misunderstands the bill.  This bill is not when the officer retires. It is when the gun is  retired. When the gun is retired, perhaps because the law enforcement  agency is upgrading to a more modern gun, it can be sold, and the money  goes to the taxpayers, obviously. If it is not repairable, it can then  be scrapped.   This amendment would say that it can't be done. It would say that you  could not recover the full market value of the weapon, and there is no  reason the taxpayers shouldn't recover that.   The amendment is an antitaxpayer amendment. It is not for the officer  when he retires. It is when the weapon is retired, which may be before  or long after the officer retires. It has nothing to do with that. So  the amendment would simply cost the taxpayers money for no purpose at  all, and I, therefore, oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, when Congresswoman Demings introduced her superior version  of this legislation last Congress, it required the law enforcement  officer who was purchasing the gun to undergo a background check. This  is a commonsense requirement, given that an officer would undergo a  standard background check to purchase the weapon from many other  sellers.   My colleagues submitted amendments that would add this background  check requirement back in. It is unfortunate that that strong and  reasonable amendment was not made in order.   The bill as passed in committee allows sales only to officers in good  standing.   This amendment allows retired Federal law enforcement officers to  also be eligible to purchase surplus service weapons without the usual  NICS background check or a certification of good standing.   This amendment is contrary to existing law and could allow prohibited  purchasers to buy a handgun. Retired officers have no standing with an  agency. They are not subject to any of the oversight and employment  rules of active Federal law enforcement.   With this amendment, someone could retire, be convicted of a felony,  and then purchase a handgun from the Federal Government, even though  they would fail a NICS check because a NICS check is not required.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, a police officer can retire for many reasons.  One of them is that he is being forced out for misconduct. An officer  who is forced out for misconduct should not be permitted to buy a gun  without a background check. The background check might show the  misconduct--would show the misconduct that forced them out. If he  committed a felony, it would show that.   Under this amendment, a retired officer who was pushed out because of  bad conduct, who was pushed out because he could not be trusted with a  handgun, who subsequently commits a felony could still purchase a  handgun without a background check. That is dangerous to the public and  makes no sense at all.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman is mistaken. There is a  difference between the officer and the gun. The gun is being retired.  The officer may have committed a felony--the ex-officer, I should say,  may have committed a felony, may have been forced out for bad conduct,  and under this amendment would be permitted to purchase the gun without  a background check that would show his felony or whatever conduct  caused him to be pushed out. It is dangerous.   We are not talking about an officer upon retirement buying his gun.  We are talking about an ex-officer who may have committed a felony, who  may have been forced out for dangerous conduct now being permitted to  purchase a gun without a background check that would show that this is  a dangerous character.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment expands the types of weapons  officers are allowed to purchase to include all retired firearms. The  amendment radically extends the bill and runs counter to its original  purpose.   This amendment would allow semiautomatic assault weapons, sniper  rifles, and military-grade weaponry to be purchased without a  background check. While Federal law enforcement has a need for these  weapons, they have no place in our communities.   Though the amendment excludes machine guns, it does not exclude other  firearms subject to heightened regulation under the National Firearms  Act, such as short-barreled rifles and even grenade launchers. The  Federal Government should not be selling these dangerous weapons to  people operating in their civilian capacity.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to oppose it, as well.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the provision that the gentleman refers to  refers only to machine guns. It does not exclude other firearms, as I  mentioned, such as short-barreled rifles and even grenade launchers,  and these are too dangerous.   We should not be selling these dangerous weapons to people operating  in their civilian capacity. That is why this amendment is dangerous and  radically changes the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, section 5845, definitions, reads as  follows: ``(a) Firearm, the term `firearm' means (1) a shotgun having a  barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; (2) a weapon made  from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less  than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length;  (3) a rifle having a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in  length; (4) a weapon made from a rifle if such weapon as modified has  an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less  than 16 inches in length; (5) any other weapon, as defined in  subsection (e); (6) a machine gun''--which is the only thing the  gentleman excludes from his amendment--``(7) any silencer (as defined .  . . ); and (8) a destructive device,'' like a grenade launcher, like a  grenade.   Therefore, when I say that this amendment would ban only machine guns  but would permit all these other things, including grenades and weapons  of destruction, it is right here in the statute. The gentleman's  amendment would permit all of these. Those are the kinds of weapons.   Grenade launchers and short-barreled rifles should not be in the  possession of civilians, even retired police officers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, let's be clear: Assaulting a law enforcement officer is  a serious offense and cannot be tolerated in the United States. It is  also largely already a deportable offense.                                time  1315     If this bill, the so-called Protect Our Law Enforcement  with Immigration Control and Enforcement Act, or the POLICE Act of  2023, closed an actual gap in current law and made our country safer,  Democrats would gladly support it.   Unfortunately, this bill represents another unserious attempt by my  Republican colleagues to target and scapegoat immigrants and to score  cheap, political points for National Police Week while doing nothing to  actually protect law enforcement officers.   It is important to remember who this legislation is targeting. This  is not about undocumented immigrants who are, of course, already  removable, and this is not about people who are seeking to enter the  United States. This is about people who have come here the so-called  ``right way.'' We are talking about lawful, permanent residents.   People have put down roots in our communities, many of whom have U.S.  citizen spouses and children and have truly established themselves here  in the United States. Many of these individuals are eligible to become  U.S. citizens today, but this bill would make them deportable without  even requiring that they be convicted of a crime, only that the assault  or act constituting the assault was committed and that the individual  admits to the commission of the act.   That throws our whole notion of due process on its head. That is why  it is absolutely critical that we adopt Mr. Correa's amendment to close  this dangerous loophole. Even if we require a conviction, I am still  concerned that the bill is so broad and overinclusive that it could  lead to truly absurd results and to the deportation of people who had  no intention of ever harming a law enforcement officer.   Let me give you three examples of what this bill would do, as  drafted:   A person walks into a fire, sees a beam about to fall on a  firefighter, and pushes the firefighter out of the way. He has  committed an act that is an assault on the firefighter who is a peace  officer, and he is deportable.   A person sees two men fighting on the street and he breaks them up.  He pushes them aside, not knowing that one of them is an undercover  police officer. He has assaulted the police officer.   A Jehovah's Witness is in an ambulance. The EMT reaches over to put a  line in to give him a transfusion. The Jehovah's Witness pushes his  hand away. He has committed assault on the EMT who is a peace officer  and he is, therefore, deportable.   Now, Republicans will say that these are far-fetched, absurd  examples. The problem is that under the terms of the bill, this would  happen. However far-fetched you may think the example, you have to read  the bill.   Mr. Correa's amendment would correct this. If Mr. Correa's amendment  passes, we can support the bill. If it does not, this is a dangerous  bill making lawful permanent residents who have been here for many  years deportable for no good reasons.   For years, we have had a bipartisan understanding that individuals  should be deported only for a serious offense, but this bill breaks  down that understanding. I hope we will fix the bill's most significant  flaw through the amendment process, namely, the  [[Page H2396]]  Correa amendment. If not, I must recommend that my colleagues oppose  this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman from New York referenced our  District Attorney Alvin Bragg. As a resident of Manhattan, I must say  that I find Alvin Bragg a perfectly fine district attorney, and he is  being attacked only because he has secured indictments on 34 counts  against Donald Trump, and that is why they are holding him up for  criticism.   I am very glad that I supported him in the Democratic primary against  a number of opponents 2 years ago, and he is doing a fine job,  including the 34 indictments he secured against former President Trump,  who it appears is also going to be indicted in Washington and in  Georgia.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal)    I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Casar).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this bill would make someone deportable if they assault a  law enforcement officer, a fact that is already largely the case, as it  should be. This bill would make it a deportable offense for a legal,  permanent resident to merely perform the acts that could be described  as a felony.   That, as I said before, leads to absurd results. The gentleman may  say that that is not the intended result and that wouldn't happen, but  you have to read the statute as it reads.   These absurd results that I mentioned before--I am not going to  repeat them now--would be real unless the Correa amendment is adopted.  Then it would solve the infirmities of the bill and we could recommend  passage. If that doesn't happen, we cannot.   Mr. Chair, I hope we will fix this bill's most glaring flaw by  requiring  [[Page H2399]]  that a person actually be convicted of assault before they are rendered  deportable--that is the Correa amendment. If not, I urge all Members to  oppose this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Boebert amendment requires the Department of  Homeland Security to make publicly available on its website an annual  report on the number of noncitizens deported for assaulting a law  enforcement officer.   It is important for us to take a step back and remember what this  bill is all about. This bill is attempting to add a new avenue for  people who are living here lawfully in the United States to be  deported.   By and large, we are talking about the ability to deport lawful  permanent residents, people with green cards. These are people who my  Republican colleagues like to say have done things the so-called  ``right way.'' I sincerely hope that this report would not be used to  further demonize immigrants.   However, on its face, I do not find this amendment to be  objectionable.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mr. Correa's  amendment.   Any conviction requirement would greatly improve this bill. No one in  this caucus condones serious assaults against law enforcement officers.  As written, however, this bill goes well beyond serious offenses to  include minor offenses and even actions for which an individual is  never charged or convicted.   That is right. Under this bill, a conviction is not required. This  will lead to bizarre consequences in which someone who had no intent of  harming a law enforcement officer but nevertheless committed an act  that constituted assault would be deemed deportable.   Mr. Chairman, remember the three examples I gave before: pushing a  fireman out of the way of a falling beam. That would make the person  deportable under this bill.    It is important to remember that convictions for serious assaults on  law enforcement are already offenses that make someone deportable under  current law. In fact, we have a wide variety of criminal grounds for  deportation, nearly all of which require a conviction. That is why  adding a requirement that an individual be convicted of assaulting a  law enforcement officer to become deportable would significantly  improve the bill.   However, it would not fix all the issues associated with this bill.  For example, the bill does not require an intent to cause harm or any  physical injury which would sweep in very low-level offenses.   Since the bill only impacts people who are here legally, the prospect  of deporting longtime members of our communities for very minor  offenses is deeply concerning, but the bill would be improved by this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
