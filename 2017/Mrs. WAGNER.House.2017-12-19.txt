 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his support  and for yielding me this time.   I am proud to rise today in support of my colleague, Chairman Blaine  Luetkemeyer, and urge immediate passage of his bill, the Systemic Risk  Designation Improvement Act of 2017.   H.R. 3312 uses a commonsense approach which would allow regulators  the opportunity to weigh multiple factors before deeming a financial  institution systemically important.   More importantly, the bill would allow the Financial Stability  Oversight Council, FSOC, to more precisely identify systemic risk by  differentiating between stable activities and those that would truly  threaten the financial stability of the United States.   Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve was given never-before- seen regulatory power to supervise those that were deemed systemically  important. Unfortunately, the Fed has chosen to ignore tailoring their  regulatory standards and continues to base them on asset size alone.   If an institution, indeed, is a minimal risk, then it is vital to  make sure those standards reflect that lower risk.   Finally, it is important to note that an arbitrary threshold does  matter to those caught in the SIFI web. These financial institutions  often face significant compliance costs under a SIFI designation,  redirecting resources that otherwise would provide consumers with  affordable financial products.   Chairman Luetkemeyer's bill creates a framework that promotes  responsible regulations and enforces market discipline, all while  protecting taxpayers from unnecessary bailouts.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to applaud my friend, the gentleman from  Missouri, Chairman Luetkemeyer, for his leadership on this issue. H.R.  3312 is about smarter regulation. I urge all my colleagues to support  Chairman Luetkemeyer's bill.
