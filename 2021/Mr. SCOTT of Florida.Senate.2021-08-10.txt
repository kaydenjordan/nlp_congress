 Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3383  and ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, earlier this year, we saw  Hamas rockets rain down on Israel for 11 straight days. Children, like  5-year-old Ido Avigal, died in these attacks.   Following these attacks on Israel, President Biden's State Department  said it couldn't guarantee that funding wouldn't go to Hamas. That is  unacceptable.   We have seen horrible anti-Israel sentiment permeate the Halls of  Congress. But we cannot, and I will not, accept the ignorance of some  of my colleagues to the evil and devastation Hamas terrorists bring to  Israel.   My amendment will ensure that any money authorized to the territory  of Gaza will not end up in the hands of Hamas terrorists and allows for  further sanctions against these terrorist groups.   This amendment is a commonsense way to protect American tax dollars,  stand with our great ally Israel, and to continue our fight against the  evils of Hamas terrorism.   I hope all of my colleagues will vote for this amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the first responders and community  members who responded to the horrific tragedy in Surfside, FL, on June  24, 2021, when the Champlain Towers South condo building suddenly  collapsed in the middle of the night.   Our Jewish Community, particularly Orthodox Jews, have been  especially affected by this tragedy. We are incredibly grateful to  Chesed Shel Emes for immediately rushing in to respond following the  building collapse. They swiftly heeded the call of duty to aid in  rescue and recovery efforts. In the face of tremendous tragedy, they  ran into danger. They are heroes, and we can never thank them enough  for their bravery and determination in the face of this terrible  tragedy.   I would also like to thank Rabbi Mark Rosenberg, who serves as  director of Chesed Shel Emes, and all of those who worked selflessly to  support our Jewish community and provide comfort during this time of  need.   Chesed Shel Emes did everything possible to make sure that search,  rescue, and recovery efforts upheld Jewish law. Chesed Shel Emes worked  tirelessly and relentlessly, offering resources, support, and comfort  to the survivors and community in Surfside and to make sure that the  needs of the Jewish community were met. This work was critical in  helping to bring comfort to families who lost relatives, giving them  faith that their loved ones were being cared for appropriately and  respectfully.   The pain these families are experiencing is unimaginable, and Chesed  Shel Emes was there every step of the way to make ensure the Jewish  community's beliefs and faith were honored. They exemplify true loving  kindness in both words and actions.   Chesed Shel Emes provided strength amidst tragedy. The community  leaned on them to advocate for their needs and to be their voice. They  helped every person who turned to them. They worked diligently,  sensitively, and efficiently to help mourners cope with the unknown and  provide assistance and guidance. Ann and I continue to pray for the  Surfside community, our Jewish community, the families and loved ones  of the lost, and all of those who worked tirelessly to serve the  Surfside community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the individuals who responded to the  building collapse in Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021.   I want to thank the FL-1 Urban Search and Rescue Task Force--FL-TF1-- for responding when the Champlain Towers South condo building in  Surfside, FL, suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night. They  swiftly heeded the call of duty to provide search, rescue, and recovery  efforts following the collapse. In the face of tremendous tragedy, they  ran into danger. They are heroes.   FL-TF1 is one of 28 Federal search and rescue task forces overseen by  FEMA, and its capabilities include search and rescue, emergency care,  engineering expertise, and logistics. When they are not being  dispatched to countries in crisis, many of them work for Miami-Dade  Fire Rescue as local firefighters.   FL-TF1 has responded to some of the world's most notable disasters,  including earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and plane crashes, among  others. They responded once before in their own community, when  Hurricane Andrew hit south Florida in 1992. Their expertise and range  of skills has made them invaluable in disasters and well-known  internationally. These brave men and women dropped everything to  selflessly assist in Surfside, a particular challenge since the tragedy  affected their own community, and some had missing friends or loved  ones.   FL-TF1 worked nonstop and with heavy hearts following the collapse in  Surfside to provide comfort and closure for the families. They worked  tirelessly, even when smoke and heat from a fire inside the building's  standing portion hampered their efforts. They persisted when the  temperatures escalated so much that some needed IVs to replenish  fluids. They continued on when Tropical Storm Elsa passed nearby and  dumped torrential rain. They left the pile only when they absolutely  had to. They braved conditions the likes of which we could never  imagine.   I also want to thank FL-TF1 dogs for their hard work to support  search, rescue, and recovery efforts. We cannot thank these brave men  and women of the FL-TF1 enough. They are heroes who stepped up to serve  the community in the wake of an unprecedented and unimaginable  disaster. Not only did they help lead the search, rescue, and recovery  operation, they also provided endless care and compassion to the  families of Surfside and did everything they could to bring closure to  those who lost loved ones.   We are incredibly grateful to these heroes and their families for  their bravery, self-sacrifice, and determination in the face of this  terrible tragedy. Ann and I are praying for the Surfside community, our  Jewish community, the families and loved ones of the lost, and all of  those who worked tirelessly to serve the Surfside community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the individuals who responded to the  building collapse in Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021.   I want thank all of Florida's first responders who responded when the  Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside, FL, suddenly  collapsed in the middle of the night. They immediately answered the  call to serve, and firefighters, law enforcement officers, search and  rescue crews, emergency medical technicians, physicians, nurses, and  others from across the State of Florida came rushing in to try to save  lives. In the face of tremendous tragedy, they ran into danger. They  are heroes.   Some of these responders lost family in the collapse; yet they still  answered the call. Rescue crews worked tirelessly, even when smoke and  heat from a fire inside the building's standing portion hampered their  efforts. They persisted when the temperatures escalated so much that  some needed IVs to replenish fluids. They continued on when Tropical  Storm Elsa passed nearby and dumped torrential rain. They conducted  their searches with enormous care and diligence and closely worked with  faith leaders to make sure that rescue and recovery efforts were done  with the respect. They left their families and faced dangerous and  life-threatening conditions, and they never gave up hope. Their work to  recover victims gave closure to so many families, and I am so proud of  these Florida heroes.   We can never thank them and their families enough for their bravery,  self-sacrifice, and determination in the face of this terrible tragedy.  Ann and I are praying for the Surfside community, our Jewish community,  the families and loved ones of the lost, and all of those who worked  tirelessly to serve the Surfside community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the individuals who responded to the  building collapse in Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021.   I want to thank Florida's brave law enforcement community for  responding when the Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside,  FL, suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night. They swiftly heeded  the call of duty and came rushing in to save lives. In the face of  tremendous tragedy, they ran into danger. They are heroes.

These brave men and  women worked around the clock to support search and rescue efforts and  provide protection and comfort to the entire Surfside community. They  worked tirelessly, and they never gave up hope.   I would also like to thank the law enforcement chaplains who did  everything they could to support the needs of those responding to the  collapse and  [[Page S6269]]  all of the families that were impacted by this tragedy. The chaplains  were a source of comfort and ensured that the emotional and religious  needs of families and first responders were met.   The chaplains were instrumental in making sure families were  constantly updated and that all of their questions were answered in  both a timely and efficient manner, to the greatest extent possible.  They provided as much transparency and kindness as they could during  this unimaginable tragedy. We cannot thank them enough.   Law enforcement teams worked to recover personal property and  religious artifacts and followed careful collection protocols. They  worked around the clock to ensure all recovered personal property and  family heirlooms were treated with the utmost respect and with great  consideration for faith traditions when recovering items of religious  significance. So many came together, as one, in the relentless pursuit  to save lives. We honor the precious lives lost and pay homage to loved  ones and all those that have suffered immensely.   Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to  keep Floridians, and this was no exception. We can never thank them and  their families enough for their bravery, self-sacrifice, and  determination in the face of this terrible tragedy. Ann and I are  praying for the Surfside community, our Jewish community, the families  and loved ones of the lost, and all of those who worked tirelessly to  serve the Surfside community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the individuals who responded to the  building collapse in Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021.   I want to thank all eight of Florida's Urban Search and Rescue Task  Force teams from Miami-Dade County, the city of Miami, Hillsborough  County, Central Florida, Northeast Florida, Southwest Florida, North  Florida, and North Central Florida for responding when the Champlain  Towers South condo building in Surfside, FL, suddenly collapsed in the  middle of the night. They swiftly heeded the call of duty to assist in  search, rescue, and recovery efforts following the collapse. In the  face of tremendous tragedy, they ran into danger. They are heroes.   Florida's Urban Search and Rescue Task Force teams are deployed to  aid communities following a natural or manmade disaster, and all eight  deployed to Surfside to aid in the search, rescue, and recovery  efforts. Nearly 370 urban search and rescue members worked on-site,  making this the largest nonhurricane deployment in Florida's history.   Some of these responders lost family in the collapse; yet they still  answered the call. Rescue crews worked tirelessly, even when smoke and  heat from a fire inside the building's standing portion hampered their  efforts. They persisted when the temperatures escalated so much that  some needed IVs to replenish fluids. They continued on when Tropical  Storm Elsa passed nearby and dumped torrential rain. They left their  families and faced dangerous and life-threatening conditions, and they  never gave up hope. Their work to recover victims gave closure to so  many families, and I am so proud of these Florida heroes.   I also want to thank Florida's Urban Search and Rescue Task Force  teams dogs for their hard work to support search, rescue, and recovery  efforts.

Our Jewish Community, particularly Orthodox Jews, have been  especially affected by this tragedy. Hatzalah is a volunteer emergency  medical service organization serving Jewish communities around the  world. We are incredibly grateful to Hatzalah of South Florida for  immediately rushing in to try to save lives following the building  collapse. They swiftly heeded the call of duty to aid in rescue and  recovery efforts. In the face of tremendous tragedy, they ran into  danger. They are heroes, and we can never thank them enough for their  bravery and determination in the face of this terrible tragedy.   Hatzalah of South Florida had a steady presence in Surfside, helping  with the search, rescue, and recovery operation. They offered  resources, support, and comfort to the survivors, families of the  victims, and the entire community in Surfside. They provided medical  services to evacuees, families of missing persons, and personnel  involved in the search and rescue operations. They worked tirelessly  and relentlessly to make sure that the needs of the community were met.  Ann and I continue to pray for the Surfside community, our Jewish  community, the families and loved ones of the lost and all of those who  worked tirelessly to serve the Surfside community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the individuals who responded to the  horrific tragedy in Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the Champlain  Towers South condo building suddenly collapsed in the middle of the  night.   Our Jewish Community, particularly Orthodox Jews, have been  especially affected by this tragedy, and immediately following the  collapse, Israel mobilized resources and personnel to help in the  response. We are incredibly grateful to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali  Bennett for deploying the joint Israel Defense Forces--IDF--and  Ministry of Foreign Affairs delegation to Surfside following the  collapse. I want to thank commander of IDF's National Rescue Unit in  the Home Front Command, Colonel Golan Vach, for leading the search and  rescue delegation and Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister, Nachman Shai,  who helped to make sure the needs of the Surfside community were  addressed. I am eternally grateful for their hard work and quick  response to this terrible tragedy.   I also want to thank Israel's Consul General, Maor Elbaz-Starinsky,  and his team, who were on site working tirelessly to address the needs  of the community and who worked alongside first responders and rescue  crews to respond to the collapse.   Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command operates search and rescue  missions in Israel and around the world, aiding in rescue and recovery  efforts for disasters. Using building information modeling tools and  technologies and careful measurements taken on site, the Home Front  Command was able to generate 3D digital models of the building before  and after its collapse. This, combined with information gathered from  surviving family members and friends, produced highly accurate  information to help the search, rescue, and recovery efforts. Their  efforts gave search teams from across the United States and around the  world the most accurate and up-to-date information on where they should  target their search efforts.   Israel responds immediately to emergencies around the world, and our  gratitude is immense. Israel is a partner in every sense of the word.  Their presence was greatly appreciated by the people of Surfside, the  State of Florida, and the entire Nation. The Israeli rescue team  demonstrated once again the kindness and strength that Israel provides.  They swiftly heeded the call of duty to help local, State, Federal, and  [[Page S6270]]  international counterparts with rescue and recovery efforts. In the  face of tremendous tragedy, they ran into danger. They are heroes. They  worked tirelessly and relentlessly to make sure that the needs of the  community were met. We can never thank them enough for their bravery  and determination.   The Israeli delegation succeeded in alleviating suffering and  demonstrated what the Jewish state can mean to people thousands of  miles away during the worst moment of their lives. The tragedy in  Surfside shows the strength of the connection between American Jews and  the Jewish state and that Israel is a great ally and friend to the  United States. Ann and I continue to pray for the Surfside community,  our Jewish community, the families and loved ones of the lost, and all  of those who worked tirelessly to serve the Surfside community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the first responders who responded to  horrific tragedy in Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the Champlain  Towers South condo building suddenly collapsed in the middle of the  night.   We are incredibly grateful to Mexico for sending its search and  rescue specialists to aid in the response, including the ``Go Team'' of  Cadena International, a Jewish nonprofit which has responded to more  than 1,000 natural disasters and humanitarian crises since 2005.

More than 440 USAR members from New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia,  Pennsylvania, and Indiana were on the ground in Surfside to help  supplement the search and rescue efforts. Florida is grateful for the  outpouring of support from our fellow Americans. We are grateful for  the task force teams that came from all over the country, traveling  thousands of miles to work alongside local, State, Federal, and  international counterparts in the relentless search for survivors.

The  outpouring of love and support was absolutely incredible, even amidst  such tragedy. Hundreds gathered every day at The Shul of Bal Harbour to  pray that survivors would be found.   The Surfside Jewish community has always held service and generosity  to others in high regard and practiced giving daily. When the tragic  collapse took place, the community quickly sprang into action. The Shul  became a resource center for survivors, family members of victims, as  well as first responders and rescue teams.   Hundreds were hosted by The Shul for Shabbat meals. Folding tables  set up in The Shul were piled high with clothing, toys, food,  electronics, and household goods for those who lost everything in the  collapse. An emergency fund set up by The Shul raised funds to be  disbursed directly to the victims and families. The Surfside Jewish  community was a vital lifeline of support and comfort in the midst of  unimaginable pain and tragedy.   There were numerous members of the synagogue that were victims of  this terrible tragedy, and our hearts are heavy for them. We pray for  those who were unexpectedly lost.

ALS causes  progressive degeneration of these motor neurons leading to their death.  There is no cure for ALS, and although the mean survival time with ALS  is 3 to 5 years, some people live 5, 10, or more years. While ALS is  considered a ``rare'' disease, the reality is that 500,000 people alive  today will eventually die from the disease.   I have seen how devastating and heartbreaking an ALS diagnosis is for  families. Over time, this disease robs people of the ability to walk,  talk, move, and breathe. In most cases, members of a patient's family  eventually need to become full-time caregivers to help navigate all the  challenges that ALS creates.   I want to commend the Florida chapter of the ALS Association for  their work to fight ALS on all fronts and support the 1,300 families in  Florida who are battling this disease each day. They work closely with  a network of 10 ALS multidisciplinary clinics in the State to ensure  those families have access to critical support as they fight this  disease. Additionally, they provide a variety of programs and services  that are designed to help ease the burden of ALS.   I want to thank the ALS staff and their many volunteers for their  service to the community. I want to specifically recognize three  individuals who are battling ALS.   John Robinson is a recently retired, 32-year veteran of the U.S.  Army. Most recently, he served as the chief warrant officer of the  Army's field artillery branch. In the same way that he served in the  military to protect our freedom here at home, he serves in the ALS  community to help those coming along behind him with ALS. Just as John  protected our freedom, he is a staunch protector of hope in the ALS  community. John wants the next generation of those diagnosed with this  dreadful disease to have better care, more effective treatments, and  the possibility of improved prognosis and quality of life.   Troy Fields is a husband and father of four living with ALS in Tampa,  FL. Prior to his diagnosis, Troy worked at a global financial  technology company for 26 years. Troy believes acceptance never means  that having ALS is okay. It simply means one is willing to deal with  it. Whether he is talking about advocacy with the ALS community and  encouraging others to take action or talking one on one with a chapter  board member about outlining strategic goals, Troy's strategy for  coping is to live in the moment, accept what he cannot control, and  work to change what he can.   Diane Mummaw is from Deltona, FL, and is the mother of two children  and a recently retired small business  [[Page S6273]]  owner. Despite battling ALS, she considers herself lucky because she is  one of the precious few who has survived more than 5 years since her  diagnosis. ALS affected her ability to function but it did not take  away her ability to work for improvement. As an entrepreneur, she took  on living with ALS with the very same grit, fortitude, and  determination that she used to build and grow her business.   These three Floridians show so much strength and hope in the face of  adversity, and I thank them for their many contributions to the ALS  community and to our State.   Last year, Congress passed the ALS Disability Insurance Act to  eliminate the 5-month waiting period for Social Security Disability  Insurance benefits for disabled workers with ALS. I was proud to  support this important legislation and will keep working to support  Floridians with ALS and help to fight this horrible disease on all  fronts.                            ____________________
