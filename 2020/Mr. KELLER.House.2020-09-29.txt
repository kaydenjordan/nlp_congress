 Madam Speaker, every day our men and women in law  enforcement put their lives on the line to protect us, doing so  willingly, faithfully, and without praise or need of recognition.  Occasionally, however, I have the opportunity and the distinct pleasure  to stand before this Congress and recognize these men and women for  their outstanding work.   Today I am honored to recognize Mansfield University Director of  Police Services and Chief of Police Scott Henry for receiving the 2020  Pennsylvania Veterans of Foreign Wars John Radko Police Officer of the  Year and the VFW National Law Enforcement Officer Award. These awards  are presented annually to a law enforcement officer who has shown  resounding commitment to their profession and community.   Chief Henry has served our community for more than 30 years, and his  service has made a lasting impact on our region.   Congratulations to Chief Henry for this wonderful achievement and  reminding us all how important our police officers are in our everyday  lives.                            ____________________
