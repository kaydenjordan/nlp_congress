 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Thomas  Russo. Tom was born in New Orleans and grew up in Louisiana, where he  received a degree in broadcast journalism from LSU.   I got to know Tom in his role as assignment manager at the WPMI  television station in Mobile, Alabama. Tom was a consummate  professional, always with a smile on his face and a contagious  positivity about himself. In all of my experiences, Tom was a true joy  to work with.   Tragically, Tom passed away, unexpectedly, on March 3 at the young  age of 56.   To Tom's wife, Kristine, and his children, Ryan and Nick, please know  that Tom helped make southwest Alabama and the world a better and  happier place. His legacy will live on in each of you.                            ____________________
