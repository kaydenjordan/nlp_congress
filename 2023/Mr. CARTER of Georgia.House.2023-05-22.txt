 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Jerry Hogan, Sr. Jerry was born in the Old Fort neighborhood of  Savannah in 1942.   Before his graduation from Benedictine Military School in 1961, he  attained the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout.   After Benedictine, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps,  serving with honor and distinction before transferring to the United  States Marine Corps Reserve.   As well as his Marine Corps service, Jerry was a police officer on  Tybee Island. After his stint with the Tybee Island Police Department,  he went on to become a stevedore at the Port of Savannah and the Port  of Miami.   In 1975 he started M.J. Hogan & Company and followed that up in 1991  with Hogan's Marina. He led both companies until his passing.   A devout Catholic, he was active in every parish in which he lived  and the diocese at large, and he founded the Joseph O'Brien Ramsey  Scholarship at his alma mater, Benedictine.   Jerry was also active in community and civic associations, being a  member of the Jaycees, the Propeller Club of the Port of Savannah, and  the Chatham County Tax Assessors Board.   A proud Irish American, he served as the general chairman, adjutant,  and finally as grand marshal of the Savannah St. Patrick's Day parade.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the Hogan family during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
