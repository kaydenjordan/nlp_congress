 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the record- high inflation hurting working families in Iowa caused by the Biden  administration.   When President Biden took office in January 2021, inflation was at  1.4 percent. As of May 2022, inflation is 8.6 percent, the highest in  40 years. President Biden has been exclaiming that the rise in  inflation would be a temporary problem, but the data does not reflect  his claims.   Inflation is hurting families in Iowa and all across the country.  With food and housing prices increasing, families are having to make  sacrifices to make ends meet. It is unacceptable for the Biden  administration to advocate for more government spending that caused  inflation rather than addressing these pertinent issues, such as rising  prices.   This rising inflation in fuel prices is hurting rural farmers in  Iowa. Gas and diesel prices are now expected to cost farmers an extra  $900 a year, and $500 to families, as well.   I call upon the Biden administration to take necessary steps to  address inflation, such as increasing domestic energy production and  stopping wasteful government spending. The Biden administration's  policies are hurting the families it is meant to serve.   I would also like to take this time to wish a happy birthday to  Michael Pinette, and I wish my sister Mari-Eleanor Martino a very happy  birthday.                            ____________________
