 Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation  to ensure that no American Citizen or green card holder faces  indefinite detention without charge or trial.   Indefinite detention is an unfortunate legacy of America's not-too- distant past. The internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II  remains a dark spot on our Nation's legacy, and it is something we  should never repeat.   To ensure that this reprehensible experience would never happen  again, Congress passed, and President Nixon signed into law, the Non- Detention Act of 1971. The Act states that ``no citizen shall be  imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant  to an Act of Congress.''   One would have hoped that this legislation would have brought an end  to the notion that Americans could ever again be imprisoned at the whim  of the Executive. Yet, in 2002, Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen, was  arrested in Chicago. He was initially detained pursuant to a material  witness warrant based on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but he was later  designated as an ``enemy combatant'' who conspired with al-Qaeda to  carry out terrorist attacks inside the United States.   Padilla was transferred to the military brig in South Carolina, where  he was detained for three-and-a-half years while seeking habeas corpus  relief. Padilla was never charged with attempting to carry out a  terrorist attack. Instead, he was transferred to Federal civilian  custody in Florida in November of 2005, where he was convicted of other  charges related to terrorist plots overseas.   While he was detained by the military, Padilla filed a habeas corpus  petition, which was first litigated in the Second Circuit Court of  Appeals. The Second Circuit rejected the argument, advanced by the Bush  Administration, that Padilla's detention was authorized  [[Page S6459]]  by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against al- Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist groups, concluding instead that  ``clear congressional authorization is required for detentions of  American citizens on American soil'' and the AUMF was ``not such an  authorization.'' Ultimately, however, the Supreme Court reversed the  Second Circuit's decision on other grounds, leaving an open question as  to whether the AUMF or other military authorities can be used to  indefinitely detain Americans apprehended in the United States.   It is past time for Congress to resolve this legal ambiguity,  consistent with our values, by stating once and for all that the AUMF  and similar authorities do not authorize the indefinite detention of  Americans apprehended in the United States. The Due Process Guarantee  Act would accomplish this by codifying the ``clear statement'' rule  articulated by the Second Circuit in Jose Padilla's case and clarifying  that authorizations for the use of military force and similar  authorizations cannot be construed as acts of Congress that permit  indefinite detention.   There is no legitimate reason to detain Americans without due  process. We have a court system that is fully capable of trying and  convicting terrorism suspects using existing laws and processes. We  made a serious mistake when we detained Japanese-Americans during World  War II, and we must never repeat it.   I thank the Senator from Utah for his long partnership with me on  this issue as well as the Senators from Rhode Island, Texas, and Maine  for their longstanding support. We were able to pass this bill in the  Senate in 2013, and I am confident we can do so again.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be included in the  Record.                                  S. 2718         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Due Process Guarantee Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF CITIZENS                     AND LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS.         (a) Limitation on Detention.--        (1) In general.--Section 4001(a) of title 18, United States       Code, is amended--        (A) by striking ``No citizen'' and inserting the following:        ``(1) No citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United       States''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Any Act of Congress that authorizes an imprisonment       or detention described in paragraph (1) shall be consistent       with the Constitution and expressly authorize such       imprisonment or detention.''.        (2) Applicability.--Nothing in section 4001(a)(2) of title       18, United States Code, as added by paragraph (1)(B), may be       construed to limit, narrow, abolish, or revoke any detention       authority conferred by statute, declaration of war,       authorization to use military force, or similar authority       effective prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.        (b) Relationship to an Authorization To Use Military Force,       Declaration of War, or Similar Authority.--Section 4001 of       title 18, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a) is       further amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:        ``(b)(1) No United States citizen or lawful permanent       resident who is apprehended in the United States may be       imprisoned or otherwise detained without charge or trial       unless such imprisonment or detention is expressly authorized       by an Act of Congress.        ``(2) A general authorization to use military force, a       declaration of war, or any similar authority, on its own, may       not be construed to authorize the imprisonment or detention       without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent       resident of the United States apprehended in the United       States.        ``(3) Paragraph (2) shall apply to an authorization to use       military force, a declaration of war, or any similar       authority enacted before, on, or after the date of the       enactment of the Due Process Guarantee Act.        ``(4) This section may not be construed to authorize the       imprisonment or detention of a citizen of the United States,       a lawful permanent resident of the United States, or any       other person who is apprehended in the United States.''.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 2722. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria  Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to  the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today, I offer private immigration  relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to  Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola  Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals  living in the Fresno area of California.   Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20  years. Two of their five children, Nayely and Cindy, also stand to  benefit from this legislation.   The other three Arreola children, Roberto, age 29, Daniel, age 25,  and Saray, age 24, are U.S. citizens.   The story of the Arreola family is compelling, and I believe they  merit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form  of relief as a private bill.   The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous  errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been  disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it  compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of  Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in  his clients' immigration cases.   Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural  migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a  migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent  residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program had  he known about it.   Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became  pregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth  because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.   Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United  States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of  deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United  States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received  foreclosed this opportunity.   One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this  private bill is the devastating impact that the deportation of  Esidronio and Maria Elena would have on their children--three of whom  are American citizens--and the other two who have lived in the United  States since they were toddlers. America is the only country the  Arreola children have ever known.   Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high  school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her  Master's degree in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific  University and now works at Gap, Inc. Nayely is married and has a young  son named Elijah and a young daughter named Brooklyn.   At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals  of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her  full potential both through her academic endeavors and community  service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific  University states in a letter of support, ``the leaders of Fresno  Pacific University saw in Nayely[ ] a young person who will become  exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''   In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual  Determination, a college preparatory program in which students commit  to determining their own futures by attaining a college degree. Nayely  was also President of the Key Club, a community service organization.  Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.S. citizen husband and  child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her lost  opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her  community and to this country.   Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has three children.  Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to automatically adjust their  status based on their marriages because of their initial unlawful  entry.   The Arreolas also have other family who are U.S. citizens or lawful  permanent residents. Maria Elena has three brothers who are American  citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an American citizen. They  have no immediate family in Mexico.   According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any  problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their  taxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked  hard to support themselves.  [[Page S6460]]    As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker,  but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His  business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home  for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community  and in their children's education.   It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the  Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their  community as well as the United States.   I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.                                  S. 2722         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ESIDRONIO ARREOLA-                    SAUCEDO, MARIA ELENA COBIAN ARREOLA, NAYELY                     ARREOLA CARLOS, AND CINDY JAEL ARREOLA.

(b) Adjustment of Status.--If Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo,       Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy       Jael Arreola enter the United States before the filing       deadline specified in subsection (c), Esidronio Arreola-      Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos,       and Cindy Jael Arreola shall be considered to have entered       and remained lawfully in the United States and shall be       eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the applications for issuance of       immigrant visas or the applications for adjustment of status       are filed with appropriate fees not later than two years       after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting       of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Esidronio       Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola       Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola, the Secretary of State shall       instruct the proper officer to reduce by four, during the       current or next following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Esidronio       Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola       Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 203(a) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely       Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 202(e)       of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation  to ensure that no American Citizen or green card holder faces  indefinite detention without charge or trial.
