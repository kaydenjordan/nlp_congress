 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2105) to require the Director of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology to disseminate guidance to help  reduce small business cybersecurity risks, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Webster) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on H.R. 2105.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on H.R. 2105.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership for giving us this time to debate  this important bill. It is especially timely as October is National  Cyber Security Awareness Month, so taking up this bill at this time is  a perfect time. We must come together to protect all businesses--large,  small, and medium--from the constant threat of cyber attacks.   America's small businesses are the backbone of our economy,  accounting for 54 percent of all American sales and 55 percent of  American jobs. Unfortunately, small businesses are especially  vulnerable, with some reports noting that 43 percent of cyber attacks  specifically target them. These small businesses are more susceptible  to attacks due to the limited access to the tools they need to prepare  for such an event. Implementation of the NIST Framework into these  small businesses will protect small business owners, their employees,  and their customer base all while contributing positively to the  economy.   H.R. 2105, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Small  Business Cybersecurity Act, will help small businesses better address  their cybersecurity risks to help them survive and thrive in the face  of such adversity.   As an owner of a multigenerational family air-conditioning and  heating business, I understand firsthand the importance of equipping  and empowering small businesses to tackle these challenges so that they  can grow and prosper.   About 10 months ago, my sons called me and said that there was a  message on the screen of one of our computers that said: ``Your data  has been frozen. You have been attacked.'' It had a little clock on  there ticking down. ``If you don't pay a ransom by a certain time, then  we will destroy your data. It is inaccessible.''   Well, there was something we had done, fortunately--not that we do  every day, but we had done several days before--which protected us from  that. We were able to fix our problem and wipe it clean and get started  all over. But most small businesses may or may not--including  ourselves--have done that just a few days before.   Thus, I introduced H.R. 2105 with the support and cosponsorship of  many of my colleagues on the committee, including Chairman Smith,  Chairwoman Comstock, and Ranking Member Lipinski.   H.R. 2105 would provide small businesses in my district, State, and  across the country with the tools they need to meet the threats and  challenges of the modern world.   This bill describes the vital role played by small businesses in the  U.S. economy, the devastating impact of cyber attacks on a majority of  small businesses and large businesses and what they need to develop to  specifically help themselves.   It directs the NIST Director--within a year of the act's enactment-- to disseminate clear and concise resources, which are defined as  guidelines, tools, best practices, standards, methodologies, and other  ways of providing this information.   Dissemination would be in consultation with heads of other Federal  agencies. These resources--based on the NIST Framework for Improving  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity--will help small businesses  identify, assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks.                                time  1400    H.R. 2105 also clarifies that use of the resources by small  businesses is voluntary, directs the NIST Director and heads of Federal  agencies that so elect to make the resources available on their  government websites, and specifies that no new funds are authorized to  carry out this act.   This bill is very similar to S. 770, the MAIN STREET Cybersecurity  Act, which is supported by the National Small Business Association,  National Restaurant Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the  International TechneGroup. The Chamber and International TechneGroup  have also come out in support H.R. 2105.   On September 28, 2017, the Senate passed S. 770 by unanimous consent,  and I ask my colleagues to similarly support H.R. 2105.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), chairman of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the chairwoman of the  subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank those from both sides-- Ranking Member Lipinski, Chairman Smith, and others--who have supported  this bill. It is a great idea. It is an opportunity to not only have  available for us, it has bipartisan support and also bicameral support.  This is a good opportunity to help all small businesses.   I know personally from my business and I know others who have small  businesses who know that there is, in a sense, very little help right  now for small businesses in this area of cybersecurity. The larger  businesses certainly have their own IT people; we don't. So I am  excited about the fact that this could happen, and I move passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Barton). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Webster) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2105, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
