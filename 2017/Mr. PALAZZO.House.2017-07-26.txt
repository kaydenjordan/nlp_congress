 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Make  America Secure Appropriations Act.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have witnessed  firsthand the hard work that Chairman Frelinghuysen and his  subcommittee chairmen have put into crafting this bill. They all should  be congratulated for their work on this legislation, and so should  their staffs.   I firmly believe that the number one constitutional responsibility of  Congress is to provide for the common defense of this Nation against  all enemies, both domestic and foreign. That commitment, by increasing  defense funding and restoring the cuts and budget shortfalls that  threaten our military readiness and our ability to project force around  the globe, is honored here today.   Our bill also honors those who serve our country in the Armed Forces  by giving them a much-deserved 2.4 percent pay raise and making  critical investments in equipment and training that help them perform  the missions we give them and, most importantly, help them return home  safely to their loved ones and their families and communities. This  includes 11 Navy ships, including two destroyers for our Navy and a new  LHA for our Marines. And I am proud to say that some of these ships  will be built in my district by the greatest shipbuilders on Earth.   The bill also honors the service of our veterans. Our commitment  doesn't stop when our men and women in uniform stop serving. We must  continue to support them after they leave service, and this bill does  just that, funding mental healthcare, care for our homeless veterans,  and other national priorities.   In addition, this bill makes critical investments in our Nation's  border security, including fully funding the President's request for a  physical barrier construction along our southern border. The President  has promised this funding, the American people want this funding, and  today the House is making good on that promise--after all, border  security is national security.   Mr. Chairman, this is a solid bill. It honors our commitments, it  keeps Americans safe and fulfills our obligation to all those who serve  this great country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation.                                time  1630
