 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2052) to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to  prohibit the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual  images.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of subchapter X of chapter 47 of title 10, United       States Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice), is       amended by inserting after the item relating to section 917       (article 117) the following new item:  ``917a. 117a. Wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual                images.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2052, the Protecting the  Rights of Individuals Against Technological Exploitation Act, or the  PRIVATE Act. This act would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice  to prohibit the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual  imagines.   Recent revelations that nude photographs of servicemembers were  nonconsensually posted to social media websites like Marines United is  abhorrent. This repugnant behavior is unacceptable, and we must work to  prevent this deplorable behavior from occurring again.   The Neanderthals who committed these acts are not emblematic of the  vast majority of decent and honorable servicemembers who serve our  Nation. However, the notion that any servicemember would think it is  acceptable to upload, view, or comment on nude photos of their fellow  servicemembers is a serious problem that must be fixed.   This bill will help hold perpetrators of these types of crimes  accountable. It will strengthen the Uniform Code of Military Justice by  establishing an enumerated, punitive article that clearly prohibits the  wrongful, nonconsensual sharing of intimate visual images, even when  those images were initially given with consent.   While the Uniform Code of Military Justice currently contains two  general articles under which these crimes can already be prosecuted,  this new provision will give commanders an additional specific tool and  send a clear message to servicemembers that this behavior is  unacceptable and is, in fact, a crime.   The PRIVATE Act is designed to protect our servicemen and -women and  is supported by 26 different military and veterans organizations.   While there are many divisive issues facing Congress today, as a  retired colonel and 26-year combat veteran of the Air Force, I am  heartened that this bill enjoys such significant bipartisan support.   I wish to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including  Ms. Speier for her leadership, for her cosponsorship, and for her  devotion to our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. If the  gentlewoman from California has no further speakers, I am prepared to  close once the gentlewoman does.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As a 26-year combat veteran, I am deeply disturbed, but not surprised  by the scandal.   As a former commander, I know that you need to give commanders all  the tools they need to hold perpetrators accountable. This is not just  about good order and discipline. This is about the military mission.  This bill gives commanders an additional tool in order to address this  culture and to hold people accountable for their abhorrent behavior.   I want to say that I appreciate the strong support across the aisle  and our side of the aisle. This is strong, bipartisan support. I would  urge all of my colleagues to support the PRIVATE Act.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thornberry for his  leadership on this issue.   I yield back the balance of my time.
