 Mr. President, each year, a proclamation is issued  designating National Small Business Week, a time to recognize the  important contributions America's small business owners make to our  economy and our local communities. South Dakota is home to many small  businesses with a strong commitment to producing quality products while  serving their community. Today it is my honor to recognize the Dairy  Queen of Madison, SD, which serves as a testament as to what makes  South Dakota's small business owners exemplary.   In 1964, the Mork family acquired the franchise license for the  Madison Dairy Queen and continues to operate it successfully. Today  DeLon Mork continues his family's business as the current owner of the  restaurant. DeLon and his family are passionate about providing  excellent service to their customers while giving back to the community  that supports them. Each year, many Dairy Queens participate in Miracle  Treat Day, to raise money for the Children's Miracle Network. For the  past 11 years, DeLon and his team at the Madison Dairy Queen have  worked to sell the most Blizzards of any Dairy Queen in North America  on Miracle Treat Day. Their hard work on behalf of the Children's  Miracle Network exemplifies the commitment to community service shared  by the Mork family and the entire team at the Madison Dairy Queen. I  commend the entire organization for their contributions to this great  cause.   Small businesses like DeLon's play an important role in South  Dakota's economy, and with this recognition, I hope to shine a light on  his great work. His dedication to producing a quality product and  serving his community makes all of South Dakota proud. I want to  congratulate and thank DeLon and the entire Mork family for their  outstanding devotion to our community. I send them best wishes as they  continue to serve the community of Madison, SD.                            ____________________
