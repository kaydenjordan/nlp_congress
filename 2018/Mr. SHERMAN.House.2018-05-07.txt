 Mr. Speaker, having been briefed at every stage of the  negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal, I was able to come to this floor  just 2 hours after it was published and be the first to speak in  opposition to the Iran nuclear deal.   Today, I rise to urge the President not to renounce that deal. The  question is this: Do we want to liberate the Iranian Government or  sanction the Iranian Government? If we renounce the deal, then the  Iranian Government is free to remove the inspectors, to begin a program  of building an unlimited number of centrifuges, and can request the  return of the fissile material, several bombs' worth of fissile  material which, under the deal, they had transferred to Russia and  which Putin might choose to return.   If we renounce the deal, we do nothing to give ourselves additional  rights because, under the deal, we are free to sanction Iran in full  proportion to its nonnuclear evil. The Iranian Government is  responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in Syria and tens of  thousands of deaths in Yemen. That alone justifies every sanction every  Member of this body can come up with.   We can stay in the deal and sanction Iran.                            ____________________
