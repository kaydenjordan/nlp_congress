 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 79, a bipartisan bill that moves us closer to adopting the equal  rights amendment.   Madam Speaker, American women are barrier breakers. We have broken  down barriers and shattered glass ceilings in education, at work, in  the law, in the military, and at home. We are in a new era where women  are leading in ways that they never have before, but legal gender  discrimination, pay disparities, and inequality remain. They will not  go away on their own. That is why we need to ensure that women's rights  are guaranteed by adopting the equal rights amendment.   I was so proud in 2018 when Illinois ratified the equal rights  amendment at long last. Two years later, I am here on the House floor  because the women of northern Illinois sent me here to fight for them.  I am here to fight for our right as women to equal treatment under the  Constitution of our great country.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to move us one giant step  closer to legal equality by supporting this essential bill.
