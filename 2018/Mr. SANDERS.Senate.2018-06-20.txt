 Mr. President, let me thank Senator Merkley and others  for organizing this important discussion--a discussion designed to  reclaim American values. I also want to take this opportunity not just  to thank Senator Merkley but to thank millions of people from coast to  coast--people who are conservatives and progressives, Democrats,  Republicans, Independents--for getting on the phone, for calling  Members of Congress, for expressing their outrage that in the United  States of America today, we have small children who are torn from their  mothers and their fathers and locked up in detention cages. All over  this country, regardless of one's political view, one understands that  is not what this country is about and must never be about.   Tonight, as I understand it, we have Democrats here, but opposition  to this  [[Page S4299]]  policy is widespread. Let me quote from a recent op-ed that Laura Bush,  our former First Lady, the wife of a conservative Republican, wrote.  This is what she said:         Our government should not be in the business of warehousing       children in converted box stores or making plans to place       them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These       images are eerily reminiscent of the internment camps for       U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during       World War II, now considered to have been one of the most       shameful episodes in U.S. history.    This is former First Lady Laura Bush.   The good news is, because the American people spoke up, because some  Republicans finally had the guts to do the right thing and convey their  displeasure to the President, Trump has changed his policy. Let us be  clear that the Executive order he issued today goes nowhere--nowhere-- as far as it should go.   Mr. President, I am going to ask consent to have printed in the  Record an article from the Daily Beast, a publication that came out  tonight.   What they say is, there is no guarantee in this Executive order, as  Senator Kaine has indicated, that the fate of the 2,400 children  currently imprisoned will be changed. There is nothing specific in the  Executive order that says those 2,400 kids will, in fact, be reunited  with their parents. Presumably, this will apply to future apprehensions  where children will be imprisoned with their parents.   Second of all, there is an effort in this Executive order to overturn  the 1997 Flores settlement, which limits the government's ability to  keep children in detention and orders them to be placed in the least  restrictive settings as possible.   If you can imagine it, what this Executive order does is raise the  possibility of children being in prison for very long periods of time.  Is that better than them being separated from their parents? I guess.  But does anybody really believe we should be imprisoning for an  indefinite period of time little children? There are better ways to  deal with this issue.   What is clear to the American people is that once again we have a  President who caused this crisis by undoing existing policy. We have a  President who I believe just the other day said: Nothing I could do, it  is law.   Sadly, once again, he was lying. It is not Federal law. His decision  to separate children from their parents was his decision and his  decision alone, as he acknowledges today by announcing an Executive  order ostensibly doing away with that policy.   Let me remind the American people that this terrible Executive order  he issued separating children from their parents is not the first  terrible Executive order with regard to immigration. Let us remember  that months ago, Trump created the DACA crisis and put 1.8 million  young people in this country--young people who were raised in this  country, who are working and going to school or serving in the  military--in danger of deportation because of a decision he made.   I say to the President, start working hard on a new Executive order  and make that Executive order clear that the 2,400 children, now in  jail, separate from their parents, will, in fact, be reunited, and make  it clear that we will not keep children in prison for an indefinite  period of time.   By the way, while you are at it, why don't you deal with the DACA  crisis you created and provide the legal status that 80 percent of the  American people want to see for the young people in the DACA Program?   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article I referred  to from the Daily Beast printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                           [From the Daily Beast]   Trump's Family Separation Order Does Nothing for Families He Already                                  Broke Up                    (By Betsy Woodruff and Justin Glawe)    Kids are thousands of miles away from parents with no reliable way to       find each other--and they may never after adults are deported.         El Paso, TX.--Immigrant families won't be separated       anymore, thanks to a new order from President Trump, but that       doesn't mean families will be reunited.        Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday ending the       practice of taking children away from parents who enter the       U.S. illegally. Already, though, more than 2,000 children       have been separated, according to the government, and       advocates and attorneys for them fear they will never see       their parents again.        Despite Trump's order, there is no clear, publicly       articulated plan to reunite families who are already       detained. Parents are held in facilities near the border like       McAllen, Texas while their children are sent to foster-care       homes as far as New York, Illinois and Michigan. While the       adults wait to be deported, their advocates must navigate       multiple federal agencies to locate their children.        ``The executive order that President Trump signed is no       solution,'' said Michelle Brane, director of the Women's       Refugee Commission Migrant Rights and Justice program, in a       statement. ``First, there are more than 2,000 children       already separated from their parents. This EO does nothing to       address that nightmare.''        The Department of Health and Human Services will not make a       special effort to reunite the children already separated from       their families, according to a CBS report.        On Tuesday, an ICE spokesperson told The Daily Beast if a       parent asks to be deported with a separated child, the agency       will accommodate the request ``to the extent practicable.''        A child immigrant advocate in the Midwest looking after a       6-year-old Guatemalan girl described ``cold-calling'' ICE       officials in El Paso and Washington, D.C. to reunited girl       with her mother so they can be deported together.        The girl's mother is in ICE custody in El Paso after being       turned away at the Paso del Norte port of entry where she       sought asylum. The Daily Beast is providing the advocate with       anonymity to protect the identity of the mother and child       from feared retribution for speaking out.        In her case, the advocate says an Office of Refugee       Resettlement agent was helpful in coordinating with ICE, but       that isn't always the case.        ``There's some actors that are more willing to cooperate       than others,'' the advocate said.        The advocate estimated many of the separated children will       be in the U.S. six months from now. ``I would say these       children will still be here,'' the advocate added.        Even if a foreign government agrees to allow a immigrant       back into the country, there is no guarantee that U.S. court       cases for the parent or the child will be resolved at the       same time, allowing them to return together (Adults are being       tried in criminal court, while children are tried separately       in immigration courts.)        DHS conceded that parents have been deported without their       children.        ``When parents are removed without their children, ICE,       ORR, and the consulates work together to coordinate the       return of a child and transfer of custody to the parent or       foreign government upon arrival in country, in accordance       with repatriation agreements between the U.S. and other       countries,'' the spokesperson said Tuesday.        Chris Carlin, head of the federal public defender's office       in Alpine, Texas, told The Daily Beast that he fears some of       his clients will never be reunited with their children.        ``I think that's a real possibility,'' he said.        Many of the deported parents return to homelessness and       poverty, Carlin said, and may not be reachable by the U.S.       government who is still holding their child days, weeks or       months later.        HHS has put the children of Carlin's clients in foster       homes as far away as New York and Illinois, and he said this       makes the obstacle of reconnecting children to their parents       potentially insurmountable.        ``In the cases that I'm personally familiar with, I don't       see any evidence of any plan to reunify the parent and the       child after the conclusion of the adult's criminal case,''       Carlin said. ``I don't see any evidence of that at all.''        Parents in detention are unlikely to have all the requisite       identification documents DHS and HHS demand to prove that a       parent and child are in fact related, according to Carlos M.       Garcia, an immigration attorney in Austin.        Garcia said none of the people he met with had received any       paperwork on how to find their children. However, The Daily       Beast obtained an ICE document that is handed out to       immigrants once they're detained. It contains several phone       numbers for parents to try to find their children. One number       notes that the lines are monitored by DHS, possibly scaring       away undocumented members of immigrants' families.        ``Who knows when they'll be reunified, if they are       reunified,'' Garcia said.        A former ICE director told NBC News parents and children       may be separated for years, if not permanently. ``You could       be creating thousands of immigrant orphans in the U.S. that       one day could become eligible for citizenship when they are       adopted,'' said John Sandweg, who served as ICE's acting       director in the Obama administration from 2013-2014.        The children of parents who have been deported may       sometimes be able to gain the legal right to stay in the U.S.       if they can make a valid asylum claim, qualify for special       immigrant juvenile status, or qualify for a visa for crime       victims, according to Ashley Feasley, the director of policy       at Migration and Refugee Services in U.S. Council of Catholic       Bishops. Her organization works  [[Page S4300]]       with children who have been separated from their parents.        ``How do we ensure that we can connect a mom that's been       deported to make sure she is fully informed of her child's       rights and responsibilities under the immigration system, and       do so in the timely manner that we'll need to as prescribed       by our immigration laws?'' Feasley said. ``That's a big       concern of mine.''        Children who have been separated from their parents usually       get a brief legal orientation, but most don't have lawyers so       they have to face an immigration judge alone. If their       parents are deported or in detention, they may have no idea       what kind of legal decisions their children face.        ``These kids are traumatized,'' the Midwest advocate said.       ``The families are heartbroken.''     I yield the floor.
