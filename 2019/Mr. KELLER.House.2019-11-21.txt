 Madam Speaker, we are now in week 2 of the ``public  phase'' of Speaker Pelosi's and Chairman Schiff's impeachment inquiry.   What comes to mind is a song from 1980 by REO Speedwagon. I am not  going to do this any justice, but here it is: ``I heard it from a  friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another . . .''   That is the evidence that has been presented in private and in  public: no substance. In fact, Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Volker, both  of whom claimed to have firsthand knowledge, testified they witnessed  no bribery, no quid pro quos, and no illegal actions by President  Trump.   Yesterday, Ambassador Sondland said: ``I never heard from President  Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement'' of investigations.   Here is what it is: We are talking about innuendos, thoughts, and  feelings, but no facts. That is what is happening. That is what has  happened in the SCIF when it was rehearsed, and that is what is  happening in the public performance this past couple of weeks.                            ____________________
