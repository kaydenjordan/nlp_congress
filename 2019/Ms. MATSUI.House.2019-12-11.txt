 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug  Costs Now Act, the most transformational expansion of Medicare since  its creation.   As co-chair of the House Democrats' Task Force on Aging and Families,  I am fighting for the nearly 9 in 10 seniors taking a prescription  drug, because when our system puts profit over patient health,  beneficiaries pay the price.   With this landmark legislation, we are delivering on the promise to  lift up older Americans and their families. H.R. 3 negotiates lower  drug prices. It expands Medicare to include vision, dental, and hearing  coverage. It caps out-of-pocket costs, and we extend low drug prices to  all Americans with private plans.   While there are many reasons to support H.R. 3, mine is Tony from  Sacramento. Tony has type 2 diabetes. She is a single mom and works  part-time to care for her child, all while managing multiple chronic  conditions.   Over the last decade, the price of insulin has increased 197 percent,  and those increases make it harder and harder for a family to get by.   Under H.R. 3, drug price savings will be passed on to families like  Tony's. Tony could pay as little as $34 per month, giving her family  the relief they need for other expenses.   For seniors, for families, and for all Americans who desperately need  to lift the burden of high drug prices from their everyday lives, I ask  that my colleagues support this bill.
