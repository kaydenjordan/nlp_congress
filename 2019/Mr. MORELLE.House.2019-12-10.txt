 Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces an alarming crisis: The  cost of prescription drugs continues to rise, placing a dangerous  burden on American families, especially our older citizens. That is  why, this week, the House is taking action to lower the cost of  lifesaving medication individuals need to survive by passing H.R. 3,  the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   I am especially proud this landmark legislation will include a  provision I authored with my colleagues, Congressman Rose and  Congressman Veasey, to help reduce Medicare part D costs for low-income  seniors.   H.R. 3 will finally allow Medicare to negotiate drug costs, and our  provision will ensure the cost savings go right back to supporting  Medicare recipients by expanding access to programs that lower out-of- pocket expenses for vulnerable adults and individuals with  disabilities.   We must continue working to improve our healthcare system, and this  marks an important step forward in ensuring medication is accessible  and affordable for everyday Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 748 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

The previous question shall be  [[Page H9957]]       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 748, providing for consideration of  H.R. 729, the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act,  under a structured rule.   This rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources.   The rule makes in order 29 amendments and provides en bloc authority.   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act  brings together ten meaningful and bipartisan bills that have  comprehensive and necessary benefits for the American people, and I am  proud to add my voice in support of this much needed legislation.   Increased climate instability is an undeniable reality. All around  us, we see spikes in severe weather patterns, rising sea levels, and  destroyed ecosystems.   As natural disasters increase in frequency and devastation, our  communities pay the price through destroyed infrastructure, economic  instability, and even loss of life.   Coastal communities in particular are experiencing intense climate  impacts, including severe weather events, sea level rise, chronic  flooding, coastal erosion, and changing oceanic conditions.   Coastal communities and economies need to adapt for climate change.   My own district knows all too well the devastation that flood waters  can cause, as many of my neighbors are still rebuilding from the severe  flooding that we experienced in 2017 and again just this past spring.   Within 100 miles of shoreline that fronts directly on Lake Ontario or  nearby bays, rivers, and streams, my district is directly impacted by  lake fluctuations, and we are experiencing unprecedented flood waters  that erode beaches, devastate family homes, and cripple lakeside  businesses.   As a Member of this Congress, I know I am not alone in worrying about  whether my constituents are adequately prepared for the next natural  disaster, which is not a matter of if, but when.   So many of us in this body, in fact most of us, have communities that  are struggling to deal with climate impacts. Whether it is wildfires,  flooding, hurricanes, droughts, red tide in our oceans, harmful blue- green algae in our lakes, the list seems to never end, but one thing is  clear: the situation is not going to get better on its own. We need to  act now.   H.R. 729 is an opportunity to help our constituents prepare and adapt  to our climate crisis. This coastal resiliency legislative package not  only tells the American people that we care about preserving coastal  communities and natural habitat, but proves we are willing to take the  necessary actions to protect coastal ecosystems and local economies.   The bill also sets in place mechanisms to improve ocean monitoring  and research and provides necessary tools and resources for coastal  communities to protect themselves from climate impacts.   It is critical that we support proactive initiatives to prepare for  and respond to our climate crisis, and this legislation takes those  necessary steps.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to speak in support of this significant piece  of legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting  its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and friend. We serve on the  Rules Committee together, and I always appreciate hearing her thoughts.  But I do want to make a couple of points that I think bear being said.   This is not a duplicative effort, and the need does exist. For  instance, while NOAA may have the flexibility to create a program like  the working waterfronts program, they are not currently supporting  working waterfronts in the way that the bill envisions and continue to  propose the elimination of coastal zone management grants.   The amount of need for coastal zone management grants far exceeds the  amount made available for grants each year, so this bill would direct  NOAA to create a grant program and a loan program to support working  waterfront activities and would also authorize extra funding to make  that happen.   Also, I wanted to make a point as it relates to the District of  Columbia, which sits at the confluence of the Potomac and the Anacostia  Rivers and lies mostly in the coastal plain. It is also bordered by the  coastal States of Virginia and Maryland, whose adjoining waterways are  included in their States' coastal zones. The shorelines of Arlington  and Alexandria, Virginia, and Prince George's County, Maryland, are  included in their States' coastal zones programs.   To clarify, the Virginia side of the Potomac is eligible, while the  District of Columbia side is not. Inclusion of the District of Columbia  would simply connect this gap and subject it to submission and approval  of the coastal zone management plan. Coastal floods do not recognize  State borders, and the District of Columbia is at risk of continued and  increasing flooding.   Since 1950, NOAA reports a 343 percent increase in nuisance flooding  in the District of Columbia, and a single 100-year flood event could  cost over $1.2 billion in damages, including damages to Federal  property.   I also want to note that in addition to consolidating 10 bipartisan  bills, the legislation also includes a range of bipartisan amendments.  I am proud that my own amendment will be included. It ensures 5 percent  of funds for the working waterfronts grant program will be used for  technical assistance, and this will help States and local governments  with early-stage resources, planning assistance, and additional  expertise.   Additionally, I would like to highlight two other amendments led by  my friend and colleague Representative   John Katko, who represents  Syracuse, New York, just to the east of my district. Both of those  amendments I am pleased to cosponsor.   These amendments make meaningful improvements that will advance  research on harmful algal bloom development and open opportunities to  assess the impact of water level regulating practices on the Great  Lakes.   These amendments further demonstrate the bipartisan work that went  into this legislative package, and I thank my colleagues on the other  side who contributed to this bill.   Policy is always better when we work together, and I look forward to  ensuring our constituents get access to the key provisions included in  this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and to  move on to a vote on the rule.   Even if the previous question was defeated, the amendment would not  be able to move as the gentlewoman suggests. The amendment is not  germane to the bill on natural resources.   Obviously, this is an attempt to obscure what we are attempting to  do, which is, we can either help coastal communities plan and prosper  for a resilient future, or we can continue to delay and pay.   Forty-two percent of Americans live in coastal communities. Working  waterfronts employ more than 2 million people. Great Lakes fisheries  alone support more than 75,000 jobs, and healthy fish habitats support  a recreational fishing industry that provides more than 800,000 jobs to  American citizens.    Coastal communities around the country are experiencing intense  climate impacts, including severe weather events, sea level rise,  chronic flooding, coastal erosion, and changing ocean conditions.   Coastal communities and economies need to adapt for climate change,  and H.R. 729 will help communities do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the next devastating flood or natural disaster is not  if, but when, and we have a choice to make here today: We can either  help our communities prepare and prosper for years to come or continue  to drag our feet and face the dire consequences.   We owe it to ourselves, to our constituents, and to future  generations to get this right, and I, personally, want to be on the  right side of history when we look back on this climate crisis. The  work we are doing here is not duplicative or onerous; it is smart,  meaningful, and bipartisan, and I look forward to its passage.   I would like to thank all my colleagues for their support of H.R.  729, the Coastal and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act.   I especially would like to thank Chairman Grijalva for his leadership  and the commitment of his committee on this effort.   I applaud and thank the sponsor, Mr. Kilmer, for his leadership on  this important legislation and Chairman McGovern for his work to move  this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 748         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 750) expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives that individual choice in health insurance       should be protected. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 750.  [[Page H9960]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
