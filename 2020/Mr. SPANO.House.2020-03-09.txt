 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life of a  distinguished Lakeland, Florida, resident and former mayor, the  Honorable Larry Durrence. Sadly, Mayor Durrence passed away on February  20.   Mayor Durrence, or Larry, as he was known to many, lived a life  dedicated to serving others and the community that he called home.   Beyond his two terms in the Lakeland City Hall, he also served as the  third president of Polk Community College, which is now Polk State  College. During his tenure, he prioritized workforce training and  accelerated education programs. He was committed to equity and  diversity, including growing minority and female representation in  leadership positions.   Larry was widely known by his friends and those who worked alongside  him as a dedicated and humble public servant who loved interacting with  and serving people.   Larry Durrence was a great leader and a great friend to our  community, and his legacy will be felt for years to come.   Thank you, Larry, for your many contributions. It is because of men  and women like you that I remain proud to represent and serve Florida's  15th Congressional District.                            ____________________
