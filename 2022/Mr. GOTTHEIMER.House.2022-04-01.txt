 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today about an amendment that I  think is critically important to this legislation. It addresses a topic  that I am concerned about, and I know many are as well, to make sure  that law enforcement has the tools they need to ensure that our roads  are safe and that when they pull someone over for whatever purpose,  they are able to actually have the tools they need to assess the  situation.   My amendment would make sure the Secretary of Transportation can  conduct a study on technology and methods that law enforcement can use  to determine whether a driver is impaired by marijuana. The study will  give the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the resources  they need to conduct this study.   I think it is important and will make this legislation even stronger.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I want to reinforce what Ms. Jackson Lee  said, the importance of making sure we invest in safety, which is  always my top priority, and making sure that law enforcement has the  tools they need.   We invest in law enforcement and ensure we have their backs. They  take care of us every single day. I stand by law enforcement, and we  will make sure they have the resources they need. This legislation  helps in that effort to protect our families and our roads.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
