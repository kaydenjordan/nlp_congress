 Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 1 year since  COVID hit the U.S., and the sick are still splitting pills, diabetics  are still rationing their insulin, and families are doubled up in homes  to keep relatives off the streets. I saw it in 2008, and I am seeing it  again. Up and down the streets of my neighborhood on the southwest side  of Chicago businesses are closed. Every week I am attending another  wake. It is happening across this country.   This has been a failure of the American Government. But finally, we  have a President willing to move a significant relief bill. Congress  needs to pass this legislation and get people the relief that they need  now.   Transit, stimulus checks for working people and immigrants, rental  assistance and small business grants--we can't nickel and dime our way  out of this pandemic. Let's do our job. Let's get the vaccine out, and  let's save our economy. We need to pass the $1.9 trillion budget and  get the American people back on their feet now.
