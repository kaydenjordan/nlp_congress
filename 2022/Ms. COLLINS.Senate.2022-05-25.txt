 Madam President, shortly, the Senator from Rhode Island,  Mr. Whitehouse, will come to the Senate floor and attempt to have a  live unanimous consent request for a nominee to be the Assistant  Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. When he does so, Madam  President, I intend to object to that request, and I want to explain  why to my colleagues. Senator Whitehouse has been delayed in getting to  the Senate floor, so I am going to outline my objections prior to his  making the request.   Madam President, in all of the time that I have served in the U.S.  Senate, I don't ever recall coming to the Senate floor to object to a  unanimous consent request. I say that because it demonstrates how  unusual it is for me to be standing here objecting to one of my  colleague's unanimous consent requests. Indeed, as I said, I don't  believe I have ever done this in all of the time I have served in the  Senate.   So let me give the Presiding Officer and my colleagues some  background. On May 1, despite the objections of the entire Maine  congressional delegation and its Democratic Governor, the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, better known as NOAA, imposed  onerous new regulations on Maine's lobster industry.   Now, Madam President, if I asked you what is the first thing you  think of when I say the State of Maine, you probably would say lobster,  our iconic industry. We have more than 4,500 lobstermen and -women,  each of whom is self-employed. They have been good stewards, always, of  the lobster resource. They have taken care over the decades to make  sure that the lobsters are large enough, for example, to keep. They  throw back egg-bearing lobsters. There are all sorts of rules and  regulations that the lobster industry has worked with the State of  Maine over decades to preserve the precious resource.   But, now, in comes NOAA. NOAA is imposing onerous, possibly  impossible new regulations that do not reflect the reality in the Gulf  of Maine with regard to the right whale. The final rule imposed on May  1 does not even come close to reflecting the reality of the Maine  fishing and lobstering industry and the endangered right whale.   NOAA's focus on the State of Maine's lobster industry is flawed and  unfair. In fact, Madam President, the Agency's own data show that there  has never, never been a right whale entanglement death attributed to  the Maine lobster fishery.   NOAA denied an entirely reasonable request to at least delay the  implementation of these onerous new regulations for just 2 months until  July 1. The entire delegation, plus our Governor, asked for this delay,  this 2-month delay, because our lobstermen cannot even find enough of  the gear, the new gear that is being mandated by NOAA. Just a 2-month  delay would have helped to prevent huge losses to these small business  owners.   Now, this isn't the first request that NOAA has refused. We have  worked over more than a year with NOAA to try to prevent these  regulations from going into effect in the first place because they are  not relevant to preserving the right whale. Nobody wants to see the  population of right whales decimated, but if you look at the data, here  is what is happening, Madam President. It is ship strikes that have  been responsible for the death of right whales. They have occurred in  the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada, not even in the State of Maine.   In addition, there is evidence that there is some gear that is used  for the Canadian snow crab that has been found to entangle the right  whale. That is different from our lobster gear. And as I said, there  has never been a right whale entanglement death attributed to the Maine  lobster fishery.   So these regulations make no sense in the first place, but at least-- at least--in response to a plea from the lobster industry, from the  Maine Department of Marine Resources, from the Democratic Governor of  Maine, from the entire Maine delegation--at least NOAA could have  answered our plea to delay these onerous regulations for 2 months--2  months--during which time maybe this brandnew, very expensive gear  would have become more available. But, no. Once again, NOAA refused.   This really is outrageous, and the industry is expected to lose out  on $7 million due to lost fishing time during these 2 months.   Now, perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island and others do not believe  what the Maine delegation, the Democratic Governor of Maine, the Maine  Department of Marine Resources, and many experts are saying about the  impact of these regulations and the lack of availability of this new  gear and the fact that the data show that we are not the problem in the  State of Maine. As I said, it is fish strikes and due to warming  waters, which I know is of great concern to the Senator from Rhode  Island, as it is to me.   The right whale are actually moving and following their food supply  into Canadian waters. In fact, I have talked to many lobstermen and - women who have never seen a right whale--never--in all the time that  they have been lobstering. But as I said, maybe NOAA just thinks that  we are just automatic advocates for an iconic industry, despite the  extraordinary record of stewardship by the lobster industry.   So let me give you another source. Denying this 2-month extension  conflicted with the recommendations of the U.S. Small Business  Administration's Office of Advocacy, an independent voice for small  business within the Federal Government. The office of advocacy asserted  that NOAA was putting lobstermen and -women in ``an impossible  scenario,'' and went on to say:         If they are not granted a short delay of the compliance       deadline, they may stand to lose significant amounts of       revenue, or in some instances, their entire business.    This isn't just the Maine delegation. It isn't just our Governor. It  isn't just the Maine Department of Marine Resources. This is another  government agency. It is the Small Business Administration's Office of  Advocacy which is saying this.   Maine harvesters are justifiably worried about what they are going to  do and I don't know what more the Maine delegation can do. We have had  countless meetings with the Department of Commerce, with NOAA. I met  with the Fisheries Administrator in NOAA. I asked for his help. He  promised to work with us. Instead, things have gotten only worse. And  now our lobster industry worries that NOAA will continue to steadily  whittle away at their livelihoods while ignoring not only their on-the- water expertise, the expertise of the State of Maine, but the impartial  advice of the Federal Government's Small Business Advocate as well.   The entire agency, all of NOAA, needs to recognize that the practice  of implementing management decisions based on incomplete, imprecise,  inaccurate data--especially when those decisions have a harmful effect  on a fishery that is known for its conservation methods and on the  communities that this fishery has supported forever in the State of  Maine--cannot continue.   So that is the situation in which we find ourselves, and that is why  I believe, for the first time in all the years that I have served in  the Senate, I have come to the floor to object when the unanimous  consent request is made.    I object.
