 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:32 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Portman).                            ____________________
