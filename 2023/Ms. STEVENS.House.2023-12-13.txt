 Mr. Speaker, as a co-chair of the Congressional Task  Force on American Hostages and Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad, I  rise in support of the Conference Report to Accompany the National  Defense Authorization Act.   In the past decade, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of  Americans taken hostage by rogue states and bad actors who are trying  to leverage civilians to get what they want.   Right now, according to the Foley Foundation, there are currently at  least 64 Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained in countries  overseas. They are held in 16 different countries and territories.   Now, more than ever, we must keep up the drumbeat to bring these  individuals home. That is why I am so heartened that the NDAA includes  two of my bills to support and assist Americans wrongfully detained  abroad and their loved ones fighting to get them safely back home.   First, the U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day Act designates  March 9 as Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day and requests that the  President issue a yearly proclamation urging Americans to observe this  day in remembrance for those held hostage.   The bill also requires the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag be  flown at the Capitol, the White House, and numerous other Federal  buildings.   These families need our support. These families need the Nation's  attention. These families need this legislation. By designating a day  and a flag to be flown on Federal property, we will bring much-needed  awareness to the plight of these Americans and the heartache of their  families.   In addition, I am so very pleased to see that the NDAA includes the  Supporting Americans Wrongfully or Unlawfully Detained Abroad Act.  Families of the wrongfully detained often spend thousands and thousands  of dollars traveling back and forth to Washington to advocate for the  release of their loved ones and to work on their safe return home.   This bill would help families defray these costs by providing  financial assistance to cover the costs of travel to and from  Washington, D.C., including travel by air, train, bus, or other  transit, as well as covering lodging expenses.    These families who are already dealing with the detention of a loved  one shouldn't have to worry about going broke or spending a life  savings because they are working alongside the Federal Government to do  what is right. This bill will help ease that financial burden.   Finally, when detainees return home after years of wrongful  detention, we must do more to ensure that they have the resources they  need to return to normal life. They have often been stripped of  employment, housing, and life as they knew it before they were taken  hostage.   We must remember that the wrongfully detained have been imprisoned  oftentimes for years, if not decades, which is wrong. They may come  home, but they won't necessarily come home to a job. We cannot let  these individuals fall through the cracks when they return. We need to  help them return back to society.   That is why I am so proud that this bill will also seek to make  available physical health services, mental health services, and other  support, including providing information on available legal or  financial resources for up to 5 years following the release of a  detainee.   We need to make sure that these individuals have the physical and  mental health assistance that they need to recover from unspeakable  trauma.   While nothing can give back the years that our adversaries or the  time that our adversaries have taken from these Americans, we have a  responsibility to help them get back on their feet.   I sincerely thank the other co-chair of the American Hostage and  Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad Task Force, Mr. French Hill from  Arkansas, for working with me on both of these bills.   I also pay recognition to the families of the hostages, particularly  the family of my constituent, Paul Whelan, who is about to hit 5 years  wrongfully detained in Russia. We are continuing to shine a light on  Paul and demand and call for his release from the Russian Government.   To those held hostage, Congress stands behind you. Congress continues  to work alongside our ally, Israel, in calling for the return of the  138 hostages currently still being held in Gaza.                            ____________________
