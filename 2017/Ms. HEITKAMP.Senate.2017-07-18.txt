 Mr. President, I think that anyone who picked up the  Wall Street Journal over the last couple of weeks and read the stories  about Indian health and what is happening, especially in our region of  the world in the Great Plains--it shocked the conscience. It should  have resulted in a prolonged level of outrage that would bring us all  together.   Unfortunately, we have seen this movie one too many times. Things  happen where we see national stories about challenges in Indian  Country, about the failure to fulfill commitments under treaty rights.  We see despair. We see the incredible rates of poverty, the incredible  rates of unemployment, even in a State like ours where unemployment  rates are never the issue. We wonder, why isn't something being done?  Guess who wasn't shocked. Those of us who serve on the Indian Affairs  Committee.   We on the committee spent a lot of time looking at this last year,  trying to figure out how we could engage the bureaucracy to be more  responsive and more responsible and how we could look at sourcing the  dollars we needed to make sure that Indian health was supplemented and  that the level of care we expect when we walk into our hospitals--that  that is the level of care Native American people who go to the Indian  Health Service on their reservations and who might go to an Indian run,  a Tribal run facility, would expect. That is what we expect, and I  think that is what the American public might think is actually going  on, but those of us on the committee know differently.   We held a roundtable today to talk about what those challenges are,  what Native American leaders believe are those challenges, and to ask  them a simple question: What has Medicaid expansion meant to your  Tribes? What does access to Medicare and Medicaid mean for delivery of  healthcare services?   I want to start off by saying that they have a lot of great ideas,  and I will run through some of these.   Chairman Keplin from Turtle Mountain said: We need local doctors. It  is hard to get people to live on the reservation if they are not from  the reservation, so we need to figure out how we are going to get local  folks to be trained, and we are willing to do that in our Tribal  colleges. We need to build relationships with other healthcare  providers, like Sanford, that can bring specialists. We need our cancer  infusion center to be there so that people can get cancer treatment  right at home. And we need to make sure we are doing everything we can  to make sure we can treat diabetes right there at home.   So the healthcare challenges were amazing, but the cost challenges  were also amazing.   Duane from Pueblo in New Mexico had some very interesting  perspectives. Eighty percent of his patient load comes to the clinic.  They speak their Native language. They have had stability in their  workforce, but they are looking at transitioning to a Tribal facility.  But those people don't want to transition because of Federal  retirement. So is there something we can do to keep these treasured  healthcare providers working for the Tribe and working for their  people--the people who know the language and who are familiar with the  case studies?  [[Page S4046]]    Lincoln from Alaska said: One of our biggest problems is year-to-year  funding. The VA has 2-year funding. We don't know what the money is  going to be and when it is going to come. We also need to train local  people.   Sam said: We have a huge need to continue to build out our cultural  resources and our attention to culture and prevention.   Ron from Washington talked a lot about the recruitment of workforce.  The employer mandate came up because so much of the employment on the  reservations is in fact Tribal members. They are talking about that  they are mandated to buy this health insurance, but these same members  have a treaty right to that healthcare. Is there a way to help those  stretched Tribal resources go a little further by taking a look at some  relief from the employer mandate?   The definition of what constitutes an Indian came up over and over.   From Massachusetts, Cheryl talked about permanent reauthorization of  Indian healthcare and more resources in diabetes, because that is a  pervasive problem, and Indian employment, again, talking about that  issue of buying health insurance.   As to marketplace access for Native American enrollees who are not  living on the reservation, how do they make sure they are able to get  their treaty rights?   Talking about mental well-being and talking about culture is  prevention. One of my favorite lines that came out of this was when we  asked about prevention, and Ashley said: Culture is prevention. We need  better access to 1115 waivers. Take a look at the Canadian model, she  suggested. They do more with cultural sensitivity.   The list goes on and on of great ideas. Not one of these ideas said:  Repeal the Affordable Care Act. Not one of them said: Let's get rid of  Medicaid expansion; let's not look at what we can do.   Let's just all acknowledge what we who serve on this committee know:  We have challenges that far exceed many other populations. We have come  to the floor to talk about how the repeal of the Affordable Care Act  and how the Republican healthcare bill would hurt different  populations. We have talked about the elderly. We have talked about  children with disabilities. We have talked about rural communities. We  have talked about many, many more folks. I think we haven't done enough  to talk about what this means for Indian people.   We have a special relationship with Indian people in my State because  every Tribe in my State is, in fact, a treaty Tribe with a treaty right  to healthcare.   Last night, it obviously became clear that the bill, as it stands,  wouldn't get enough votes to move forward. But we need to keep talking  about this bill, and we need to keep talking about what the questions  are. Instead of talking about this bill or that bill or all of the  acronyms, let's start with healthcare. Let's have a conversation about  healthcare that starts with healthcare. Where are we doing it right?  Where are we doing it wrong? How can we reduce costs? Who is being left  behind?   It is clear to me that in the healthcare world--never mind the  Affordable Care Act or the Better Care Act, whatever the Republican  bill was called. That is a discussion for politics. That is not a  discussion for healthcare. So let's talk about what Native Americans  need. Let's talk about how we have failed.   As I said earlier today, Senator Udall led a really important  discussion about how we need to preserve Medicaid. When we look at the  Indian Health Service, I think anyone who really looks at the numbers  has to admit that it is chronically underfunded.   Last year, I brought the former IHS Director to North Dakota to press  her on maintaining quality care in our Tribal communities. This was  especially important because of the severe challenges Indian healthcare  has. We know that the lack of funding for Indian healthcare can be  critically augmented by three main sources: Medicaid, Medicare, and  private insurance. If every person walking in has the ability to pay,  we are going to improve access to care, and we are going to improve the  opportunity to recruit a workforce.   I think some people may roll their eyes when they say: Don't get sick  in June. My husband is a family physician and practices about 60 miles  north of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He can tell you that there have  been times when people from the reservation have come to the clinic to  see him because the clinic in Fort Yates is shuttered--no money that  day, no opportunity for healthcare. So people come to get the  healthcare they need, but they have to drive a long way. It is wrong.  You see a new doctor whom you have never seen before and who may not,  in fact, understand your condition.   So the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, who are represented today,  have over 33,000 enrolled members, of which approximately 14,500  actively receive treatment and benefits for services at the local IHS  hospital. Thanks to Medicaid expansion and increased enrollment efforts  by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in my State of North Dakota,  their Indian Health Service hospital is now able to offer so much more  in services to their people and increase their outreach and prevention.   In June alone, Turtle Mountain's IHS clinic served nearly 13,000  clinical patients and provided over 1,000 emergency room services.  Third-party billing revenue has now allowed the Tribes to make  renovations to their emergency room and their clinic, to purchase new  medical equipment, including neonatal monitors, to recruit and hire  additional staff, including licensed professionals, to increase staff  training and education, to provide Wi-Fi throughout the hospital, and  to expand their behavioral healthcare facility to serve more patients.   Since the Medicaid expansion, they have had a 9-percent increase in  the number of individuals they have served. Their hospital is also  experiencing a decrease in the number of uninsured patients--still too  high, in my opinion, at 39 percent. We can get that lower if we get  more people to take advantage of Medicaid expansion.   But, unfortunately, a Republican healthcare plan that would eliminate  cost-sharing subsidies is making that private health insurance less  affordable and less successful.   So let's be honest about how we are affecting our Native American  population and talk about the multiple times this expansion has been so  important to our Native families.   In North Dakota, the Republican bill would cause an estimated 984  Native Americans to lose cost-sharing reduction subsidies. The Senate  Republican healthcare bill would also get rid of the Medicaid expansion  and cap the amount of Federal funding States can get to cover those on  traditional Medicaid. As a result, it would drastically reduce the  amount of Medicaid funding going to the States. This would push the  remaining costs to the States and counties that can't afford it.   The American Hospital Association estimates that North Dakota  Medicaid would lose $1.2 billion. I will say that again. North Dakota  Medicaid would lose $1.2 billion through 2026.   Right now, 9,000 North Dakota children and individuals with  disabilities--Native Americans, seniors, and low-income families--rely  on Medicaid for affordable, quality care, but this bill would rip it  away in so many wrong ways.   The uninsured rate for Native Americans has fallen nationally from 24  percent to 15 percent, largely due to Medicaid expansion.   We go on and on. Currently, Medicaid accounts for 24 percent of the  Indian Health Service workforce. The Senate Republican bill would strip  away $772 billion from Medicaid, and the White House proposes cutting  an already underfunded Indian Health Service budget by 6 percent.   We already know that the per-patient cost in the Indian healthcare  system is greatly below that of Medicaid reimbursement cost, on  average. So if we take away Medicaid reimbursement, we are hurting not  only the providers, but we are once again making healthcare less  affordable.   This is a crisis. I can't begin to tell the Members of this body what  a crisis Indian healthcare is in. We have known it on the committee for  many, many years. In fact, Senator Dorgan was the first one to really  sound the alarm of the crisis in the Great Plains area,  [[Page S4047]]  thinking that a report that was so damaging would result in change.  Guess what. It didn't. It didn't result in change. But the one thing we  can point to that is a bright shining light has been access to Medicaid  dollars. It has given them access to capital expenditure, and it has  given them access to workforce. It has given a more consistent way for  people who don't live on the reservations to get healthcare.   I have said this many, many times: We need to not go backward; we  need to go forward. When people say: We are going to take a step back,  we are going to reduce actual appropriations by 6 percent for Indian  health, and we are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion, I say: You  had better look before you take a step backward because you might be  off the cliff. That is how dire it is in Indian Country.   The one thing I am going to conclude with is that for many, many  years in healthcare we have not done what we need to do to consult with  Tribal people: Here is the facility; this is what we are going to  provide. Good luck. One size fits all.   What we need to do and what Medicaid has allowed is that flexibility  for Tribes to engage, for Tribal people to engage in what their needs  are, and to take a look at those community health models that do dental  care, eye care, and mental health and addiction counseling. All of this  needs to be wrapped up. When people say there is no hope, there  certainly is no hope without help.   There is an old saying: When you have your health, you have  everything. I can tell you from personal experience that it is  absolutely true. You could be the richest man in the world, but if you  don't have good health, your quality of life is not what it could be.   When we look across the indicators of what has happened in Indian  health with indigenous people throughout our country, when we know this  is our obligation--this is that treaty obligation, the treaty right  that has been bargained for--shame on us.   Medicaid can be that bridge. It can be the bridge to better  healthcare. That is why it is so critical, Mr. President and my vice  chairman, that we be out here speaking for our communities, speaking  for these unique groups of folks who depend so much on Medicaid  expansion but who also depend on us to do a better job, to be better  stewards of that relationship, to be better citizens as it relates to  living up to the obligations that our ancestors negotiated.   I ask everybody who hasn't really been exposed to this issue to read  the articles in the Wall Street Journal. But don't just read them and  wring your hands and say: This is horrible. Take a step to change the  outcome. Don't just read them and say: Boy, that is horrible. Take  responsibility for what you read. Every one of us in the Senate and in  the Congress is responsible for fulfilling the obligations of these  treaties. When we aren't doing it, it is a failure on every one of us,  and it is a failure to protect some of the most vulnerable people in  our country--and that is Native American children.   I yield the floor and turn it back to my vice chairman, Senator  Udall.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Myles  Odermann, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  duration of today's session of the Senate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
