 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Rabbi Moshe Feller  for the beautiful prayer he offered us this week. He could be  considered a prolific guest chaplain--having led both Houses of  Congress in prayer a combined 10 times over the last several decades.  Each time, his wisdom, his faith in God, and his regard for the work of  this body have all shined through. Today was no exception.   It was particularly special to know that he was joined by one of his  sons, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Feller, as well as three of his  grandchildren, Rabbi Tzemach Feller, Rabbi Yossi Feller, and Moussie  Feller. I am confident that his other son, Rabbi Levi Feller, and his  many other grandchildren were excitedly watching from home. And I know  that if Mindelle, Rabbi Moshe Feller's wife of 56 years who passed away  in 2017, were still with us today, she too would be so proud.   I have had the honor of meeting Rabbi Feller many times over the  years, and I am glad he was able to return to this Chamber today.   In addition to being the longest serving Rabbi in Minnesota, Rabbi  Feller leads the Upper Midwest Merkos Chabad Lubavitch in St. Paul and  is a member of the board of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, the education arm  of the International Chabad movement. Through his work, he mentors and  inspires people of all faiths in Minnesota and across the country. A  passionate and dedicated leader, he has been instrumental in  cultivating Jewish life in Minnesota, and his numerous contributions  have enriched our State as a whole.   Whether by overseeing the founding and establishment of over 30  Jewish institutions in the Midwest or by serving as a counselor and  mentor to those seeking to grow closer to their faith, Rabbi Feller  unwaveringly answers the call.   With his remarks this morning, Rabbi Feller offered a clarion  reminder  [[Page S188]]  that the work we do in this body, to pass just laws, is not just  important--it is sacred. I will be holding his words close to my heart,  and I am sure my esteemed colleagues will be doing the same.   Thank you to Rabbi Moshe Feller for joining us this morning. I look  forward to seeing you back in Minnesota.                            ____________________
