 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   One of my predecessors--a good friend and mentor--was Bill Frenzel.  He was the last Minnesotan to serve on the Ways and Means Committee  when tax reform was passed. It was 1986.   In the 31 years since then, our Tax Code has been one of the most  complicated, unfair, and most uncompetitive in the world. It has led to  a stagnant economy with sluggish growth, with America losing our  manufacturing, our jobs, our innovation, and our headquarters overseas.   But today, that all changes. Today, we will pass and give Minnesota  employers the confidence and the capital that they need to grow their  businesses, to hire more workers, and to give their employees a raise.   This provides middle-income families with tax cuts they need to save  for their future and improve their standard of living. This helps real  people with real needs.   Mr. Speaker, tax reform for me is about one thing and one thing only:  it is about restoring the hope for a prosperous future for ourselves,  our parents, and, most importantly, our children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the report.    Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, the National Park Foundation  was established by Congress and President Johnson.   The National Park Foundation is the official charity of America's  national parks and the nonprofit partner to the National Park Service.  For 50 years, they have raised funds, private funds, to help protect  more than 84 million acres of national parks through critical  conservation and preservation efforts.   The National Park Foundation has helped safeguard our heritage and  engage that next generation of national park enthusiasts by connecting  us to the parks right in our own backyard. Although they haven't been  around as long as the National Park Service, they have played an  important role in strengthening and enhancing our parks.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to thank the National Park  Foundation for its work to help protect and preserve the crown jewels  of America, our national parks, monuments, and battlefields. Our  country looks forward to another 50 years of your great work.                            ____________________
