 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of securing  the Internet of Things through the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of  2020.   Every second of the day, more devices are connecting to the internet,  and the amount of data we put online through these devices grows. The  Internet of Things is the world in which all these devices and  information live. The Internet of Things is the world where devices  work together to make our lives easier. The Internet of Things is a  world where we are always connected.   IoT devices are improving our society. IoT devices are improving our  economy. IoT devices are improving healthcare systems, shopping  experiences, and just about every other aspect of our lives. The  Internet of Things is showing just how innovative humans can be.   But, like most innovations, IoT has the potential to be misused and  abused by bad actors.   The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency has called IoT  devices one of ``the most important emerging cyber threats to our  national security.''   If our security practices for using the Internet of Things does not  evolve as our use of it grows, then we will find out how innovative  criminals, hackers, and hostile foreign governments can be.   Securing the Internet of Things is something Congress can actually  address, and we are doing just that with the IoT Cybersecurity  Improvement Act. The bill reduces the risks associated with introducing  new devices into the Federal Government's digital infrastructure. We  achieve this goal by establishing minimum security requirements for the  supply chain that is used to purchase devices that will be used on  government systems.   The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act will ensure that taxpayer  dollars are only being used to purchase IoT devices that meet basic  minimum security requirements. We are taking simple steps to secure our  supply chain and protect Americans' personal data and information.   We can take advantage of technology before it takes advantage of us,  and one way we accomplish this feat is by passing this piece of  legislation that will mitigate vulnerabilities that IoT devices might  introduce into Federal networks.   What we are about to do today wouldn't have been possible without my  friend and partner from the great State of Illinois, Representative  Robin Kelly. We have had a lot of fun together and passed a lot of  legislation together.   I want to also thank the Committee on Oversight and Reform staff for  helping to perfect this legislation. If it weren't for you all, we  couldn't have gotten to this point.   I hope all of our colleagues join us in supporting this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4785,  which will honor the bravery of Lance Corporal Rhonald Dain Rairdan,  who died serving his country in Iraq.   Dain, as he was called by his friends and family, grew up in an Air  Force family, moving to and living in many places around the country,  but his adopted hometown was Castroville, Texas.   It was in Castroville that Dain joined the Air Force JROTC program at  Medina Valley High School. It was here that he realized his passion for  service and, in 2005, joined the U.S. Marine Corps.   According to his friends and family, being a marine was what he  wanted to do his whole life. Four months after joining the Corps, Dain  deployed to the Middle East, where his unit was tasked with hunting for  weapon stockpiles and policing damaged cities as residents tried to  regain a sense of normalcy.   Tragically, on what was supposed to be his last mission before  leaving Iraq, Dain and 30 other servicemembers were killed when their  helicopter crashed in western Iraq.                                time  1700    With that crash, we lost so many brave, incredible American patriots  who embodied Semper Fidelis--Always Faithful.   This was true for Dain especially. His commitment to his country left  an unwavering impact on the lives of those who knew or served with him.  He made his country, family, and friends proud.   While his legacy will undoubtedly live on through his family and all  those who knew him, the renaming of the Castroville, Texas, Post Office  in his name will forever enshrine his love of our great Nation.   I thank every one of my Texas colleagues for joining me in this  bipartisan effort to allow folks in Castroville to remember Lance  Corporal Rairdan, and I hope the rest of my colleagues in this Chamber  will do the same.   As we reflect on the bravery of one man who gave everything for  country, let's remember that our mission in the Middle East isn't  finished. He died for this mission, and we must ensure it is complete.   God bless all of our servicemen and -women.
