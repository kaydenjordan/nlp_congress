 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of three critical pieces of legislation that are in the House this  week. I proudly endorsed and cosponsored all three of them to keep our  promise to essential workers and support communities across the  country. It is time for Congress to start delivering the results that  we have promised to the American people.   First, I will begin by praising the passage of H.R. 2499, the Federal  Firefighters Fairness Act of 2022. There are over 15,000 firefighters  employed by the Federal Government. Each of them is at greater risk of  developing illnesses due to their job. These hazards include diesel  emissions, carbon monoxide, and other cancer-causing chemicals released  by fires that they combat on a regular basis.   Madam Speaker, 48 States have compensation laws that provide  firefighters with a presumption that certain diseases were contracted  on the job. However, no such rule applies so far to Federal  firefighters, and it is time we correct this wrong and stand behind the  brave men and women who protect us.   I also urge the passage of H.R. 903, the Rights for the  Transportation Security Administration Workforce Act. 365 days a year,  TSA agents across the country ensure safe travel to all of us. Despite  working through the COVID-19 pandemic and government shutdowns, agents  face stagnant pay.   These brave men and women deserve better, which is why I am a proud  cosponsor of H.R. 903. This legislation will put TSA agents on a level  playing field with other Federal employees, and we need to do this  today.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 5129, the  Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022. This bill  reauthorizes the community services block grants for the next 10 years  that improve the lives of Americans across the country and have done so  much in my district. Just this year, over $3 million of these grants  helped improve the lives of communities in south Texas in my district.   This is a product of the War on Poverty. These grants support poverty  reduction, increase in health access, and many other benefits. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation and continue the  program for south Texans and Americans across this country.   I urge the House to pass these bipartisan pieces of legislation so we  can get them to the President's desk.                            ____________________
