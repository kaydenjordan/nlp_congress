 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 635, line 9, after the first dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.        Page 636, line 17, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $30,000,000)''.        Page 643, line 11, after the first dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $535,184,000)''.        Page 643, line 15, after the dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $535,184,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Jayapal) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment will eliminate $535 million  in new funding for ICE officers and provide $30 million to the DHS  Office of Inspector General and $10 million to the Office for Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties. Simply put, my amendment makes it clear  that we must increase oversight and accountability over the Department  of Homeland Security.   Reports of unlawful turnbacks of asylum seekers have only increased.  The May 2017 Human Rights First report, ``Crossing the Line,'' flagged  125 incidents where asylum seekers were denied full access to the  process. Just last month, the American Immigration Council and others  filed a class action lawsuit challenging CBP's continued practice of  turning back asylum seekers requesting protection at ports of entry.   The Trump administration's anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy appear  to have emboldened the CBP practice. CBP personnel also reportedly  stated: ``Donald Trump just signed new laws saying there is no asylum  for anyone . . . `'   We have also heard reports of CBP turning away asylum seeks through  threats, coercion, and intimidation. CBP reportedly threatened to take  away asylum seekers' children unless they left the port of entry and  let loose dogs unless they exited the port of entry.   We have also heard CBP turning away asylum seekers through verbal and  physical abuse. CBP reportedly threw an asylum seeker's 6-year-old  daughter to the ground and knocked a transgender asylum seeker to the  floor and then stepped on her neck.   These are not only unconscionable, Mr. Chairman, they may violate  U.S. and international law. They violate the Immigration and  Nationality Act, which guarantees the right of an individual present  within the United States or arriving at a U.S. port of entry to apply  for asylum.   Also, they may violate the principle of non-refoulement, articulated  in the 1951 Refugee Convention and enshrined in U.S. law in the 1967  Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. This prohibits the return  of asylum seekers to a country where their lives or freedom would be  threatened on account of protected ground.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Roybal-Allard), ranking member of the Homeland Security  Appropriations Subcommittee.                                time  2345    Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my strong support  for the gentlewoman's amendment. As I said during general debate, the  increases of the bill for ICE's enforcement, detention, and removal  operations are excessive. They support an overly aggressive immigration  enforcement approach that is tearing apart families and communities,  and it is unnecessary for national security or public safety.   The cut to ICE operations in support by this amendment would leave  sufficient funding for ICE to carry out its responsibilities humanely  and fairly, and the increases the amendment proposes for the Office of  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Inspector  General are clearly needed to ensure appropriate oversight of the  Department's activities. I urge my colleagues to support the Jayapal  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to just remind my colleagues  again that ICE has plenty of money to carry out their activities. What  we are asking for through this amendment is to have some oversight and  accountability to make sure that we are not seeing the kind of abuse  and turn backs that we have been seeing.   Let me just remind my colleagues of the grave and critical need on  one level to address sexual assault and abuse in detention.   Between May 2014 and July 2016, the Office of the Inspector General  received, at minimum, 1,016 reports of sexual abuse and detention. In  other words, they received more than one complaint of sexual abuse each  day over the course of 26 months. According to CIVIC, a detention  watchdog, only 2.4 percent of those complaints were investigated.   So I could go on, Mr. Chairman, but I think what this amendment is  trying to say is we desperately need to ensure that we use the funds  that we are appropriating here, the funds that we are taking away, in  order to make sure that we have accountability for the Department of  Homeland Security, and to make sure, for example, that when we have  Prison Rape Elimination Act regulations to prevent sexual assault in  immigration detention, that we have adequate funding to the Department  of Homeland Security's Civil Rights and Civil Liberties department so  that they can carry out the audits to ensure that immigration detention  facilities are in compliance with those regulations.   Mr. Chairman, I hope that my colleagues will accept that we still are  going to have plenty of money for ICE to do its job, but we want to  make sure we have accountability.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division E (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used for the construction or expansion of detention       facilities.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Jayapal) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.                                time  0110     Mr. Chairman, the United States already operates the  largest immigration detention system in the world at a cost of $2  billion annually. In fiscal year 2017, ICE had the capacity to detain  an unprecedented 39,324 men, women, and children. Although a large  amount of funding is dedicated to detain these people, the system is  plagued with inhumane conditions and inadequate oversight. Mr.  Chairman, my amendment imposes a moratorium on the construction and  expansion of immigration detention facilities.   This year, we are seeing the highest number of deaths in ICE custody  since 2011. Private, for-profit detention facilities in particular have  not abided by basic standards necessary to protect civil and  constitutional rights, and all of this is occurring at the same time  that the administration is increasing enforcement, including expedited  removals with inadequate due process, elimination of the longstanding  division between local police and Federal immigration enforcement, and  this is all tearing families apart.   The overreach of these detention facilities combined with an  overreach on enforcement in general, instead of focussing on more  practical, humane, and, frankly, economically viable options of  alternatives to detention, are issues that Congress must address.   We should not be funding these dangerous overreaches by expanding  immigration detention with no accountability. This amendment ensures  that we focus on fixing this broken system as opposed to funding an  increased detention expansion, and this is deadly. It is a deadly  powder keg, and I don't use the term ``deadly'' lightly.   I would like to take a moment to talk about Jacinta Morales, a woman  from Oregon detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma,  Washington. Jacinta found out she was pregnant while she was in  detention. She said: I was thrilled to be pregnant and thrilled at the  prospect of being a mother again.   When she found out she would be deported, torn from her 11-year-old  U.S. citizen son as well as her long-time partner, Jacinta was  devastated. She experienced pain and nausea, and not long after, she  woke up bleeding. After an hour, she went to the doctor, where she  waited another hour. One of the people who was seen before her had a  toothache.   When the doctor finally saw her, they requested an ambulance to take  her to the hospital, but the ambulance didn't come for a long time, and  so they took her in the back of a patrol car where she was forced to  sit up, making the bleeding worse. When Jacinta finally arrived at the  hospital, she learned she had a miscarriage.   Jacinta is one of 292 pregnant women ICE detained between January and  [[Page H7085]]  April of 2017, alone, and part of the 60 percent of detained women.  Formerly detained women and their attorneys and advocates have reported  that pregnant women only receive the bare minimum of services and  accommodations and are routinely denied extra blankets, additional  food, and adequate prenatal care.   When pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians, ICE policy  does not prohibit the shackling of pregnant women during transport.  Moreover, the stress of detention and fear of miscarriage may lead  detained women to abandon their asylum claims.   One of these women, I am going to call her Ana, accepted deportation  back into the hands of her abuser because she was so afraid that being  detained would harm her unborn child.   ICE's own detention standards and directive on the detention of  pregnant women acknowledges the complexity and risks of detaining  pregnant women, but implementation and oversight are not enough to  protect these women.   It is irresponsible to expand detention while the agency struggles to  conduct even basic oversight and hold facilities accountable for  inhumane conditions. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington has 45 seconds  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington has 45 seconds  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I will just say that we currently have  almost 40,000 people in detention. We are not proposing eliminating all  detention centers. We are saying we are putting a moratorium on  expansion of detention centers. Those people would still be able to  stay there. We could detain up to that many people.   I don't think that is the right policy for the United States of  America, but I am not saying that we are going to eliminate all of that  detention space. What I am saying is that we need accountability around  the detention system, and as long as we don't have that accountability  and we have pregnant women who are losing children in the ICE detention  facilities, I believe that we should ensure that we have  accountability.   I will tell you that we are continuing to detain and not hold these  detention centers accountable for any of the things that happen within  the detention centers, so, again, I hope that my colleagues will  support this amendment and allow us to bring some accountability back  to our detention system.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 85 Offered by Mr. Zeldin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 85  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
