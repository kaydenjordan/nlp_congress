 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3684, which is  nothing more than the Green New Deal in disguise. Whether it is  creating dozens of new government programs or propping up failed  passenger rail projects, the House Democrats' my-way-or-the-highway  bill is bloated Big Government at its worst.                                time  1730    Democrats blocked every Republican attempt to improve the bill,  including my amendment in committee that would stop taxpayer dollars  for funding art through transit projects.   H.R. 3684 also bends the knee to Beijing, allowing communist China to  profit off American investments in electric vehicles.   There is plenty of room for commonsense, bipartisan efforts on actual  transportation infrastructure: Fixing roads and bridges, repairing  airports, and even responsible investments in broadband.   But the majority is intent on ignoring these bipartisan prospects  with irresponsible spending on socialism and driving up debt on the  backs of American taxpayers.   I reject H.R. 3684, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Madam Speaker, for 6 years, a bipartisan agreement in the  last surface transportation reauthorization prohibited transit funds  going to nontransportation, art-related aspects in federally funded  transit projects. The majority's bill ends that bipartisan agreement  and allows for the diversion of transportation infrastructure funding  to ancillary and unnecessary art projects. My amendment would keep this  prohibition in place so that transportation infrastructure funding goes  to actual infrastructure projects.   Both Republicans and Democrats agree there is a real need for  investments in critical infrastructure, though the majority is  attempting to expand the definition of infrastructure to include  virtually anything.   Rerouting these investments to unnecessary art projects or to pay for  artists on the project design team is a misuse of taxpayer dollars. We  need to focus on repairs for roads and bridges, not feel-good frescoes  and metro station murals.   The amendment will allow excess transit funding to be directed toward  improving our highway systems.   My colleague from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  today suggested that if the Soviet Union could have artwork as part of  their infrastructure projects, the United States can as well. I am not  sure we should be taking infrastructure advice from the bankrupt nation  that gave us the Chernobyl incident. And the comparison to the Soviet  Union is unintentionally appropriate: This bill is bloated with  socialist policies.   Simply put, this amendment makes sure that infrastructure funds are  used to fund actual infrastructure. A vote against this amendment  codifies art as infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to  prohibit Federal funding for unnecessary art projects.    Mr. Speaker, Americans depend on basic infrastructure to  get to work and go about their daily lives, but our infrastructure is  crumbling.   The majority's bill proposes spending $715 billion over 5 years to  make a transformational investment in our infrastructure, including  more than $109 billion on transit. That is an extraordinary amount,  especially after all the relief we have provided transit agencies over  the last year, nearly $70 billion in total.                                time  2240    For now, let's ignore the fact that none of this bill is paid for,  because instead of concentrating our taxpayer resources on real  infrastructure, the majority thinks we have the luxury of spending  these resources on art, sculptures, and nonfunctional landscaping.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how many times we have to say that art is  not infrastructure. It does not provide mobility. It doesn't get you to  work or to the store. Our limited resources for transportation should  not be wasted on art. That is why this body in the FAST Act put in  place a bipartisan ban to prevent wasting our valuable transportation  dollars on nonfunctional art.  [[Page H3574]]    Interestingly, it seems that some on the other side still agree. Just  a few hours ago, the Democratic leadership tried to allow a vote on  restoring this commonsense ban but failed. This was an interesting  development, particularly since I offered an amendment during the  committee markup 3 weeks ago to ensure we keep the ban in place. Of  course, given this partisan process, the majority voted against my  committee amendment.   Throughout this whole process, the majority has turned its back on  bipartisanship and commonsense. My amendment now will keep in place  2015 the protection against wasting transportation money on art. We  simply can't afford to decorate the walls when the house is crumbling.  We shouldn't be putting art before the horse. It doesn't even pass the  laugh test that the majority continues to defend this policy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.
