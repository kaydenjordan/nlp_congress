 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration imposed sanctions  on Russian energy imports. Biden finally listened to Republicans, but  it means nothing if he is unwilling to take action to restore American  energy independence today.   The alternative is President Biden begging countries like Venezuela,  Saudi Arabia, and Iran for energy, in which case, all we have done is  trade one tyrant for another. It is clear what we must do to lower  energy costs: open the Keystone XL pipeline, encourage expedited  permits, allow leasing on Federal lands.   It is unclear whether this administration is willing to put aside its  Green New Deal pipe dream to make it happen. It is absolutely shameful  that the President would rather make deals with our adversaries than  build the Keystone XL pipeline or remove burdensome regulations on  America's energy producers.   Under every single circumstance, Biden has chosen foreign energy over  American energy, adversarial nations over the American people. That is  the definition of America last. It is time to put America first.                            ____________________
