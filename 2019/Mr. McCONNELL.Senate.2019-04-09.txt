 Later today, the Senate will vote to advance the  nomination of Daniel Domenico to serve as U.S. District Judge for the  District of Colorado.   After we vote on his confirmation, we will do the same for Patrick  Wyrick, nominated to a vacancy in the Western District of Oklahoma.   Mr. Wyrick is a two-time graduate of the University of Oklahoma and  held a clerkship in the Eastern District of Oklahoma at the outset of  his legal career. That career included time in private practice, as the  State's Solicitor General and, most recently, as Associate Justice of  the Oklahoma Supreme Court.   I am sorry to say that this week will mark 1 year since Mr. Wyrick's  nomination was first received in the Senate. I hope each of my  colleagues will join me in long-overdue support for its prompt  consideration on the floor.   Over the course of the week, as I have outlined, we will consider  four other well-qualified nominees who have been waiting on the  Executive Calendar for far too long. We will build on the action taken  last week to restore some reason and sanity to the nominations process,  which has suffered in recent years under the burden of partisan  obstruction.   Before the week is through, we will also turn to the nomination of  David Bernhardt to lead the Department of the Interior. The Senate has  confirmed Mr. Bernhardt twice before to serve that Department as Deputy  Secretary and as Solicitor. When you hear the nominee and review his  credentials, it is easy to see why. Mr. Bernhardt has significant  private practice experience, as well as a past record of service at the  Department.   Along the way he has earned the respect of those who rely on the  public lands the Department of the Interior is charged to oversee, from  Native American leaders to sportsmen's groups. He has been praised as a  ``proven leader'' who ``act[s] with integrity'' and has ``the right  approach and skill set.''   I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to confirm him  later this week.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Wyrick nomination expire at 5:30, Tuesday,  April 9; further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask unanimous  consent that the mandatory quorum call with respect to the Stanton  nomination be waived; finally, that notwithstanding the provisions of  rule XXII, the cloture motion on the Abizaid nomination be withdrawn  and the Senate vote on his confirmation at a time to be determined by  the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, on  April 10, 2019.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony, documents, and  representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for evidence in a  criminal action pending in Florida Federal district court. In this  action the defendant is charged with threatening to assault and murder  Senator Sanders in voicemails he left with the Senator's Burlington,  Vermont office. A trial is scheduled for April 29, 2019.   The prosecution is seeking testimony from one of the Senator's staff  assistants who listened to the voicemails at issue. Senator Sanders  would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant  employee testimony and documents from his office.   The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other  current or former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant  evidence may be necessary, to testify and produce documents in this  action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel of such  staffers and Senator Sanders.                            ____________________
