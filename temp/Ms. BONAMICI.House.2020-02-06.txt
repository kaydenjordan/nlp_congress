 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Gun  Violence Survivors Week and to honor and support the Oregonians and  people across the country who have been affected by gun violence.   Gun violence is a public health crisis in this country. Each year,  more than 36,000 people, nationwide, including almost 500 Oregonians,  are killed by guns, and more than 100,000 people across the country are  injured by gunfire.   For those survivors of gun violence and the friends and families of  those killed, life will never be the same.   Nobody is immune to the threat of gun violence, and communities have  been forced to take what should be unthinkable steps to protect  themselves.   Parents are buying bulletproof backpacks for their young children.   Schools across the country are conducting active-shooter drills to  make sure their students know what to do in the event of an attack.  These drills often cause trauma for students and for educators.   At a townhall meeting, a student told me the first thing she does  when she goes into a classroom is she looks where to hide and how to  escape.   As a mom, this is heartbreaking; as a policymaker, it is  unacceptable. Kids in classrooms should be focused on learning, not  being fearful for their lives. This is not normal, and it should never  be normal.   But there is reason to be hopeful. Families and communities in Oregon  and around the country are rising up and demanding change. Students are  demanding that Congress finally take action to protect them.   This Congress, we took the critical step of passing H.R. 8, a  comprehensive bipartisan background check bill that will save lives if  it is enacted. I call on Leader McConnell to immediately bring H.R. 8  to the floor. We cannot wait any longer. Every day this bill languishes  in the Senate is another day when people are dying in Oregon and around  the country.   We will not rest until we have done all we can to reduce gun violence  in this country. We owe it to the children who are looking for a place  to hide in the classrooms; we owe it to the families who are mourning  their loved ones  [[Page H853]]  they have lost; and we owe it to the communities that are forever  changed by gun violence.   I stand in solidarity with the survivors of gun violence.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Income inequality is challenging our communities and our future. In  northwest Oregon and across the country, the labor movement has helped  fight income inequality, raise wages, improve working conditions, and  expand benefits.   More workers would join a union if given a choice, but many feel  retaliation for supporting or engaging in organizing efforts. Under  current law, tactics to intimidate, coerce, or fire workers involved in  union organizing are illegal, but the penalties aren't strong enough to  deter employers.   I helped ban captive audience meetings when I served in the Oregon  legislature, but these rights should be protected for every worker in  the country. We should be making it easier, not harder, for workers to  form unions and collectively bargain.   I am an original cosponsor of Chairman Scott's Protecting the Right  to Organize Act. Under this bill, employers who break the rules will  finally be held accountable.   Today, by supporting the bipartisan PRO Act, we can support workers,  restore fairness, and help to make sure our economy works for everyone.   Mr. Chairman, I insert in the Record letters in support of the PRO  Act from the BlueGreen Alliance and more than 70 environmental groups.                            BlueGreen Alliance, January 31, 2020.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: As a coalition of       some of the nation's largest labor unions and environmental       organizations, collectively representing millions of members       and supporters, we write to express the BlueGreen Alliance's       support for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of       2019, H.R. 2474.        In the United States, we face a critical juncture for the       rights of employees to organize. As Supreme Court cases and       anti-union legislators and their financial backers seek to       strip workers of their rights, we need a strong law on the       books to ensure that workers are not penalized for organizing       and demanding collective bargaining for higher wages, safer       working conditions, and better benefits.        Union membership has fallen dramatically from 33 percent in       1956 to ten percent in 2018, due in large part to       exploitation by employers of labor laws that have been made       toothless. As it stands, no meaningful penalties exist for       corporations using illegal tactics to eliminate the option to       organize.        Additionally, workers now are facing record wage       inequality, and we know based on the National Bureau of       Economic Research's statistics that unions consistently       provide working Americans with ten to twenty percent higher       wages than non-unionized workers. Empowering workers to band       together to negotiate better wages and safer working       conditions is the best path forward to protecting our workers       and rebuilding America's middle class.        Organizing does not just affect job quality, though:       unionized workers are better equipped to handle potentially       hazardous workplace situations, and have more freedom to blow       the whistle in dangerous situations. This can avert       industrial accidents and result in safer communities, as well       as cleaner air and water. Many unions also take firm       positions on environmental issues because they understand the       impact that clean air and water have on workers. Unions have       supported the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other       actions designed to both reduce the carbon pollution driving       climate change and grow good-paying jobs in the clean       economy.        The PRO Act empowers employees by strengthening workers'       rights to bargain and to organize. It does so by ending       prohibitions  [[Page H881]]       on collective and class-action litigation, prohibiting       employers from permanently replacing striking employees,       amending how employees are defined so that no one is       misclassified as an independent contractor, strengthening       remedies and enforcement for employees who are exercising       their rights, creating a mediation and arbitration process       for new unions, protecting against coercive captive audience       meetings, and streamlining the National Labor Relations       Board's procedures.        The PRO Act would take tangible steps to stem the tide of       continued violations of the rights of working people to       organize and would provide real consequences for those who       violate the rights of workers. We must restore fairness to       our economy so that workers no longer get a raw deal, and       strengthen the right of workers all over the country to       unionize and bargain for better working conditions.        For these reasons, the BlueGreen Alliance urges you to vote       yes on the PRO Act.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                       Jason Walsh,      Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance.                                   ____                                                    5 February 2020.        Dear Representative: As organizations dedicated to a       sustainable future, we believe that such a future must       include fair treatment for the people and communities working       to build a clean and thriving economy. For that reason, we       support H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO)       Act, and urge you to vote in favor of the bill when it comes       before the House this week.        Since 1970, global carbon dioxide emissions have nearly       doubled, spiking the frequency and intensity of natural       disasters, increasing the risk of drought, and putting the       future of our entire planet at risk. Over that same period,       income and wealth inequality have exploded in the United       States and elsewhere--incomes have risen by 229% in the U.S.       for the top 1% of earners since 1979, while the bottom 90% of       households have seen income growth of just 46%, or 1% on an       annual basis. These parallel trends reflect an economy built       to serve the interests of a small group of the extremely       wealthy and powerful, not people or the planet.        One key element of fixing our broken economic system is       ensuring that working people have a voice in the economy and       earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Workers are       often unable to have their voices heard or to earn fair pay,       a function of weak labor laws that have made it virtually       impossible for workers to organize and form unions in the       face of unrelenting, aggressive corporate opposition.        The PRO Act would make common-sense changes to existing law       to enable workers who want to organize and form unions to do       so. It would penalize corporations that break the law, limit       tactics used to intimidate workers, help workers who organize       secure timely collective bargaining agreements, and institute       a number of changes to better enable workers to act in       solidarity with one another.        Remaking our economy and environment to address climate       change and rising inequality will require substantial       investment and transition, across many sectors. This is an       opportunity to create millions of good jobs with family-      sustaining wages and strong worker protections. We need       strong, common-sense worker protections like those in the PRO       Act to ensure that a sustainable economy reverses rather than       reinforces rising inequity. There is no way to build a       greener, more inclusive economy without strong, thriving       labor unions.        Our planet and our communities are under enormous threat.       We must act urgently to confront the dangers imposed by       climate change, including by ensuring that working people are       treated fairly and helping lead the transition to a fair,       green economy. The PRO Act would help advance that goal and       help us rebuild our economy to function for both people and       the planet. Therefore, we urge you to vote in favor of the       PRO Act.
