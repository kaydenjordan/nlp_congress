 Madam Chair, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), for his leadership on this issue.   Souls to the Polls is a bedrock of Florida elections. For my  colleagues who may be unfamiliar, minority communities, particularly  African American and Latino, use Sunday early voting to energize their  communities to make their voices heard. For those without reliable  transportation or with unpredictable work schedules, Sunday voting is  critical and sacred.   This is how a healthy democracy should work, communities organizing  themselves to increase participation, doing their civic duty. Higher  turnout and greater participation strengthen our democracy, giving  elected leaders a stronger, more representative voice.    Unfortunately, some States have targeted Sunday Souls to the Polls  voting. My own State tried to shut it down in 2012.   This amendment would block States from using voter suppression  tactics against Souls to the Polls.   I urge my colleagues to support the Brown-Crist amendment and let the  underlying bill pass.   Let's refresh our democracy, for the people.
