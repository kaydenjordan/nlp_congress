 Mr. Speaker, I have taken three oaths in my lifetime.  The first oath I took was in 1984, as a police officer, when I was  sworn in at the Orlando Police Department. The second oath I took when  I was sworn in as the chief of police. And the third when I became a  Member of the 115th Congress.   Although different positions, each oath stated that I would protect  and defend the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I want  you to know that I have taken each oath very seriously.   I know former FBI Director James Comey understood the enormity of the  oath he took to uphold the Constitution to seek the truth, regardless  of outside influences or political circumstances. His loyalty is to the  United States Constitution.   The American people should have faith that no one--that includes the  President, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Deputy U.S. Attorney  General--should be able to interfere with the proper functioning of the  FBI or its work with local and State law enforcement agencies. It is  the responsibility of Congress to ensure that all our law enforcement  and intelligence agencies are able to fulfill their mission: to protect  and defend the United States and enforce criminal laws as appropriate.  [[Page H4328]]    I filed an amendment with the Rules Committee that would prohibit the  removal of the FBI Director, except for inefficiency, neglect of duty,  or malfeasance in office.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would insulate the FBI's mission from  political influences and agendas. Unfortunately, it appears that the  Republican leadership doesn't think that this is a good idea, or simply  does not want to have this debate.   The rule reported from the Rules Committee prevents me from offering  this important amendment.    Mr. Speaker, if the FBI Director is abiding by the oath  he took, then he should not be removed.
