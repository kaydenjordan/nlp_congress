 Madam President, I want to say a very special thank-you  to my colleague, the Senator from Oregon. Senator Merkley has worked  harder and more persistently on questions about the filibuster and the  procedures of the U.S. Senate for years now and tried to lead us to a  more functional situation than we are in right now. I want to thank him  for his leadership.   I know that tonight must be frustrating for him because he has tried  so hard to get us to a better place. But I very much appreciate all  that he has done, and to the extent we make progress, we make progress  in no small part because of his leadership.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to urge the Senate to take  action to protect voting rights and to defend our democracy. Voting is  foundational to our democracy. In a strong, functioning democracy, the  playing field is level. Citizens have a right to vote, and neither one  side nor the other has the right to block those voters from the ballot  box or from getting their votes counted.   That basic premise no longer holds in America. Let's be blunt.  American democracy is under attack from Republican politicians. In the  past year alone, Republican State legislatures have passed laws in  nearly 20 States to restrict American citizens' right to vote.   The Republican nominees to the Supreme Court have destroyed  longstanding protections against dark money in politics; they have  given the green light to partisan gerrymandering; and they have gutted  the Voting Rights Act. Republican dark money networks are bankrolling  voter suppression efforts with hundreds of millions of dollars in  lobbying and advertising.   And for years and years, Republican Donald Trump and Republican  politicians have spread lies about the integrity of our elections. Last  January 6, a Republican President, backed up by Republicans right here  in this Senate, provoked a deadly insurrection at our Nation's Capitol.   And in the intervening year, Republican leaders have refused to  accept evidence of President Biden's 7 million-vote victory over Donald  Trump. Instead, they have fed conspiracies and lies that further  undermine our democracy.   Yes, American democracy is under attack, and, today, 50 Democratic  Senators agree on the right response to this attack. The Freedom to  Vote Act would guarantee that every American citizen can easily vote  and get their vote counted.   The act would defend against attempts to overturn the will of the  people; the act would reform our broken campaign finance system and  help root out dark money; and, critically important, the act would ban  partisan gerrymandering by either side.   The companion bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,  would restore historic protections against State laws that have the  purpose and the effect of discriminating on the basis of race.   Unfortunately, Senate Republicans would rather destroy our democracy  than have free and fair elections, and so they support those around the  country who are trying to block access to voting and who are trying to  rig how votes get counted.   Elections are about the will of the majority, but the Republicans in  the Senate don't want what a majority of Americans want. In fact, the  50 Republicans in the Senate, together, represent 41\1/2\ million fewer  Americans than the Democratic majority, but instead of taking a simple  vote to protect American citizens' access to the polls, they want to  stop legislation to defend the very foundation of our democracy from  even getting a vote on the floor of the Senate.   Let me be clear. My view on this is that the filibuster has no place  in our democracy. Our Founders believed deeply in protections for the  minority, and those are enshrined in the Constitution and in the  structure of Congress. But our Founders made it clear that, after  extended debate, the majority could always get a vote. And that final  vote--except in the case of treaties and impeachment--would always be  by simple majority. The Founders did not add a filibuster. With two  exceptions, they insisted on plain old majority rule.   When the Senate changed its rules a decade later, the filibuster  became the favored tool of racists and segregationists. The filibuster  preserved Jim Crow laws and stalled civil rights legislation for  decades. The filibuster helped block the passage of anti-lynching  legislation for over 100 years. The filibuster nearly stopped Congress  from passing the most important voting rights law in our Nation's  history--the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Today's filibuster does not foster bipartisanship and compromise. In  fact, the exact opposite is true. The filibuster has been weaponized to  intensify partisan division.   The filibuster is a wicked tool used to kill legislation supported by  the majority of Americans of all political parties, and that is true  for protecting the right to vote and gun safety legislation and  immigration reform and codifying Roe v. Wade.   The filibuster thwarts the will of the people. Today's filibuster  doesn't encourage debate; it promotes power. Senators can torpedo bills  without saying a single word in public or even stepping to the floor of  the U.S. Senate. This is not how a so-called deliberative body should  operate.   Senators should be required to talk and vote instead of hiding behind  a rule. They should have to put skin in the game. If Republicans are  fine with the wave of anti-voter laws being enacted in State after  State, then they should have to come to the floor and make that clear.  If Republicans oppose reinstating the Voting Rights Act that passed in  this Chamber unanimously in 2006, their constituents and the historical  record should know exactly where they stand.   Instead, because of how today's filibuster works, we have two sets of  rules in our country, one for Democrats, who want to promote civil  rights and liberties, and another set for Republicans, who want to take  them away. Republicans who want to close polling places, who want to  limit voting, who want to pass gerrymandered maps are hard at work  doing that right now with simple majorities in State legislatures all  across this country. They face no filibusters to stop them. It is  majority rule all the way.    And here in Washington, when Republicans want to pass massive tax  cuts for billionaires and rig our Tax Code to favor big businesses, an  exception to the filibuster lets them do just that with a simple  majority.   Republicans who want to pack the Supreme Court with extremists  Justices who roll back fundamental rights and who disregard the rule of  law can do that with a simple majority right here in the U.S. Senate.  But a majority of Democratic Senators--again, Democrats who, together,  represent over 40 million more Americans than the Republican Senators-- a majority of Democrats cannot pass legislation to improve the lives of  Americans.   Democrats want to raise the minimum wage; Democrats want to lower the  cost of prescription drugs and healthcare; and Democrats want to  protect the right to vote. But too often we cannot achieve these goals  because the filibuster gives the minority party an almost total veto  over legislation, including the legislation we need to save our  American democracy.   We can't ignore Republicans' attempts to rig free and fair elections  in this country. We can't roll over when Republicans want to make it  harder for Black Americans to vote. We can't look the other way when  Republicans want to make it tough for Latinos and Asian Americans to  vote.  [[Page S268]]    We can't be silent when Republicans make voting harder on Tribal  lands. We can't shrink back when Republicans work to keep students from  voting. We can't turn away when Republicans try to keep working-class  people or anyone who might be more inclined to vote for Democrats--keep  them away from the polls. That is not how democracy works.   In a democracy, the most votes win--period. In a democracy, the  Senate debates, and then the Senate votes. And in a democracy, the  people--not the politicians--decide who will lead the Nation.   This week, the eyes of the Nation and the entire world are on the  U.S. Senate. We can choose to protect the tool of Jim Crow and  segregation that is found nowhere in the Constitution or we can choose  to defend the sacred right to vote.   I urge the Senate to protect our democracy and to protect the right  of every American citizen to vote and to have their vote counted.   Some of our Republican colleagues have made the dishonest claim that  there is no voter suppression crisis, and there is no need for Federal  voting rights legislation. So I would like to enter into the Record a  series of articles that demonstrate the voter suppression taking place  in State after State in this country.   I will start by reminding everyone that the Supreme Court--led by  Chief Justice John Roberts--opened the door to all of these anti-voter  tactics by gutting preclearance from the Voting Rights Act and by  turning its back on equal justice under law.   So first I will read excerpts from an article published in Vox on  July 21, 2021, entitled: ``How America lost its commitment to the right  to vote.''         The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan lamented in a       dissenting opinion earlier this month, ``has treated no       statute worse'' than the Voting Rights Act.        She's right.        The Voting Rights Act is arguably the most successful civil       rights law in [all of] American history. Originally signed in       1965, it was the United States' first serious attempt since       Reconstruction to build a multiracial democracy--and it       worked. Just two years after President Lyndon Johnson signed       the Voting Rights Act into law, Black voter registration . .       . in the Jim Crow stronghold of Mississippi skyrocketed from       6.7 percent to nearly 60 percent.        And yet, in a trio of cases--Shelby County v. Holder [in]       (2013), Abbott v. Perez [in] (2018), and Brnovich v. DNC [in]       (2021)--the Court drained nearly all of the life out of this       landmark civil rights statute.        After Brnovich, the decision that inspired [Justice]       Kagan's statement that the Court has treated the Voting       Rights Act worse than any other federal law, it's unclear       whether the Supreme Court would rule in favor of voting       rights plaintiffs even if [the] state legislature tried to       outright rig an election.        These cases are the culmination of more than half a century       of efforts by conservatives who, after failing to convince       elected lawmakers to weaken voting rights, turned to an       unelected judiciary to enact a policy that would never have       made it through Congress. All of this is bad news for       minority voters in America, who are [the] most likely to be       disadvantaged by many of the new restrictions currently being       pushed in statehouses across America, and for the country's       relatively young commitment to multiracial democracy. And       there are at least three reasons to fear that decisions like       Shelby County and Brnovich foreshadow even more aggressive       attacks on the right to vote.        The first is that Republican partisans can use race as a       proxy to identify communities with large numbers of       Democratic voters. In 2020, according to the Pew Research       Center, 92 percent of non-Hispanic Black voters supported       Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump--and that's       after Trump slightly improved his performance among African       Americans compared to 2016.        That means that state lawmakers who wish to prevent       Democrats from voting can do so through policies that make it       harder for Black voters (and, to a lesser extent, most other       nonwhite voters) to cast a ballot. And Republican lawmakers       haven't been shy about doing so. As a federal appeals court       wrote in 2016 about a North Carolina law that included many       provisions making it harder to vote, ``the new provisions       target African Americans with almost surgical precision.''        An even starker example: Georgia recently enacted a law       that effectively enables the state Republican Party to       disqualify voters and shut down polling precincts. If the       state GOP wields this law to close down most of the polling       places in the highly Democratic, majority-Black city of       Atlanta, it's unclear that a Voting Rights Act that's been       gravely wounded by three Supreme Court decisions remains       vibrant enough to block them.        The second reason to be concerned about decisions like       Brnovich is that the Supreme Court's attacks on the Voting       Rights Act are not isolated. They are part of a greater web       of decisions making it much harder for voting rights       plaintiffs to prevail in court.        These cases include decisions like Purcell v. Gonzalez [in]       (2006), which announced that judges should be very reluctant       to block unlawful state voting rules close to an election;       Crawford v. Marion County Election Board [in] (2008), which       permitted states to enact voting restrictions that target       largely imaginary problems; and Rucho v. Common Cause [in]       (2019), which would ban federal courts from hearing partisan       gerrymandering lawsuits because the Court's GOP-appointed       majority deemed such cases too ``difficult to adjudicate.''        Finally, decisions like Shelby County and Brnovich are       troubling because the Court's reasoning in those opinions       appears completely divorced from the actual text of the       Constitution and from the text of federal laws such as the       Voting Rights Act. Shelby County eliminated the Voting Rights       Act's requirement that states with a history of racist       election practices ``preclear'' any new voting rules with       officials in Washington, DC. It was rooted in what Chief       Justice John Roberts described as ``the principle that all       States enjoy equal sovereignty,'' a principle that is never       mentioned once in the text of the U.S. Constitution.        In Brnovich, the Court upheld two Arizona laws that       disenfranchise voters who vote in the wrong precinct and       limit who can deliver an absentee ballot to a polling place.       [Justice] Alito purports to take ``a fresh look at the       statutory text'' in this case. But he imposes new limits on       the Voting Rights Act--such as a strong presumption that       voting restrictions that were in place in 1982 are lawful, or       a similar presumption favoring state laws purporting to       prevent voter fraud--[qualifications] which have no basis       whatsoever in the law's text.        As [Justice] Kagan writes in dissent, Brnovich ``mostly       inhabits a law-free zone.''        That doesn't necessarily mean that this Supreme Court will       allow any restriction on voting to stand--under the most       optimistic reading of cases like Brnovich, the Court might       still intervene if Georgia tries to close down most of the       polling places in Atlanta--but it does mean that voting       rights lawyers and their clients can no longer expect to win       their cases simply because Congress passed a law protecting       their right to vote.        The rules in American elections are now what [Justice]       Roberts and his five even more conservative colleagues say       they are--not what the Constitution or any act of Congress       has to say about voting rights.    Mr. President, Republicans are not just content with making it harder  to vote. They are also passing State laws allowing them to replace  local election officials with those who will administer elections in  their favor. Unsurprisingly, they are targeting areas with huge Black  populations, like Atlanta, that helped determine the outcome of the  2020 election cycle.   And they are targeting smaller places, too. As described in an  article published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on December 29,  2021, entitled ``New Election Board in Lincoln County Seeks Central  Voting Site,'' a replacement elections board is planning to close all  seven polling places in Lincoln County, north of Augusta, requiring in- person voters to report to one centralized location. The poll closures  would reduce voting access for rural residents, who would have to drive  15 miles or more to cast a ballot in a county with no public  transportation option, leading to opposition from voting rights  advocates.   The plan is moving forward after a State law passed this year  abolished the previous county elections board and gave a majority of  appointments to the Republican county commissioner. Now, Lincoln is one  of six counties where the Republican-controlled Georgia General  Assembly reorganized local elections boards.   ``This is about the powerful flexing their muscles and saying, `We  can do whatever we want to do and who is going to stop us?' '' said the  Reverend Denise Freeman, who is organizing Lincoln voters to oppose the  poll closures. She goes on to say: ``In Lincoln County, it's always  been about power and control.''   The remade board is the same as before, with one exception: A  Democratic Party appointee was replaced by an appointee of the county  commission, whose five members are all Republicans. The elections board  could vote on the poll closure plan on January 19.   ``Folks should have access to their polling locations. They should be  able to vote without having to drive 30 minutes to get there,'' said  Cindy Battles of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a civil  rights group that has been collecting voter signatures for a petition  drive to try to stop the closures.   There is no public transportation available in Lincoln County, nor  are  [[Page S269]]  there taxis, Uber or Lyft. Anyone who wants to vote would have to drive  or walk to a polling place, or return an absentee ballot. Turnout  decreases when voters have to travel farther to cast a ballot,  according to a statistical analysis by the Atlanta Journal- Constitution.   Polling places can be closed by a majority vote in Lincoln County,  and the Federal Government has no oversight role. A 2013 U.S. Supreme  Court decision removed the requirements of the Voting Rights Act for  States with a history of discrimination, including Georgia, to obtain  Federal preclearance before making changes to voting practices and  locations.    And what happened?   County election boards closed 214 precincts across Georgia between  2012 and 2018. That is nearly 8 percent of the State's total polling  places, according to a count by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.   Mr. President, Republican efforts have already succeeded at  disenfranchising voters, especially Black voters. So I now want to  share the impact that limiting polling places had on voters during the  last Presidential election in Georgia, using an excerpt from an NPR  article published on October 17, 2020, entitled ``Why Do Nonwhite  Georgia Voters Have to Wait in Line for Hours? Too Few Polling  Places.''   Here is the story:         Kathy spotted the long line of voters as she pulled into       the Christian City Welcome Center about 3:30 p.m., ready to       cast her ballot in the June 9 primary election.        Hundreds of people were waiting in the heat and rain       outside the lush, tree-lined complex in Union City, an       Atlanta suburb with 22,400 residents, nearly 88% of them       Black. She briefly considered not casting a ballot at all,       but she decided to stay.        By the time she got inside more than five hours later, five       hours later, the polls had officially closed and the       electronic scanners were all shut down. Poll workers told her       she would have to cast a provisional ballot, but they       promised that her vote would be counted.        ``I'm now angry again, I'm frustrated again, and now I have       an added emotion, which is anxiety,'' said Kathy, a human       services worker, recalling her emotions at the time. She       asked that her full name not be used because she fears       repercussions from speaking out. ``I'm wondering if my ballot       is going to count.''        By the time the last voter finally got inside the welcome       center to cast a ballot, it was the next day, June 10.        The clogged polling locations in metro Atlanta reflect an       underlying pattern: the number of places to vote has shrunk       statewide, with little recourse. Although the reduction in       polling places has taken place across racial lines, it has       primarily caused long lines in nonwhite neighborhoods where       voter registration has surged and more residents cast ballots       in person on Election Day. The pruning of polling places       started long before the pandemic, which has discouraged       people from voting in person.        In Georgia, which is considered a battleground State for       control of the White House and U.S. Senate, the difficulty of       voting in Black communities like Union City could possibly       tip the results on November 3. With massive turnout expected,       lines could be even longer than they were for the primary,       despite a rise in mail-in voting and Georgians already       turning out by the hundreds of thousands to cast ballots       early.    Since the U.S. Supreme Court's Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013  eliminated key federal oversight of election decisions in states with  histories of discrimination, Georgia's voter rolls have grown by nearly  2 million people, yet polling locations have been cut statewide by  nearly 10%, [this is] according to an analysis of state and local  records by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica. Much of the  growth has been fueled by younger, nonwhite voters, especially in nine  metro Atlanta counties, where four out of five new voters were  nonwhite, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.         The metro Atlanta area has been hit particularly hard. The       nine counties--Fulton, Gwinnett, Forsyth, DeKalb, Cobb, Hall,       Cherokee, Henry and Clayton--have nearly half the state's       active voters but only 38% of the polling places, according       to the analysis.        As a result, the average number of voters packed into each       polling location in those counties grew by nearly 40%, from       about 2,600 in 2012 to more than 3,600 per polling place as       of October 9. In addition, a last-minute push that opened       more than 90 polling places just weeks before the November       election has left many voters uncertain about where to vote       or how long they might have to wait to cast a ballot.        The growth of registered voters has outstripped the number       of available polling places in both predominantly White and       Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote have been longer       in Black areas, because Black voters are more likely than       Whites to cast their ballots in person on Election Day and       they are more reluctant to vote by mail, according to U.S.       census data and recent studies. Georgia Public Broadcasting/      ProPublica found that about two-thirds of the polling places       that had to stay open late for the June primary to       accommodate waiting voters were in majority-Black       neighborhoods, even though those neighborhoods made up only       about one-third of the State's polling places.    An analysis by Stanford University political science professor  Jonathan Roddin of the data that was collected by the Georgia Public  Broadcasting/ProPublica found that the average wait time after 7 p.m.  across Georgia was 51 minutes in polling places that were 90% or more  nonwhite.   That is 51 minutes in polling places that were 90 percent or more  non-White, but only 6 minutes in polling places that were 90 percent  White.   Georgia law sets a cap of 2,000 voters for a polling place that has  experienced significant voter delays, but that limit is rarely, if  ever, enforced. Our analysis found that, in both majority Black and  majority White neighborhoods, about 9 out of every 10 precincts are  assigned to polling places with more than 2,000 people.   A June 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New  York University Law Center found that the average number of voters  assigned to a polling place has grown in the past 5 years in Georgia,  Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina--all States with substantial  Black populations that, before the Supreme Court's Shelby decision,  needed Federal approval to close polling places under the Voting Rights  Act, and though dozens of States have regulations on the size of voting  precincts and polling places or the number of voting machines, the  analysis found that many jurisdictions simply do not abide by them.   Georgia's State leadership and election officials have largely  ignored complaints about poll consolidations, even as they tout record  growth in voter registration. As secretary of state from 2010 to 2018,  when most of Georgia's poll closures occurred, Brian Kemp, now the  Governor, took a laissez-faire attitude toward county-run election  practices, save for a 2015 document that spelled out methods officials  could use to shutter polling places to show ``how the change can  benefit voters and the public interest.''   Kemp's office declined to comment Thursday on the letter or as to why  poll closures went unchallenged by State officials. His spokesperson  referred to his previous statements that he did not encourage officials  to close polling places but merely offered guidance on how to follow  the law.   The inaction has left Black voters in Georgia facing barriers  reminiscent of Jim Crow laws, said Adrienne Jones, a political science  professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta, who has studied the impact  of the landmark Shelby decision on Black voters. Voter suppression ``is  happening with these voter impediments that are being imposed,'' Jones  said. ``You're closing down polling places so people have a more  difficult time getting there. You're making vote-by-mail difficult or  confusing. Now we're in court arguing about which ballots are going to  be accepted, and it means that people have less trust in our state.''   Despite false Republican claims to the contrary, voter ID laws  disproportionately harm people of color, rural Americans, and poor  Americans.   I now want to read an article from ABC News. They published it on  October 5, 2021. It tells the story of Texas voter ID laws, and it is  entitled ``Black woman in rural Texas struggles with process to vote,  advocates say system is unfair.''         While voters across Texas submitted voter registration       applications on Monday, October 4, ahead of the Nov. 2       statewide election, 82-year-old Elmira Hicks worried she       would not be able to have her vote counted.        The Oakwood, Texas, native said she hasn't been able to       renew her driver's license for more than a year because she       has been unable to present the required birth certificate       needed to verify her identity.        In the Lone Star State, election laws require voters to       present a driver's license, passport, military identification       card, citizenship certificate, state election identification       certificate or a personal identification card to cast a       ballot in person.        A person does not need an ID to register to vote, or to       vote by mail in the state of Texas.  [[Page S270]]         For voters ages 70 and over, an otherwise valid form of ID       may be presented when casting a ballot, even if it's expired,       according to the office of the . . . Secretary of State.        If a voter does not possess or cannot reasonably obtain one       of the seven acceptable forms of photo ID, the voter may file       a Reasonable Impediment Declaration and present a supporting       form of ID, [like] a bank statement, current utility bill,       paycheck or government check.        Hicks and her daughter, Jonita White, said they were       unaware of the RID process, and that without a driver's       license and limited transportation, it's difficult for Hicks       to participate in state and federal elections.        ``My voice does not count.'' Hicks told ABC News. ``It's       very important. People have died just to vote, people have       stood in line, in the rain, women fought to vote and now I       can't vote.''        Like many Black elders in the South, Hicks was born at a       time when records weren't kept. She never had a birth       certificate. Her daughter has helped her apply for one. The       pair even went to court over the issue, and said a judge       ruled in their favor. Still, they said the Office of Vital       Statistics rejected Hicks because she filled out an outdated       form.        ``I do feel like the laws right now are targeting my mother       and other African Americans in this country,'' White said.        Eight state constitutional amendments ranging from taxes to       judicial eligibility will be up for a vote on Nov. 2, in an       election that, as of now, Hicks [cannot] participate in.        Advocates warn that potentially thousands of predominantly       minority voters could be disenfranchised due to voter       identification requirements, which could have large       implications during next year's midterm elections for state       and congressional races.        ``It's often very common for people of a certain age not to       have a birth certificate. I want to emphasize it's not as       uncommon as people might believe,'' said Franita Tolson, the       vice dean for faculty and academic affairs and a professor of       law at the University of Southern California Gould School of       Law.        ``In this country, race correlates to a lot of different       characteristics. So, for example, if you take voter       identification laws . . . people of color, so African       Americans, Latinos, will be less likely to have the       underlying documents that you need in order to get the ID in       the first place in order to get a driver's license,'' Tolson       [said].        Texas recently passed the Election Integrity Protection       Act, one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country.       It bans drive-thru voting, enlists new regulations for early       voting and enacts new ID requirements for mail-in voting.        While Tolson does not believe all voter identification       requirements are discriminatory, she called Texas' voter ID       measures ``racist'' during a Congressional Subcommittee       hearing on September 22 because she believes they       disproportionately impact voters of color.        ``Texas has very restrictive voter ID law,'' Tolson said.       ``If you read it, it doesn't seem racist on its face, but if       you think about how it operates in practice, as well as the       intent behind it, it is fairly racist. For example, Texas'       law only allows voters to have a certain limited amount of       IDs. You have to have a driver's license, you can have a . .       . handgun license, you can have a military ID, but you can't       have a federal ID, or you can't have a student ID, which are       types of IDs that people of color are more likely to have.''        White said obtaining an election identification is not so       easy for an 82-year-old woman who lives in a rural area       without the convenient ability to drive herself to the       Department of Public Safety.        ``My challenge is it's taking so long to get this done,''       White said. ``And to send my mother through all of these       hoops at this age to go get documents notarized, to go get       her Social Security application, We're having to look for       high school records and baptism information . . . To send her       through such a process, it really is ridiculous.''    Latino communities have also been at the forefront of the fight for  social, racial, and economic justice, but Republican gerrymandering is  silencing these communities as described in the following article,  published by the Brennan Center, on November 14, 2021, entitled ``It's  Time to Stop Gerrymandering Latinos out of Political Power.''         In 2020, Latinos made up just 1 percent of all local and       federal elected officials, despite being 18 percent of the       population.        In fact, the 2020 census results show that Latinos made up       over half the country's population growth from 2010 to 2020,       adding 11.6 million people to their total numbers--more by       far than any other ethnic group in absolute terms. Latinos       are already the largest minority group in 21 states, and in       California and New Mexico they have already surpassed non-      Latino whites as the largest single ethnic group in the       state. In Texas, they are poised to do the same.        In states where growth among Latinos and other people of       color threaten the political status quo, lawmakers are       already beginning to gerrymander Latino communities out of       their political voice, packing them into fewer and fewer       districts to circumscribe their electoral power or       dispersing Latino communities across multiple districts in       order to dilute their voting strength. In Texas, for       example, lawmakers recently passed a new congressional map       that reduced the number of Latino-majority districts--      despite the fact that the state has actually added 2       million Latinos since 2010.        This isn't a new tactic. Last decade, Texas failed to       create any new electoral opportunities for Latinos despite       rapid and concentrated Latino growth, leading to years of       drawn-out litigation over the discriminatory scheme.       Likewise, successful litigation in Florida demonstrated that       lawmakers packed Latino voters into already heavily       Democratic districts to shore up Republican districts at the       expense of Latino voters. Even in states under Democratic       control, like Illinois and Washington, Latinos are often       shuffled between different districts to bolster safe       Democratic seats and denied the equal opportunity to elect       representatives of their choice.        Even with record turnout in 2020, Latino voters were, by       many accounts, neglected by Republican and Democratic       campaigns alike. This comes at a time when Latino communities       are in particular need of responsiveness from lawmakers. Over       the course of the pandemic, Latinos have been 2.8 times more       likely to die of COVID-19 and suffered more economic and job       losses than other Americans. And since the pandemic began,       Latino adults were more likely to get evicted and their       children more likely to fall behind in school than their       white peers.        But rather than address the concerns and desires of this       growing body of constituents, many states, like Texas and       Florida, have instead created new barriers to the ballot box.       Anti-Latino redistricting practices are occurring amid the       biggest voter suppression push in decades--much of it aimed       at diminishing the growing power of Latino communities.        These attacks on Latino voters have deep roots in       historical prejudice and violence going back over a century.       Often erased in U.S. history books, violent mobs are       estimated to have killed thousands of people of Mexican       descent in the early 20th century. Forgotten too is the       campaign by state and local officials to ``repatriate'' (that       is, forcibly move to Mexico) an estimated 2 million Mexican       Americans during the Great Depression, many of whom were U.S.       citizens. Later, even the Voting Rights Act of 1965 failed to       initially protect Puerto Ricans from English literacy tests       at the New York polls--``language minorities'' weren't       included in the law until 10 years after its passage.    Though the Latino population has grown and grown more diverse over  the past 50 years, the pattern of discrimination remains strikingly  unchanged. Every day, lawmakers across the country are recycling the  bad map-drawing practices that have stymied Latino political  opportunity for decades. Voters and advocates can challenge these maps  in court, but they will be hampered by courts' restrictive  interpretation of voting rights laws and the ability for map drawers,  after the Supreme Court green-lighted partisan gerrymandering, to claim  that Latinas were targeted for partisan reasons, not for their  ethnicity. And that is why it is more urgent than ever that Congress  repair and strengthen the Nation's voting rights laws by passing the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote  Act.    Asian-American voters are turning out at record levels, and it is no  coincidence that Republican State legislatures are responding with new  laws to suppress their voices.   I will now read from an NBC News article from March 31, 2021, about  the effect of Georgia's recently enacted voter suppression law on  Asian-American voters. This is entitled ``Asian American voter rights  in Georgia hit record high. How voting bill threatens progress.''         While new data shows Asian Americans had record turnout in       Georgia in the last election, a new law that restricts voting       in the state threatens their participation in the political       process, particularly at a time when they also have the       highest rates of absentee voting, critics say.        The new legislation, passed with the overwhelming support       of Republicans in the state Legislature last week, adds       restrictions to absentee and early voting, among other forms       of balloting. Critics say the law could disproportionately       affect communities of color, including Asian Americans, whose       voting population already confronts significant barriers to       civic engagement.        The bill, activists say, is particularly alarming in light       of a recent analysis by the policy nonprofit AAPI Data on       turnout in battleground states that showed a historic 84       percent vote gain in Georgia by Asian Americans from 2016 to       2020--a result, in part, of aggressive community outreach.        ``Voters of color, including Asian American voters, have       shown their electoral power in Georgia,'' Phi Nguyen, a       litigation director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-      Atlanta told NBC. . . . ``And now some elected leaders want       to try to suppress those voices rather than be accountable to       a diverse, multiracial, multiethnic electorate.''  [[Page S271]]         Critics said that the bill--which was fast tracked through       the state House and Senate and signed by Republican Gov.       Brian Kemp in just over an hour--was passed without public       notice to advocates or voters. The sweeping legislation       criminalizes ``line warming,'' the practice of offering food       and water to voters waiting to vote, and allows the Georgia       Legislature to take power from local boards of election.        In regards to absentee and early voting, the earliest date       a voter can request a ballot is 11 weeks ahead of an       election, less than half the time before the law [before the       law was passed]. And the deadline to complete the ballots has       been moved up as well. Both requesting and returning ballots       requires identification, such as a driver's license number,       state ID number or a copy of an acceptable voter ID.        The restrictions on absentee voting, Nguyen said, are       particularly concerning given that Asian Americans voted by       mail at the highest rate compared to all other racial groups       in the general election. Voting data from November showed       that in 13 of the most contested battleground states,       including Georgia, AAPI early and absentee voting rose almost       300 percent from 2016 [to 2020].        Nguyen further pointed out that any laws that make voting       more challenging have a particularly amplified impact on       those who are limited English proficient, or people who have       difficulty communicating in English. The Asian American       population has some of the highest rates of limited English       proficiency. And according to Pew Research, Asian Americans       are the only group made up of a majority of naturalized       immigrants, who account for two-thirds of the electorate.        With a high immigrant population, Asian Americans face       barriers beyond just language, Karthick Ramakrishnan, [an]       associate dean [for] the University of California Riverside       School of Public Policy and founder of AAPI Data, said.       Because the majority of the electorate is foreign born, most       Asian Americans most likely did not grow up in a [Democratic]       or [a] Republican household, he said. For those who were able       to get college degrees, they probably attended universities       in their home country, which influenced their knowledge of       the political process.        ``What that means is that the political awakening and       consciousness and even information about where the party       stands on issues and where candidates stand on issues--the       barriers are pretty high beyond the language barriers,'' he       said. ``You combine that with the fact that parties and       candidates traditionally have not reached out to them. It's       asking a lot for someone to make a decision when they don't       have all that background information, and no one is reaching       out to them.''        Given the added work that is required by immigrants to seek       out this information, Nguyen noted that ``they are more       likely to give up or feel intimidated in the face of       additional hurdles or hoops.''        Within the Asian American community, those who tend to vote       at higher rates also tend to be more proficient in English,       and have higher incomes and higher education. . . . Many are       also homeowners as opposed to renters. Voter suppression laws       . . . would result in a distorted representation of the Asian       American population.        ``All of these factors matter. . . . They       disproportionately hurt populations that are lower income,       lower education, renters, younger people''. . . . ``You get a       skew in terms of communities of color less likely to be       represented. Even within those communities you will get a       class skew and an age skew in terms of who has a voice.'' . .       .        Ultimately, people should be pushing for more ways to make       voting easier and pull more people toward civic engagement .       . . adding that even if lawmakers are genuinely concerned       about voter fraud, it occurs far more infrequently than voter       suppression, of which there are widespread examples.        Previous research suggests that there is little to no voter       fraud and a Harvard study on double voting, one of the most       frequently cited examples of fraud, suggests . . . it's ``not       . . . carried out in such a systematic way that it presents a       threat to the integrity of American elections.''        ``This is a serious reminder of how important political and       civic education is for our most vulnerable communities.''    For far too long, Native communities have faced massive challenges in  exercising their right to vote. Voter suppression efforts in Montana,  as illustrated by this Mic article from July 6, 2021, are just one  example of recent efforts to disenfranchise Native voters. The article  is entitled ``Montana is ground zero for Native American voter  suppression--and the fight against it.''   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting practices  and gave Native American communities the right to vote, in theory. Most  of us know now that even with the Voting Rights Act in place, voter  suppression is still going strong. In Montana, Native Americans are  fighting new Republican laws that further restrict their ability to  vote.   This year, Montana Democratic Governor Steve Bullock, who served for  8 years, was replaced by Republican Greg Gianforte. With a Democrat no  longer holding veto power, State Republicans took advantage of the  Governor's election by passing two new voting law bills--house bill  176, which eliminates same-day voter registration, and house bill 530,  which makes it illegal for people to distribute or collect mail-in  ballots if they are being paid to do so.   Per the National Congress of American Indians, the turnout rate  amongst Native voters is up to 10 percentage points lower than any  other racial group. In 2019, the Brennan Center reported that  restrictive voting laws throughout the country continued to  disproportionately impact Native communities.    On the surface, preventing people from being paid to collect ballots  might seem like an OK idea, but in Montana, local nonprofits like  Western Native Voice and Montana Native Voice pay people to collect and  distribute ballots as an important part of their voting strategy.  Without this practice, many people would be unable to cast their  ballots at all.   For example, the New York Times reported the story of Laura Roudine,  a resident of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, who had emergency open- heart surgery only a week before the 2020 election. Because of the  risks that coronavirus posed, neither Roudine nor her husband could  vote in person. Home delivery wasn't an option either because it  doesn't exist in her area of the reservation. Instead, the Times  reported, the couple relied on Renee LaPlant, a Blackfeet community  organizer with Western Native Voice, who took applications and ballots  back and forth between their home and one of the only two satellite  election offices located on the 2,300-square-mile reservation. The new  laws signed by Gianforte would make this practice illegal.   Native American communities in Montana are organizing against these  voter suppression efforts. In May, the ACLU of Montana and the Native  American Rights Fund sued on behalf of several Native voting rights  organizations and four Montana Tribal communities, stating that the new  laws will disenfranchise Native voters in the State.   I know I am running low on time. I will not be able to speak to the  question of the student vote and how Republican legislatures are doing  all they can to keep young voters from voting because they are more  likely to vote Democratic or to speak on felon disenfranchisement and  what that means in our democracy. I am not able to speak on these, but  it does not mean that I do not think they are important; it just  reminds us of the magnitude of this problem.   Voter suppression laws have devastating consequences for real  Americans every day, so I want to conclude my remarks today with the  story of Crystal Mason, which is told in the New York Times on April 6,  2021, in an article entitled ``Crystal Mason Was Sentenced to Five  Years Behind Bars Because She Voted.''         Whenever you hear Republican rants about widespread voter       fraud supposedly undermining Americans' faith in the       integrity of their elections, remember the story of Crystal       Mason.        Ms. Mason, a 46-year-old grandmother from the Fort Worth       area, has been in the news off and on since 2016, when Texas       prosecutors decided she was a vote fraudster so dangerous       that justice demanded she be sentenced to five years behind       bars.        Her offense? Visiting her local precinct on Election Day       that year and casting a provisional ballot for president. Ms.       Mason was not eligible to vote at the time because she was on       supervised release after serving a prison term for federal       tax fraud. Texas, like many states, bars those with criminal       records from voting until they have finished all terms of       their sentence.        Ms. Mason, who had only recently returned home to her three       children and had gone to the polls that day at the urging of       her mother, said she did not realize she wasn't allowed to       cast a ballot. When poll workers couldn't find her name on       the rolls, they assumed it was a clerical error and suggested       she fill out the provisional ballot.        Provisional ballots are a useful way to deal with questions       about a voter's eligibility that can't be resolved at the       polling place. Since 2002, Congress has required that states       offer them as part of the Help America Vote Act, a law passed       in the aftermath of the 2000 election debacle, when millions       of ballots were disqualified. Ms. Mason's ballot was rejected       as soon as the search of the database determined that she was       ineligible. In other words, the system worked the way it was       intended to.        Tarrant County prosecutors went after her for illegal       voting anyway. They said she  [[Page S272]]       should have known she was not allowed to vote. The state had       sent her a letter telling her so back in 2012, shortly after       she had been sentenced in the tax fraud case. The letter was       delivered to her home even though she had already begun       serving her sentence behind bars. ``They sent it to the one       place they knew she was not going to be,'' said Alison       Grinter, Ms. Mason's lawyer.        The prosecutors also pointed out that when she cast her       ballot in 2016, she signed an affidavit [saying] that she had       completed all the terms of her sentence.        Ms. Mason said she had not read the fine print; she was       focused on writing down her address in exactly the form it       appeared on her driver's license. She was convicted after a       one-day trial and sentenced to five years behind bars for       casting a ballot that was never counted.        ``It's a surreal experience to be in a courtroom for these       trials,'' said Christopher Uggen, a professor of law and       sociology at the University of Minnesota who has studied the       impact of felon disenfranchisement for decades, and has       testified as an expert in prosecutions of people charged with       illegal voting.        ``You've got the judges, you've got the lawyers. You've got       somebody who often is a model probationer called in, and       what's at issue is whether they voted. I have overriding       sense of, gosh, don't we have other crimes to prosecute? It       really should be a consensus issue in a democracy that we       don't incarcerate people for voting.''        Mr. Uggen said that there is a stronger case for criminal       punishment of certain election-law offenses like campaign-      finance violations or sabotaging voting machines, that can do       more widespread damage to our election system. But in his own       work he has found that the people who get punished are more       likely to fit Ms. Mason's description: female, low-level       offenders who are doing relatively well in the community.       ``These are not typically folks who represent some great       threat to public safety,'' he said.        You wouldn't get that sense from how Ms. Mason has been       treated. After her voting conviction, a federal judge found       she had violated the terms of her supervised release, and       sentenced her to 10 extra months behind bars. That       punishment, which she began serving in December 2018, earned       her no credit toward her five-year state sentence.        Ms. Mason has continued to fight her case, but so far she       has lost at every step. In March 2020, a three-judge panel on       a state appellate court rejected her challenge to her       sentence. The court reasoned that she broke the law simply by       trying to vote while knowing she was on supervised release.       It didn't matter whether she knew that Texas prohibits voting       by people in that circumstance.        This appears to be a clear misapplication of Texas election       law, which criminalizes voting only by people who actually       know they are not eligible, not those who, like Ms. Mason,       mistakenly believe that they are. It's as though Ms. Mason       had asked a police officer what the local speed limit was,       and he responded: ``Beat's me. Why don't you start driving       and see if we pull you over?''        Last week, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's       highest court for criminal cases, agreed to rule on Ms.       Mason's appeal. It's her last chance to avoid prison for       voting. Tossing her conviction would bring a small measure of       justice to a woman whose punishment should have been limited       to, at most, not being able to cast a ballot.        But it wouldn't give her back the last four years of fear       and uncertainty she has endured for no good reason. Ms.       Mason's first grandchild was born a few months ago, another       reminder of how much she would miss if she were to lose the       appeal and end up back behind bars. ``This is very       overwhelming, waking up every day knowing that prison is on       the line, trying to maintain a smile on your face in front of       your kids and you don't know the outcome,'' Ms. Mason told       The Times in an interview. ``Your future is in someone else's       hands because of a simple error.''        Identifying errors like these is the whole point of       offering provisional ballots: The crazy quilt of voting rules       and regulations that Americans face from state to state can       trip up even the best-informed voters, and honest mistakes       are common. By prosecuting Ms. Mason, just one of more than       44,000 Texans whose provisional ballot in 2016 was found to       be ineligible, the state is saying that you attempt to       participate in democracy at your own risk.        That risk is almost always higher for people of color.       Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton, likes to brag about the       155 people his office has successfully prosecuted for       election fraud in the last 16 years--an average of fewer than       10 per year. What he doesn't say out loud is what the       A.C.L.U. of Texas found in an analysis of the cases he has       prosecuted: almost three-quarters [of those cases] involved       Black or Latino defendants, and nearly half involved woman of       color, like Ms. Mason.        At this point you might be wondering why Ms. Mason was       ineligible to vote in the first place. She had been released       from prison, after all, and was trying to work her way back       into society. As more states are coming to understand, there       is no good argument for denying the vote to people with a       criminal record, and that's before you consider the       practice's explicitly racist roots. There is even a strong       case to be made for letting those in prison vote, as Maine,       Vermont and most Western European countries do. And yet       today, more than five million Americans, including Ms. Mason,       are unable to vote because of a criminal conviction. That has       a far greater impact on state and national elections than any       voter fraud that has ever been uncovered.        Given the disproportionate number of Black and brown people       caught up in the criminal justice system, it's not hard to       see a connection between cases like Ms. Mason's and the       broader Republican war on voting, which so often targets       people who look like her. The nation's tolerance of       prosecutions for the act of casting a ballot reveals       complacency about the right to vote, Mr. Uggen said, and a       troubling degree of comfort with voting restrictions       generally. ``There's a slippery slope: If you start exempting       individuals from the franchise, it's easy to exempt other       individuals by defining them outside the citizenry,'' he       said. ``What is shocking to me is that people view this as       acceptable in a political system that calls itself a       democracy.''    Mr. President, these efforts to subvert our democracy cannot be  allowed to stand. Congress must pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis  Act immediately to protect free and fair elections across this Nation.  And if Senate Republicans will not join us, then we must reform the  filibuster. We must pass this vital legislation. Our democracy depends  on it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I understand that there are 20 bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m. on  Wednesday, January 19; that following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two  leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the  Senate resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R.  5746, the legislative vehicle for the voting rights legislation;  further, that the cloture motion on the House message to accompany H.R.  5746 ripen at 6:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:01 p.m., recessed until  Wednesday, January 19, 2022, at 10 a.m.
