 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 838, I call  up the bill (S. 610) to address behavioral health and well-being among  [[Page H6929]]  health care professionals, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on S. 610.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 610, the Protecting Medicare  and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which will, among other  things, extend additional relief to Medicare providers in 2022 to  support providers during the COVID-19 public health emergency.   In 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made changes  to how different physician services were valued relative to one another  in the Medicare payment system. While physicians performing many  primary care services saw an increase in payments as a result of these  changes, other providers saw fairly substantial reductions which were  not phased in.   That is why last year, Congress provided a 3.75 percent increase in  the Medicare conversion factor, as a transition to the providers that  were most affected.   This legislation continues that glidepath, with a 3 percent 1-year  increase in the Medicare conversion factor, providing a bump in  payments. With the new COVID variant emerging here in the United  States, this will be important support for our frontline workers.   This legislation also eliminates the Medicare sequester, the 2  percent cut slated to take effect in January, and instead provides a  glidepath by fully eliminating the cut in the first quarter and phasing  it down to 1 percent in the second quarter.   Lastly, the legislation imposes a 1-year delay on clinical laboratory  reductions and a radiation oncology payment model to provide additional  time to adjust to these new policies. These commonsense provisions were  also included in the legislation that I am proud to have introduced  earlier today, along with my colleague, Congresswoman Schrier. These  provisions have strong support from the medical community, physicians,  and hospitals, because those in the healthcare field recognize that we  must ensure providers have the support they need to care for patients  as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. A letter from 20  surgical groups notes: ``We urge Congress to pass the Protecting  Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Funds Act to mitigate the  2022 Medicare payment cuts.''   This legislation will also provide a procedure for the Senate to  raise the debt ceiling. This deal was struck by Senate Republican  Leader McConnell.   As much as my colleagues across the aisle may claim, this is not  about new spending. Increasing the debt ceiling will prevent us from  defaulting on debt we already owe.   It is about investments that Congress previously approved. In fact,  97 percent of the current debt was accumulated before President Biden  assumed office. This vote is about protecting the full faith and credit  of the United States of America.   A default would spell disaster. Nearly 50 million seniors could stop  receiving Social Security checks for a period of time. Troops could go  unpaid. Millions of families who rely on the monthly child tax credit,  a tax cut, could see delays. Our current economic recovery could  reverse into recession, with billions of dollars of growth and millions  of jobs lost. According to an analysis by Moody's Analytics chief  economist, Mark Zandi, the recession could wipe out as many as 6  million jobs and erase $15 trillion in household wealth.   I am proud to stand in strong support of this bipartisan agreement  that will end the specter of default looming over the American economy  and the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this responsible  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished chair of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1945     Madam Speaker, I just remind the gentleman, when we  talk about bipartisanship, this side of the aisle worked in a  bipartisan way to pass a bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act that only 13 Republicans voted in favor of and more than 200  Republicans voted against.   Tonight, we are providing a solution to protect the healthcare  providers in my home State of Nevada, in States all across the country,  including in the prior speaker's home State of Missouri. If he won't  vote to fix that problem, I will, because this is about solving a  problem, not creating another one.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I have one additional speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will close by stating that, yes, Democrats are delivering. We are  delivering for the American people. We are delivering in the time of a  pandemic. We are delivering to restore public confidence in our public  institutions and to help our economy recover. This bill is about  important and responsible measures to deliver for the American people.   When the Republicans had the majority in the House, the Senate, and  the White House, they chose to spend their time giving tax cuts to the  very wealthy, to big corporations that provided little benefit to  average Americans and to small businesses.   Now with Democrats in charge, we are delivering for the American  people.   I urge my colleagues to support this important and responsible  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.
