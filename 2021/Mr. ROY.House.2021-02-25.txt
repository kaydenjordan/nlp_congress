 Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Ohio is absolutely  correct. The assertion that it doesn't impact Title IX is completely  false. It directly amends Title IV in the Civil Rights Act. It will  have a direct impact on educational institutions and would, therefore,  absolutely impact women's athletics. We all know that. Everybody gets  the joke.   But as one of my colleagues said, it is 100 percent clear that the  majority doesn't want to have the American people see what is in this  bill. They don't want to have it go through committee. They don't want  to spend time on it. They want to jam it through under the name of  equality.   See, you put fancy names on bills in this building and suddenly  people think it is about something that it isn't. And we know exactly  what this bill is about. It is about power. This bill is about power  and control.   This is about this institution being run by Democrats who want to  tell the American people how to live their lives.   They want to tell people who disagree on these issues that they need  to go to the corner and they need to hide; that they need to give up  their closely held beliefs and their values and they need to bow down  to the altar of the people here and the cultural elites in Washington,  D.C., and do what they tell us to do.    It is an absolute abomination and flies in the face of the very  principles upon which this Nation was founded. We know that. We see  that. We can go through the list. We are all going through it.   The definition of sex in H.R. 5 inserts the right to abortion into  the Civil  [[Page H642]]  Rights Act. The Equality Act can be used to force a universal right to  abortion until birth. It forces medical professionals to conduct or  assist in performing abortions; forces medical professionals to perform  certain surgeries and administer hormone blockers, even if it is  against their medical advice; forces employers to cover sex  reassignment surgeries; forces schools, churches, hospitals, and  businesses to recognize a chosen gender.   I could go down the list. But this is about power and control. It is  the same thing about having a fence with razor wire around the people's  Congress, around this Capitol building. It is an absolute affront to  who we are.   In the Declaration of Independence, where we are talking about  rights, government is instituted among men to secure those rights.   And the House of Representatives, supposedly the people's House, is  using the power of this body to step on the rights of the American  people. And it is our obligation to defend those rights. And I can tell  you this: We are going to stand up in defense of the Constitution, our  liberties and the Bill of Rights, and the consent of the governed  matters.   You do not have the consent of the governed, my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. You don't. And you are pretending that you  have got power that you do not have, and it will not end well if you  pull this republic apart, thread by thread, and you have to look in the  mirror and tell your kids and grandkids that this republic died on your  watch.   It is not going to because we are going to stand on the wall, the  same wall that our Founders stood on, the same wall that those men at  the Alamo stood on, and we are going to defend this Constitution in the  name of the Declaration of Independence and the Lord that gives us the  rights that we protect.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who, like me, served as a staffer for a Texas  Senator in his career, the great John Tower.                    Celebrating the Memory of Daisy Bates     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for his commitment  in being down here on the floor. We have this Special Order reserved  tonight to talk about an issue that I think is fundamentally important  to what we are seeing now today. And that is what I describe as the  ideological cleansing of America, the silencing of dissent--cancel  culture in common parlance today. It is a sickness that lies among us.  It threatens to tear apart our Republic at the seams. It undermines our  economic strength, our families, our schools, our churches, our culture  at all levels, and even our military strength. That sickness is indeed  the ideological cleansing of America.   We have witnessed in America in just a matter of months the shaming  of Americans questioning COVID. They are not questioning its existence.  They are questioning our response. They are questioning the fact that  we have got people who are committing suicide, who are stuck, unable to  see loved ones, or can't get cancer screenings. They are questioning  why hydroxychloroquine is one day okay and one day not okay, and then  suddenly okay again. They are inquiring about the efficacy of masks.   Do they work or not work?   How well do they work?   Where should we wear them?   They question the removal of Americans from social media, the  coordinated effort of technology companies to block companies or  threaten to pull down news media outlets.   We see examples of cancel culture in society are all around us.   Ryan Anderson is a good friend of mine. His book is behind me, titled  ``When Harry Became Sally,'' responding to the transgender moment. It  is an important work on civil rights and transgender policy. Well, it  was deplatformed by Amazon and Apple without explanation this week. It  has been on for 3 years. It is a good book, whether you agree with it  or don't agree with it.   Are we really into book burning?   Is that where we are?   Is that what we have become as a country that supposedly values  freedom and the free exchange of ideas?   A book written by a good man, a PhD, on a topic that matters, ``When  Harry Became Sally.''   Am I going to get canceled?   Is C-SPAN going to cancel this?   Is Speaker Pelosi going to cancel this because this is somehow  offensive?   It is a book with ideas researched and offered. That is where we are  as a country.   Gina Carano was recently canceled by Disney for tweeting a comparison  of Nazi Germany rounding up Jews for the current hate doxing and  targeting of fellow Americans for political views.   Now, should she make that comparison?   I don't know. But we are a free country where people are supposed to  have the free exchange of ideas. And if there is anything that should  bind us together, it should be a unanimous belief that standing up  against tyranny and standing up against this kind of cleansing is  something that this body--all 435 of us--should agree to. We see it  from college campuses to religious schools, to small businesses, to  corporate boardrooms.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to have more to say on this. I have some of  my colleagues here who want to join. So I am going to yield first to my  good friend from Texas,   Michael Cloud.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my friend from Texas that  I know he has a heart for immigrants who come to the United States of  America. We both live in Texas. We both deal with an open border and we  deal with the issue of immigration on a regular basis.   Too often when you talk about cancel culture, if I dare to say that  we should have a secure border in the United States of America and that  I believe that is pro-immigrant, that that undermines the power of  cartels, that makes it less likely that immigrants are abused, also  protects us, protects us from the dangers of fentanyl. That is the kind  of canceling that we see every single day.   Oh, you want a secure border?   You hate Brown people.   It is as if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have some  sort of monopoly on being able to say things about Brown people, and  here I am trying to protect our border for the betterment of the United  States and the immigrants who seek to come here, and somehow I am a  bigot. The very structures put in place by the Obama-Biden  administration are called cages for kids.   And now what has happened?   The Biden administration is having an uh-oh moment because their  absurd policies of open borders are attracting people to come across  our border. Now they are saying: Oh, no, what do we do with  unaccompanied children?   Well, who the heck could have seen this coming?   Yet somehow we are canceled for believing in a secure border.   The gentleman from south Texas, who I know has a heart for  immigrants--    And has a family who does as well, does the gentleman have  thoughts on that?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. If you take that  view, you are labeled a bigot. If you take the view that we want a  secure border, you are labeled as someone who wants to keep people out  of this country.   If you dare to say what you just said, which is that maybe we should  think through how to make sure that Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El  Salvador are strong so that--by the way, the first lady of Guatemala  was visiting and said something along the lines of: All of these  caravans and all of the cartels are driving a lot of our people out of  our country, and it is hurting our country.   I am told from the other side of the aisle that it is compassionate  to have open borders, and then we are labeled as bigots.   I know the gentleman has somewhere to go. I appreciate the  gentleman's remarks and passion for this issue. May God bless the  gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Well, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Colorado. I will  tell you, you know, as I was thinking through the times we are in right  now, the Book of Acts is my favorite book in the Bible.   And when you--you know, I look at the arrows that some are taking  today for standing up for their beliefs and some of the things that are  happening today; and then you remember that we are not in the middle of  a circle yet, getting stoned.   You remember what those men did and what they faced in the early  church, and it inspires us to know, to have the strength that we need  to have. And this is true of all faiths. This is true of all Americans.  It is instructive to stand up in faith when you believe something in  your soul and in your heart.   And we, as Americans, when Patrick Henry gave his famous speech at  St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia, in that famous speech, ``Give  Me Liberty Or Give Me Death,'' that is the founding building block of  this Nation.   And it is that liberty, that liberty expressed in the First Amendment  of the Constitution, which is under assault today on a bill voted on  the floor of this body today in the so-called Equality Act, with a  direct assault on the First Amendment of the United States, a direct  assault on religious liberty, a direct assault, basically. It is the  tyranny over the mind of man.   I am inspired by the Book of Acts, and I assume that the gentlewoman  from Colorado agrees.    I appreciate the gentlewoman from Colorado, and I appreciate  our joint commitment to the Lord Almighty and liberty in this country.   And I would just say before I yield, I think, to the gentleman from  Georgia next, a couple of thoughts.   You know, we are talking today about cancel culture. We are talking  about the silencing of dissent, the cleansing of ideology in the public  square in America. It is truly an ideological cleansing, but it is  always not direct.   I alluded to it when I was talking to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud) about immigration; that if we dare stand up for secure borders,  we are a bigot. It happens all the time. You hate Brown people. You are  a bigot.   Today, I stood up against the Equality Act. The first thing out of  the indivisible crowd in Austin and San Antonio, you're a bigot. You're  transphobic.   Dare stand up for what you believe. Oh, my gosh. The gentleman from  Texas says that there is a man and woman. Bigot. All right?    I mean, this is where we are today. And you know, look, if you want  your child to actually be educated in a school, then despite the  science, you don't care about public health and you want teachers to  die. Right?   All last year, running against an opponent in Austin, it was, oh, you  want people to die. You don't care about the science.   If you want to keep your business open to keep your livelihood going,  you just want to survive. You are a barber in Dallas, Texas, and you  just want to stay working to pay for your kids and your family, put  bread on the table.   Well, you are just greedy, and you hate science.   If you think Dr. Fauci is inconsistent--I mean, I am just going to be  nice and say inconsistent--if you think Dr. Fauci is inconsistent,  sometimes making stuff up, maybe to be on the front cover of a  magazine, and maybe we ought to hear from 20 scientists instead of one,  well, suddenly, you hate science.   If you say that COVID has been politicized, as I did last year, or  question any aspect of it, not that it exists, not that people are  getting sick--I have had it--not that you want to protect your family-- I canceled Thanksgiving because my dad is 78 and had polio--but if you  question any of it, you are calling it a hoax.   If you want to go to church, you are reckless.   If you believe men are men and women are women, you are a bigot.   If you think it is wrong to let biological boys compete against your  daughter in a sports competition, or you don't want your daughter to  have to share a locker room with a male, you are a bigot.   I mean, when are we going to sit down, roll our sleeves up and  actually do the work of the American people, instead of sitting here  firing shots across everybody and saying, well, you are a bigot.   I yield to my good friend from Georgia, Mr. Hice.    Yeah. There is no question. In my view, what we are seeing  today is the assertion of power over the mind of America, right? And it  is just happening as we see it.   We have got a fence with razor wire around the Capitol. We were all  horrified, sitting right here, all of us here in the body who were here  on January 6. We all want to protect each other.   But we also have a duty to lead. We also have a duty to have a  Capitol that is open; to figure out a way to secure the body without  sending signals to the world that somehow this is a military state.   You walk around the Capitol and there are people in camouflage. There  is a fence. I can't even walk around D.C. We are harming business. We  are telling the American people that, nope, sorry, you can't come here,  all in the name of a virus or then what happened on January 6.   That is all about power. That is all about message. Okay?   I do not believe for a minute, with all due respect, that that is  about actual security of this building and this complex. That is about  projecting a message to the American people. That is what the  magnetometers are for. That is not to keep us safe. It is not.    It is not the highest and best use of the Capitol Police to be having  20 people around this floor every day; literally having Members of  Congress duly elected by the people to have to go through  magnetometers. You have got to go through security to get in the  building. It is all a show. And that is all a projection of power. And  that is what the Equality Act was today.   And the last thing I will say is my point about immigration earlier.  That whole point is: It makes no sense to be yelling about kids in  cages, when any rational human being knows you are trying to figure out  what to do with this child, a child that could be being abused by this  guy who claims to be his or her uncle, and you are trying to keep him  or her safe. You can't just let him go. You have got to do something  with them.   I mean, I am sorry we don't have four-star resorts up and down the  Rio Grande to put these children into, but go down and work at Border  Patrol--who, by the way, are majority Hispanic--dealing with immigrants  coming here through policies that attract them.   That is all about power. Kids in cages. Republicans are evil.  Republicans are bigots. They hate Brown people. It is all about power.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask how much time we have left in our  Special Order. Sorry for surprising the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia that  I could not agree more, and I have spoken a little bit about the  Equality Act. The only thing I would add to it--and I said this earlier  on the floor about the Equality Act--my wife and I, products of public  school, K through law school, undergrad, law school, we currently send  our kids to a private Christian school, not an easy thing for us to  afford. We are fine, we are blessed, but it is a lot of work to make  that happen. Why do we do that? It is because, unfortunately,  increasingly those with beliefs and values that they want to be able to  have their children experience, we are being forced into the corner.   We are being forced to kind of be shoved back away from mainstream  society. I mean, forget just saying Merry Christmas. I mean, it is just  hostile to our values, hostile to our beliefs, teaching our children  something different than that there is one man and one woman. These are  the things that are happening every day across America.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would say whatever  frustrations you have about the previous President, just understand  this: President Trump represents a large number of men and women across  this country who are feeling exactly what we are saying right here.  They are frustrated and angry about what is happening to their country.  They are scared. They believe the power of government will be used  against them, and in many cases, we have seen evidence of it.   The point of this is not to just rant about it. It is that we should  be having a debate and a dialogue, and we need to come together as a  Congress and do our job to do what is right for the people of this  country. I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia very much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Georgia (Mrs. Greene), your colleague.    Yes. One of the things that you made me think of is how much  cancel culture is now getting rooted in government and, in fact, the  institution in which we are currently standing. The gentlewoman is well  aware that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stripped you of  your ability to serve and sit on committees, in an unprecedented  action, for things that you said before the election, that you have  addressed on the floor of this House. That is canceling.    We are in a situation right now where this body is now  refusing to work. Democrats are refusing to work with Republicans. They  are threatening to hold up and block their legislation because they  dared to object to the electors, a proposition, by the way, that I  disagreed with, on my side of the aisle. I spoke right there. I stated  my disagreement with my Republican colleagues.   But it is perfectly normal speech and debate under the Constitution  and the laws, under an act passed in 1887, one that my Democrat  colleagues have engaged in themselves: Ms. Waters from California, for  sure, Mr. Raskin from Maryland, others who have objected.   Now, Democrats in this body want to cancel my Republican colleagues.  That is how bad it has gotten. Cancel culture is now in this body.   I have a couple more colleagues here, Mrs. Greene, but do you have a  closing thought?    I am going to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I  would ask the Speaker how much time we have remaining.    I thank the Speaker. Right before I yield to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania, I want to appreciate his service, his service to the  country, both in the military and now in Congress. I know he has a  passion for this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.    Will the gentleman yield?    I also have a quote here I was going to close with from  Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn because it is so on point. I am going to go  ahead and do it now rather than closing with it because you just went  there.   He said this in another part of that book:         What was drummed in our ears as political courses, we have       now internalized. Live comfortably and all will be well ever       after. We lie to ourselves to preserve our peace of mind. It       is not they who should be blamed, but ourselves. One can       object but cannot imagine what to do. Gags have been stuffed       into our mouths. Nobody wants to listen to us, and nobody       asks our opinion. How can we force them to listen to us? It       is impossible to change their minds. Some will lose their       jobs, but there are no loopholes for anybody who wants to be       honest.    Now, that may sound like a diatribe from a conservative talk radio  host today, but it wasn't. It was him.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I  know that is true and I know your heart for service, and I know wearing  the uniform of the military of the United States meant a lot to you and  that your service here means a lot.   Mr. Speaker, as I get ready to yield to my friend from West Virginia,  I would add that my colleagues across the other side of the aisle are  effectively canceling Congress. I mean, it is pretty extraordinary when  the members of a body essentially act to cancel its own institution.   Proxy voting. Half of my Democratic colleagues are never here. About  half of the time I look over there and you look at the number of people  there, and they are voting from home. By the way, the rules suggest  that is supposed to be directly tied to the pandemic. But do you know  how many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and maybe  increasingly a few on my side of the aisle--have been here voting and  then submit the proxy form and then fly home?   It happens.   We are turning this institution on its head. We have remote hearings  that are halfway functional, where you sit there for an hour trying to  hear each other. We have no regular schedule. It is come and go. It  takes hours to vote. We have no regular order. We have massive bills.  We have things being done in smoke-filled rooms. We never get to amend.  We never get to debate. We never get to actually have an actual  discussion on the floor of the House. And we have fence and razor wire  around the Capitol.   Tell me how Democrats are not canceling Congress. You might as well  just say Speaker Pelosi can just pass a bill by herself.   I know my friend from West Virginia is going to talk a little bit  about spending, and the only thing that I will add to my point here  about order is that we are going to be passing a $2 trillion  monstrosity of a bill in the next week with no actual debate or  amendment on the floor of this body; no real review by the members of  this body. That is an absolute travesty.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  Mooney).                    Sanctity of Human Life and the Unborn     Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from West Virginia  for his remarks. And I would echo that--and I think the gentleman would  agree--that I believe that, of the $2 trillion, only 9 percent is  directed to COVID relief.   And I really just can't believe that my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle can really market this as a COVID relief bill when, by the  way, we have $1 trillion remaining from the $4 trillion last year and  only 9 percent of it is directed to COVID.   Does the gentleman agree?    Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the gentleman from West  Virginia, and I appreciate his comments.   I have 1 minute left and I will simply just say this: This chart  showing debt is not just about the big number. It is not just about the  $30 trillion of debt. This is about tyranny.   That money, that debt that we owe to our kids and grandkids is being  used to fund an education system that teaches our kids that America is  evil.   It is being used to fund an education system that won't even put  teachers back to work.   It is being used to fund a DHS that won't secure the border and is  turning it into a catch-and-release agency.   It is being used to fund the very institutions that are coming after  our precious Bill of Rights.   And I would just say to the Speaker and my friends on the other side  of the aisle: It is time that we come together and protect the rights  given to us by our Creator, that are reflected and defended in the  Constitution of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
