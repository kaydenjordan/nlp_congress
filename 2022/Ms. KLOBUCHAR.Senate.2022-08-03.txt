 Madam President, I rise today in support of Finland  and Sweden's application to join NATO. I give my strong support to this  application.   I disagree heartily with our colleague from Missouri. I know you  know, Madam President, having worked on this issue, as I have--having  visited these countries, we know how important they are to Minnesota  and Wisconsin.   Minnesota has a special bond with the Kingdom of Sweden and the  Republic of Finland, and at the core of this bond, at the core of the  bond between our country and these countries, is shared values--values  of democracy, values of freedom.   Yes, we have challenges--of course we do--in Asia, but I happen to  believe that when you are a great power like the United States of  America, you can do two things at once.   Let's look at what these countries add to our security by joining  NATO.   First of all, Finland is over 2 percent of their budget on military.  Sweden is increasing their budget on military. Both nations have  professional militaries. They have strong and transparent economies,  and mostly they believe in human rights--in freedom, in liberty, and  equality. They believe in democracy.   I will note specifically that Finland has added an extra $2.2 billion  in defense spending this year. Greece and Poland and Lithuania and  Latvia and Estonia and Slovakia and Croatia and the United Kingdom-- above 2 percent.   So let's get the facts straight here, and let's talk about what these  countries will add to our security.   We are at an unparalleled moment in history. Since Vladimir Putin's  cruel, unjustified invasion of Ukraine, people all over the world have  been waking up out of a 2-year plague, out of a slumber, to realize  just how fragile our democracy is.   We realized it here in this building when, not so long along,  insurrectionists invaded this Chamber. We didn't just sit back and say:  Well, there goes our democracy. We stood up. We stood up, Democrats and  Republicans, in this very Chamber.   When President Zelenskyy of Ukraine took to the streets the minute  that this invasion started and looked at a video camera and said: We  are here, he was saying that to his own people to give them the courage  to stand up against the inhuman barbarism of a dictator, but he was  also saying it to the rest of the world.   We see it on Ukraine's frontlines, where everyday people took up arms  and are taking up arms to protect their country. It sent a warning shot  to tyrants around the world who believe that free democracies are just  up for grabs. Ukrainians have shown their true colors in bright blue  and yellow, which just happen to be the colors of Sweden. They have  shown their true colors, and they are showing the world what courage is  all about.   Having been in the last group of Senators from this Chamber who met  with leaders in Ukraine just a few weeks before the war started, I can  tell you  [[Page S3889]]  this: The people of Ukraine want to choose their own destiny, and the  moral flame they have lit across the world will not be doused.    Russia's unprovoked aggression in Ukraine has changed how we think  about the world's security. That is why I strongly support the decision  of these two great democracies, Sweden and Finland, to join the most  important and defensive alliance in the world--NATO.   When President Biden met in May with Finnish and Swedish leaders  about their application to join NATO, he said the people of Sweden and  Finland--he said to them that they ``have the full, total, and complete  backing of the United States of America.'' We supported that. The  Senate Committee on Foreign Relations echoed its support with an  overwhelming bipartisan vote just last month. Our leaders support this  pact.   By joining NATO, allies made a sacred commitment to one another that  an attack on one is an attack on all. The only time in history this has  been invoked was after 9/11, when the United States was attacked, and  all our allies rallied to our side. As Americans, we have never and  will never forget that.   In June, we celebrated the anniversary of the end of World War II in  Europe. NATO was formed in the wreckage of World War II. When President  Truman signed the North Atlantic Treaty, he expressed the goal of its  founders ``to preserve their present peaceful situation and to protect  it in the future.'' And for decades, it has been crucial to upholding  that peace.   Now, 73 years later, NATO is as important as ever, and the recent  decisions made by our great friends, the great countries of Sweden and  Finland, are a testament to the continued promise of this alliance.   As Swedish Prime Minister Andersson said in May:         With Sweden and Finland as members, NATO will also be       stronger. We are security providers with sophisticated       defense capabilities.    That is correct.         And we are champions of freedom, democracy, and human       rights.    That is correct.   As Finland's leaders, President Niinisto and Prime Minister Marin,  also said:         NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security. As a       member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense       alliance.    I had the honor of being on a panel at the Munich Security Conference  with President Niinisto, and I saw firsthand his commitment to the  democracy in Finland and to the democracy all over the world.   Finland and Sweden are already among our closest partners on a range  of issues. They are already important contributors to the international  community, including in the United Nations, the Organization for  Security and Co-operation in Europe, and other international  organizations.   Finnish and Swedish troops have already served shoulder to shoulder  with U.S. and NATO forces in Kosovo, in Bosnia.   In 1994, Sweden and Finland joined NATO's Partnership for Peace  program, strengthening our official relationship and coming one step  closer to being a full-fledged NATO member.   NATO, Finland, and Sweden have partnered together on securing the  Baltic Sea region through regular conversations and exercises--a  practice that will be even more important now.   In 2018, Finland, Sweden, and the United States signed a trilateral  agreement to deepen defense cooperation and promote security in  Northern Europe.   Both Finland and Sweden are already working in coordination with the  United States and other allies and partners to support brave Ukrainians  standing up to Vladimir Putin.   Sweden has responded to Russia's bombing of maternity hospitals with  millions of dollars of support and helmets and body shields, as well as  billions for the refugees flowing from Ukraine. Finland has sent  military aid, including thousands of assault rifles and 70,000 ration  packages, and has offered millions of dollars in humanitarian aid.   Both nations also have the potential, as I noted, to bring huge  assets to this alliance, not, as my colleague from Missouri implied, to  somehow make things harder. Are you kidding? Maybe he hasn't seen these  countries. I have.   Finland, after fighting its own territorial wars with the Soviet  Union, has a reserve force of 900,000 strong. Sweden has built its own  fighter jets. Both countries recently announced upcoming expansion and  reform of their militaries.   As the Arctic region, which holds increasing importance for U.S. and  European security, sees encroachments from Russia and China--may I add  to my colleague from Missouri--Sweden and Finland are poised to help  NATO confront these challenges.   I am here to give my full support for Sweden and Finland entering  NATO. As we made clear, we stand with Sweden, we stand with Finland,  and we stand with democracy.   Russia's war in Ukraine--a full-scale, unprovoked, and premeditated  war against a sovereign and democratic country--has changed Europe and  the world, but it has also demonstrated the importance and resilience  of our transatlantic alliance. We have all witnessed the bravery of the  Ukrainian people as they fight for their lives, and we are proud to  stand with them.   This is about the future of political freedom, economic freedom,  technological freedom, and, yes, democratic freedom.   Finland and Sweden taking the step of NATO membership will not only  strengthen their own security but the cause of freedom in Europe and  around the world.   I would say, when things are tough, we keep our friends closer, and I  believe that this strong NATO and the inclusion of Sweden and Finland  will actually help us with the rest of the world, not just with this  conflict in Ukraine.   So I ask my colleague from Missouri, who is not here right now, to  consider that as we look at our alliances and how we deal with China.  We must strengthen our trade alliances. We must strengthen our military  alliances. Certainly, including Finland and Sweden as a member of NATO  is one big positive step.   I yield the floor.
