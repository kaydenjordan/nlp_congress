 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  district director, Brooke Childers, for being named a member of the  Georgia Southern University Alumni Association's ``40 under 40'' class  of 2021.   Brooke graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2005 with a  degree in political science. Since graduating, Brooke has served her  community with immense passion and dedication. As our district  director, Brooke has ensured that the highest levels of constituent  outreach and services are met throughout the district.   From cofounding a southeastern Rotary E-Club to volunteering across  Georgia's First District, Brooke continues to make a lasting impact.   Whatever role Brooke has occupied, she has exemplified compassion,  determination, and leadership. A model public servant, Brooke is well  deserving of this prestigious honor.   I am proud to have her on our team, and I am thankful for all that  she does for the First District and the entire State of Georgia. I am  forever grateful to have her lead our district office and represent us  in our community.                    October is American Pharmacists Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October  as American Pharmacists Month.   As a pharmacist, I have seen firsthand the impact pharmacists have on  people's lives. Throughout this pandemic, pharmacists have helped  distribute lifesaving medicines and care to those in need.   Pharmacists across our country deserve to be recognized for their  service in helping others through these unprecedented times. Every day  these pharmacists are providing vaccines for a number of illnesses and  carefully counseling patients on prescriptions.   As a pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am proud to  recognize the work these individuals are doing every day to serve their  local communities around the country. Their commitment to serving their  communities is to be admired by all.   Mr. Speaker, this month, as well as through the rest of the year, I  encourage everyone to visit their pharmacist, ask questions about your  prescriptions, and get to know the people who provide your medicine and  work to keep you healthy.                      Remembering the Life of Tony Cope     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Tony Cope of Savannah, Georgia, who sadly passed  away on October 8 at the age of 83.   Founder and director of the Oatland Island Wildlife Center, Tony  dedicated his life to teaching and inspiring the next generation.   After attending college, Tony returned to Savannah, where he would  serve the community for over 30 years as an author, educator, baseball  coach, and an administrator.   Beyond the classroom, Tony's life work was sharing his love of  Savannah with others. Authoring many books about his beloved hometown,  Tony's work touched countless lives.   As president of the Savannah Symphony and member of the Rotary Club  East, Tony's passion for his community was undeniable.   Despite retiring to Ireland, Tony was always first and foremost a  Savannah native.   I am grateful for Tony's service to Georgia's First Congressional  District, and I know his legacy will never be forgotten.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.           Award-Winning Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport for being awarded the number  one airport in the country by 2021 Conde Nast Traveler Readers' Choice  Awards.   More than 800,000 readers rated the Savannah airport as the number  one destination that they cannot wait to return to.   Since opening their doors in 1929, the Savannah airport has helped  shape the Savannah community into a world-renowned travel destination.   This distinguished award highlights the airport's exemplary customer  service and dedication to safety and security.   Providing the Savannah community with countless jobs and tremendous  service, Savannah's airport has contributed immensely to the economic  success of Georgia's First Congressional District.   Much like the readers of Conde Nast Traveler, I believe the southern  charm of Savannah's airport makes it a truly unforgettable experience.   I look forward to the continued success of the Savannah/Hilton Head  International Airport.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this afternoon, I am pleased to  join many of my colleagues to discuss the crucial need to improve  access to critical mental health resources for veterans battling post- traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, TBI.   Georgia's First Congressional District, which I have the honor and  privilege of representing, has a strong presence from each branch of  the military, with 61,000 Active Duty servicemembers.   We are home to four major military bases: Fort Stewart, Hunter Army  Airfield, Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, and Moody Air Force Base.   My district is also home to over 50,000 veterans. Approximately  19,000 of these veterans are post-9/11 veterans, 14,000 are Gulf war  veterans, 15,000 are Vietnam war veterans, 1,800 are Korean war  veterans, and nearly 200 are World War II veterans.   Suicide is a major issue, not just within Georgia's First District,  but one across our entire Nation as well.   The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that an estimated 20  veterans a day commit suicide. Madam Speaker, that is totally  unacceptable. Twenty servicemembers, 20 veterans a day committing  suicide. It is a sad thought that 20 of our veterans and servicemembers  are taking their own lives after returning home.   Even worse, a recent study released this past summer by the Costs of  War Project found that servicemembers and veterans are four times more  likely to have committed suicide than those who lost their lives in  combat. This is an epidemic.   We are losing more veterans on our home front than we have fighting  the global war on terrorism. It affects not only the veterans suffering  from mental stress but their families, friends, and loved ones they  leave behind.   The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 11 to 20 percent of  veterans who deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and  Operation Enduring Freedom will have PTSD in a given year, compared to  veterans of Desert Storm and Vietnam, who will suffer from PTSD at a  rate of 12 and 30 percent, respectively.   As many as 23 percent of combat veterans who have returned home from  Iraq and Afghanistan have come back with a traumatic brain injury. The  reason why these statistics are so alarming is the increased risk  factors veterans with PTSD and TBI have for committing suicide.   Veterans who suffer from PTSD are four times more likely to commit  suicide than those veterans without PTSD, while veterans with a TBI are  twice as likely to commit suicide than those without one.   That is why I stand here today with my colleagues and pledge we work  together in passing crucial legislation needed to improve access to  critical mental health resources for our veterans.   One critical piece of legislation that I was proud to cosponsor is  H.R. 1476, the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program Act, which has  been offered by my friend and colleague, Representative Lee Zeldin.  This bill will expand veteran peer-to-peer support programs nationally  and help veterans suffering from PTSD and TBI. It is imperative that  veterans receive the care they need and to prevent this ongoing crisis.   Over 60 percent of the veterans that died by suicide in 2018 did not  visit the VA in the year of their death or the previous year. Again,  over 60 percent of the veterans that died by suicide in 2018 did not  visit the VA in the year of their death or the previous year.   While the VA offers different types of treatment for veterans who are  battling with PTSD and TBI, we need to ensure that veterans are aware  of the programs available to them and remind them that they are not  alone.   That is also why earlier this month I cosigned a letter led by my  friend Representative   David Joyce to Secretary McDonough. This letter  urged the VA to develop a comprehensive plan to connect veterans of the  war in Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism to essential VA  benefits and services as soon as possible.   As I mentioned, Georgia's First Congressional District is home to a  large military and veteran community. We have several veteran nonprofit  organizations who focus on providing peer-to-peer support for veterans  who suffer from PTSD.   The PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program Act will ensure that all  veterans have access to a safe and confidential peer-to-peer platform.  I wholeheartedly believe this will help lower the number of veterans  who commit suicide in our country each day.   One death is too many.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for organizing this  today. His efforts are appreciated, they are recognized, and we thank  him for that.
