 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the  time.   With respect to the gentleman from Maryland, I understand the  perspective with respect to free speech, and I certainly wish to always  stand aside the protection of free speech in this country, but this  goes well beyond that.   We are not talking about restraining the gentlewoman from Michigan's  ability to speak as an American citizen. We are not talking about  punishing her and putting her in jail.   What we are talking about is whether a Member of the House of  Representatives, a Member of this body representing this Nation, is  justified in putting forward a defense of the actions of Hamas  terrorists that murdered innocent Israeli citizens and are holding  United States citizens and Israelis hostage. In her own language, she  was defending on October 8--a mere 24 hours into the brutal and  barbaric attacks in which babies were beheaded, babies were placed into  ovens, literally. Moms were raped in a house while their babies were  put in an oven. This is a documented account, video evidence, and this  is dismissed as resistance to an apartheid state.   My problem is that the gentlewoman is also referring to Joe Biden  supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people. The gentlewoman has  put forward that by virtue of the United States of America funding, in  solidarity the people of Israel in defense of their right to exist,  that by virtue of our position as Americans standing in  [[Page H5499]]  front of that flag in this Chamber representing 330 million Americans,  that by funding and supporting Israel, we are somehow perpetuating the  call for violence that we saw unfold right before our eyes on October 7  in the most brutal and heinous acts that some of us have ever seen.   I do not doubt the gentlewoman's sincerity of her concern for her  home people and concerns about the attacks on the people of Gaza.   I had some people who called into question that I would put out my  public support for my former colleague, Justin Amash, who lost cousins  in a church, receiving missile fire into a building next to a church.   I genuinely pray for the people of Israel, the people of Gaza, the  people throughout the world that are now dealing with all of this.   The gentlewoman cannot, as a Member of Congress, be standing up and  telling the world that what we saw unfold in attacking Israel is  justified. We can't.   Free speech matters. I have grave concern right now about where this  institution is going with respect to censures. I voted against the  censure last week because I thought it had drafting problems and I  thought it had significant concerns it raised.   Mr. Speaker, I believe the work that was done by my friend from  Georgia, he put forward a resolution that is worthy of support. I  support the resolution and believe that we should pass it.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend from Pennsylvania offering  the amendments that he has offered. I am offering here an amendment  that I have offered to other appropriations bills affecting other  agencies that would prohibit any of the funding in this bill, the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill, from being used to  carry out President Biden's executive orders on climate change.   We have had success in moving this amendment on previous  appropriations bills because, frankly, it is fairly obvious to most  people in the Chamber, certainly to most Americans, that these  executive orders are out of step and out of touch with where the  American people are. They are pushing a radical agenda that is  completely devoid of recognition of what is happening in every  American's life right now, that they can't afford to buy even the home  they live in, much less the fuel they need for their cars, buy the car  that they need, be able to afford to pursue any of the initiatives put  forward in terms of solar panels and other things because we are  driving up the price of energy, making it impossible for people to live  their lives because we are pursuing a radical agenda.   By the way, it is making us completely dependent on China at a time  when we should be decoupling from China. It is at a time that is making  it where we are not holding Iran accountable, and we are actually  enriching Iran right now with our energy policies.   We are not sanctioning Iran. We are allowing them to sell oil to  China. We are advancing this agenda because my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle want to put out this notion of climate change as  being more important than the inflation that is wrecking the American  family. I have had Members on the other side of the aisle testify to  this in the Rules Committee. They literally have said that.   They are prioritizing this agenda over the American family today who  cannot afford an automobile, cannot afford the gasoline to put in the  automobile, cannot afford the energy prices in their homes,  electricity, and can't even afford the houses because of what this  administration has done with their policies to drive up the price of  energy with a radical agenda.   In this case, Secretary Buttigieg is on a mission to overhaul the  transportation sector saying, ``Transportation ought to be responsible  for the biggest share of the solution.'' DOT has established a Climate  Change Center with the goal of decarbonizing the transportation sector  by 2050.   In July of 2022, the Secretary said, ``The more pain we are all  experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there is for  those who can access electric vehicles.'' Right there is the agenda of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Right there is the agenda  of the Biden administration. They want the American people to feel  pain. Those are the words of the Secretary of Transportation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the problem is that if you listen to our  Secretary, we saw that in 2 months after he made those comments,  California asked EV owners to stop charging amid a heat wave.   Secretary Granholm literally pushed aside a pregnant woman and her  family from the ability to charge at a charging station in order to do  a photo op.   That is what we are doing. This is all about projecting an image. It  is not about the real-life impact on American families. That is the  truth. For example here, one of the Secretary's appointees to DOT's  Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity--don't get me started on  that--has said: ``All cars are bad.'' All cars are bad.   This is about undermining the American way of life, and the fact of  the matter is, if you eliminate the internal combustion engine--by the  way, the internal combustion engine that is sitting in President  Biden's 1967 Corvette--which I believe is a 327; I don't think he has  the 427--doesn't get exactly a great deal of really good gas mileage  and, in fact, is spewing out a whole lot more carbon than the average  American's vehicle. By the way, I am totally fine with that because it  is a great car, a great example of American awesomeness, to be clear.   The fact is when you have got an appointee of the Committee on  Transportation Equity saying, ``All cars are bad,'' that tells you  exactly what the situation is.   If you eliminate the internal combustion engine, that will do nothing  when you know that China has 1,100 coal-fired plants. We have about  250, and China is building a couple coal-fired plants a week, and we  think that we are going to impact CO2 production around the  world?   How about we develop nuclear power? How about we let the American  people live their lives? How about we let the American people not have  their lives get crushed with radical policies?   That is why this amendment should be adopted.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1945
