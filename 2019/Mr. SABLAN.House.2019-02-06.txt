 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from the great State of  New York and the great city of New York for inviting me to speak on the  need for comprehensive immigration reform for our Nation as a whole  and, specifically, about how the broken immigration system hurts people  I represent in the Mariana Islands.   In 2013, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill,  with Republicans and Democrats voting together, that would have gone a  long way to fixing immigration.   The bill gave people who came here illegally but are now contributing  to the economic prosperity of all Americans a way to come out of the  shadows, and it provided for substantial improvements in border  security--just what the President says he wants.   The Republican-led House decided not to take the path the Senate had  courageously shown us in 2013, but I hope that, in this 116th Congress,  we can dust off that comprehensive immigration reform bill and breathe  new life into it.   Because our immigration problems still need fixing, we have a  solution, ready-made, that already passed the Senate with Republican  and Democratic votes.   I worked with the Gang of Eight in the Senate who drafted that  legislation. I was able to include a section that dealt with groups of  people in the Mariana Islands who fell through the cracks when Congress  extended U.S. immigration law to my islands in 2008.  [[Page H1382]]    Let me begin by saying that none of the people I wanted to help came  into our country illegally or stayed illegally. They were all lawfully  present, but their situations were not understood or accounted for when  Federal law was applied to the Mariana Islands. I have wanted to help  them since my first days in Congress 10 years ago, and I will not stop  working until they are pulled out of the limbo we left them in. Let me  tell you about these people.   Imagine you are the daughter or son of parents who came to the  Mariana Islands before 1976, before our islands were even part of the  United States. The Mariana Islands is your only home. You grew up in  the Islands, went to school, have worked there ever since, raising your  own family, always lawfully present.   Then, three decades later, Congress decides to extend America's  immigration borders. Suddenly, you are told you are a foreigner. You  need a work visa or humanitarian parole or, otherwise, you will have to  leave the only home you have ever known. Imagine.   The Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill would have fixed  that.   Imagine you are living in the Mariana Islands and the local  government passes a law, as it has every right to do, that gives you  permanent resident status. Then along comes Congress, 25 years later,  and says the Mariana Islands is within U.S. immigration borders now.  Oh, and by the way, you permanent residents, you do not have that  status anymore. If you want to stay, you need a work visa or  humanitarian parole; otherwise, you will have to leave your home, your  children, your family. Imagine.                                time  1445    The Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill would have fixed  that.   Imagine coming to the Marianas as a foreign worker. You have  contributed to economic growth and have been a lawfully present  resident for decades. But Congress passes a new law, and suddenly, your  status changes. Even if you have a spouse or children who are U.S.  citizens, they cannot petition for you because they are too poor or  underage.   Under the Obama administration, at least you were granted  humanitarian parole. But the Trump administration wants you gone by  June 30, June 30 of this year.   You must uproot your family, pull your children out of school, or  leave them behind as orphans. Imagine.   The Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill would have fixed  that, too.   Madam Speaker, I come from a very small community, compared to my  colleagues here in the House, just 50,000 people. When I ask you to  imagine the plight of those who were forgotten when Congress extended  Federal immigration law to the Marianas, I do not have to imagine who  they are. I know them individually. They are my neighbors. Some are my  relatives. None are strangers to me. They are good people who came in  legally and remained lawfully present. But their lives are precarious,  and the Trump administration is tightening the noose.   We do not have to imagine how to help them. The solution is before  us. The Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, a  bipartisan vote, a set of policies to fix our broken system and  strengthen border security, I dare say could pass this House today. Let  us act.   Again, I thank the gentleman from New York for giving me this time to  speak.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Escobar), the CHC freshman Representative.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague very much for her  comments.   Madam Speaker, I just realized that today, this Special Order, we had  four speakers, three of whom are immigrants: the gentleman from New  York, the gentleman from Illinois, and this gentleman from the Northern  Marianas. We are immigrants. The sky hasn't fallen.   There is nothing to be afraid of. We are a country of immigrants.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Espaillat, for organizing  this evening's Special Order on the need for immigration reform.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
