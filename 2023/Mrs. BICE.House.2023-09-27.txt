 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this year's Defense  appropriations bill, and I thank Chairwoman Granger and Chairman  Calvert for their hard work in crafting this important bill.   Today, our Nation faces serious threats from our adversaries--in  particular, the People's Republic of China. This legislation focuses on  delivering the resources needed to counter these threats and to support  our servicemembers and their families.   The bill includes one of the largest pay increases for our troops in  years, particularly for our junior enlisted, as well as needed  investments in next-generation fighter aircraft, submarines, and  modernized tactical vehicles.   I am also pleased that the bill focuses on combating the illicit flow  of opioids and fentanyl into the country, which is killing countless  Americans on a daily basis.   The legislation takes needed steps to ensure that the DOD is focused  on its core mission of being the most lethal and effective fighting  force on the planet, not on advancing a woke agenda.   Lastly, I am pleased that the bill includes important Defense  priorities in the State of Oklahoma, including funding to accelerate  the E-7, which will be based at Tinker Air Force Base.
