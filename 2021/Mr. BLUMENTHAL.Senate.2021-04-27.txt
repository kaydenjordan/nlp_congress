 Madam President, today I rise to recognize  Lions Clubs International as it celebrates 100 years of outstanding  service in Connecticut.   In the winter of 1921, Lions Clubs International, now the world's  largest service organization, dispatched an organizer to Connecticut to  form the first Lions Club in New England, the Bridgeport Host Lions  Club. Throughout their century of service, these volunteers have worked  diligently to help set up a fresh-air camp for Bridgeport's youth,  create a vision clinic at Bridgeport Hospital, purchase x-ray devices  at St. Vincent's Medical Center, provide dental services for the  indigent at Park City Hospital, and a litany of other community  projects. Lions Clubs in New Haven, Greater Hartford, New Britain, New  London, Greenwich, Waterbury, Meriden, Torrington, and Bristol would  soon follow. Today, approximately 160 clubs with over 4,600 Lions are  serving their communities, many collaborating with local governments to  act as dependable volunteer arms.   In 1925, a future Connecticut resident, Helen Keller, would have a  profound impact on the mission and very future of Lions Clubs  International with her simple plea: ``Will you not help me hasten the  day when there shall be no preventable blindness; no little deaf, blind  child untaught; no blind man or woman unaided? I appeal to you Lions,  you who have your sight, your hearing, you who are strong and brave and  kind. Will you not constitute yourselves Knights of the Blind in this  crusade against darkness?'' Connecticut Lions not only embraced her  message, but also did much more, donating monies and time to support  their communities locally and globally. Lions Clubs across the State  have sponsored parades, festivals, and school projects, as well as  raised funds for building equipment to improve the quality of life for  children, the disabled, seniors, and veterans. Connecticut Lions have  taken families in need shopping to make their holidays brighter. In  support of the health and well-being of their communities, Lions Clubs  have donated ambulances, school buses and other vehicles, and vital  [[Page S2222]]  equipment to our local emergency response teams, senior centers, and  social services agencies.   Perhaps the most critical area of focus for Lions Clubs has been in  vision care. In their ``crusade against darkness,'' Lions Clubs have  raised enormous sums for research into blindness and eye disease. The  Connecticut Lions Eye Research Foundation was chartered in 1956,  establishing an eye research clinic under the auspices of Yale  University, and later helped establish a second research facility with  the University of Connecticut. Thanks to the work at these clinics,  thousands of children and adults have benefitted from quality care and  research.   Connecticut Lions have also established three District Lions Low  Vision Centers to improve the quality of life and independence of those  suffering from low vision. I have personally visited one of these  centers and listened to healthcare providers and patients discuss how  important and valuable these centers are.   For those still struggling with hearing and vision issues, the  Connecticut Lions have supported the Connecticut Radio Information  System with donations, volunteer readers, and other assistance. Guide  and service dogs have been sponsored by Connecticut Lions, helping to  restore the independence of the blind and visually impaired in their  communities.   Connecticut Lions have also been deeply involved in providing relief  from disaster and tragedy. In the early stages of the COVID-19  pandemic, Connecticut Lions secured sizeable grants from Lions Clubs  International Foundation to purchase and distribute critically needed  equipment for our first responders and healthcare workers. When  Hurricane Sandy devastated much of the State's shoreline, our Lions  Clubs provided meals for first responders and volunteers who worked  tirelessly to rescue people and restore services following the storm.  Immediately following the Sandy Hook tragedy in December 2012, the  Newtown Lions established a community fund to address the short-term  and long-term needs of individuals arising from that tragic event. To  date, they have raised more than $11 million for those affected by  posttraumatic shock disorder, including many children of Sandy Hook  Elementary School. Connecticut Lions recognized the desperate need of  Hurricane Katrina victims, donating thousands of dollars and making  multiple trips with shipments of vital supplies. Connecticut Lions have  collected and provided food year-round, working with meal centers, food  banks, and food share programs to distribute directly to our homeless  and those in need. Police and first responders in many towns were  provided with ``Homeless Kits.''   In the face of tragedy and immense need, the Connecticut Lions have  never forgotten the importance of looking to the future. Connecticut's  youth have been a significant part of Lions Club service programs.  Leadership, Experience, Opportunity--LEO--Clubs give our youth an  opportunity to serve their communities and develop their leadership  skills. The Lions Quest program brings schools, families, and  communities together to promote the development of healthy and  responsible young people through social and emotional learning,  character development, and a commitment to community service. The  International Peace Poster Contest has provided an opportunity for  children to express their visions of peace through art and creativity.  Outstanding students striving to reach higher academic achievement have  been provided significant scholarships as rewards for their incredible  work.   We are proud of our Connecticut Lions who are, each one, a solid  citizen contributing significantly to their community and beyond. They  strive for new ways to serve others and to address the needs of their  communities. Connecticut Lions are adept at recognizing needs, planning  projects, organizing fundraisers, and rolling their sleeves up to get  the job done. ``Where there is a need, there is a Lion!'' For 100  years, our Connecticut Lions have proudly demonstrated their motto:  ``We Serve''                            ____________________
