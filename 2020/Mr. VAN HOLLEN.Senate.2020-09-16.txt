 Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues  Senator Menendez and Senator Durbin in urging the U.S. Senate to do the  right thing and grant protected status to Venezuelans in this country.  At this moment, I thank them for their continued leadership on this  issue and for making sure we have immigration policies that live up to  what this country has always stood for.   As my colleagues have pointed out, Venezuela is suffering a dire  humanitarian crisis under the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. Its  economy has collapsed, and its medical system is in free fall. They are  governing through a reign of terror.   Even before COVID-19 struck, Venezuelans were facing shortages of  food, of water, of gasoline, and other lifesaving items. The pandemic  has taken a very bad situation and made it much worse--in fact,  desperate. An estimated two-thirds of physicians in Venezuela lack  access to basic sanitary equipment, like gloves, masks, soap, or  goggles, and only 25 percent of the doctors have reliable running water  in their hospitals and clinics.   On top of this desperate economic situation, you have the political  tyranny and terror that has been imposed by the Maduro regime. In fact,  as my colleagues pointed out just this morning, U.N. investigators  found that Venezuelan security forces and allied groups have committed  systemic human rights violations, including killings and torture,  amounting to crimes against humanity. Reasonable grounds exist to  believe that President Maduro and his Interior and Defense Ministers  ordered or contributed to these crimes against humanity, which are  documented in the U.N. report. The U.N. factfinding mission has said  that other national jurisdictions and the International Criminal Court  should consider prosecutions. So you have a desperate situation.   President Trump claims to support the people of Venezuela who are  facing this tyranny and this desperation. In fact, as Senator Durbin  said, he has on numerous occasions said he was sympathetic and that he  wanted to help.   Here is what he said last year: ``To the Venezuelans trapped in this  nightmare, please know that all of America is behind you.''   That is what President Trump said. Yet he has refused to use his  authority to take action to grant Venezuelans here in the United States  that temporary protected status. He wants to send them back to what he  describes as a nightmare--a nightmare that is getting worse by the day  as documented by the U.N. report. He wants to send them back to a place  where the U.N. has just implicated the government in crimes against  humanity.   Because the President refuses to do what he says--refuses to actually  take action to help--the House has passed legislation to grant  Venezuelans TPS. My colleagues Senator Menendez and Senator Durbin have  introduced that legislation here in the Senate, and I am proud to  cosponsor it. Yet, as we are saying here today, the fastest thing to do  is to just take up the House bill and pass it. So it is incredibly  disturbing that our Republican colleagues would get up and block a vote  on that action on the very day when the government in question, the  Government of Venezuela, has been found to have committed crimes  against humanity.   The majority in this Senate says: Well, don't worry about that. If  you are here in the United States, we are going to insist that you go  back home. We are going to insist that you put yourself and your family  back this danger.   That is what our Senate Republican colleagues are saying by blocking  the vote on this House TPS measure. They are forcing innocent people to  go home to what the President himself described as a nightmare.   As my colleagues have said and as we know, this is part of an  inhumane, anti-immigration agenda from this administration--from the  Muslim ban, to ending DACA, to the termination of TPS for many other  populations. This President has separated families and instilled fear  in our communities.   Senator Menendez referenced the Ninth Circuit Court's decision from  earlier this week, the decision of its upholding, on a 2-to-1 vote, the  President's decision to rescind TPS protections for over 400,000  individuals who are here, working in our communities, living here  legally with their families. Many of them have been here for over 20  years. As he said, 130,000 of them are on our frontlines as essential  workers. More than 10,000 of them are medical professionals who put  themselves at risk to help others throughout our communities and our  country. These are individuals who are our neighbors and small business  men and women, and they are contributing to our communities and to our  country. The President has said he wants to deport them--400,000  people--despite this hour of peril both here and even more so in the  countries to which they would be required to return.   That is why we have to pass the SECURE Act--to provide stability and  security to those who are on TPS. That is why we have to pass the  American Dream and Promise Act that the House passed last year.   That is why we need to grant TPS to Venezuela, so, as my colleagues  say, this country can do what Presidents from both political parties  have done in the past and Members of the House and Senate from both  political parties have done in the past, which is to live up to the  idea that we are a place of refuge for those who are facing political  persecution at home.   I don't know how you can more clearly define ``political  persecution'' on this day than a finding by the United Nations that the  Government of Venezuela is committing crimes against humanity, against  the people of Venezuela. Yet, that is the day that, once again, we saw  our Republican colleagues block this legislation that would allow our  country to live up to our tradition of doing the right thing.  [[Page S5637]]    As Senator Menendez said, I look forward to joining him as we  continue to press this issue. I guess the only good news is that it  seems to be getting a little harder for the other side--our Republican  colleagues--to find somebody who wants to come here in the light of day  and object to it. I hope that in the coming days, that number will be  zero and we can actually pass this important piece of legislation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
