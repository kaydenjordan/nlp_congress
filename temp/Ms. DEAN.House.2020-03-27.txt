 Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus pandemic is a reminder of our  common humanity and our interconnectedness.   I stand today to say Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and Berks  County, Pennsylvania, my home district, have been particularly hard  hit. There are suffering and courage in my community. We have had three  deaths.   I rise in support of this CARES Act. It is unprecedented. It is a  monumental bill to send relief and confidence to those who are  suffering, to our workers, to our families, to our children, to our  business owners. I am proud to support this bill.
