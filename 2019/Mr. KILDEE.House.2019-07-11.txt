 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the committee for  working with me on addressing this PFAS contamination issue.   Today, the House is taking historic action to address PFAS  contamination that is hurting communities, including communities like  the city of Oscoda in my district in Michigan.   At the beginning of the year, I launched the bipartisan Congressional  PFAS Task Force to bring together Members of Congress who are dealing  with contamination in their districts. We wanted to work together on  meaningful legislation to address PFAS and to protect public health.   I am very pleased to stand here today, 6 months later, in support of  these amendments. The package of amendments included in this en bloc  will help address PFAS contamination and ensure people have access to  safe drinking water.   Included in the package are three of my amendments.   The first would direct the U.S. Geological Survey to look for PFAS  contamination around the country so we know where people are  potentially exposed.   My second amendment would require the Government Accountability  Office to conduct a review of the military's response to PFAS  contamination and its efforts to clean it up.   Another amendment that I was proud to work on with my friend,  Congresswoman Dean from Pennsylvania, is to end the use of PFAS by the  military by 2025. This will protect servicemembers from being exposed  to these dangerous chemicals.   These provisions will mean fewer veterans, servicemembers, and  families will face struggles like those in my district have faced. I am  proud to see this come to the floor. I thank the chairman for his work  on this.
