 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act.   Hardworking Americans who are paid hourly wages and work overtime  should have the choice to receive the money or annual leave to spend  how they choose. Under our outdated law, they don't have this choice  today. This commonsense legislation will fix that and directly benefit  workers and their families.   As a single working mom myself, I know firsthand the difficulties  parents encounter when trying to balance work and family  responsibilities. For hourly  [[Page H3044]]  workers having the voluntary option to take either money or more time  with their families opens up a world of possibilities for folks to  spend more time with their kids, run errands, or make appointments.   This is an option provided to workers in the public sector. Why  wouldn't we want to give this option to all American workers?   I support this family friendly legislation. I encourage my colleagues  to support it as well.
