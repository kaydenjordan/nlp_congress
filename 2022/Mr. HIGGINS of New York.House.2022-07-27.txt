 I rise today in support of H.R. 6929, the  Susan Muffley Act.   Madam Speaker, this House has been one of the strongest advocates for  workers and worker families in recent history.   We passed legislation to increase the minimum wage; to support the  right to organize; to decrease the cost of drugs and health insurance.  And we protected and restored pensions. But as this bill shows, our  work is not complete.   My community in Buffalo and Western New York has a long history of  auto-making. When the recession hit in 2009, families across my  district saw their pensions evaporate.   And while we stabilized the auto sector, and the loans have been  repaid, thousands of former auto company employees have been left  behind, including hundreds of Delphi workers in Lockport who, due to no  fault of their own, had their pensions arbitrarily cut.   This legislation will fix that longstanding error and will provide  certainty so that these families can retire with the benefits they  earned.   I thank Mr. Kildee from Michigan, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Turner from Ohio,  for being champions of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  its passage.
