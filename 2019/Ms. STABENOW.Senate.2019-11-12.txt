 Mr. President, I support the sentiments of my colleague  from Illinois in objecting to the ``small refinery relief'' language in  the fiscal year 2020 Interior appropriations bill. In the past, this  language has been invoked by the Trump administration's  [[Page S6504]]  Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to disregard the Department of  Energy's recommendations regarding small refinery hardships under the  renewable fuel standard, RFS, and waive additional gallons of renewable  fuels from our fuel supply. These actions, permitted by President  Trump, hurt rural America and our farmers.   The RFS is an important driver of Michigan jobs and our bio-based  economy. This Administration's continued abuse of refinery waivers  undermine the integrity of the RFS program and hurt our farmers,  biofuel producers, and rural communities in Michigan and across the  country. I strongly oppose this report language and encourage my  colleagues to support rural America's interests by calling to end the  Trump administration's abuse of small refinery exemptions.
