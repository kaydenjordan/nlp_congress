 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Connecticut State Labor Council AFL-CIO as they celebrate 60 years of  extraordinary and exemplary advocacy on behalf of Connecticut workers  and their families.   Since its formation in 1957 with the merging of the Connecticut  Federation of Labor and the Connecticut State Industrial Union Council,  the Connecticut State AFL-CIO has demonstrated an impressive dedication  to the wellbeing of workers across the State. The organization seeks  fair and equal treatment for workers through collective bargaining on  their behalf and promoting legislation to create good jobs and provide  people with the skills needed for them.   Simply, they strengthen the middle class, allowing tens of thousands  of people to own a home, raise their families, and retire with  financial security.   Uniting workers and their families toward these common goals, the  Connecticut AFL-CIO has fought continuously and ceaselessly for better  wages, benefits, and conditions for the working families of the State.  Throughout its six decades, the Connecticut AFL-CIO has facilitated  union member access to insurance plans, credit cards, and beneficial  mortgage programs.   Always looking for ways to raise the standard of living for our  middle-class workers, the Connecticut AFL-CIO was one of the early  leaders in the fight to achieve affordable and accessible quality  healthcare, pay equity, and parental and medical leave for all  employees. The Connecticut AFL-CIO also helps those who have lost their  jobs, supporting fair unemployment compensation laws and education and  job training programs.   Since its formation, the Connecticut AFL-CIO continuously puts the  needs of workers and their families first. I applaud their numerous  achievements and hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the  Connecticut State AFL-CIO on 60 years of service and commitment to  Connecticut employees.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, we have been here before. We have been  here in the wake of Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Orlando, numerous other  mass shootings, and now Las Vegas.   We can all agree that our hearts and prayers, mourning and  condolences go out to the families of loved ones who have suffered this  senseless, horrific violence. We can also agree that many of the  details are unknown about the shooter, and a lot of investigation will  be done. We can all agree that Las Vegas was struck by evil; call it  pure evil.   We know what it looks like in Connecticut because we saw it firsthand  in Newtown. We lived through the heartbreaking, unspeakable violence of  that day, just a few years ago, when evil visited Newtown and caused  the death of 26 beautiful human beings, including 20 children. America  came together in support of us in Connecticut, and today we should come  together in support of the people of Nevada.   My heart and prayers are with them, but thoughts and prayers are not  enough. We know the evil that visited Connecticut also brought forth  good in other people--in the first responders, the doctors, and  countless members of the community and people of America who united.   I will never forget that day in Newtown when the community came  together in St. Rose of Lima Church for an evening of mourning. I said  then that the whole world was watching. Indeed, what the world saw was  courage and resilience of truly heroic proportions--some of the good  along with the evil.    When I saw those images today in Las Vegas--the sound of that  gunfire, the pandemonium, the reports of injuries and deaths--it  brought back to me that day in Newtown. I was not there for the  shooting, as I had gone later in the day, but the memories of that day  and of the successive days, weeks, and years had been brought back. My  heart broke, but my stomach also churned with anger. I was frustrated  and furious.   I am now furious because Congress has failed to act. Nothing has  changed since Newtown. Congress has been complicit when we have had  numerous opportunities and many reasons to make America safer and adopt  commonsense measures that 90 percent of Americans support. So thoughts  and prayers are not enough. Hand-wringing and soul-searching is needed,  but it is insufficient. What is needed now is action.   I am under no illusions. Nobody needs to tell me where the votes are  at this moment. We need to be realistic about what the agenda is in our  going forward. We need to be very clear-eyed and realistic, but we also  need to recognize that we can win this fight. Between the time that  Ronald Reagan had almost been assassinated and the day that the Brady  bill had passed, it had been almost 10 years. We need to be in this  fight as a marathon, not as a sprint, and that is the determination and  resolve that must be brought to this effort.   It was 5 years ago when a man wielding a semiautomatic rifle murdered  20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.  The cries of grief echoed around this country, and there was a moment  when action could have been taken. We need to seize this moment. Then,  the vote, shamefully, failed to reach 60 for commonsense measures, like  background checks. We needed 60, and we had a majority, and our  colleagues in the House of Representatives told us that that measure  would have passed there.   Since then, every day in this country an average of 92 Americans die  due to gun violence, which is 33,000 Americans every year, and 59 is  the death toll as of this moment in Las Vegas. Day after  [[Page S6266]]  day, 92 Americans are killed as a result of gun violence, and 60 of  them are suicides, but that is no less a death, and it is a preventable  death if there are commonsense measures that will stop this carnage.   I would be happy never to speak about this topic, never to complain  again about Congress's complicity, but our hearts break, and our  stomachs churn with fury. America's should as well. After Newtown,  Aurora, Blacksburg, Charleston, Chattanooga, Lafayette, San Bernardino,  Orlando, and, now, Las Vegas, these cities have become synonymous with  mass shootings--unjustly tarnished. What is needed is national resolve.   For anyone who says that we should only mourn or offer condolences,  let me just say, very simply: Let us honor those victims and keep faith  with their memories, so that their lives and losses will not be in  vain, by taking action that makes America safer. Let us redouble our  determination. The bills are ready to go, the agenda is set, and the  action is clear. Let us honor their memories through action. If the  President believes this carnage was pure evil, let him lead--if not  today, tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, Wednesday, when he visits Las  Vegas. If these actions were pure evil, let us all lead by our example,  and let us move forward to stop this carnage in the future. We grieve  these losses, but we need to recognize that the measures now before  Congress are a travesty and a dishonor to those lives that were lost.   One of these proposals is an innocuous-sounding Hearing Protection  Act--let me repeat: the Hearing Protection Act--which could come to a  vote as early as this week in the House of Representatives. This  measure would gut regulations on gun silencers.   Now, let's be very clear. Silencers are already widely available to  hundreds of sportsmen who pay the fee, register, and wait for a short  period. This legislation would make it terrifyingly easy to buy a gun  silencer. Hunters and recreational shooters deserve to have silencers  but only if they comply with those regulations. This measure would pose  an unacceptable risk to public safety and make it more difficult for  law enforcement, especially in urban areas, to identify gunshots,  locate shooters, and protect civilians.   In one interview after another of the victims of last night's  shooting, there was a common refrain: They ran, and they escaped  because they heard those gunshots. The only supposed reform measure  before the Congress right now that has been given a chance of passage  is a proposal to make it easier to buy gun silencers. The only thing  that led those individuals to escape--or one of the only things--was,  in fact, the sound of gunshots. How many lives would have been taken  last night if the shooter had had a silencer?   Another proposal is the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would  essentially eliminate the States' ability to regulate concealed-carry  permits in their States, undermining the laws that States like  Connecticut have put in place to keep our residents safe.   In the wake of Newtown, Charleston, Orlando, and, now, Las Vegas,  Members of Congress should come together to protect our lives from  these senseless killings. It is not about Republicans or Democrats. It  is not about politics. It is not even about policy. It is about public  safety, simply. We should not be undermining protection. What a  travesty and tragedy and what a dishonor to the memories of those  victims in Las Vegas to now be on the verge of weakening rather than  strengthening our public safety laws.   Let's join hands across the aisle and across both Houses to stand up  to the gun lobby, the NRA, and other special interests and release and  break their grip on Congress. More than thoughts and prayers are  necessary, although they fulfill a vitally important function. Talk  must be turned into action. Waiting simply means more deaths, and delay  means time. Time is not on our side with there being 92 deaths, on  average, every day as a result of gun violence.   Let us join together and combat evil. Certainly, it was there in Las  Vegas, but it will visit other communities, as it does every day. Those  92 deaths and mass shootings will continue unless commonsense, sensible  measures, like a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,  are adopted, as well as there being mandatory background checks for all  gun sales. Until this is adopted, America will be more at risk. We must  make America safer, and that is an obligation that we share across the  aisle and across the two bodies of Congress.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
