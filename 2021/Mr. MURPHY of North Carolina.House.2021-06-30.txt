 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in  opposition to H.R. 3684. American infrastructure is in dire need of  repair, but this is just not the way to do it.   One provision lifts a longtime ban against spending Federal money on  art and nonfunctional landscaping. It is sad when tax dollars are  diverted to afford art projects rather than fixing crumbling bridges,  buildings, and roads.   That is why I introduced H.R. 3208, which would amend the U.S. Code  to explicitly define what the term ``infrastructure'' means so we can  better allocate taxpayer dollars. In my bill, the term  ``infrastructure'' is defined as being specific to bridges, dams,  wharves, roads, highways, ports, buildings, and public utilities,  including broadband, airports, and train stations, not childcare.   This messaging bill prioritizes Pelosi's party and its green agenda  over the needs of this great Nation. I urge my colleagues to vigorously  oppose passage of this misguided bill.
