 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 374, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2213) to amend the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 to  authorize certain polygraph waiver authority, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 2213.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the question of  adopting amendment No. 1 to H.R. 2213 may be subject to postponement as  though under clause 8 of rule XX.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and in support of the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of  2017.   Mr. Speaker, the failed immigration policies of the previous  administration have kept our borders open, weakened our national  security, and put millions of American lives at risk from an increasing  number of grave and growing threats. These threats come from drug  cartels, gang members, human traffickers, and international terrorists  who seek to do our country harm.   Fortunately, we now have a partner in the White House who understands  that we cannot rely on the oceans or other natural boundaries alone to  separate us from those looking to infiltrate our homeland.   This morning, I was once again pleased to welcome Secretary Kelly  before the Committee on Homeland Security and listen to him articulate  the importance of border security to the Trump administration.   We know we need a 21st century border to meet 21st century threats.  Sadly, every few days, we hear a story on the news that reminds us of  the dangerous consequences of Washington's inability to achieve that  goal.   As a former Federal prosecutor and the chief of counterterrorism and  national security in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Texas, I have seen  how people take advantage of our Nation's open borders. Over time,  those who are determined to come here illegally become agile. They  adapt to the measures that we take to stop them. It is obvious that we  need a new approach.   When it comes to strengthening our borders, additional funds and new  technology will be necessary. However, our strongest assets are the  courageous men and women who serve as Border Patrol agents and Customs  and Border Protection officers. These patriots put their lives on the  line every single day to protect us while also safeguarding our  economic relationships that boost American jobs and grow American  businesses.   However, we are almost 1,800 Border Patrol agents and 1,000 CBP  officers short of having the force that we need to keep our borders  secure. Our forces are stretched thin and our efforts to recruit  additional officers and agents have slowed due to strict requirements  for new applicants. Currently, it takes an average of 113 applicants to  hire just one new officer or agent. This is a major problem that must  be addressed.   This legislation offers a solution by providing the CBP Commissioner  with the flexibility to hire State and local law enforcement officers  who have already served for 3 years without a break in service, are not  under investigation or have been found guilty of misconduct, and have  previously passed a law enforcement polygraph exam.   It also provides the CBP Commissioner with the authority to hire  members and veterans of the armed services who have held security  clearances and who have already completed a robust background check.   To put it simply, this bill will make it easier for some of America's  finest law enforcement officers and soldiers to help protect our  borders.   As drugs continue to creep into our neighborhoods and wreak havoc on  our communities and terrorists advance their plans to attack our  country and disrupt our way of life, we must make sure we have an  adequate force to protect our borders.   This needs to be a priority. This should not be a partisan issue. In  fact, Mr. Speaker, this bill passed unanimously out of my committee.  Members from both parties should come together, as they did at the  committee level, as Mr. Vela did, and support this effort.   American families deserve to know that we are doing everything we can  to keep our homeland safe. This legislation gives us a chance to do  just that.   I would like to thank my colleague and chairwoman of the Subcommittee  on Border and Maritime Security, Congresswoman McSally from Arizona,  for all of her hard work on this bill. As a Representative from a  district along our Southern border, she fully understands more than any  Member the seriousness of this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally), the sponsor of the bill and  the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Homeland Security  Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in concluding this debate, it is important to note this  bill is a bipartisan effort, passing unanimously out of my committee.  It is supported by Ranking Member Thompson, Congressman Vela, and we  thank you for that, and others. Again, it passed out unanimously.    I was pleased to see also a Dear Colleague letter sent by my  Democratic counterparts on the Homeland Security Committee urging the  passage of this bill. This only further underscores the bipartisan  nature of this effort.   It is also supported, Mr. Speaker, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  the Border Trade Alliance, the CBP officers' union, and the Fraternal  Order of Police, among others.   The issue is very clear. Not passing this bill will continue to keep  American families at risk from dangers of human traffickers, drug  smugglers, and international terrorists. Right now, we simply don't  have an adequate number of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers to  safeguard our Nation's border. We need to fix that. That is what this  legislation does. It will allow us to bolster our forces with talented  law enforcement officials and military personnel who have been  previously vetted and have already demonstrated their commitment and  patriotism to their fellow Americans.                                time  1545    As I have stated before, while new infrastructure and technology will  be important in protecting this Nation, the brave men and women who  confront threats to our homeland are our greatest assets.   Once again, I thank Congresswoman McSally, Ranking Members Vela and  [[Page H4683]]  Thompson, and all those who supported this bill. It will help  strengthen our borders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Lujan Grisham  amendment.   Let me say, first, that the Secretary of Homeland Security testified  before my committee this morning, a decorated four-star general serving  in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is the head of SOUTHCOM. This man knows the  border. Secretary Kelly supports this legislation.   I find it a bit offensive that decorated veterans who have already  received clearances somehow would present a threat to the security of  the United States, so I reject that argument.    This amendment strikes me as an unnecessary and harmful delay tactic  that would prevent CBP from implementing the much-needed flexibility  provided for in the underlying bill.   If the delays called for in this amendment were put in place, CBP  would have to sit and wait until certain unnecessary obstacles were  overcome, some of which are completely out of their control. All the  while, they would continue to hemorrhage officers and agents,  threatening the Nation's border security and the flow of commerce in  and out of the country. This could put our national security at risk  and would be, further, detrimental to the flow of legitimate trade and  travel.   CBP has missed hiring targets for Border Patrol agents for 4 years  and CBP officers for almost 18 months. We need additional officers and  agents now, simply to meet the congressionally mandated CBP staffing  levels that have been put in place for a year. We cannot wait for more  reports and evaluations.   Sadly, this amendment looks to me like an attempt by opponents of the  bill to prevent the important provisions of this bill from going into  effect in a timely manner, thus preventing the hiring of already  trusted and vetted individuals who have served their Nation and the  military with honor and distinction.   It is also important to underscore two points here: one, that all  applicants will continue to be fully vetted, including a rigorous tier  5 background investigation, which is equivalent to the investigation  performed for all servicemembers who hold a top secret clearance; and  second, the authority granted under this bill is discretionary. If the  CBP Commissioner wishes to require a polygraph examination for any  applicant for any reason, he can and should still do so.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to wait any longer. As the Speaker  knows, who is briefed on the threats, as do I, in a classified setting,  the threats are real. This Nation is at risk, and we cannot afford to  wait.   So, for these reasons, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to reject it.   Let me just close, again, by saying I oppose the amendment. The men  and women wearing the uniform on the front lines of our ports and  borders need relief now, and any delay tactics should be rejected.  Therefore, I urge opposition, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
