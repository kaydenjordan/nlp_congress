 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, Attorney General Barr  [[Page S1926]]  transmitted to Congress his summary of the special counsel's principal  conclusions from his investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere  in the 2016 election.   The result of that investigation is being hailed as good news for the  President, and it certainly is that. But, really, it is good news for  our entire country. It is good news that our law enforcement  professionals know much more about Russia's malevolent attempts to  interfere in American elections, and it is good news that we can  conclusively set aside the notion that the President and his team had  somehow participated in those attacks on our democracy.   According to the Attorney General, the special counsel's indepth  investigation ``did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone  associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts  to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.'' That really says it  all.   Further, Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein  concluded the investigation did not--did not--establish that the  President engaged in obstruction of justice.   So after 2 years, thousands of subpoenas, hundreds of search  warrants, hundreds of witnesses, millions of taxpayer dollars, these  are the findings: no collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction.   What the investigation did produce, it seems, is a deep examination  of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. The Attorney  General reports that Russia carried out online disinformation campaigns  and computer hacking efforts designed to sow discord in our Nation and  interfere in American politics.   It is deeply disturbing that the Obama administration was apparently  insufficiently prepared to anticipate and counter these Russian  threats. It was hardly a secret prior to November 2016 that Putin's  Russia was not, and is not, our friend. Yet, for years, the previous  administration ignored, excused, and failed to confront Putin's malign  activities both at home and abroad.   I am glad the special counsel's report will contribute new insight  and new understanding to our awareness of Russian activities. I look  forward to the release of more information in the coming days, as the  Attorney General has said he intends to do, in consultation with  Special Counsel Mueller.   I look forward, as well, to the continuing parallel work of our  Senate colleagues on the Select Committee on Intelligence to study the  threats that foreign interference pose to our institutions.   As I said, in any sane political moment, all of this would be very  welcome news to all Americans--in a normal time. But we know that,  amazingly, the reaction in some corners of the far left has seemed not  to be celebration but, rather, disappointment.   Huge components of the Democratic Party and their media allies have  spent literally years spinning intricate theories about this Presidency  and trying to sell the American people on their wild claims. It is as  if many of our Democratic colleagues are still just unable to process  the simple fact that, yes, the American people elected this Republican  President over his Democratic opponent.   We are faced with new evidence every day that our Republican policies  are delivering exactly the change that middle-class families voted for  back in 2016. Yet, even still, many on the left remain convinced that  only conspiracy and corruption could possibly explain why they might  actually lose an election.   Well, here in the real world, the American people hired this  President to clean up the mess of the preceding 8 years. That is  exactly what we set about doing, and the results are clear. The Nation  is clearly better off than it was 2 years ago.   I sincerely hope that now, at last, our friends on the left will be  able to put aside their fixation on permanently relitigating their loss  in 2016 and actually join in the productive work that the rest of us  have been proudly engaged in for the past 2 years and counting.   Unfortunately, the events over the last few months have not exactly  indicated that productive, practical cooperation is what our Democratic  colleagues have in mind. To the contrary, the Nation has watched as the  Democratic Party has engaged in a collective headlong sprint--a  headlong sprint--toward the left, as far to the left as possible, as  fast as possible.   They have proposed a massive rewriting of the rules of American  politics. They have proposed scrapping Medicare, slapping its name on a  brandnew, one-size-fits-all government insurance plan, and then making  American families' existing private insurance policies illegal. And, of  course, they have proposed what the Senate will be voting on later this  week--the famous Green New Deal.    My colleagues and I will have plenty more to say on this subject in  the coming days. Today, I just want to say that I could not be more  glad that the American people will have the opportunity to learn  precisely where each one of their Senators stands on this radical, top- down, and socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy.   Middle-class families will get to see if their Senators have been  wooed by the disjointed contents of leftish daydreams.   Hard-working Americans in Kentucky and around the country who are  employed in the energy and manufacturing industries will get to see if  their Senators support eliminating all fossil fuels and suffocating  their livelihoods.   Homeowners who take pride in their hard-earned investment will get to  see if their Senators are in favor of forcible, DC-directed remodeling  of every building in America.   Working-class Americans who have benefited from our growing economy  and historic job market will learn whether their Senators support  turning away from free enterprise and implementing a new government- driven employment system.   Families who have to budget for household expenses will see which  Senators vote to increase their electricity bills by what one analysis  pegs at--listen to this--$300 a month.   Of course, every American taxpayer will get to learn whether their  Senator supports saddling our Nation with the astronomical cost of this  socialist fantasy--tens and tens of trillions of dollars--a tax burden  that would be certain to hurt not just wealthy Americans but the middle  class as well.   On all of these questions, on this whole Democratic effort to rebrand  all the failed ideas of 20th-century socialism with a little green  paint, every Member of this body will have the opportunity to cast a  clear vote this very week. The American people deserve to know which  Senators can reject this crippling proposal right away and which  Senators find themselves unable to do that. That is exactly what they  will learn later this week.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I  said just a few moments ago, it is certainly good news for the country  that the special counsel concluded that there is no evidence that the  Trump campaign collaborated or conspired with the Russian Government to  influence the last Presidential election. It is also good news for the  country that due to the special counsel's work, we now have more  insight into Russia's efforts to interfere with our democratic  institution.   Now, I have consistently supported the proposition that the special  counsel should be allowed to finish his work without interference. The  work of the special counsel, however, is not yet complete. Neither is  the work of the Department of Justice. The Attorney General told us  yesterday that he is working with the special counsel to determine how  much of the special counsel's report can be produced without violating  the law and without jeopardizing other ongoing matters, including other  matters initiated by the special counsel. The special counsel and the  Justice Department ought to be allowed to finish their work in a  professional manner.   Now, my good friend, the Democratic leader, was all for allowing the  special counsel to conduct his work without political interference when  it might be politically advantageous to him, but, apparently, my friend  from New York is not for allowing the special counsel to complete his  work with the Justice Department, according to his best professional  and legal judgment, when that might be inconvenient to my friend's own  current political purposes.   To date, the Attorney General has followed through on his commitment  to the Congress. One of those commitments is that he intends to release  as much information as possible. I certainly welcome that commitment to  transparency, as do others, but to the extent that the Attorney  General, in consulting with the special counsel, believes it is  important to protect sensitive sources and methods, protect material  that could affect ongoing investigations and prosecutions, and is  legally protected, then he deserves the time to work through these  issues.   I am going to object in order to allow the special counsel and the  Justice Department to finish their careful and professional review of  a, no doubt, voluminous record--a record that likely contains  sensitive, classified, and legally protected material.   For all of those reasons, I object.    Mr. President, the country and the President had to  wait 2 years. It has been going on for 2 years. This very expensive  investigation took 2 years to be concluded. Look, it is not  unreasonable to give the special counsel and the Justice Department  just a little time to complete their review in a professional and  responsible manner.   Remember, as I said earlier, we are likely dealing here with other  potential prosecutions, classified information, and damaging people's  reputations. There is no evidence that the Attorney General is not  going to produce as much information as possible for all of us, and  that is why I objected.   I think it is a reasonable thing to do. We have been waiting for a  long time for this report to wrap up. It is largely good news, not just  for the President but for the country.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Bade nomination expire at 2:15 p.m. tomorrow;  further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action. I further ask that following the disposition of  the Bade nomination, the Senate proceed to legislative session and  resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 88, with the  time until 4 p.m. equally divided between the two leaders or their  designees; finally, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, that  the cloture motions with respect to the motions to proceed to S.J. Res.  8 and H.R. 268 ripen at 4 p.m. tomorrow.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today it is my honor to pay tribute to  Willard Kinzer, a one-of-a-kind Kentuckian who will receive a lifetime  achievement award at the beginning of April. Willard, a leading figure  in Floyd County, seems to have done it all.   He is a World War II veteran, who felt compelled to join the Navy  after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Willard's a nonstop worker, becoming  a prominent entrepreneur in eastern Kentucky, leading Kinzer Drilling  through expansions and growth. His philanthropy has helped build  schools in his native Appalachia and has supported the Mountain Arts  Center, and perhaps most unexpectedly Willard holds the distinction  [[Page S1932]]  as the first individual in history to drive a stock suspension car  faster than 230 miles per hour. If that weren't impressive enough, wait  until you hear that Willard was in his 80s at the time.   He certainly has a notable list of accomplishments, and Willard shows  no plans to slow down any time soon. Last year, he celebrated his 90th  birthday by winning a drag-racing championship at 175 miles per hour,  In Willard's trophy room, which is packed with the many awards he has  earned over a long career of achievement and thrill-seeking, a sign  reads, ``Life begins at 200 mph.'' It is a fitting motto for a man who  never seems to take his foot off the gas pedal.   Willard's local community will continue to enjoy his many  contributions and inspirational example for generations to come. I am  pleased to see his incredible life be honored, and I would like to add  my voice to the chorus of those praising this remarkable Kentuckian. I  hope my Senate colleagues will join me in recognizing Willard Kinzer  for a lifetime of achievement and to congratulate him on this honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 863.
