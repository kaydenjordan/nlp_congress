 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to President  Trump's ever-growing risk of personal and business entanglements. They  call into question his ability to serve impartially in the interests of  the American people. Both he and his administration remain closely  linked to private companies and foreign entities whose interests are  often in direct opposition to those of the United States.   For example, we are well aware of the increasing boldness of the  Chinese regime and its efforts to extend their economic and military  influence. Despite portraying China publicly as a threat to economic  growth of the United States, the President has selected Goldman Sachs'  executive, Gary Cohn, to be his director of the National Economic  Council. That is about one of seven individuals from Goldman Sachs who  have been brought into this administration. Mr. Cohn has just sold his  $16 million holding in a Chinese bank. This same state-owned Chinese  bank also happens to be the largest tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan.  Isn't that a coincidence?    Wilbur Ross, President Trump's choice for Commerce Secretary,  presents similar conflicts of interest. As a man who will play a major  role in shaping U.S. trade policy, Mr. Ross continues to hold a stake  worth tens of millions of dollars in the international shipping  company, Diamond S Shipping Group, a company that not only operates  ships that fly the Chinese flag, but those ships also call on ports in  countries, such as Iran and Sudan, that are under U.S. sanctions for  being state sponsors of terrorism.   We also know that The Trump Organization was recently awarded sole  rights to the President's name for products sold in China. He had  waited 10 years to get those rights. The case was settled just mere  days after President Trump's phone call with Chinese President Xi  Jinping, when the President reversed his prior stance on Chinese  unification and gave a full-throated endorsement to what he termed  ``One China'' policy. That was a reversal from what he had done just  after the election.   Meanwhile, according to The New York Times, President Trump's son-in- law, Jared Kushner, was recently negotiating a real estate deal worth  hundreds of millions of dollars with a Chinese company closely tied to  its government. And while it has been reported that the deal was called  off, the fact that Mr. Kushner is continuing to negotiate private real  estate deals while serving as a White House employee is deeply  troubling.   It was announced last week that Ivanka Trump will now be joining her  husband in the White House as an adviser to the President with top  secret security clearance. While she has stepped down from her former  role at her fashion licensing company that uses the Trump name, her  decision to transfer her brand's assets into a trust run by her own  brother-in-law--and her arrangement to continue to receive fixed  payments from the company--is a matter of serious concern given her  role in the administration.   The ever-growing list of valid concerns about the Trump  administration's conflicting entanglements are taking place at the same  time that the President is proposing $18 billion in reductions for the  2017 appropriations process--while he himself, his daughter, son-in- law, and his Cabinet members continue to benefit off the American  taxpayer.   While the President spends millions of tax dollars on securing his  residences in New York and in Florida and flying to his so-called  southern White House almost every weekend, he is slashing to zero the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative--an absolutely critical program that  directly impacts my district and many others responsible for preserving  the world's largest body of fresh water from serious and growing  environmental threats. What is right about that?   President Trump also wants to eliminate TIGER grants, a highly  successful transportation program that provides  [[Page H2636]]  funding for communities across America with backlogged infrastructure  projects that create jobs and produce robust economic benefits.  Everyone agrees on that.   He has also called for a nearly $3 billion draconian reduction to  foreign operations endangering our national security. We are the leader  of the free world the last time I looked, and, meanwhile, he and his  family spend millions of American taxpayer dollars on travel and  security costs for themselves.   With an investigation into President Trump's possible entanglements  with Putin's Russia already underway, and members of the President's  family and administration engaging in increasingly brazen conflicts of  interest, this Congress should pass legislation to prevent these  increasingly apparent conflicts of interest from endangering our Nation  and the American people. It is only a matter of time before his  conflicts of interest harm our country.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is Equal Pay Day, and I am privileged to  rise in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act today. This legislation  would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by ensuring that women can  hold employers accountable for what they earn and challenge  discrimination. Representative Rosa DeLauro has introduced this bill  for two decades, which is two decades too long.   Women in Ohio make 75 cents for every dollar a man makes, which is  unacceptable. It is time we close the decades-old loophole that  prevents the United States from closing this gender pay gap once and  for all.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act  of 1963, by holding employers accountable for discriminatory practices.  The bill would end the practice of pay secrecy, ease workers' ability  to individually or jointly challenge pay discrimination, and strengthen  the available remedies for wronged employees.   President Trump said on equal pay: ``If they do the same job, they  should get the same pay.'' Boy, do I agree. So let's make it happen.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rush) in the beginning of our Special Order this evening.     Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the Anniversary of His                                   Death     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rush) in the beginning of our Special Order this evening.     Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the Anniversary of His                                   Death     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rush) in the beginning of our Special Order this evening.     Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the Anniversary of His                                   Death     Mr. Speaker, Congressman Rush is always calling the  Nation to its higher principles. I thank him so very much for sharing  our Special Order this evening.   Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island is here on the floor. I  also want to thank Congressman John Garamendi for sharing his hour with  us.   The focus tonight really is on jobs and trade, an issue on the mind  of millions and millions of Americans. We have been joined by  Congressman Brendan Boyle of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well.   I will place this up for the Nation to see. It is a chart showing  just U.S. trade relations with Mexico and Canada and what has happened  since the deal was negotiated back in the early 1990s. It was also  prepared before that, during the 1980s, when the United States actually  had some trade surpluses on this continent with both Canada and Mexico.   This shows, in 1994, when NAFTA was actually enacted. You could see  the United States begin to kind of fall into deficit. Then we had just  a precipitous trade deficit, including the collapse of the peso after  the NAFTA trade agreement was signed.  [[Page H2681]]    This is serious business for our country because this red ink  represents lost jobs, lost productive power, and communities in  disrepair across this country, where production units were just picked  up and put either north or south of the border.   Tonight, we want to focus on President Trump's Manufacturing Jobs  Initiative, which he announced during the campaign and afterwards. Here  were his words:         Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back,       the good jobs, the real jobs. They have to come back.    Well, after all we have lost, we certainly do need job creation in  this country.                                time  1730    We are now into the third month of Mr. Trump's Presidency and closing  in on his first 100 days in office, a period when most Presidents are  able to pass something through this Congress that really matters to the  American people. I remember when we were able to save Social Security  back during the 1980s and when a Congress was elected in response to  Ronald Reagan's excesses, and it was in the first quarter of the year  that that was done. So we are waiting. It is 100 days now, and nothing  significant has been done on the jobs and trade front.   Candidate Donald Trump's campaign for President in my region of  America was actually founded on the principle of fixing jobs and trade.  People listened. But if we look at this first 100 days, we see that he  has really taken a back seat to his billionaire donors and their  interests and a staff that seems to be more and more peopled with  individuals who spent a whole lot of time at Goldman Sachs, which is a  company that has been notorious in helping to outsource jobs.   Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump touted his trade policies,  assuring voters he would renegotiate NAFTA. Well, we have been waiting.  During a debate, he said: ``NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever  signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.''   I would say that that agreement is the foundational agreement, the  precepts on which all subsequent trade deals have been negotiated that  have placed America in a red ink position: many more imports coming  into this country, many more of our jobs being outsourced elsewhere  than our exports going out.   So I ask: Are the strong planks for a new NAFTA part of what the  Trump administration is proposing?   Well, no. A leaked draft notice last week revealed a tepid agenda on  trade that is little more than a rehash of what the President said in  his campaign rhetoric. It is not a real plan. The one action item  identified in the Trump trade agenda is the announcement of a study to  find out why the United States is losing in global trade. It actually  doesn't focus completely on NAFTA itself, and we need healing in this  hemisphere before we start looking around the world.   The reality is we know why the deficit is so bad. Bad trade deals  have led to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit just  last month of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that  would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. Instead, our  deficit with NAFTA and Mexico and Canada is 31 percent higher. It got  worse than a year ago. So I hope the President understands the real  urgency of stopping U.S. job outsourcing, especially in the  manufacturing sector. He should do more than pay lipservice. He should  really take a look at how thin his administration proposals have been  on renegotiating this agreement. He should establish real goals and  timetables for U.S. trade to drive policy that will fix these job- killing trade agreements and deliver real benefits for the American  people.   Now, we have Members who have been very active on this trade issue  since being sworn in here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield now to Congressman David Cicilline, former mayor  of Providence, Rhode Island, and a very strong leader for working men  and women across this country.    I thank Congressman Cicilline. He hit it right on the  head. We ought to be exporting goods, not importing this many more than  we export, and we ought to be creating jobs right here. I am sure he  has seen companies from his community, from his State, literally picked  up and then magically transported to some other environment, like  Mexico, in one of the maquiladoras, and maybe windshield wipers or  plastic parts or auto parts that used to be made in the United States  then are made down there. I certainly have seen it.    If we look at this chart, just for those who are  listening to us this evening, if you go back to the mid-1970s, as  Congressman Cicilline pointed out, you will see the United States was  pretty buoyant. We were actually exporting more than we were importing.   But then when China Most Favored Nation passed in 1979, 1994 NAFTA  passed, and all of a sudden what was happening is the reverse flow  started. We started importing more than we were exporting, and every  time you get a billion dollars of red ink, you lose 5,000 more jobs in  this country.   Well, my gosh, as NAFTA actually took full bore and then China  permanent normal trade relations took effect here, CAFTA, which was the  Central American Free Trade Agreement, here was the Colombian Free  Trade Agreement, here was the Korean Free Trade Agreement, every single  agreement that happened, we ended up getting more imports into our  country than exports out, and promises were not kept.   Our focus tonight is mainly on NAFTA, but if we look at Korea, they  were supposed to be taking 50,000 cars from us. We were supposed to  have more balanced trade. Well, guess what, they didn't keep up their  end of the bargain. Other markets around the world, such as Japan,  remain closed to this day to cars from other places in the world.   You say: Congresswoman, that can't be possible.   I have seen it with my own eyes. I have visited there many times.  When I first began my career, Japan had about--oh, 3 percent of the  cars on their streets were from anyplace else in the world. Today maybe  it is 4 percent, maybe it is 3.5 percent, but there are all kinds of  nontariff barriers where they keep cars out. Yet you look at our  country, they have put manufacturing plants here, they send product  over here. It simply isn't a two-way street, and Japan is the second  largest market in the world for automobiles. So the trade isn't fair.  The American people know this. They are trying to fix this. It really  requires the President's leadership to do it.    Congressman Cicilline talked about steel trade--I just want to put on  the Record--with China, and we see what a big player she is in the  market and doesn't play fair. I just want to put some numbers on the  Record. China's expansion of steel since 2000 has grown to over 2,300  million metric tons. That is a big number to imagine. But only 1,500  million metric tons are needed to actually serve the global  marketplace. So what you have got is over 800 million metric tons of  steel just floating around the world in warehouses and stored up in  provinces in China, and they are dumping the steel.   Why does that matter?   Because in places like I represent, Lorain, Ohio, U.S. Steel just  pink-slipped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more workers.  Republic Steel, which sits next door to U.S. Steel, has shuttered their  plant because of imported steel.   The President could do something about that. He could have done  something about that the second day he was in office. Nothing has been  done. All these workers, some of whom have worked in these plants for  28 years, in modernized plants where hundreds of millions of dollars of  investment have been made to upgrade the capacity of these plants,  rather than save that capacity for our country for the years ahead and  to try to deal with this Chinese dumping, they are allowing more  workers and more companies to go belly up in this country. It is wrong.  It is wrong. This needs to be fixed. This is big time for jobs and  economic growth in our country.   I want to thank Congressman Brendan F. Boyle, who understands this  problem full well. As a younger Member of Congress and one who really  speaks on behalf of working men and women in Pennsylvania and coast to  coast, I thank him so much for taking time and joining us tonight. I  yield to the gentleman.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding. I have to say that the working people of not  just Ohio but this country are very lucky to have Marcy Kaptur fighting  for them and for her years of service. There is not a more passionate  champion for working Americans in this House than the gentlewoman from  Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I come here not with a prepared text, but really to  speak from my heart. As the son of two hardworking parents who were  working in industries that were supported by organized labor, and it  depresses me to see the great decline in our workforce today that is in  a union.   Now, the subject that we are speaking about tonight is about the  trade deficit, and I just started talking about unions. To some that  might seem as if I am off topic, but there is no question the two are  absolutely related.                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, I want to correct a fallacy that sometimes is out there  about those of us who may be critical about NAFTA and other trade  deals. I am not antitrade. I recognize that the United States of  America, despite being a large country of over 320 million people, we  are only 5 percent of the world's population. We must engage in trade  with the rest of the world. I also look at those economic statistics  that tell us, without question, the most productive workforce in the  world today is the American worker.   So if the grounds of trade are fair and if the rules of the game are  fair, we can compete with anyone. Our workers can compete and  outcompete anyone in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, they have not been  fighting on a fair playing field.   Now, let's not forget that over the last 20 to 23 years or so since  NAFTA was passed, that happens to also coincide with this point in  American history in which most wages have been stagnant. Indeed, for  middle class people and lower middle class folks, their real wages have  declined, not to mention the most lower income quintile, which has seen  a dramatic drop in real wages.   I think that it would be unfair for any of us to say that this is  because of NAFTA or that this is because of any specific trade deal.  But it is also very fair for us to point out that none of these trade  deals did anything to raise the living standards and wages of American  workers. Here we are in an environment in Congress in which, recently,  we were talking about the TPP and moving forward with other trade deals  and talking about nothing really to raise wages and living standards  for our own workers here at home.   Look at the example of NAFTA, something that was promised to raise  wage standards in Mexico, that we would benefit from having on our  [[Page H2683]]  southern border a country with a rising middle class population. There  is no question that would be in the best interest of the United States  and, obviously, in the best interest of Mexico.   However, Mr. Speaker, here we are in the last few years with more  jobs going to Mexico, including the closing of the Nabisco plant in my  district that I stood on the well of the House floor and protested  against. It goes to a nice new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. Is that  helping to raise wages in Mexico? Actually, wages are lower today in  Mexico than they were 3 years ago. That is an economic fact.   Under the letter of the law of NAFTA, that is something that our  administration could take up with our Mexican counterparts, but they  don't. Instead, we see Nabisco. And I am taking one specific example  because it affected my district. We see them closing a plant that had  existed in Philadelphia since before my parents were born lay off 325  workers, lay off double that in Chicago, and move to Monterrey, Mexico,  which they can do in accordance with NAFTA.   If we are going to move forward with new trade deals, which  inevitably at some point in years moving forward we will, I would  simply ask--and strongly suggest--that we look out not just for the  corporate interest, not just for what is in the best interest of  consumers, but also what is in the best interest of American workers.   We should not be surprised that we see this tumult in the United  States politically at the same time that we are seeing stagnant wages  and stagnant benefits for decades. Those two are inextricably linked.   Mr. Speaker, finally, let me say to all those who are interested in  working on this trade issue on both sides of the aisle: You have  committed and passionate public servants on this side of the aisle who  want to get it right, who want to ensure that we finally have trade  deals that put American workers first and foremost.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Boyle. He has raised so  many important issues tonight on jobs and trade and how we fix this  problem for the people of our country and, frankly, the world.   One of the issues is which banks are actually financing this  outsourcing. I can tell you, they are not banks in the communities that  I represent. They are not big enough to put all that money, to actually  take these big companies and move them out of the United States and  plunk them down in a Third World environment. It is largely Wall Street  banks that do that. So they fly over the heads of people that live in  communities across this country.   The gentleman talked about Nabisco moving. I had an experience. I  went out to Newton, Iowa, a few years ago when Maytag was closing. I  felt so bad as an American that a gold star label company that had  manufactured reliable, high-quality products in our country was  closing. I learned what was happening. What I didn't realize was that  the production that closed in Newton, Iowa, large parts of it were  moved south of the border.   I was traveling down to Monterrey, Mexico. I was going down there,  actually, to find out what had happened to someone who was murdered,  who had been a student in our community and was murdered in Monterrey,  Mexico. We went by this big complex that said Maytag, Amana, all of  these American companies that had been outsourced to Monterrey. I said:  Stop the cab. I am taking a picture. This is exactly what I am talking  about.   I said: Let me ask a question to some of the people that were walking  by and living in the area. I said: Can the people who work in that  Maytag plant in Monterrey, can they afford to buy the washers they  make?   Guess what? No. In fact, where they lived, there was no running  water. There was no decent water to drink.   I thought: This is what we stand for as a country? What is wrong with  this picture? For our country, in districts like mine, the results of  all this lopsided trade are that citizens in northern Ohio, on average,  are earning $7,000 less than they did when this century began, because  of this. The playing field is simply not level.   Several years ago, I was visited by a group of United Automobile  Workers from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They told me--and I just love these  wonderful, generous human beings. They had all been pink-slipped. They  had just lost their jobs. They came to see me to tell me their stories  on trade and what it had done to them.    They said: Marcy, we are training those who are going to replace us  in Mexico. But we went down to Mexico, and we felt so sorry to see  where the people lived and the conditions under which they were working  that we are collecting medical items, and we are doing humanitarian  shipments to that town.   I thought: Oh, my goodness, what a generous group of Americans who  are facing such horror in their own lives and yet they were doing that  for people who live on this continent--and were, by the way, going to  be earning, like, one-twentieth of what the workers in Milwaukee  earned. So it was all about cheap labor.   I really felt bad for the cheapening of the Maytag product. I am  probably going to get in trouble for saying that, but it is the truth.  I certainly learned a lesson by traveling to Newton, Iowa.   Now, another story, this is on plastic seals. I happened to visit a  plant in the Tijuana area, and I walked through the plant in Mexico.  This company had been moved from Ohio and its equipment shipped down to  Mexico.   I walked through this plant. It was about 100 degrees that particular  day. I turned the corner. There were no fans taking out the exhaust. It  was bloody hot, and it had to be 110 degrees. These men were working.  They had T-shirts on. It was very hot that summer. They were pulling  down these large levers because they were melting plastic and rubber. I  witnessed this.   I thought: Boy, that really looks dangerous with that thing that they  are pulling down because it was moving like this. I thought: Boy, they  have got to really pay attention every time they move that steam press  down so they don't catch their arm in there.   I took pictures, and I sent them back to Ohio. I got a letter from  one of my constituents. This constituent said: Congresswoman, did you  really take a look at the picture you took?   I thought: Well, yeah, I was looking at the workers.   He said: No. No. Look at the machine, the machine, up in the right- hand corner, the button with the tape over it.   I said: Oh, yeah.   He said: I used to do that job. Do you know what that button is?   I said: No.   He said: That is the safety button.   In other words, when the equipment was shipped and the machine  started, life wasn't worth as much in Mexico, so these workers were  working with much greater risk of injury to themselves because the  equipment had been tinkered with in a way that told me a lot about  health and safety standards and how they are really not enforced in  places like Mexico.   I finally want to end with a story that relates to trade. It doesn't  just have to do with goods. It has to do with human beings, with  people, and why renegotiating trade deals is so important for what our  Constitution says we stand for: life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. This is a country that believes in liberty and justice for  all. It has to do with the undocumented workers in our country who are  coming from south of our border.   We hear all kinds of rhetoric about that, but the truth is that I  face the reality of what happened in the agricultural sector with  NAFTA. What happened is we wanted two-way trade with Mexico, but what  the trade agreement did is it caused great problems in Mexico in that  over 2 million small farmers in Mexico were displaced by the NAFTA  agreement because our country was 18 times more efficient in corn  agriculture than the Mexican people. These workers and owners of these  little ejidos, these little, tiny farms that were subsistence farms,  they were just completely obliterated--2 million or more people.   Well, guess what? When you lose your livelihood and the trade  agreement doesn't provide for readjustment, what do you think desperate  people do? They run anywhere to eat, and north of the border looks  pretty attractive.   As I heard all of these speeches during the campaign about what we  are going to do on trade and how we are going to fix everything, I have  never heard any of the major candidates talk  [[Page H2684]]  about: How are you going to fix the problem for the people in Mexico  who lost their livelihoods, their ability to produce for themselves?   The undocumented worker problem has a big, big root in Mexico. It was  an uncaring set of governments that negotiated these agreements that  caused that hemorrhage that creates an endless flow of people who are  desperate, who will do anything to survive. You wouldn't want this to  happen to your family.   I am all for yellow corn from the United States. I eat corn. I just  served it the other night to our family. But when a trade agreement  wipes out the livelihoods of millions of people, it upsets an entire  continent. So now the solution is not to figure out a way to have  readjustment in agriculture in Mexico as part of a renegotiated NAFTA  agreement; the answer is supposed to be a wall.    Do you know what? Walls don't feed people. Proper trade agreements  feed people when they are done the right way and you don't obliterate  people's lives. That is what really matters.   When I see what the White House is producing, I haven't seen anything  yet that really gets us to balanced trade accounts in a way that people  matter and the communities in which they live matter. And it isn't  always a default to what Wall Street wants and cheap labor and  substandard working conditions and substandard living conditions.   We have to do better than that. We have to aspire to a system where  people are invited into a trade union in which we have rising standards  of living, where we have balanced trade accounts again, and where  people's incomes and living standards rise. If we don't get there, we  are going to have even greater social problems on this continent.   Today, I met with El Salvadoran workers, talking about the conditions  in that country, what has happened there with the maquiladoras and the  situations that people face in their daily lives. This race to the  bottom is not working. It is not working in our country. It is not  working in the Latin American countries or in Canada. We simply have to  aspire to the highest values that founded this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro), someone who knows all about those values. Congresswoman Rosa  DeLauro is a true leader of our trade efforts to reform this really  terrible trade regimen that isn't helping anyone but the wealthiest  investors who have invested in the movement of these companies abroad.   Connecticut we think of as an eastern State close to New York, but  Connecticut has been battered in so many corners by trade.  Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro is an indefatigable Member of the House. I  don't know how the people of Connecticut found her, but keep sending  her here because she really does her job with distinction. I thank her  so much for joining us this evening.                                time  1800    Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, what a great compliment from someone who is  a tigress when it comes to making sure that the working people in her  community are represented--that their interests, their families, and  their economic security are represented--and who fights on a daily  basis to make sure that our families have the economic wherewithal with  which to succeed.   The gentlewoman from Ohio is someone who really knows that the  biggest problem that we face today in this Nation is that people are in  jobs that just don't pay them enough; and that they can't make it, that  they are struggling.   When you lay on top of that the direction that our trade agreements  have taken us, it reinforces the fact of their lack of wages and of  income inequality. And you can't have a discussion about income  inequality in this Nation today without starting with wages.   I am struck by those people who tell us that all of this wage  stagnation and income inequality is the fault of globalization and  technology. No, that is not the case. You just listen to Nobel Laureate  Joseph Stiglitz, who said that this inequality and the depression of  wages has come from public policy choices. And we have made the wrong  public policy choices, as has been evidenced by my colleague's  comments.   We support a trade policy that puts American workers before corporate  interests. And although President Trump made trade a central focus of  his campaign and he promised to fight for working men and women, the  broken promises are piling up.   I am deeply disturbed--I know my colleague is--that President Trump's  Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, has suggested that the Trans-Pacific  Partnership Agreement is a good place to start for the NAFTA  renegotiations. Working men and women deserve a new North American Free  Trade Agreement, not more of the same corporate-driven trade policies  of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership--an agreement, as I said, that,  as a candidate, President Trump opposed. He spoke all over the country  and told people that it had to go, that he was going to renegotiate  NAFTA.   This is not the only about-face that this administration has taken on  trade. If you listen to the Economic Policy Institute, China's past  cheating to manipulate the value of their money has left over 5 million  Americans without good-paying jobs. Yet, President Trump has failed to  deliver on declaring China a currency manipulator. He said he was going  to do that on day one. And he has yet to act on countering our massive  $347 billion trade deficit with China.   He missed his promised deadline to start NAFTA renegotiation in his  first 100 days. He has already reneged on his Buy American promise that  American steel would be required for the Keystone XL pipeline. They  have waived that requirement, and my colleague knows deeply what has  happened to steel workers.    Mr. Speaker, I wanted to mention that hundreds and  hundreds of steel workers in my district are getting laid off right  now, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut speaks.   We are facing complete closure of two plants. One has already been  idled, Republic Steel; and the other, the U.S. Steel plant in Lorain,  Ohio, will be by early June.   If the President really wanted to do something to make a statement,  what he would do is put an embargo on the products that are being  dumped by China and Korea on our market that are forcing this to happen  at our steel companies.   There is a glut in the steel market globally. We have about 800  million metric tons of steel that are out there.   What China has been doing is building a steel company in every  province to put people to work. Then, what do they do with the steel?  They have been storing it because there is so much that the global  market can't absorb 800 million more metric tons.   So companies like those I represent get hurt because they are trying  to play by the rules; but the rules aren't being enforced properly, so  they end up with the short end of the deal that is absolutely  backwards. So what the gentlewoman says about steel is right on.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this has been happening all along in so  many sectors. When you talk about the various agreements and NAFTA--and  actually with regard to currency--what we fought for in the Trans- Pacific Partnership Agreement was to do something about currency  manipulation because everything that may have been negotiated in the  NAFTA agreement with tariffs and lowering them and all of that, all of  that was for naught when Mexico devalued the peso. Once you do that,  then your goods are cheaper than our goods and we suffer. It is the  same thing that has happened in Korea, and this is what we were looking  at in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.   Despite the Oval Office fanfare last Friday, President Trump's recent  executive orders are, frankly, nothing but window dressing. While  initiating a new Federal report--a new Federal report, God, there must  be unbelievable cavernous institutions and places where we have Federal  reports which go nowhere--what they are about is a common way to avoid  fixing any problems that we have. The real test is going to be whether  or not the Trump administration takes action to create jobs and to  reduce the trade deficit.   Improving our trade policy requires new rules, not more of the status  quo. And it was Mr. Ross who, I believe, said  [[Page H2685]]  that: My gosh, you can't throw out the Trans-Pacific Partnership  Agreement. You have to fiddle around the edges with it.   That is where they are going. Again, they are betraying the promises  that were made to those workers in your district, those workers in my  district, and workers all across the country.    Mr. Speaker, what the gentlewoman from Connecticut is  saying is very important because certain States hung in the balance in  this past election. Ohio was one of them. Michigan, Pennsylvania,  obviously Indiana next door was constant. If you look at each one of  those States, those were the ones that actually carried for President  Trump in the end because of the jobs and trade issue.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely right. That was a  central part of the election last November.   Improving our trade policy requires new rules, as I said, not more  status quo. We have to push a trade agenda that will create good-paying  jobs and that is going to raise wages here at home. And our coalition  is going to continue to hold this administration accountable. What we  need to do is to try to reshape the trajectory of modern globalization,  one that doesn't exacerbate that economic problem that I spoke about  people being in jobs that just don't pay them enough money. The NAFTA  agreement put people at such grave risk.   I know that the gentlewoman can recall this as well: we both stood on  this House floor all those years ago and we said we were going to lose  jobs, that we were going to increase the trade deficit, and that this  was not an agreement that would benefit the working men and women of  this country.   At that time, quite frankly, we were told by the then-Clinton  administration that we were thugs, that we did not understand what was  happening, that we were protectionist, all kinds of labels against the  thinking that we said that this was not going to benefit us.    Mr. Speaker, does the gentlewoman from Connecticut  remember when Gary Hufbauer said we would have trade surpluses? In  other words, this is upside down. It should actually be like this. We  would have surpluses then. Well, it is exactly the opposite he  testified back then. I will never forget that.   The Peterson Institute said we would have jobs, we would have rising  incomes, we would have more benefits for workers. Wrong, wrong, wrong.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, we said it then.   What we didn't have at that time was the data, which is now right  here on this floor of the House, which is why we were able to defeat  the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, because they couldn't fool us  again. They could not fool us again. Not us. They couldn't fool the  American people again.   We are not going down that road, not with a reheated Trans-Pacific  Partnership Agreement or a tweaked North American Free Trade Agreement.   I said we have to reshape that trajectory of modern globalization. It  is a trajectory that needs to benefit American workers. It has to  foster inclusive growth.   This is not just about large corporations and special interests that  will be the beneficiaries of trade agreements. It is about trade  agreements that grow our economy, that grow the economic security of  the people of this country.   Implementing a new model is not going to be easy. It isn't going to  be easy; we know that. But with so much on the line, we understand that  it is our obligation to put the American people first, to set those new  rules for a 21st century economy and give it our all.   We are going to be absolutely vigilant with where the discussions and  the negotiations go on a renegotiated NAFTA agreement and future trade  agreements that we may embark on.   We are not afraid of trade. We just want it to work for the people of  this country, and we don't want to do what has happened to the folks in  Mexico and to other countries as well.   First and foremost, I will just say that we have to be cognizant of  the repercussions on the standard of living and the quality of life  that our people in the United States have. These trade agreements have  worked against that, and it is not going to happen again.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro for  her stellar leadership on the trade task force and the work that it has  done. The hours and hours of effort on defeating the Trans-Pacific  Partnership, the great assemblage that she gathered and the persistence  with which she approached that, seeking to defeat that trade model,  which has now been done, and to go back to the drawing board and to fix  what is wrong with these, Representative DeLauro has been  extraordinary.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it has been a remarkable coalition, and it  is standing strong. It stands strong.   I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for being a central and integral  part of this effort. I appreciate that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for  coming down this evening.   As we complete our work here this evening, I wanted to reissue our  invitation to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to travel to Ohio to  come to U.S. Steel in Lorain to really see what is happening there to  the workers; and not just Lorain--we are not selfish--but all over this  country where steel companies are being harmed because of imports and  the fact that China, Korea, and Russia are dumping on the international  market.   We need to have an embargo. We need to let our industry survive and  get over this hump of overcapacity.   We are going to need that production in the years ahead, for example,  in the natural gas industry for piping and so forth. These are modern  plants. America should not lose them. We have lost so many steel  plants. We can't afford to lose many more for the sake of the Nation's  defense.   I also wanted to invite the President to Ohio. I hope that somebody  is listening. He campaigned a great deal in Ohio. I know he likes  meeting people, and it certainly would be a good way to see the  immediate challenge on the trade front where real lives and livelihoods  are at stake in this country.                                time  1815    I also just wanted to end by saying this: When you create a system of  trade where people are exploited in our country, or in other countries,  that really isn't the best face that America can put forward. And  unfortunately, what happens too often in our country now, for example,  in trade with Mexico, when you have undocumented workers who come here,  many in desperation, many of them are being trafficked across the  continent. You say: Oh, Congresswoman, what do you mean trafficked? I  mean, some of them come here because they are desperate, and they end  up paying sometimes as much as $8,000 to come here and work at a very  low-wage job. They never get out of debt.   We have to take that system and move it into the sunlight out of the  doldrums, because we can't treat people like chattel. There are  millions of agricultural workers, for example, who come to this country  with no contract. They are completely indentured to whatever coyote  brings them across the border. That is not the system I want for this  country. That is not fair to those families. It is not fair to their  children. It is not fair to the places to which they come in our  country.   They always feel uncomfortable. What kind of a system, what kind of a  trade system would subject them to that? We are a different kind of  country. We aspire to higher values. We aspire to treating people and  elevating their worth, not diminishing their worth as human beings.   We have a lot to fix in these trade agreements, and I hope that  President Trump will join us. I would like to tell him about what  coyotes do. I would like to tell him how they behave, how some of them  have been involved in murder of individuals from my district who fight  for labor rights so that no one is afraid, that people feel that they  have a legal system that will defend them.   We need to get to that world. Our Constitution intends it for all of  the people of our country. We should behave no differently  internationally.  [[Page H2686]]    So in closing tonight, I agree with the President. We need good jobs.  We need real jobs. They have to come back to this country, and we have  to treat people in other countries with worth, with their worth as  human beings. We need to get back to trade balances, not trade  deficits.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
