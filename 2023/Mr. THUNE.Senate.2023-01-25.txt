 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the new Congress is a chance for a fresh  start, and we need a fresh start. We cannot afford a repeat of the past  2 years.   Despite the fact that Democrats controlled Congress by the slimmest  of margins in the last Congress, Democrats acted as if they had a  mandate for radical, far-left change.   Democrats shoved through multiple partisan spending sprees, including  the so-called American Rescue Plan Act which kicked off our current  inflation crisis. And what they got through was mild compared to what  they wanted to push through--from a Federal takeover of elections to  some of the most extreme abortion legislation in the world.  Fortunately, some of the Democrats' most radical proposals didn't  ultimately make it through Congress, but not for a lack of trying on  Democrats' part.   Despite the fact that they had nothing more than a technical  majority, Democrats did their best to eliminate a voice for the  minority party in the Senate by attacking the Senate filibuster rule.  Some contemplated packing the Supreme Court to secure judicial support  for Democrat policy priorities. And Democrats' rhetoric was often as  extreme and divisive as their policies, with the standout example being  an address the President gave a year ago this month in which he  suggested that half the country was racist.   Mr. President, we have had another election, and the American people  rejected one-party rule by electing a Republican House of  Representatives. They have created a situation in which both parties  will have to work together to get anything done.   I hope this will mark a new less partisan moment here in Congress. I  hope we can move on from the past 2 years and start afresh to work  together to address the challenges facing our country, because there is  a lot that we can do together.   Despite the partisanship of the Democrat agenda over the last 2  years, there were still moments that reminded us that there are many  areas where we can agree or are close enough to work together.   I introduced a number of bipartisan bills in the last Congress, and I  am looking forward to working with colleagues of both parties on a  number of issues in the new Congress.   One major piece of legislation we take up every few years is the farm  bill, which has a strong bipartisan history. During my time in the  Senate, I have introduced farm bill legislation with both Democratic  and Republican  [[Page S82]]  colleagues, and I think that working together, we can produce a bill  this year that will meet the needs of our Nation's farmers and ranchers  and strengthen U.S. agriculture production.   Another obvious area for bipartisan cooperation is the Federal  Aviation Administration reauthorization that is coming due this year,  and none too soon, as recent air travel fiascos have made clear. Our  last FAA reauthorization bill was a strongly bipartisan piece of  legislation, and this year's bill should be the same.   Another area where I think there is a lot of room for bipartisan  cooperation is promoting transparency and accountability in Big Tech.   President Biden recently published an op-ed in the Wall Street  Journal calling for, among other things, section 230 reform. I already  have bipartisan legislation with Senator Schatz to reform section 230  and increase transparency and due process for users around content  moderation actions taken by Big Tech platforms, and I will work to  advance that legislation in this Congress.   I also think there is a lot we can do on a bipartisan basis to  advance trade agreements to expand markets for American products and  services around the world. The Biden administration has been slow to  take action on trade, and I think there is a real interest from Members  of Congress of both parties to accelerate our trade efforts and create  new market access opportunities for American workers and producers.   I would also like to think we can agree on the need to conduct  serious oversight of government spending to ensure that taxpayer  dollars are being used efficiently and effectively. Democrats forced  through trillions of dollars in new spending during the last Congress,  and conducting oversight of how that money is being spent is nothing  less than our responsibility as Members of Congress. I am thinking in  particular of the massive funding infusion--$80 billion the Democrats  handed to the IRS. Especially given the IRS' shaky record when it comes  to handling taxpayer data, I would hope we can agree that rigorous  oversight of the IRS is required.   I also hope that my Democrat colleagues will be open to working to  extend tax relief for American businesses and American families.  Americans and small businesses are going to face serious tax hikes if  the tax relief from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act isn't extended or made  permanent. I would like to think that Members of both parties could  work together to extend this tax relief and the benefits it provides  for Americans.    Another thing that I am hoping will happen in this Congress is a  return to regular order when it comes to appropriations bills and other  legislation. Omnibus appropriations bills are not an ideal way to fund  the government, to put it mildly. They are an invitation for waste and  all the other problems that come with hastily thrown together  legislation, and we need to do everything we can to make sure  individual appropriations bills go through the committee process and  are individually debated on the floor.   I am very encouraged that the incoming Democrat chair of the Senate  Appropriations Committee has joined Senator Collins, who will be the  top-ranking Republican on the committee, to announce her desire to pass  appropriations bills through regular order. I really hope that that  will be a bipartisan priority this year.   For similar reasons, we need to put a greater emphasis on making sure  nonappropriations bills--especially the biggest bills that we  consider--go through regular order in committee, where they could be  publicly debated and amended and receive input from all committee  members.   I hope that we can move forward a more collaborative and transparent  process, which is the kind of process that best serves the American  people.   Getting anything done in divided government requires a genuine  attitude of compromise, with both sides conceding things, rather than  the ``my way or the highway'' approach that we have seen from Democrats  over the past 2 years. But if we can get there, then I think we can  achieve a lot together in this new Congress.   I am eager to work with my colleagues from both parties to address  the challenges facing our country. And for the good of the American  people, I hope we will build a record of bipartisan accomplishment over  the next 2 years.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
