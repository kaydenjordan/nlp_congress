 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1353) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to issue  rules for the provision of emergency connectivity service, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1353         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advanced, Local Emergency       Response Telecommunications Parity Act'' or the ``ALERT       Parity Act''.       SEC. 2. EMERGENCY CONNECTIVITY SERVICE.         (a) Rulemaking Required.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue rules       for the provision of emergency connectivity service under       which--        (A) a person may submit to the Commission an application       for approval to provide such service to an area--        (i) that is an unserved area with respect to either or both       services described in subsection (i)(5)(B); or        (ii) in the event that such area becomes an unserved area       with respect to either or both such services due to       destruction of infrastructure, a power outage, or any other       reason; and        (B) for any period during which such approval is in effect       and such area is an unserved area, such person will receive       access to electromagnetic spectrum in accordance with       subsection (d) to provide emergency connectivity service to       such area.        (2) Provider not licensee.--The Commission shall include in       the rules issued under paragraph (1) language to ensure that       approval of an application to provide emergency connectivity       service under such rules does not render the provider of such       service a licensee (as such term is defined in section 3 of       the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153)).        (3) Deadline to initiate rulemaking.--The Commission shall       initiate a rulemaking to issue the rules required by       paragraph (1) not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (b) Demonstrations.--In the rules issued under subsection       (a), the Commission shall require a person who submits an       application to provide emergency connectivity service under       such rules, in order for such application to be approved, to       demonstrate to the Commission the following:        (1) Such person has a technical proposal describing how       such person plans to provide such service and how the       proposal complies with technical requirements included in       such rules under subsection (d)(2).        (2) Such person will not use any electromagnetic spectrum       to which access is made available under such rules to provide       any service other than emergency connectivity service, unless       the other service is provided under a separate authorization       to use such spectrum held by such person.        (3) Such service proposed can withstand the impact of major       natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,       wildfires, floods, blizzards, and tornados.        (4) Such person has the capability to begin providing such       service in a rapid manner--        (A) in the case of an application to provide such service       to an area that is an unserved area at the time at which the       application is submitted, after the approval of the       application; or        (B) in the case of an application to provide such service       to an area in the event that such area becomes an unserved       area due to destruction of infrastructure, a power outage, or       any other reason, after such area becomes an unserved area.        (c) Publication of List of Providers.--The Commission shall       publish on the internet website of the Commission a list of       all providers of emergency connectivity service for which an       approval is in effect to provide such service under the rules       issued under subsection (a).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1353, the ALERT Parity Act,  led by the gentleman from Ohio's Sixth District and the gentlewoman of  Washington's Eighth District.   When hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural disasters strike,  connectivity and access to emergency communications is often one of the  many critical services that are temporarily knocked out. Access to 911  services and important updates from local authorities sent by text  message may be unavailable in dire moments.   While network operators do great work in preparing for, responding  to, and improving future preparations for these natural disasters, they  are unavoidable. Even the best response may leave Americans trapped  without access to emergency services in the aftermath of the event.   However, recent innovations in satellite communications technologies  have opened new opportunities to leverage our communications systems to  provide emergency communications in times of natural disaster from  satellites. Many of these services are designed to be available on  Americans' phones seamlessly with no action needed by Americans.   Recent innovative partnership between terrestrial network operators  and satellite operators have highlighted the type of possibilities  Americans may someday take for granted. Yet, these innovations and  partnerships have also demonstrated that novel use of our airwaves,  while potentially lifesaving, also need regulatory certainty so that  they are reliably available and do not result in harmful interference.   The ALERT Parity Act would establish a process for the FCC to ensure  that satellite technology can be used to ensure access to wireless  emergency alerts and 911 service remain uninterrupted during times of  an emergency in areas that do not have connectivity.   This legislation will be key to ensuring that emergency connectivity  services are not authorized using temporary authorities and adequately  protect all of the wireless services Americans rely on.   This legislation will also pave the way for U.S. leadership as other  countries look to take advantage of the innovation pioneered here in  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1353, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support of H.R. 1353, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1343) to codify the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences and  to direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and  Information to establish an initiative to support the development of  emergency communication and tracking technologies, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1343         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Institute for       Telecommunication Sciences Codification Act'' or the ``ITS       Codification Act''.       SEC. 2. INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION SCIENCES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The test center within the National Telecommunications       and Information Administration (in this subsection referred       to as the ``NTIA'') represents executive branch agencies on       spectrum issues before the Federal Communications Commission.        (2) Understanding radio frequency propagation       characteristics and modeling is a critical component of       making spectrum decisions.        (3) Federal agencies rely on expert engineering studies,       simulations, and analyses to make determinations about how to       make spectrum available for commercial use, including through       system relocations and identifying spectrum sharing       opportunities through the NTIA.        (4) Clearing of Federal spectrum, when feasible, is the       priority action to take to make Federal spectrum available       for commercial uses as required by section 113(j)(1) of the       National Telecommunications and Information Administration       Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(j)(1)).        (5) Sharing of Federal spectrum between Federal entities       and commercial entities provides access to Federal spectrum       for commercial uses in circumstances where clearing is not       feasible.        (6) The test center within the NTIA is the Government's       premier expert laboratory for spectrum research activities,       spectrum sharing innovation and testing, spectrum       interference studies, and all activities related to advancing       next generation wireless technologies.        (7) The test center within the NTIA is critical for       undertaking engineering studies and analyses that inform       clearing or sharing opportunities and facilitate policy       decisions to maximize the efficient use of spectrum       resources.        (b) Operation of Test Center.--Part A of the National       Telecommunications and Information Administration       Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended by adding       at the end the following:       ``SEC. 106.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  [[Page H1925]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1343, the ITS Codification  Act, led by the gentleman from Georgia's First District and the  gentlewoman from Colorado's Seventh District.   The effective and efficient management of our airwaves plays an  important role in fueling our economy, which increasingly relies on  communication between digital technologies.   As demand for wireless technology continues to grow, we must continue  to focus on identifying potential opportunities to make more spectrum  available for commercial use, including reallocating and sharing  spectrum from Federal users.   Complex, technical engineering testing and analysis underpins these  important decisions on how best to maximize our airwaves for commercial  use while preserving our Federal missions.                                time  1615    Indeed, having a sound technical basis supporting these decisions  will help restore trust in the process among Federal agencies.   The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, or ITS, within NTIA  plays an essential role in conducting the tests that guide these  spectrum reallocation or sharing decisions. ITS will also help ensure  that NTIA, as the Federal spectrum manager, can continue to find  opportunities to unleash commercial wireless innovation while also  ensuring military readiness, securing our southern border, and  advancing scientific discovery and other successful Federal missions.   The work ITS performs has led to innovative advancements in the way  we manage our airwaves. These airwaves power faster mobile connectivity  for Americans, and making more spectrum available in the future is  critical to beating China and ensuring our continued economic and  national security.   The ITS Codification Act will strengthen the statutory authority for  ITS and ensure the work they do to advance United States technological  leadership remains a key part of our approach.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is the bill's sponsor and the vice chairman  of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support of H.R. 1343 and passage  by the House, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1339) to require the Federal Communications Commission to review  certain rules of the Commission and develop recommendations for rule  changes to promote precision agriculture, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1339         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Precision Agriculture       Satellite Connectivity Act''.       SEC. 2. PRECISION AGRICULTURE SATELLITE CONNECTIVITY.         (a) Review.--The Commission, in consultation with the Task       Force, shall--        (1) review the rules of the Commission relating to fixed       satellite service, mobile satellite service, and earth       exploration satellite service to determine if there are rule       changes that the Commission could implement under existing       authority to promote precision agriculture; and  [[Page H1926]]         (2) if the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that       there are rule changes that the Commission could implement,       develop recommendations for how to implement the changes.        (b) Report.--Not later than 15 months after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a report on the results of the       review conducted under subsection (a), including any       recommendations developed under paragraph (2) of such       subsection.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Communications Commission.        (2) Task force.--The term ``Task Force'' means the Task       Force for Reviewing the Connectivity and Technology Needs of       Precision Agriculture in the United States established under       section 12511 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018       (Public Law 115-334).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill, including an  exchange of letters with the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 1339, the  Precision Agriculture Satellite Connectivity Act, that I was pleased to  introduce with the gentlewoman from Illinois' Second District.   For years, large parts of my district and rural areas across America  have lacked access to fast broadband connections. Reliable internet  access is more than just being able to stream your favorite TV shows  and movies, Mr. Speaker. It is the crucial link connecting us all.  Whether it is helping seniors access telehealth services or allowing  students to complete homework assignments or enabling small businesses  to reach global markets, our people, country, and economy run on a  reliable internet connection.   Farmers in rural Ohio also know that reliable broadband connections  are essential to their operations. After all, it helps deploy  technologies that increase their productivity, produce higher yields,  and minimize operating costs.   Today's smart agriculture technology, from autonomous tractors to  distributed soil sensors, rely on internet connections to share data.  In fact, farmers use information in real time to make smarter decisions  on how to optimize inputs and whether and when to plant or harvest.  When terrestrial or cellular networks are not available, satellite  broadband steps in to make these technologies work.   However, it is not just advanced satellite broadband capabilities  that improve precision agriculture. Earth imaging satellites also  provide important information that can help farmers and ranchers  identify visual trends that may require immediate attention. As we  heard in hearings before the Energy and Commerce Committee, satellite  communications technologies can offer an array of services that may  promote precision agriculture.   In order to ensure our regulations maximize these opportunities, our  legislation directs the FCC to evaluate its rules and identify  potential changes that could further promote precision agriculture.   I am committed to ensuring our farmers have the tools needed at their  disposal to help increase productivity while minimizing costs. This  legislation is a good step forward in that mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                    Washington, DC, April 24, 2023.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Chair: I am writing concerning H.R. 1339, the       ``Precision Agriculture Satellite Connectivity Act'', which       your committee reported on April 24, 2023.        H.R. 1339 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule Xjurisdiction. As a       result of your having consulted with the Committee and in       order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego       action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our       mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or       alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and would request that you include a copy       of this letter and your response in in the Congressional       Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you       in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                    Frank D. Lucas,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, April 25, 2023.      Hon. Frank D. Lucas,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Lucas: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 1339, the ``Precision Agricultun Connectivity Act,''       which was referred solely to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce.        I understand that the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology (Committee on Science) has requested a sequential       referral on the bill based on its jurisdiction over       ``[a]stronautical research and development, including       resources, personnel, equipment, and facilities,''       ``[e]nvironmental research and development,'' ``National       Aeronautic sand Space Administration,'' and ``[o]uter Space,       including exploration and control thereof.''        While I am not prepared to concede that point, I recognize       the request for a sequential referral is not frivolous. I       therefore thank the Committee on Science for not insist       sequential referral request so that H.R. 1339 can be promptly       scheduled for Floor consid the Majority Leader.        As a fellow committee chair, I understand it is your duty       to protect the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, and       I agree that foregoing action on this bill will in no way       diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the       appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in this bill or       similar legislation.        I will place a copy of your letter and this response into       the Congressional Record during the Floor consideration of       this bill.            Sincerely,                                            Cathy McMorris Rodgers,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I also urge the passage of H.R. 1339, the  Precision Agriculture Satellite Connectivity Act, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
