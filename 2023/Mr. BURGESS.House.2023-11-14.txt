Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the Congresswoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 864, providing for consideration of  H.R. 5894. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5894 under a  structured rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations or their designee.   The rule further makes in order 146 amendments. The rule also  provides that the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee, or their respective designees, may offer up to 10 pro forma  amendments each at any point for the purpose of debate. Finally, the  rule additionally provides for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill,  H.R. 5894, the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2024.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is committed to fulfilling their  promises to the American people by ensuring that we pass H.R. 5894 to  fund our government and its crucial public health, education, and labor  programs.   This bill is a significant accomplishment and the most recent step  House Republicans are taking to restore fiscal responsibility to the  Federal budget after years of overspending. It is a fact that our  Federal spending is out of control, and H.R. 5894 is a step in the  right direction, encouraging responsibility and restoring  accountability.   H.R. 5894 provides $147 billion for vital programs at the Departments  of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education while still reducing  total Federal spending by over $60 billion.   The bill eliminates 61 programs, 50 of which are currently not  authorized. It reduces funding for an additional 54 other programs and  prohibits funds from unnecessary regulations and partisan executive  orders.   This Congress should aim to prioritize funding programs that can have  positive outcomes and deliver results for the American people. Inflated  spending for duplicative programs is a sure way to fuel the economic  situation in which we now find ourselves.   H.R. 5894 funds key priorities, including maintaining funding for  essential education, public health, substance abuse and mental health,  and veterans job training programs.   Republicans have fought to ensure that funding is prioritized to help  all school districts safely educate children, including children with  special needs. H.R. 5894 also contains provisions to support funding  for charter schools, Pell grants, and local career and technical  training programs for those students who are not seeking a college  degree to ensure that our next generation is given opportunity and  access to essential education programs.   Especially important to many districts around the country, including  mine, this bill maintains vital funding for the Impact Aid Program,  which supports school districts affected by a Federal presence such as  a military base.   H.R. 5894 promotes American values of freedom, faith, and family by  prohibiting the executive order requiring biological boys to be allowed  to compete in girls' and women's sports, protecting religious freedom  for students on college campuses, and strengthening parental rights for  children in school.   Republicans understand that our country is facing a mental health  crisis, along with record-breaking rates of substance abuse in the  United States; therefore, this bill has designated funding for programs  that combat opioid abuse in urban and rural communities. These crucial  programs allow Americans to access the proper care that they need,  including vital telehealth and response resources.  [[Page H5736]]    Democrats seem to disregard the value of the taxpayer dollar. They  have continuously proven that they prioritize additional spending,  progressive initiatives, and push through woke policies that will have  negative consequences on the health and well-being of the American  people.   When they were in the majority, congressional Democrats took drastic  steps to push through legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act,  saying that it would lower healthcare costs for America's seniors. In  fact, we have already seen that this legislation has resulted in a halt  to innovation and disincentivized investment into high-stakes research,  such as rare diseases.   This bill, H.R. 5894, contains provisions that fund and support  biomedical research programs that work to examine the cures for cancer,  Alzheimer's disease, chronic conditions, and rare diseases. Under  Republican leadership, the United States will continue to remain a  leader in healthcare innovation, while peeling back the partisan  politics that would limit access to lifesaving medicines.   The bill also maintains longstanding provisions of the Hyde  amendment, bipartisan protections which have been in place since 1976.  These pro-life policy protections prohibit Federal funds from being  used for abortion while also including essential protections for  healthcare providers who refuse to provide abortions.   Under the leadership of Democrats, the right for America's medical  professionals to operate under their own autonomy and authority was  under constant attack. Future medical professionals are being forced to  practice medicine outside their own standards or to not practice at  all. Protections placed in this bill ensure that any medical  professional who does not wish to perform procedures that are against  their religious or moral standards simply do not have to. The  Republican Party continues to fight to maintain the balance between the  professional practice of medicine and individual values.    Additionally, H.R. 5894 prohibits funding from being used to promote  gain-of-function research or from any funding going to EcoHealth  Alliance, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or any other lab located in  the People's Republic of China, Cuba, Iran, or Russia.   Americans deserve transparency for the years lost due to the COVID-19  pandemic. The ability to perform biomedical research is a privilege and  should not be abused. It is our responsibility to ensure that American  dollars do not go toward dangerous research in adversarial countries.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is facing a significant healthcare  workforce shortage. The government continues to have a role in deciding  what is best for American doctors and their patients. This is, in fact,  unacceptable. The combination of low reimbursement rates in the  physician fee schedule, the burdensome compliance requirements through  the No Surprises Act, and the enforcement of unnecessary vaccine  mandates on healthcare workers has only fueled this ongoing shortage.   This bill prohibits the enforcement of regulations by the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services to force a vaccine mandate on healthcare  workers. Healthcare providers should not be forced to comply with these  mandates that infringe upon their individual freedom of choice.   We must come together and pass this bill and continue our commitment  to the health and well-being of our people. The United States is facing  record-breaking inflation, government spending is at an all-time high,  and our communities continue to face barriers to education, healthcare,  and recent partisan policies that stifle healthcare innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I am  sorry, last year when the Democrats were in charge of the United States  House of Representatives, I do not recall the Labor-HHS bill being on  the floor as an individual bill. In fact, it was not. Everything was  grouped together in a large omnibus bill literally a year ago, last  December.   Here is the problem: We all recognize, both Republicans and  Democrats, additional spending was necessary during the pandemic to  protect Americans and get us through this unprecedented crisis.  However, last year, when everyone acknowledged that the effects of the  coronavirus were on the wane, discretionary spending increased by 15  percent.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents do not understand that. They do not  understand why that was necessary. The people struggling to buy gas and  groceries for sure don't understand why that was done to light the  fires of inflation.   I encourage Members on my side of the aisle to remember, if you do  not want a December omnibus, then vote for this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. If anyone is just  tuning in, the bill we have before us today is a bill to fund the  Federal agencies of Department of Health and Human Services, Department  of Labor, and Department of Education. It is not to provide public  funding to Planned Parenthood. That funding should come from someplace  else, but not the pockets of the American taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Again, I remind colleagues on my side of the aisle that if they do  not want a December omnibus, a giant Christmas tree with all sorts of  things hung upon it like they saw last year, then they should  understand that we need to pass individual appropriations bills.   Colleagues on my side of the aisle should carefully look at this bill  and vote in favor of passing the rule and the underlying bill.   There are over 60 programs that are currently being funded that are  not authorized. Well, that is on us as authorizers in the authorizing  committees, to be sure. However, at the same time, we cannot continue  to write checks, to send money to programs that no one has bothered to  authorize. If these are important programs that need to continue, then  we on the authorizing committees should do the work, dig into the  details of the program, bring in the witnesses, take the testimony, and  do the appropriate authorization. The fact that that has not happened  in so many programs for so long indicates how broken the process is.                                time  0945    We need to reverse that, reverse that curse, reverse that inexorable  spending that results if you just simply fund the government at a 15  percent greater level than you did last year before going back to  basics and seeing if the program was even necessary.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has many conservative policies that  deliver results to the American people. H.R. 5894, the underlying  appropriations bill, works to reverse the harmful effects of  controversial executive orders and the woke politics that have really  damaged our country.   Republicans seek to protect life, promote American values in the  classroom, prioritize safe medical research, and combat the opioid  epidemic, all while reining in unnecessary spending and promoting  oversight and accountability. That is why I support the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule. I support the  underlying bill and urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 864 Offered By Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment specified in section 7 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representatives DeLauro of       Connecticut or a designee. That amendment shall be debatable       for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the       proponent and an opponent.        Sec. 7. The amendment referred to in section 6 is as       follows:        ``Strike section 239.''.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
