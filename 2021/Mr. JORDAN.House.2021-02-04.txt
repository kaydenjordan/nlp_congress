 Mr. Speaker, who is next? Who is next?   Everyone has said things they wish they didn't say. Everyone has done  things they wish they didn't do.   So who is next? Who will the cancel culture attack next?   Former New York Times editor Bari Weiss--not a conservative--had to  resign because of the environment at that paper. She had to resign--she  coined this term--the ``digital thunderdome.''   You engage in wrong-think? You engage in wrong-speak? You are going  in the thunderdome.   Today, it is Mrs. Greene. Who is it going to be tomorrow?   I have heard several times on the floor today from the Democrats,  ``conspiracy theory.'' The Democrats peddled the biggest conspiracy  theory of all time, the Russia hoax.   For the last 4 years, they peddled this theory. Two of those years,  they spent $40 million, 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 500 witnesses, 2,500  subpoenas, but came up with zero collusion.   The former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, he was  going on television all the time, talking about the coordination and  the collusion that was going on. But what did he say behind closed  doors when he was under oath in the Intelligence Committee? He said  this: I never saw any evidence that the Trump campaign was conspiring  with the Russians to meddle with the election.   No evidence, but they peddled this theory for 4 years.   And think about this: The guy who started the debate off today for  the Democrats, the Democrat chair of the Committee on Rules, 4 years  ago, guess who was the first person to object to the 2016 Presidential  election? The guy who kicked off the debate for the Democrats today  going after Mrs. Greene, the gentleman from Massachusetts. Guess what  his reason was: the Russian hoax conspiracy theory.   And guess which State he objected to. Alabama.                                time  1700    That is right, January 6, 2017, the guy who kicked off the debate  from the Democrats objected to Alabama, a State that President Trump  won by 30 points. The first person to kick off the debate today 4 years  ago objected to Alabama based on this Russian hoax conspiracy theory.  And now, they are coming after Mrs. Greene.   I stood right here 3 weeks ago, and I said this cancel culture will  not just come after Republicans; it is going to come after us all. It  is going to come after us all. This is what is scary. And it took all  of 13 days--all of 13 days--for that to be proven true.   Last week, Senator Dianne Feinstein Elementary School is no longer  named after Senator Feinstein. That is how bad this is.   I hope this stops, and I hope it stops soon.
