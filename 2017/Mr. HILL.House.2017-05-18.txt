 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  one of our Nation's greatest leaders and, for me, in my young career, a  mentor and good friend, William Coleman, Jr., who passed away earlier  this year at the age of 96.   Throughout his long career, Bill helped shape the future of our  country in a past full of racial tension.   In 1948, Bill became the first African American to serve as a law  clerk on the United States Supreme Court, and helped draft the legal  brief for the landmark 1954 case, Brown v. Board of Education.   Bill later became our Nation's second African-American Cabinet  official, serving as Transportation Secretary for Gerald Ford.   I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his family, his loved  ones, his former law partners, and his staff.                            ____________________
