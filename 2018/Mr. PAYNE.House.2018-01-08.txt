 Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congressman Evans for hosting  tonight's Special Order hour on Dr. King's life and legacy. The  gentleman from Philadelphia has come to this body and has made an  impact in his first year on the floor of Congress. We are delighted to  have had him join the CBC.   Mr. Speaker, as I sat here and listened to my colleagues, the  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Cedric Richmond, not the  eldest member of the caucus, but a young man who has demonstrated the  leadership to be the head of this august body; and to hear my  colleague--and I use the term in reverence--John Lewis, I am fortunate  to be able to serve the 10th Congressional District of the State of New  Jersey at this time. Because, you see, I was sitting here as I listened  to Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, John Lewis, Terri Sewell, and Mr.  Evans, that to whom much is given, much is expected.   I hear the story of the ``Boy From Troy.'' I hear the story of my  chairman, Cedric Richmond. But I have been fortunate in my life  because, you see, I had a father who felt that the most important thing  to do was to serve this country and this world. He instilled that in  me. A lot of his teachings come from Dr. Martin Luther King.   Fifty years after his death, Dr. King's legacy has been shrouded in  myth by people who prefer being comfortable to being real. Mr. Speaker,  at this time, as young people back in my district say, I am going to  keep it real. His personal truths have been twisted into lies by people  who want to appear woke but whose eyes are blind to the harsh reality  of injustice.   This year, in 2018, we must reclaim Dr. King's legacy for those who  are apt to quote ``I Have a Dream'' as they seek to silence people of  color for fighting to preserve that dream.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. King understood that nonviolence does not mean  nonconfrontational. He knew that social change requires sacrifice. He  knew that doing what is right does not mean doing what is always easy.   When Black Lives Matter protesters peacefully rally in the streets to  protest police brutality against young men of color, conservatives and  White moderates shout that Black Lives Matter incites violence and  should be peaceful like Dr. King.   What they are really saying is: Sit down, boy, and know your place.   That is the same thing they said 55 years ago, when Dr. King led  peaceful protests against racial injustice in Birmingham, Alabama.  Conservatives shouted that Dr. King was causing hatred and violence.  They told him to sit down and to know his place, but he persisted. Dr.  King was not in Birmingham to make everyone comfortable. He was there  to upset the status quo and to change our democracy.   Then, 4 years later, Dr. King proclaimed that the Vietnam war was  morally unjust. He pointed out that profit had become more important to  the government than people who were sacrificing their lives overseas.  Conservatives, once again, attacked Dr. King. They said he was being  slanderous and that he was tragically misleading people.   Now, Mr. Speaker, you see the great outcry and support that we have  for our soldiers and our military people now in this country. We honor  and revere them now. That came out of the struggle of the Vietnam war,  where they were spat on and told that they weren't worth anything. That  is where it came from, Dr. King bringing up the unjust war that this  was. So out of Dr. King's protests against the Vietnam war, we began a  great reverence for our soldiers once again.   That is what we see now in the streets when we see a Vietnam vet and  we tell them: Thank you for your service.   Or whether they were in Afghanistan: Thank you for your service.                                time  2015    It was Dr. King who first raised that issue. They told him to be  quiet and to know his place. But like Dr. King told one of his friends  at the time, he might have been politically unwise, but he was being  morally wise, and that is what mattered. This year, in 2018, we must be  morally wise.   Dr. King's life and legacy show us that doing right is rarely the  same thing as doing what is easy. We, too, must persist.   As we head into a consequential year when Americans will go to the  polls, let us not lose sight of the fact that to protect and preserve  Dr. King's legacy demands that we protect and preserve our democracy  from voter suppression, cybersecurity weakness, and foreign meddling.   We must expand voting rights for all Americans.   We must modernize our voting systems.   We must appoint an independent commission to investigate foreign  meddling into the electoral system before the 2018 Federal election.   We must break down barriers to voting, not build them.   We must make registering to vote easier, not harder.   We must ensure elections are competitive, not guaranteed.   We must restore the right to vote, for felons who have served their  prison sentences.   We must end partisan gerrymandering.   We must protect the sanctity of our elections.   We must restore the Voting Rights Act. Dr. King knew that it was  important.   As I go to my seat, I just want to thank my colleagues for their  endurance. As ``Amazing Grace'' says: ``I once was lost, but now am  found.'' Serving with these great people in the United States Congress  has saved a wretch like me.
