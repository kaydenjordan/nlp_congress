 Madam Speaker, I rise with great sorrow to oppose this  second attempt at a baseless impeachment from my Democrat colleagues.   This week's attack on the U.S. Capitol was completely unacceptable,  and the people involved should be met with swift accountability.   The President didn't incite a riot. The President didn't lead an  insurrection. There are no high crimes and misdemeanors requisite of an  impeachment.   I am not saying the President didn't exercise poor judgment, but to  criminalize political speech by blaming lawless acts on the President's  rhetoric is wrong, Madam Speaker, and a very dangerous precedent.   The criminals who stormed the Capitol that day acted on their own  volition. They are responsible for their actions.   This is an important moment, Madam Speaker, for our Nation. We have  the opportunity to come together and do what is right for our country.  The votes are certified; President Trump has conceded. Let's focus on  the future and get back to the people's business.
