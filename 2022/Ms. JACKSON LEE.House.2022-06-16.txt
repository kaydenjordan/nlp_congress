 Mr. Speaker, civilians and soldiers are dying in  Ukraine and the American people are feeling it in their pocket, even as  they rise up to support democracy. The American people know there is a  problem.   As we stand on the floor today, the good news is that Democrats care.  That is why we rise today to offer the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act  because the American people see it. They see it at the gas station on  their way home or to work, they see it at the grocery store when their  carts are half empty, and they see it with their hard-earned paychecks  that don't meet what they need. Inflation--they know about it.   You know what, they are looking for a fighting team like the  Democrats to make something happen, not a whining, complaining, get- nothing-done. In my community, the interest rates are 8.5 percent of  the cost of goods in Houston, Texas. I am not going home and telling  them that we are out here working. I ask for our colleagues to  recognize the importance of lowering costs at the grocery store,  ensuring robust competition, and helping farmers. Let us fight to pass  this bill. We care.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7606, the Lower Food and Fuel  Costs Act, that would shore up the food and agriculture supply chain,  assure fair competition in the meat and poultry sectors, and lower food  and gasoline costs to the American consumer.   The American people know that there is a problem.   They see it.   They see it at the gas station on their way home from work.   They see it when they leave the grocery store with a half empty cart.   They see it when their hard-earned paychecks stretch less and less.   Inflation rose by 8.6 percent in May, a 40-year high.   The price of all goods in the Houston metro area have jumped by 8.5  percent since April 2021--the highest year-over-year jump since 1981.   My constituents aren't suddenly making 8.5 percent more than they did  a year ago, mind you.   No, they are now going without.   The cost of the most basic commodities--electricity, oil, meats, and  dairy--have gone up at alarming rates, and our people are  disproportionately bearing the burden of inflation.   An income that previously fed and housed a family, provided life- supporting medication, and got people to work and back is now capable  of paying only half of those bills.   Our constituents are forced to choose between picking up a  prescription or paying for childcare, between keeping the lights on and  keeping the pantry full.   These are not choices American families should have to make.   Congress must act to rebalance the financial scales in this country.   This package includes the following bills:   H.R. 7606--``Meat and Poultry Special Investigators Act'' which  Establishes an Office of the Special Investigator for Competition  Matters in the Agriculture Secretary's Office.   H.R. 7764--``To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to provide  additional payments under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  for implementation of nutrient management practices'' which would  provide additional assistance to specialty and row crop producers who  undertake USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service practice  standards to use fertilizers more efficiently, do soil testing, or seek  out other sources of plant nutrients.   H.R. 2518--``PRECISE Act--Producing Responsible Energy and  Conservation Incentives and Solutions for the Environment'' which  explicitly states precision agriculture eligibility in Environmental  Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program,  allows a producer who receives payments under EQIP to also receive a  conservation loan guarantee, and allows up to a 90 percent cost share  for precision agriculture under EQIP.   H.R. 1542--``Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Investment and Market  Expansion Act of 2021'' which would deploy additional storage and  dispensing equipment to ensure that higher ethanol blends and other  biofuels are more readily available across the country.   H.R. 4410--``Year-Round Fuel Choice Act of 2021'' which would build  on a recent Biden Administration action allowing voluntary year-  [[Page H5625]]  round sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, know as E-15 or  Unleaded 88.   H.R. 7675--``Strengthening the Agriculture and Food Supply Chain  Act'' which would create an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain  Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force at USDA, headed by a Special  Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response.   H.R. 4140--``Butcher Block Act'' which would provide assistance to  create new and expand current local and regional livestock and meat  processing capacity with direct or guaranteed loans.   From the soil in which our farmers plant their seeds, to the fuel  that transports vegetables to our grocers, to the very meat on our  tables, this package will enact positive legislation that the American  people will be able to see.   The spike in food and energy prices are at the center of inflation.   Beginning at the root, as producers across the country face  skyrocketing fertilizer prices, we must help producers reduce their  input costs so planting decisions are not impacted.   Expanding access to precision agriculture technology is critical now,  as we face climate change and fertilizer costs that have doubled or  almost tripled.   Breakdowns and bottlenecks in the food and agriculture supply chain,  resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have been well documented and  have caused significant losses and concerns to our agricultural  constituents.   Over the last few decades, there has been an influx of domination in  the meat packing industry by four large companies resulting in raised  prices and reduced options for products.   COVID-19 highlighted the country's dangerous reliance on large beef  plants run by the four biggest processors.   The pandemic caused slaughterhouses nationwide to close to contain  outbreaks of the virus among workers.   Ranchers were and still are frustrated that cattle prices drop when  major plants close, while meat companies still benefit from rising meat  prices.   Farmers' share of profits have gone down, while American consumers  continue to pay more, with meat prices being the single largest  contributor to the rising cost of food people consume at home.   A fair and competitive market is fundamental to a well-functioning  U.S. economy.   When firms have to compete for customers, it leads to lower prices,  higher quality goods and services, greater variety, and more  innovation.   Strengthening enforcement of the Packer and Stockyards Act will lead  to greater competition in the meat and poultry processing, fairer  access to markets for producers, and more price stability for  consumers.   Increased processing capacity will alleviate some supply chain  bottlenecks and provide producers with more options to market their  cattle and receive a fair price.   The supply chain will be more resilient and competitive long term as  a result.   With regard to our energy and fuel crisis, further use of biofuels  will reduce prices at the pump for all Americans and increase the  supply of fuel available.   Biofuels adoption and investment helps reduce our reliance on foreign  oil and the supply shocks facing our gasoline supply while also  bolstering a revenue stream for farmers across the country.   E-10 gasoline, gasoline containing 10 percent ethanol, is currently  sold year-round, while the sale of E-15 gasoline, gasoline containing  15 percent ethanol, is dependent on receiving special waivers despite  both having very similar emission profiles when it comes to smog  formation.   Year-round sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol (E-15) will  reduce the price at the pump for American drivers by giving consumers  the choice to purchase a fuel that is substantially cheaper than  standard gasoline.   The American people need legislative intervention in a market that is  increasingly becoming more concentrated and suffering from supply chain  disruptions.   This package provides small concrete actions that will invoke change  and provide both short-term immediate and long-term continuous relief.   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7606, the Lower Food and  Fuel Cost Act.    Madam Speaker, this morning I introduced the 2022  Observance of Juneteenth Independence  [[Page H5639]]  Day Resolution. I thank my cosponsors and those who recognize this  important Federal holiday.   H. Res. 1182 is to celebrate Juneteenth, but I was pleased to be the  first Member of Congress, after years of introducing resolutions, to  introduce the actual language of the Federal holiday signed by  President Biden on June 17, 2021.   What is Juneteenth? It is a recognition of one of America's original  sins, the slaves that were held over 200 years, and the brutality that  they experienced but the freedom they experienced on June 19, 1865.   We can come together as a Nation to celebrate freedom in many, many  ways. I am delighted that over the weekend in Houston and Galveston, we  will be lifting up our voices of celebration, but we know that there  are next steps.   As I have been introducing the resolution on Juneteenth, I also  commend my colleagues to move forward on H.R. 40, the Commission to  Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act.  Again, what are reparations? It is healing, it is restoration, it is  repair. We look forward to responding to the indicia in African- American communities that should be fixed. Happy Juneteenth, America.  Let's celebrate together.                            ____________________
