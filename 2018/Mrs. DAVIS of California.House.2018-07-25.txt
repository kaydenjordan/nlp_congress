 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that our  colleagues in the Senate have joined the House in passing career and  technical education legislation. I want to thank Chairwoman Foxx and  Ranking Member Scott, along with our authors of the bill, for your  leadership in moving the House version of this bill through committee.   Also, today, we gathered experts from across the country to  participate in the committee's first Workforce Innovation Forum. We  just had an opportunity to hear from these innovators from cities  around the country about the importance of investments and workforce  development programs, and they shared how Federal investments can spur  private investments in students, raise public awareness--very, very  critical--of these programs, and connect workers to jobs in  their communities.    CTE provides a crucial link between the K-12 system and the  workforce, and allows promising students to prepare for fields where  high-paying jobs are available.   Mr. Speaker, every day, families across America gather around the  kitchen table to discuss college and career options, and we need to  make sure that high-need job development programs are a bigger part of  that conversation. Students and parents need good, current information  to make these critical decisions.   The flexibility in many of these programs offers our students less  time in the classroom and more time in the workplace. And the hands-on  education model keeps people engaged while teaching necessary soft  skills before graduation.   Every person deserves a quality education, and every community  deserves a thriving local economy with highly skilled workers. I am  proud to support career and technical education, and look forward to  working with our community partners to implement this very important  legislation.
