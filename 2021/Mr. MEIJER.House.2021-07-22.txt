 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Allies Act. It is  our moral obligation to honor the promises we made to our Afghan allies  and ensure that those who risked their lives for the U.S. mission are  safely relocated, but it is patently clear that the Special Immigrant  Visa program, as it currently exists, is not up to the task. Staffing  shortages and bureaucratic hurdles have resulted in years-long delays  in the process and a backlog of over 18,000 applications.  [[Page H3816]]    The Allies Act will help speed up the process by streamlining  duplicative procedures and removing unnecessary requirements, while  maintaining the necessary security and vetting procedures. It also  expands eligibility for those who are unfairly left out of the program,  most critically, surviving spouses and children of applicants who died  or were killed by the Taliban before visa approval.   Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the recent news of the plans to begin  evacuating some of these Afghan interpreters, but make no mistake,  there is much more to be done. We have a responsibility to ensure that  those who risked their lives serving alongside U.S. and coalition  forces are both swiftly evacuated and given a path to safety.   This bill is a significant step toward that goal and will help ensure  that America lives up to the promises made to those brave individuals  and their families. I am proud to support this bill, and I call on all  of my colleagues to do so today. I urge passage.
