 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendment, No.  89, drawing attention to the lack of funding for the Uranium Reserve  Program in this bill. I would like to thank the Rules committee for  making this amendment in order, although I was disappointed that many  other crucial amendments I supported will not be debated or voted on by  the full House, including many that would have preserved the  protections for unborn lives that have been included in every other  appropriations bill in recent memory.   The Department of Energy's Uranium Reserve Program is critical to  both our energy industry and national security. In the Fiscal Year 21  appropriations, this program was funded at 75 million dollars, but it  was not included this year at all. This program will play an important  role in reviving domestic uranium production and will bring new jobs to  states like Wyoming. Uranium, despite what this administration may  believe, is a critical mineral that is essential to our energy  security, armed forces, and strategic deterrence.   The Uranium Reserve Program was designed to address identified risks  to the unobligated uranium supply chain including the loss of domestic  uranium mining and enrichment capabilities, and defunding it will only  serve to make the United States more dependent on unreliable foreign  sources owned by China and Russia. This is not the time to expand our  reliance on these countries. Instead of stifling domestic production of  uranium, we should be expanding it.   I hope the Chair and Ranking Member will work with me, moving  forward, to ensure this important program receives adequate funding. I  hope eliminating the Uranium Reserve Program from this year's Energy  and Water appropriations was simply an oversight and the result of a  rushed, partisan process, and that this can be remedied before the  September 30 deadline.
