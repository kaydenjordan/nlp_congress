 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the Arvin High School color guard.   Ranked number one in California, the Bears recently won the Western  Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada, and this last April brought home  the silver medal at the World Color Guard Championships in Dayton,  Ohio. The team has proven that hard work, practice, and teamwork can  bring success in any arena.   Led by Director Bryan Dandin, I am so proud of team members Ivan  Perez, Andrea Ramos, Ivory Rose Iglesias, Karen Jaqueline Islas Rosas,  Jose Nava, Melisa Sierra, Jocelyne Tapia, Yasmin Zavala, Maria Nunez,  Maria Ramos Navarro, Juan Gomez, Cithali Barrena, Veronica Sanchez,  Cassandra Cervantes, Enrique Portillo, Nevaeh Arriaga, Emily Watson,  and Jessica Sierra. I look forward to their future victories and the  success I know they will have in life.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the team.   Go, Bears.                            ____________________
