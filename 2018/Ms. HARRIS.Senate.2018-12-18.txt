 Mr. President, today I wish to express my deepest  appreciation to Governor Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown, Jr., for his nearly  50 years of committed public service to the people of California.   The son of a former California Governor, Jerry was born in San  Francisco in 1938 to Pat Brown and Bernice Layne. He graduated from the  University of California, Berkeley in 1961 before earning his law  degree from Yale University in 1964. He began his statewide career in  public service in 1970 after winning his first election as California  secretary of state.   In 1974, Jerry became Governor of California for the first time,  implementing an agenda that epitomizes the essence of California  values. He helped create millions of jobs and strengthened the  environment. He passed the Agricultural Labor Relations Act and led the  cause for the introduction of government funding in renewable energy  research. After 8 years in office, Jerry had a distinguished law  career, ran for Federal office on a platform dedicated to empowering  communities and affecting change, and served as chairman of the  California Democratic Party.   He reentered public life in 1998, this time as mayor of the great  city of Oakland, my hometown. As mayor, Jerry worked diligently to  revitalize downtown Oakland, reduce crime, and expand educational  opportunities. In 2006, he became California attorney general and  prioritized consumer protection, environmental protection, and  combating the underground economy.   Finally, in 2011, Mr. Brown returned to the Governor's seat where his  record can only be described as extraordinary. Jerry has brought  California's unemployment rate to record lows, expanded health coverage  to millions in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, and established  groundbreaking policies to combat climate change that have inspired our  Nation and the world. Before joining the U.S. Senate, I worked with  Jerry for 6 years as attorney general of California, during which we  tackled an economic and housing crisis of epic proportions and fought  to protect the privacy and cyber security of California's residents and  businesses. Since joining the U.S. Senate, Jerry, Senator Feinstein,  and I have worked together to bring critical aid to those affected by  the deadly wildfires that have ravaged our State.   I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to honor Governor  Brown's leadership and achievements today on the Senate Floor. His  ability to bring sweeping change to improve the lives of the people he  serves and the communities he governs is truly inspiring. His  unwavering commitment to the people of California and vision for a more  perfect union will long be remembered and cherished in the pages of  history.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is with gratitude that I rise  today to acknowledge Arturo S. Rodriguez for his 45 years of leadership  and commitment to protecting and advancing the civil, political, and  economic rights of farm workers, most notably as president of the  United Farm Workers of America, or UFW.   Born the grandson of a cattle farmer in San Antonio, TX, in 1949,  Arturo first learned of Cesar E. Chavez and California's farm worker  movement in 1966. His passion for civil rights and social justice  motivated him to become an active farm worker supporter as a student at  Saint Mary's University, where he would later graduate in 1971 with a  degree in sociology. After receiving a master's degree in social work  from the University of Michigan in 1973, Arturo joined the farm worker  movement full-time, working with Chavez for the next two decades to  develop and train new organizers, manage UFW industry organizing  campaigns, and oversee national boycott strategies that would increase  wages and improve working conditions. Following Chavez's passing in  1993, Arturo became the second president of the UFW and committed  himself to fulfilling Chavez's legacy of creating a more just and  equitable food system that treated farm workers with the dignity and  respect they deserved.   Arturo's presidency has been nothing short of extraordinary. Under  his leadership, farm worker wages have risen to an average of $13.18 an  hour, above State and Federal minimum wage laws. Arturo established  industry-wide organizing campaigns resulting in 80 percent of the  mushroom, rose, and strawberry workers now represented by a union  contract. He held employers accountable for wage and hour laws, winning  millions of dollars for workers in back wages and overtime pay. He won  historic State legislation to provide overtime pay to farm workers and  protect them from heat exposure.   As president of the largest and most active farm worker movement in  the Nation, Arturo has also pushed a national agenda for immigrant and  workers' rights. He led negotiations with major agricultural  associations to develop the agricultural provisions in the Senate's  comprehensive immigration reform bill passed in 2013. He and the UFW  worked closely with the Obama White House to secure protections for  farm workers from the harmful effects of pesticides, in addition to  protections for children and parents as part of President Obama's  immigration Executive actions. I was honored to work closely with him  as a newly elected Member of the Senate to introduce the Fairness for  Farm Workers Act, S. 3131, to strengthen critical Federal protections  for farm workers as they face long hours and exposure to harsh working  conditions.   Arturo's legacy represents the best of who we are as a nation. His  unwavering commitment to bettering the lives of the most vulnerable  epitomizes the kind of servant leader we should all  [[Page S7785]]  strive to be. His contributions to the farm worker movement and our  Nation will have a lasting impact for generations to come.                            ____________________
