 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Rolf  Monument Company of Newport, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   All across America's Main Streets, one will find small businesses  that offer a product or service more valuable than that which is  offered by their corporate competitors. Rolf Monument Company is one of  those businesses. Established in 1895, Rolf Monument Co is the oldest  business in Newport. The secret behind this main street mainstay is  their respectful customer service and high-quality products, which are  often sought by customers that are going through some of life's  toughest moments. Rolf Monument Company is a premier craftsman of  custom memorials, and the owner Tim Rolf takes great pride in providing  his customers with products that showcase an unparalleled attention to  detail and dignified artistry.   Being only the fourth person to run the business since its founding,  owner Tim Rolf took the helm of Rolf Monument Company in 1984, and he  takes special care in continuing to steward the family company into the  modern age. Though his family may not be famous by their name, the work  of Rolf Monument Co is well known throughout the tri-state area. Some  of the company's most notable works around Newport include the 9/11  Memorial at the World Peace Bell, the Riverwalk plaques, the Northern  Kentucky Firefighters Memorial, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club  Memorial, which the company is currently designing and building.  Perhaps the company's most famous work was a piece commissioned by a  movie producer who was then in the production of ``Rain Man''. With the  movie being filmed in northern Kentucky, the production crew largely  depended on businesses in the northern part of the State to service  whatever needs arose while filming. Therefore, Rolf Monument Co was  tapped to design the headstones for the fictional parents of the  characters played by Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. These movie-famous  monuments are on display today at Rolf Monument Company, serving as a  reminder of the company's work featured in the hit 1988 movie.   In addition to his reputation for providing top-quality products to  all his customers, Tim Rolf has been recognized for his service outside  of his leadership of Rolf Monument Company. This year, Mr. Rolf was  inducted into the Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame, a group that honors  Kentucky military veterans and educates the community about their  accomplishments. Mr. Rolf comes from a family that understands the  importance of serving our country; he and his three brothers and one  sister all having served in the U.S. military. However, the Kentucky  Veterans Hall of Fame not only recognized Mr. Rolf for his  contributions during his time in uniform, his induction paid tribute to  the fine work he and his company have  [[Page S6774]]  done to honor many of our fallen soldiers and servicemen. Memorials  that are commissioned for veterans often display additional markings  and features not usually featured on the average headstone, such as  Bronze Stars and Purple Hearts. In a display of gratitude for their  service to our country, whenever Rolf Monument Co receives a commission  for one of these specially crafted veterans' headstones, Mr. Rolf adds  the additional service-specific features free of charge.   Of the many services this company offers, the most popular is the  creation of memorials for families who have recently lost loved ones.  Mr. Rolf understands that these monuments often embody the final step  in the grieving process, and Rolf Monument Company takes special care  to streamline this process and ensure the family of the bereaved is  treated with the utmost dignity and respect. Moreover, this same level  of dignity is displayed in all the collaboration Rolf Monument Co  participates in within the veteran community. Tim Rolf's company often  works with AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam veterans  groups. Not only does his company play an important part in the  transition of life for Kentucky citizens, but they work tirelessly to  pay tribute to the men and women who fought to keep our country free. I  want to thank Mr. Rolf for his fine work done on behalf of our Nation's  veterans and congratulate him and to the entire team at Rolf Monument  Company. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
