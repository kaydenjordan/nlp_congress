 Madam Speaker, our Nation owes a great debt to the  healthcare and social service workers fighting on the frontlines of the  COVID-19 pandemic. These essential workers treat the ill, administer  vaccines, care for the elderly, and respond to emergencies across the  country. Their efforts are critical to our Nation's response to the  pandemic.   Yet, Congress has abdicated its responsibility to protect these  essential workers from violence in the workplace. These workers are  almost five times as likely to experience a serious injury from  workplace violence than workers in other sectors.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1195. I want to acknowledge  the principled, compassionate, committed and effective leadership of  Congressman Courtney for shepherding this bill to the floor.   This legislation would direct OSHA to quickly issue an interim final  standard mandating healthcare and social service employers implement  workplace prevention plans.   This is not a partisan issue. I hope we can all agree that everyone  deserves to feel safe at work. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Public Health Association in support of the legislation.                                                     American Public                                              Health Association,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2021.      House Committee on Education and Labor,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Public       Health Association, a diverse community of public health       professionals that champions the health of all people and       communities, I write in strong support of H.R. 1195, the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Services Workers Act. This important bipartisan legislation       would require the Occupational Safety and Health       Administration to develop a workplace violence prevention       standard to protect workers who are at the greatest risk from       violence on the job.        Workplace violence is a serious problem that has increased       substantially in the last decade. Every day, nurses,       psychiatric aides, social workers and other caretakers are       assaulted on the job. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports       that in 2019 health care and social service workers       experienced the highest rate of workplace violence injuries       at 14.7 per 10,000 workers, compared to a national average of       4.4 for all workers. In the same year, psychiatric hospitals       had a recorded rate of serious injury due to workplace       violence at 152.4 per 10,000 workers. Since 2010, the rate of       serious workplace violence injuries has increased by 52% in       health care and social assistance jobs. Health care and       social service workers are at greatest risk because they are       on the frontlines of patient and client care, often working       with high-risk populations who need specialized care and       attention. This type of violence has a significant and long-      lasting impact on individual workers and on the public's       health.        Assaults and other violence experienced by health care and       social assistance workers is a preventable problem that       requires a public health approach. This legislation would       require employers who operate health care facilities, mental       health clinics, emergency services and home care to develop a       workplace violence prevention plan. These plans have shown to       be effective and the tools for preventing violence in these       workplaces are available, such as emergency response alarms,       improved lighting and safe staffing levels.        We strongly urge your support for this important       legislation which is a critical step in protecting our       caregivers from work-related violence.            Sincerely,                                           Georges C. Benjamin, MD,                                                Executive Director.
