 Madam Speaker, this resolution really raises a question to  each one of us who is a Member of Congress; and that question is: Do we  believe in the separate, independent authority of the legislative  branch to conduct oversight?   The contents of this resolution and the whistleblower report, to be  sure, are extremely explosive and important. But the question that we  have to ask, as a Congress, Republicans and Democrats, is: Are we  willing to stand up for the constitutional authority of the House as a  representative branch of government?   That is the constitutional question. This resolution goes to the  heart of our responsibility. We must pass it in order for us to be a  coequal branch of government.
