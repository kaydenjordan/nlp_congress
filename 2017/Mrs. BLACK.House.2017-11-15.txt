 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his endless hours  of work listening to everyday people, listening to small businesses,  listening to large businesses, listening to how what we put in this  bill was going to affect the American people who, at the end of the  day, are going to be the winners.   So it has been more than three decades since Congress has worked with  the White House to modernize our Nation's very confusing and  complicated tax system. Just ask anybody who has filed their taxes on  their own.   But we are closer to changing that day with H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. And with this budget, with the budget passed in both Chambers  and following last week's productive markup in our House Ways and Means  Committee, tax relief is on the horizon.   With this legislation, Republicans clearly recognize the need to do  something about our heavy tax burden weighing down the hardworking  Americans and holding back job creators.   We also recognize the need to bring simplicity to the Tax Code. In  our tax reform plan, we will help low- and middle-income Americans see  more of their hard-earned paychecks by lowering the tax rates and  nearly doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married  couples.                                time  1730    For instance, for an average middle class family of four, that  translates to a $1,200 tax cut. Now, I will tell you, that is real  money.   We also establish a new family credit that raises the child tax  credit and introduces new credits for family members and other  dependents.   The Tax Code will also become less confusing, making it possible for  most Americans to file their taxes on a single postcard.   Our plan, rightly, provides tax relief for job creators, empowering  entrepreneurs and small businesses to continue opening, operating, and  expanding on Main Street.   For my home State of Tennessee, H.R. 1 will allow families to see an  estimated $2,200 increase in wages. Again, that is real money.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, this bill  would also mean 20,000 new jobs for my State. This will provide a  welcome jolt to our economy, which is badly needed following eight  lackluster years under the Obama administration.   Without question, enacting tax reform is a challenge, but the  benefits of seeing it through will be felt for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. We cannot miss this historic opportunity.
