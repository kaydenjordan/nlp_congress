 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today's rule deems the Senate version of the budget  resolution, S. Con. Res. 5, as passed. Last night, the Senate  considered this measure, along with hundreds of amendments. The House  passed its version, H. Con. Res. 11, on Wednesday. The two measures are  largely the same, but because the Senate version has minor changes, we  find ourselves once again considering a measure that the House has  already passed.   Even though we are once again considering a rule for the budget  resolution, we will not actually debate and pass because this rule  deems the resolution as passed. I think it is important for Members to  recognize: This is  [[Page H442]]  your only vote on adding nearly $2 trillion to the deficit.                                time  1200    If this is the way we are going to achieve the passage of a budget  resolution, why don't we take more time to negotiate a better product  for the American people? Instead, we spent hours on what has amounted  to procedural votes. The House has had little to say in the resolution  outlining the reconciliation instructions by simply deeming the Senate  version in this rule.   As I mentioned on Tuesday, budget reconciliation is a fast-track tool  used to implement policy changes into law requiring only 51 votes in  the Senate to pass.   Senator Sanders has stated the budget reconciliation does not have to  be a partisan process. I actually agree with that. But that is exactly  what this resolution sets up. Democrats control the House and the  Senate and the White House, so we don't need to work with the  Republicans on a resolution to benefit Americans.   Democrats previously promised $2,000 stimulus checks, billions for  State and local governments, expansion of Medicaid, pension bailouts,  added unemployment benefits, implementation of a Green New Deal, passed  the citizenship for illegal aliens, lowering Medicaid-age eligibility,  providing universal basic income, increasing the minimum wage, and  canceling student loan debt.   But as we have seen in previous relief packages, many stimulus checks  went to individuals who had actually kept their jobs or had no decrease  in their pay. These checks could have been sent to those most in need,  those who lost their jobs or are struggling to find work.   In addition, many State and local governments are in the red due to  mismanagement of their budgets. This actually occurred before the  pandemic began and now taxpayers are being asked to bail them out for  that fiscal mismanagement that actually was decades in the making.   While Americans should be able to compete for a livable wage, raising  the minimum wage to $15 an hour really does put some people at a  disadvantage. Fast-food workers are now paid at the same level as  paramedics though the training for those two jobs is clearly different.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, raising the minimum  wage without considering market conditions could result in the loss of  well over a million jobs. Student loan repayments are currently paused,  but canceling that debt altogether harms individuals who have already  paid back their loans and places that burden on the taxpayer. It also  sends a message that you do not have to be responsible for the debt  that you accumulate.   These policies are part of President Biden's $1.9 trillion  coronavirus relief package that could ultimately increase the deficit  between $2- and $3 trillion. But it does not address the immediate  needs of the Americans who are trying to survive the pandemic. So now  is not the time to push through partisan priorities.   Barely a month ago, Congress passed and President Trump signed into  law a $900 billion coronavirus relief package. Combined with previous  relief packages--and there have been several: three in March, one in  April, one in December--and there remains $1 trillion in unspent  funding.   As I pointed out on Tuesday, there have been few efforts to conduct  oversight on this massive amount of funding.   In addition, yesterday, Larry Summers, President Clinton's Treasury  Secretary and an economic adviser to President Obama, published an  opinion piece outlining the risk of President Biden's massive $1.9  trillion package. Secretary Summers points out that the 2009 stimulus  was about half as large as the estimated economic output shortfall.   In contrast, the already enacted $900 billion stimulus Congress  passed in December will fill the gap three times over. To make this  even more clear, the output shortfall due to the pandemic is estimated  between $20- and $50 billion a month. The $900 billion stimulus will  total $150 billion a month.   So you have to ask again: Why is it suddenly so urgent that we pass  another $2 trillion bill?   I am pleased that on a few amendments considered last night in the  Senate, the Senate came together. It appears to support not increasing  the minimum wage during the pandemic; not moving the United States  Embassy in Israel from Jerusalem; and not providing economic stimulus  payments to undocumented or illegal aliens.   I am disappointed that the Senate Democrats defeated an amendment  that would have prohibited a carbon tax, meaning a large tax increase  is likely coming.   Despite the largely partisan nature of these budget resolution  proceedings, there exists examples of bipartisanship. Now is the time  to simply focus on policy and determine the best way forward for our  country.   Republicans do stand ready to work with Democrats. Last March, last  April there was considerable agreement on the way forward. But while  Republicans do stand ready to work with Democrats to provide these  resources for the American people, we must ensure that all proposals  are thoroughly examined and will be implemented in a way that helps  rather than harms our recovery.   Despite calling for unity, the first move by President Biden and the  Democrats is to employ a partisan process and jam through a wish list  of policy priorities. I sincerely hope that the committees tasked with  complying with the budget reconciliation instructions will engage in a  more bipartisan manner.   With that, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I do need to say one thing. A year ago, the gentleman had the  opportunity to be in the same briefings that all of us were in. These  were bipartisan briefings over in the Capitol Visitor Center. All of  the experts in public health came and talked to us about the dangerous  waters ahead because of this plague coming out of China.   And there could be no mistaking the difficulties that were ahead, but  this was information that was available to all of us. It was not  information that was secret or waived by the previous administration,  not shared. It was here that we were given that same information.   Unfortunately, I sit on one of the authorizing committees that is  responsible for pandemic preparedness. Did we do a single thing on a  hearing basis during the month of February? The answer is no. We added  on 1 hour to the end of a budget hearing at the end of February and by  the middle of March, we had to suspend all activity in the Congress  because of the pandemic.   We squandered the weeks that were available to us. The President  bought us some time by cutting off foreign travel from China. The  problem is that we, as the House of Representatives and Democratic  leadership in my committee, did not use that time effectively.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Cammack), a valuable new freshman Member.                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to  encourage local educational agencies to resume in-person instruction at  elementary and secondary schools.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of my amendment, along with extraneous material, immediately prior  to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Steel), who is here to explain the amendment. I  welcome her to the floor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), the lead Republican on our House Budget  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, to recover from the pandemic, really, it is not a good  idea to push through policies that don't address the immediate needs of  the American people. The budget reconciliation resolution provided for  in this rule will drastically increase the deficit and seek to  implement nonessential partisan policies without first conducting  hearings and oversight to ensure that current funding is spent  effectively and efficiently.  [[Page H446]]    It is disappointing, after calling for unity just a little over 2  weeks ago in the front of this Capitol Building by the President, that  the first move is to employ this partisan process.   It is now up to the committees crafting the reconciliation  legislation to work in a bipartisan manner. I sincerely hope that they  do, but it has been disappointing so far. And if the past is prelude, I  don't think we will look forward to this being a bipartisan process.   Madam Speaker, I do want to remind Members that this will be a vote  on the rule, but you will not get a vote on the resolution. Bear that  in mind. The vote on the rule expands the deficit by $1.9 to $2.9  trillion.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and a  ``no'' vote on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
