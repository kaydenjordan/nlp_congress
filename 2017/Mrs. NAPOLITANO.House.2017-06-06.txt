 Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No.  286 and No. 287 due to my spouse's health situation in California. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on H. Res. 354--Condemning  the violence against peaceful protesters outside the Turkish  Ambassador's residence on May 16, 2017, and calling for the  perpetrators to be brought to justice and measures to be taken to  prevent similar incidents in the future, as amended. I would have also  voted ``yea'' on H. Res. 355--Condemning in the strongest terms the  terrorist attacks in Manchester, United Kingdom, on May 22, 2017,  expressing heartfelt condolences, and reaffirming unwavering support  for the special relationship between our peoples and nations in the  wake of these attacks, as amended.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
