 Madam Speaker, over the past week we have seen tragic  images coming from Del Rio, Texas. Caravans of migrants wading across  the Rio Grande. Families sleeping under bridges. Border Patrol who are  overworked and overwhelmed.   These images don't show a border under control, as President Biden  promised. Instead, they are a picture of chaos, incompetence, and  crisis.   When President Biden picked Vice President Kamala Harris to be border  czar, he assured us she was ``the most qualified person to handle the  job.'' He also said she had a plan to ``stem the surge of migrants.''   Was the plan to dismantle Title 42 and return to Mexico, which would  have prevented this crisis?   Was the plan to release hundreds of thousands of migrants into the  country each month without a COVID test?   Was the plan to effectively give the cartels control over the border  and disrupt local communities?   If that was her plan, we can't afford it anymore. This is more than a  disaster; it is a direct threat to Americans' safety.   The Vice President often says we need to examine root causes to solve  the border crisis. Well, the chaos in Del Rio confirms that the root  causes are Democrats' radical immigration policies. It is time for  Congress to hold this administration accountable and secure the border.   We need to hear from those responsible for this failure, starting  with the Vice President. Right now, it seems she is more interested in  visiting talk shows and football games than visiting the border.   Madam Vice President, this isn't a news cycle to hide from, it is a  humanitarian, national security, and public health crisis that must be  stopped.   The American people need action and answers, not the largest amnesty  plan in American history. Do your job before the crisis gets even  worse.
