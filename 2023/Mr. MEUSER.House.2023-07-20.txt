 Mr. Speaker, ``I think that there's no doubt about the  seriousness of the problem we've got. We have a cancer within--close to  the Presidency, that's growing. It's growing daily.''   Mr. Speaker, that is a quote from the Watergate scandal, but the  American people are applying it to current circumstances in the White  House.   We have a laptop referencing ``the big guy'' is getting his 10  percent. We have text messages stating: My father is sitting next to me  and you better pay up.   I am paraphrasing, slightly.   Despite statements from the White House on how there was no contact  with business partners, we have pictures of them playing golf together,  and White House visitor logs.   Mr. Speaker, we have bank records, lots of them, around 20, with tens  of millions of dollars going to members of the President's family,  including grandchildren. We don't know what they did for it, and  recently a bag of cocaine was found in the White House, but case  closed. No one accused. No one found.   Mr. Speaker, if this was a bag of anthrax, would that have been taken  more seriously and solved? I think the answer is yes. The only reason  there are any investigations taking place or oversight is because  Republicans have a majority in the House.                            ____________________
