 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the John R.  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   It is because of the courage and sacrifices of civil rights leaders  like Congressman John Lewis that we were able to pass the Voting Rights  Act of 1965. But for over a decade, we have witnessed a new era of  voter suppression and Jim Crow laws pursued by Republican State  legislatures, including in my State of Arizona.   These attacks on our right to vote are nothing new. For too long,  Black, Latino, and Native American voters have overcome incredible  barriers to cast their votes.   That is not how American democracy should work. That is why  Representative Mondaire Jones and I were proud to add a provision to  this bill today that bans discriminatory voting laws that harm voters  of color.   I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this bill and this provision  with it.
