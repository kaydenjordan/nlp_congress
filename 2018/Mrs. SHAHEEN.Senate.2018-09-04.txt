 Mr. President, I wish to honor the life and legacy of  my friend and colleague, Senator John McCain. Over these past months,  his presence has been dearly missed, and I must admit it is still hard  to imagine that John isn't coming back.   I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues who have  so eloquently discussed John's lasting legacy as a great statesman and  as a true American hero. I join with them and so many Americans across  the country in mourning his passing.   As many people know, John had a special relationship with New  Hampshire, a relationship forged during his Presidential campaigns. We  often considered John one of our own, a true Granite Stater. He just  seemed to click with the Granite State; in fact, he  [[Page S6027]]  would call New Hampshire his ``second favorite state.''   Throughout his many visits to New Hampshire, Granite Staters  appreciated his candor and sincerity. The Straight Talk Express wasn't  just a slogan--the John McCain you saw was the John McCain you got.   Most memorable, during a campaign stop in Wolfeboro in 2008, a mother  stood up and asked John to wear a bracelet with her son's name it. Her  son, Matthew Stanley, was only 22 years old when he died serving in  Iraq. She wanted to make sure that her son's sacrifice wasn't  forgotten, that he didn't die in vain. John said he would be honored to  wear the bracelet. From then on, it was on his wrist everywhere he  went. In his final days, John continued to wear the bracelet of Matthew  Stanley on his wrist. Until the very end, John was true to his word and  true to his convictions.   As my chairman on the Armed Services Committee, it was always a great  honor to work with John on the annual defense authorization bill. The  issues we addressed were so important to him. His devotion to service  and the Armed Forces not only ran deep in his character, but in his  family legacy. Delivering a good and timely defense bill was John's No.  1 priority.   One issue I had the great honor of working with John on every year  was providing additional visas to Afghan interpreters and support staff  who help our troops and diplomats on the ground. For their service,  these men and women are often targeted by the Taliban and other  terrorist groups. John recognized that we have a profound obligation to  provide a safe haven to these Afghan allies who risk everything. John  led this fight because it is just the right thing to do. He understood  that the solemn commitment to leave no man behind extends to all who  fight, and just like John, America would be true to its word.   I also had the pleasure of traveling internationally with John to  represent the United States and observe U.S. missions. As many of my  colleagues can attest, rarely was a minute wasted on a McCain  delegation. One of his great passions was human rights and supporting  those on the side of freedom and democracy around the world. Whether  that be students seeking academic freedom in Belarus or newly elected  leaders in Tunisia, he always made time to encourage and support their  efforts.   John cared greatly for the U.S. Senate and was deeply worried about  the current state of our politics. I believe that the floor speech that  Senator McCain delivered soon after learning of his cancer diagnosis  will echo for decades to come. We can fight like hell for what we  believe in, but we must always recognize that we are fundamentally  Americans who have more in common than we have differences. Compromise  in a legislative body is essential, not a dirty word. Political  expediency must take a backseat to what is best for the country. We  should all take this message to heart every day as we seek to address  the many challenges our country faces.   My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the McCain family. I wish  for them strength and perseverance during this very difficult time.   There will never be another John McCain, and the Senate will not be  the same without him.                            ____________________
