 Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute to  Michigan residents who have given their lives while serving in our  Nation's Armed Forces and their families.   As long as Michigan has been a State--and even before--our people  have been willing to put their lives on the line in defense of this  Nation. From the War of 1812, to the Civil War, the World Wars, Korea,  Vietnam, the Cold War, and the fight against terrorism, the people of  Michigan have raised their hand when called upon and stood to the very  end.   That was never more true than on December 7, 1941.   That morning, 2,341 American servicemembers lost their lives when  Pearl Harbor was attacked. More than 30 of those who died were from  Michigan.   This spring, I had the opportunity to honor their sacrifice in person  when I visited Pearl Harbor with Senate colleagues.   It is difficult to explain just how moving it is to see Battleship  Row and to gaze down at the USS Arizona, so quiet and still in those  clear blue waters. I thought about what it must have been like that  Sunday morning, a day that began like any other, but which would live  in infamy.   Imagine being barely out of high school, far from home, and on the,  threshold of war. Imagine being aboard a ship that is coming under  attack. Imagine the fearful realization that this might be where your  story ends.   These veterans gave everything for us. It is our solemn duty to keep  the promises we have made to them.   My own father served in the Navy during World War II. Being there at  Pearl Harbor reminded me of his sacrifice and the sacrifices made by  all of our veterans, especially those we have lost. On Memorial Day and  every day, let's give them our heartfelt thanks, surround their  families with love, and honor their sacrifice.   Thank you.                            ____________________
