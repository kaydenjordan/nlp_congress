 Mr. President, today I wish to make some remarks paying  tribute to a former staff member of mine for whom I have the highest  opinion. However, before I begin those remarks, I should take a moment  to address the elephant in the room.   Mr. President, today the majority leader revealed a revised  discussion draft for legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Let  me say at the outset that this bill isn't perfect. There are some  things in the bill that, given my preferences, I would do very  differently. But one thing I have learned in my 40 years in this Senate  is that people who demand purity and perfection when it comes to  legislation usually end up disappointed and rarely accomplish anything  productive. That is particularly true when we are talking about complex  policy matters.   The next vote on this legislation will presumably be whether to let  the Senate proceed to the bill. Regardless of any of the positions of  my colleagues on this particular draft, if they support the larger  effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare, they should at the very least  want to have a debate on this bill. Under the rules, we will have an  open amendment process. Members will get a chance to make their  preferences known and to have the Senate vote on them. Taking that  opportunity is the very least we can do.   Keep in mind, virtually every Republican in this body has supported  the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare more or less since the day  it was signed into law. We have all made promises to our constituents  along those lines. This legislation, while far from perfect, would  fulfill the vast majority of those promises.   If we pass up this opportunity, we are looking at further collapse of  our health insurance markets, which means dramatically higher premiums  and even fewer healthcare options for our constituents. Make no  mistake, while some are talking about a bipartisan solution to prop up  markets in the event this bill fails, there is no magic elixir or  silver bullet that will make that an easy proposition.   I have to think that at the end of the day, if we fail to take action  to fulfill the promises we have all made, we will have to answer to the  American people for the missed opportunity and the chaos that will  almost certainly follow. I hope all of my colleagues will keep that in  mind.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
