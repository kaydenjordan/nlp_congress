 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize National Intern Day. Today is a day dedicated to recognizing  and celebrating the future leaders of the world: interns.   National Intern Day has served as an opportunity for thousands of  employers to commemorate and thank their hardworking interns.   I will take this time to recognize and thank our three current  interns who join me this summer: Adiya, Ben, and Sam. All three have  been instrumental in helping serve both the people of Pennsylvania's  15th Congressional District and the House Agriculture Committee.   From conducting research to drafting speeches and statements, to  guiding tours and responding to constituents, Adiya, Ben, and Sam were  fantastic additions to my D.C. office.   Madam Speaker, our interns today are truly the leaders of tomorrow,  and they deserve recognition for their outstanding work.   Thank you to our interns, again, for joining us this summer.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership on this issue. If there is anyone that  should be leading this discussion, it should be somebody whose career  was as a professionally trained forester who actually knows this topic.   I rise in opposition to this legislation. Wildfire is a national  crisis that we must confront immediately. Tens of millions of acres are  overgrown and unhealthy, but this bill won't meet those challenges or  provide the Forest Service with the tools that they need to combat this  threat.   The Forest Service has already announced a strategy to treat 50  million acres. Mandating a new plan is duplicative, removes  flexibility, creates restrictions, and limits projects.   This bill authorizes billions for recreation, wilderness programs,  and old growth, which have nothing to do with protecting communities  and mitigating wildfire. Because this is only authorizing legislation,  the Forest Service will be directed to carry out the provisions without  being provided the necessary funding.   Additionally, there are none of the much-needed regulatory reforms  that would allow the Forest Service to increase the pace and scale of  restoration and wildfire mitigation.   There have been no committee hearings, markups, stakeholder feedback,  or technical assistance. The majority also blocked nearly every  amendment filed from even being debated today.   The provisions within the Committee on Agriculture's jurisdiction are  largely unvetted but are being crammed into this 558-page bill, which  we only first saw last week.   Madam Chair, let me just say, on the issue of firefighting, I served  as a state-certified firefighter, so, on behalf of my brothers and  sisters, I appreciate what they do, those that are fighting wildfires  or structure fires.   But I agree with the ranking member here that the Forest Service's  own words said that they were going to have to lay off more than 610  wildland firefighters because of this bill.   What my brothers and sisters who are wildland firefighters need more  than anything else are other firefighters. They are the primary tool  when it comes to battling these conflagrations.   This bill is an insult to them, an authorizing bill that provides no  additional funds. Quite frankly, Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote.
