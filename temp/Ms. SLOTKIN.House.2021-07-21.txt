 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the PFAS  Action Act, a bill that I am proud to cosponsor and that will address a  critically important issue in my district and across the country, PFAS  contamination.   This bill will take bold action to address PFAS contamination and it  contains a number of provisions in particular that will affect our  smallest communities; and I want to share those today.   From the very early days when I became a Member of Congress, one of  the issues that my residents were talking about more than anything else  was the need to access clean water. In particular, Michiganders are  concerned about increasing levels of PFAS and other toxic chemicals  that we are continuing to find in our drinking water.   In Michigan, water is our identity. We are the home of the Great  Lakes, and protecting our water and our waters is one of the most  bipartisan issues you will find in the State of Michigan.   I have always believed that environmental security is homeland  security, because it is about the safety and security of our kids and  the preservation of our way of life in Michigan.   If you can't take your grandchildren fishing in the lakes you grew up  on, or can't safely hand your child a glass of water without knowing  they might get a learning disability, that is a threat to your family.   We have kicked the can down the road long enough when it comes to  finally addressing the PFAS issue, and I am happy to stand here today  to fight for a bill that will make a real difference in people's lives  when it comes to clean water.   Today, the House is going to vote on several amendments that I  drafted and introduced and come directly from on-the-ground  conversations I have had with residents in my district. Here is a story  for you:   In Michigan, roughly 25 percent of our households get our water from  private wells, including myself and my family farm. And even though  there is a great deal of public reporting on PFAS contamination in our  public water sources, those of us who have private wells do not have a  ton of access to best practices, information, how we test.   So back in 2020, I went on a wells and waterways tour in my district  and hosted an evening in Davisburg, in Oakland County, right before  COVID came to us to talk directly with people who have private wells  about how we can make sure that our water is protected, clean, safe,  and tested.   The response was overwhelming. We had 150 people on a weekday to talk  about how we protect those of us on private wells. Most people do not  have the resources, information, or tools they need to get their  private wells tested.   These questions led to a bill that I am proud to cosponsor called the  Test Your Well Water Act, which ended up being included in the PFAS  Action Act. It requires the EPA to set up a website with information  for residents on private wells, including how to get your water tested,  treatment options, and financial assistance to help homeowners afford  the necessary treatment.   I also wrote an amendment to the PFAS Action Act to ensure that this  website also contains information about the health risks associated  with PFAS. My goal was to create a resource that would be able to  answer the questions I received from my constituents a little over a  year ago in Davisburg.   The fight to protect safe drinking water for all Michiganders  actually starts usually with local advocacy from people in our  districts who are directly impacted by that PFAS contamination. This  includes people like Stacy Taylor.    Stacy is a resident of my town of Holly, Michigan, and she gets her  water directly from a well on her property. When she and her husband  started experiencing serious health effects, she suspected there may be  PFAS in her water supply.   Stacy conducted intense research on her well and Holly's history,  digging through old documents, deeds, and maps to figure out where the  problem may lie. When she presented her findings to our office--and she  was diligent about coming to find me everywhere I was in the district-- we reached out to the State agency that is responsible for testing our  water sources in Michigan, and it turns out Stacy was right. There was  PFAS in her water supply--in our water supply.   But discovering the contamination isn't the end of the story. We have  to make sure that our towns and cities can clean up these chemicals and  provide their residents with clean water, even our smallest  communities.   Because of Stacy's dogged advocacy and countless other local folks  across my district, one of my amendments to the PFAS Action Act will  beef up assistance to local and community governments that would  otherwise really struggle to pay for PFAS cleanup. The cost can often  be prohibitive.   The stories my constituents have shared have helped shape this bill  to be more effective and impactful. In the  [[Page H3762]]  richest and most powerful country on Earth, we have to have the ability  to provide clean water to our citizens. We have to be able to lead  healthy lives, and that certainly includes guaranteeing a clean water  supply.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support the PFAS Action Act, and I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.                            ____________________
