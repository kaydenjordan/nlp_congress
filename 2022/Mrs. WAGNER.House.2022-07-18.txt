 Madam Speaker, as we stand here today, Vladimir Putin  continues his unconscionable assault on the sovereign nation of  Ukraine, displacing millions of families and killing thousands of  innocent civilians.   In response to this horrific assault, my home State of Missouri has  projected the colors of the Ukrainian flag on to our State capitol, as  well as both landmarks in St. Louis and Kansas City.   My bill here today will illuminate the Gateway Arch, the defining  structure of the St. Louis skyline and a symbol of pride for the people  of St. Louis, Missouri. It will also show the world that we stand  united in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, with the support of the entire Missouri delegation, I  urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.                            ____________________
