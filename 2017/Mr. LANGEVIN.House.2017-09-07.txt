 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 64, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.        Page 64, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.        Page 67, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,000,000)''.        Page 73, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Chairman, before I actually get to my amendment, I  just want to say in reference to the previous discussion about properly  funding the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, I commend  the discussion on both sides and the commitment to properly fund those  programs.   The National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the  Humanities holds a special place in Rhode Island in that both of those  programs were championed by and helped to have been created by our late  senior Senator Claiborne Pell. We understand the importance of the arts  and humanities in Rhode Island, the jobs they create, the quality of  life they enhance, and I wholeheartedly support properly funding both  of those programs.   I had led a Special Order when the President's budget came out and  those programs had been zeroed out in funding. Several of my colleagues  and I got together and talked about the impact the arts and humanities  have on our States, on our districts, and on the country as a whole. I  just want to reiterate my support for the National Endowment for the  Arts and Humanities and all they do for the country.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment that we have before us would restore some  funding to the southern New England estuaries program, which is  currently zeroed out in the underlying bill.   This program, part of the EPA's geographic programs, has been a  thriving success, and anyone who has been to New England knows the  beauty of where the ocean meets the land. Our estuaries are in South  County, Rhode Island, and all along the Narragansett Bay; along Mount  Hope Bay and Buzzards Bay and throughout Cape Cod.   These areas are the lungs of our coastal areas and sustain the  diversity of plant and animal life. These funds are vital to conserving  this wetland habitat which is frequently under attack by human and  natural damage. So I implore the majority to support this program, as  they have supported similar programs for Puget Sound, the Chesapeake  Bay, and other areas.   I am proud to be joined by Representatives Cicilline, Keating, and  Kennedy as cosponsors of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, finally, I just want to say that I intend to offer and  withdraw this amendment provided that my colleague, Chairman Calvert,  is open to continuing the discussion on the importance of this program.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, I have offered to withdraw the  amendment as long as the chairman would continue discussion with me.    I thank the chairman, and I am grateful for his  consideration, and I look forward to working with him.   I yield back the balance of my time and withdraw my amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.   The Committee will rise informally.   The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Katko) assumed the chair.                            ____________________
