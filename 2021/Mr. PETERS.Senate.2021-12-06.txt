 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the city of Royal Oak, MI. Situated in Oakland County,  Royal Oak is a city endowed with natural beauty and rich traditions,  built on a strong agricultural base and populated with dedicated  citizens and entrepreneurs.   The vibrant history of Royal Oak began in 1819, when it was explored  by Michigan Governor Lewis Cass as part of his survey of the land that  now comprises Oakland County. In contrast to the surrounding marshes,  Royal Oak sat on lush, high ground. Near the intersection of the modern  Crooks and Rochester Roads, Cass and his companions found an imposing  oak tree that brought to mind the tale of England's King Charles II,  who was said to have taken refuge under a grand oak tree from enemy  forces. For this reason, Cass and his fellow explorers christened the  tree the ``Royal Oak,'' and the city received its name.   Early settlers in the area were principally farmers focused on  clearing the land in order to build homes and plant crops. The  introduction of the railroad into Metro Detroit and Michigan's Bay area  soon brought with it an increase  [[Page S8931]]  in Royal Oak's manufacturing ventures, including logging, milling,  textile production, and more. The economic growth of the area soon  began attracting settlers from across the country, including the city's  first manufacturer, Orson Starr, who became known for his production of  cowbells. The boom in Michigan's automotive manufacturing in the early  twentieth century continued to bolster Royal's Oak's economic and  population growth, and by 1921, the city claimed over 6,000 residents  and voted to be officially incorporated as a city.   Today, Royal Oak is a diverse and vibrant city of over 57,000  residents who enjoy its beautiful parks, historic downtown, and  thriving neighborhoods. Located in the Detroit metropolitan area, Royal  Oak is home to a number of well-known local attractions, including the  Detroit Zoo, the Royal Oak Music Theatre, and the historic Royal Oak  Farmer's Market which has been in operation since 1927. The variety of  shops, restaurants, and entertainment offered by downtown Royal Oak  attracts both local residents and visitors from across the State of  Michigan alike. With its rich history, spirited downtown, and natural  beauty, Royal Oak is recognized as one of the top places to live in the  State of Michigan.   The City of Royal Oak has been an integral part of the State of  Michigan and our great Nation for over 100 years. As a Michigander and  a resident of southeast Michigan, I am honored to ask my colleagues to  join me in celebrating this significant milestone for the city, as well  as its residents, elected officials, and businesses. I wish the city  continued growth and prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
