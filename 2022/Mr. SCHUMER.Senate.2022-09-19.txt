 Madam President, today, my thoughts are with all our  fellow Americans in Puerto Rico--and all communities across the  Caribbean--battered by the destruction of Hurricane Fiona. As of this  morning, well over a million residents on the island remain without  power, and two-thirds remain without running water.   In a short while, I will get on the phone with the FEMA Administrator  and urge that they be ready to approve temporary 100 percent Federal  cost share for all emergency protective services that Puerto Rico  conducts in the coming days. That means covering the island's costs for  distributing food and water, disaster operations, and emergency medical  care. Right now, the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund has about $15 billion as  of late last week--a fund we Democrats fought extremely hard to secure.   I will also join with my colleagues in the New York delegation to  send FEMA a letter calling on them to be ready to support Puerto Rico  on any upcoming request for aid.   Five years--almost exactly 5 years to the day--after Puerto Rico was  devastated by Hurricane Maria, the Federal Government has a  responsibility to make sure we don't repeat the mistakes of the  previous administration. The Federal response should be swift, robust,  and continued for as long as the island needs.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to consider Calendar  No. 484, S. 4822.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, September 19, be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1055.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1097.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, September 19, be  waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 20; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Pan nomination, postcloture; further, all  postcloture time on the Pan nomination be considered expired at 11:30  a.m. and, following the disposition of the Pan nomination, the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings;  further, at 2:30 p.m., the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture  on the resolution of ratification with respect to Treaty document No.  117-1; finally, if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:39 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, September 20, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
