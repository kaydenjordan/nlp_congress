 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters of the House Financial  Services Committee for offering this resolution.   I rise in support of this resolution, and I look forward to working  with the gentlewoman from California to incorporate its basic  principles into future legislation produced by our committee to tackle  the illicit drug trade, international financing that moves around the  globe that is illicit in nature, as well as combating human trafficking  and using the financial system to traffic in human beings, which I  think is absolutely abhorrent.   This resolution reflects the Financial Services Committee's  longstanding emphasis that we have on protecting our national security  and ensuring the integrity of the financial system. The size and scope  of that system, along with the preeminent role of the U.S. dollar in  global trade, requires us to remain vigilant against illicit finance,  money laundering, and other significant threats.   Already this Congress, the House has passed several of our  committee's bills designed to identify new risks in illicit finance and  to strengthen our banks' cooperation with law enforcement authorities.  We are also looking forward to addressing a more comprehensive reform  of processes under the Bank Secrecy Act in order to crack down on money  laundering much more effectively.   We believe technology can be a great driver of those reforms and more  efficiently and effectively enforce those laws. We are working together  to achieve that bipartisan outcome and update to that very important  piece of legislation. This, I think, represents a down payment,  rhetorically, on that interest that we have of combating illicit  finance wherever it may be.   I hope that we can continue to engage in a meaningful way in that  bipartisan dialogue to achieve reforms to the Bank Secrecy Act, with  the understanding it is important to safeguard our national security,  while upholding a financial system that is open, transparent, and  efficient and that is, in many ways, the envy of the rest of the world,  without unduly burdening businesses in a manner that ends up turning  away legitimate trade and commerce. Striking that balance is obviously  that fine art that this Congress seeks to do, and we hope to do that  well coming out of our committee.   Now, Republicans and Democrats should also be able to agree that  these laws and regulations require us to strike a balance. That has to  be a stated objective, and I am hopeful that the chairwoman will  continue to work with us based on that principle. I am encouraged by  that opportunity on the Bank Secrecy Act and Illicit Finance for us to  tackle those items.   I thank the chairwoman for sponsoring this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I  ask my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2699]]                                     time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gooden), my colleague and a new member of the House  Financial Services Committee, for the purposes of a statement.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to note for the House that the original draft of  this resolution that was put forward and made public by committee  Democrats was not one that committee Republicans had vetted. And, in  that conversation, we had revised the text of this resolution.   So, out there today is the original text Chairwoman Waters had  offered. She undertook, through her staff and through my staff, and we  worked out the changes, so the language here is something that should  receive unanimous approval of the House of Representatives.   In fact, it states some very important things that we find important  in  [[Page H2700]]  the House Financial Services Committee.   Now, if there is illicit financing and our laws are not detecting it,  that is a problem, is it not? And we should address that problem,  however it manifests itself.   And we have two examples here, using artwork and using real estate;  but we also would use money in order to possess that artwork, that real  estate. So we want to make sure that we are getting at that money, that  flow, within our financial markets and getting at that.   There is bipartisan agreement, and the language here is not the  original language Chairwoman Waters offered and maybe, perhaps, the one  that she would want to pass. But, in her effort at bipartisanship, she  worked with committee Republicans, changed the resolution, and now  before us we have a new resolution.   This new resolution should meet the approval of everyone in this  House.   I want to state that very clearly. This is not a Democrat product.  Actually, it is because Chairwoman Waters did author it, but she was  willing to hear our feedback on the Republican side. That is helpful.   What this would be is the fifth bill that we have passed out of the  House Financial Services Committee that has received bipartisan  support. That is a good sign. That is a good sign, in a broken  Washington, that we can actually do some sensible things.   And outlined here, this resolution got out of, really, prescriptive  positions that we are still negotiating on on this idea of beneficial  ownership, which our colleague, Subcommittee Chair Maloney, has been  working on intensely, as have French Hill from Arkansas and Blaine  Luetkemeyer from Missouri on the Republican side.   And they are still working through the contents of that, and we are  still not in agreement. So we removed that language, and I think that  is a very hopeful thing.   I didn't really want to get into the mechanics of how we came to  this, but I think it is important for the House to note that that work  has been done. Before us is a new resolution that should be able to  meet the support of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I want to finish by saying this, that Chairwoman Waters  said she would work with us on this; she worked with us on this. I am  grateful for that.   Recognizing that there are more Democrats than Republicans in the  House, the gentlewoman could have passed this resolution if she saw  fit, on a partisan basis, but she thought it was important to actually  have a bipartisan outcome so we can have bipartisan legislating  following this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to reiterate that what my colleague, Mrs. Maloney, the chair  of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and  Capital Markets outlined, outlined is an ongoing conversation we are  having on her piece of legislation around beneficial ownership. We are  still working through that process. I think the talks have been  productive, but there is a lot of work to do. There is not quite  consensus yet on how we achieve that right balance.   Notwithstanding that, you have to look at the contents of the  resolution before us. I think this is, while not perfect--if I had  drafted the resolution, I would have also included the international  drug trade and human trafficking as two highly important areas that  need our attention and focus as policymakers. But that is a sin of  omission rather than commission.   I would also target a broader set of regimes. ISIS is targeted in  this, and I think that is strong. We have bipartisan agreement that we  have to fight this terrorism network and evil ideology that they have  put upon the world, and how they act out in this, and we have to have a  concerted effort, as Americans, in a bipartisan way, to fight them.   I would also add to that the regimes in China, Russia, and North  Korea as other state actors that are doing really horrible things in  terms of cyber threats, but also through money laundering--not just a  regime, but there are a lot of regimes around the world.   So this is not a complete resolution, but I think it is worthy of our  support. I think this is a first step in that longer conversation about  modernizing the Bank Secrecy Act and making sure that we are targeting  illicit financing.   I ask my colleagues to vote for this resolution, and I look forward  to continuing the conversation with my Democratic colleagues on more  bipartisan outcomes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
