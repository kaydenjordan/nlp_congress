 Mr. Speaker, the mainstream media will  never acknowledge that 2020 is the year of the Republican women.   They wrote us off on countless occasions, and yet, we proved them  wrong time and time again.   Across the country, the American people made their voices heard in  voting booths, and they chose numerous Republican women candidates to  be their voice in Washington.   To conservative women who aspire for public office, people will work  to discredit you, they will claim your priorities are misplaced, and  they will do everything they can to undermine your hard work.   But what they won't acknowledge is that you represent the best of the  values of the American people. That is what truly matters.                            ____________________
