 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, we meet not to lower the costs of prescription drugs, nor to  expand President Biden's infrastructure plan, nor to protect the voting  rights of the people, nor to protect the healthcare choices of women  across America because we know they are definitely not interested in  that. No, we meet, rather, for another stop on the GOP's endless  revenge tour against Democrats who dared to tell the truth about Donald  Trump and his repeated sellouts and betrayals of the American people  over the last 6 years.   It is all about Donald Trump tightening his stranglehold over  Republicans for the 2024 campaign and driving out anyone who dares to  think for himself or herself.   Don't take my word for it. Just read Friday's statement by the twice- impeached inciter of insurrection, sexual abuser, defamer of women, and  indicted pilferer of national security secrets, war plans, and top- secret classified documents himself. On Friday, Trump posted this order  to his followers in this unveiled threat to anyone who would dare to  defy his control over the GOP: ``Any Republican voting against [Adam  Schiff's] censure, or worse, should immediately be primaried.''   The Luna resolution is a weapon of mass distraction from Trump's  indictment by a Florida grand jury on 37 Federal charges relating to  obstruction and unlawful retention of defense information for storing  dozens of classified, secret, and top-secret documents at his Florida  resort in his bathroom, his bedroom, and beyond, and then refusing  repeatedly for more than a year to return any of these official  documents to the National Archives and the FBI.   It is amazing to me that they have to change the subject from one of  Donald Trump's current offenses against America to one of his older  offenses, welcoming Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential  campaign.   Russia repeatedly intervened in the 2016 campaign to help Donald  Trump, and that is not a matter of opinion. That is a question of  direct, positive fact.   Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the former FBI Director whose report  is cited authoritatively by Mrs. Luna, found right at the beginning of  his report that ``the Russian Government interfered in the 2016  Presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.''   Here is what the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and the Office of the  Director of  [[Page H3015]]  the National Intelligence found in 2017: ``Russian President Vladimir  Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S.  Presidential election.''   The Mueller investigation and the Moscow Project documented more than  250 episodes of collaboration and meetings between Russia and the Trump  campaign, including Paul Manafort's repeated passing of campaign  secrets, such as polling data, to Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian agent,  and the infamous meeting on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower led by Donald  Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.   Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, stated that the U.S.  Senate bipartisan Select Committee on Intelligence ``found irrefutable  evidence of Russian meddling'' in the American campaign.   The Mueller report, if you read it, makes no pronouncement on  collusion, the punitive crux of the distinguished gentlewoman's  complaint, because, as Mueller writes, ``collusion'' is not a legal  offense or a legal concept.   The whole question of Trump's collusion with Russia is in the realm  of opinion, and most Americans would see a lot of collusive activity,  all the way up to the present day when Donald Trump refuses even to  take the side of the Ukrainian people against Vladimir Putin's filthy,  bloody, imperialist invasion of their country, which has been filled  with lies, atrocities, and war crimes.   In any event, we don't censure Members over a difference of opinion.   Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the complete ethical collapse of a once- great political party. The Republican Party began as a pro-freedom,  antiracist, pro-immigrant, anti-Know-Nothing party. It has become an  authoritarian cult of personality taking orders from an inciter of  insurrection, bully, and braggart whose rage toward Mike Pence and  whose spectacular disrespect for the rule of law endangered not only  our entire constitutional order but everyone in this room. The party of  Lincoln and his Lincolnites has become the party of Luna and her Luna  followers.   Today's madcap antics are an obvious deflection from Trump's  deepening legal troubles. His allegedly criminal conduct in pilfering,  hoarding, and refusing to return national security documents has caused  his own Attorney General, William Barr, to say that: ``Trump's conduct  is indefensible. . . . He is not a victim here. He was totally wrong.''  And, ``There is no excuse for what he did here.''   Yesterday, Representative Boebert offered a resolution of impeachment  against President Biden. The GOP simply has no ideas for our economy,  no ideas for our country, and no ideas for our people but is on an  embarrassing revenge tour on behalf of Donald Trump, who treats them  like a ventriloquist dummy.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and a  former member of the January 6th Select Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the minority leader and a member of the first  House impeachment team.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Goldman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes).   Mr. HIMES: Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I just heard the gentleman from Virginia say that this  is not a censure of Donald Trump, and he is right about that, and, boy,  is he right about that because there is no behavior--not a discussion  of how he would handle women, not an attack on this Capitol, and not  the misuse of classified information--that will ever result in a peep  from the Republican majority much less a censure of that behavior. This  is a question of standing, Mr. Speaker, amongst other things, if that  is what you stand upon.   As my colleagues pointed out, we don't hear anything about a  colleague whose entire campaign and entire resume was built on  falsehood. Instead, we hear that Russia was a hoax.   Mr. Speaker, I was there. The investigation began by a Republican  chairman. All these investigations were predicated on the fact that a  Donald Trump foreign policy aide told the Australian ambassador that  they were expecting dirt from the Russians.   The most important thing I can say is that I sat next to Adam Schiff  for years. He is a man of integrity and dignity. This vote, quite  frankly, Mr. Speaker, is a testament to your dignity or lack thereof.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to observe that there are dozens  of Members on our side who have come to stand with Mr. Schiff, and it  appears to have been evacuated on the other side. There is nobody  standing with the Luna resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), a member of the second House impeachment team.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Mullin).    Mr. Speaker, they defend the big lie, they defend the  insurrection, they defend George Santos, but they attack Adam Schiff.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Carson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the ranking member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Rules  Committee for those astute remarks. I note that dozens of Members of  our caucus have come to stand with Mr. Schiff today, while the sponsor  of this resolution, Mrs. Luna, appears to be completely isolated over  on her side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), a member of the first impeachment team.    Mr. Speaker, we are here precisely because of Donald  Trump, because he wants this retribution exacted against Adam Schiff  for standing up against Donald Trump's lies and assaults on American  democracy.   I congratulate the gentlewoman on her forthcoming baby. That is  awesome news. I am wondering if she would share some of her time with  me because I have started to run out of time, and she has no speakers  over on her side, so consider that.   In the meantime, I recognize for 1 minute the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette). I recognize for 1 minute the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the chairman of the January 6th Select Committee.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentleman from Mississippi.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr.  Robert Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the former Speaker of the  House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
