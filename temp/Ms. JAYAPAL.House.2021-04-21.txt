 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the NO BAN  Act, and I thank Congresswoman Chu for her leadership.   Yes, let's get back to protecting America. That is what we want to  do.   Madam Speaker, Anahita is an asylee from Iran. The last time she  spoke to her father, he told her that, when she returned home, he would  sit with her on the terrace and talk politics. That  [[Page H2011]]  never happened. Due to Trump's Muslim ban, Anahita could not get travel  documents to see her dad before he died or to mourn with her family.   Madam Speaker, for 4 years, families remained separated. That is not  the America we want to protect.   American businesses and universities couldn't recruit top candidates,  and our Nation's doors were closed to people seeking refuge.   President Biden rescinded the bans, but we must pass the NO BAN Act  to prohibit any future President from issuing discriminatory bans.   Now, that day, I was in my first month here in Congress, when the  Muslim ban was passed. I rushed to the airport, along with our chairman  and many other Members of Congress. We worked with attorneys to file  the national lawsuits that called for an emergency petition that  blocked the President's order from taking effect.   We were also able, at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, to go  onto the tarmac and stop a plane from taking off because of an  emergency habeas from a judge there that allowed us to get two people  back in who should have been here in the first place.   Madam Speaker, just imagine the hearts and souls of people whose  lives were thrown into chaos, thinking that they were going to land in  the United States with valid travel documents and then were turned away  by a President who issued a Muslim ban. The reason we need this bill is  to make sure that that can never happen again.   Madam Speaker, yes, we want to protect America's values. We believe  that the way to do that is to pass the NO BAN Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman so much for his  tremendous leadership on helping to bring this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Access to Counsel Act.   It is the Access to Counsel Act. I don't know if my friends on the  other side have heard that. I am not sure how access to counsel helps  empower cartels. I am not sure if my colleagues on the other side have  read the bill. This does not fund counsel, and it actually doesn't give  a right to counsel. We could debate that in another bill. This gives  access to counsel.   It brings us one step closer to upholding our country's principles of  due process and fairness by ensuring that individuals with lawful  status have the right to call a lawyer and receive assistance if they  are detained at ports of entry or in airports.   So why did this bill come about?   The Access to Counsel Act was the very first bill I introduced as a  Member of Congress in 2017 in response to President Donald Trump's  Muslim ban. On the day that Donald Trump announced that ban, I rushed  to my local airport in Seattle. What I encountered and what we saw at  airports across the Nation was a sham of our democracy.   People from seven Muslim-majority countries--all with legal access to  be in the United States--suddenly found themselves held for upwards of  30 hours, deported, and in some cases pressured to sign papers giving  up their legal status without even the ability to call an attorney or a  family member.   I then reintroduced, again, the Access to Counsel Act in my second  term, in January of 2020, after Customs and Border Protection targeted  Iranian Americans at ports of entry. As many as 200 Iranian Americans  were held in secondary screening in Blaine, Washington.   Negah Hekmati and her two children were detained for nearly 6 hours  despite being U.S. citizens and despite having preclearance for  expedited processing at the border that is specifically for approved,  low-risk travelers.                                time  1415    She recalls her small children begging her not to speak Farsi in fear  of being detained. At such a young age, her children, U.S. citizens,  already recognized that they were being profiled and unjustly held  because of their heritage.   Of course, when we raised this in the moment, Border Patrol said:  That is not happening. We can't do that. We wouldn't do that. We are  not doing that.   Well, it took over a year and suing the government in order to access  documents from Customs and Border Protection for us to find out that  the total number of people held was 227 people. Half of those people  were U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, half of the 227. The  rest of them had legal paperwork to come into the country.   So, why were they held? They were held because of their Iranian  heritage or ties to the Middle East. Later, we also found out that  there was no attempt from Border Patrol to figure out why they were  there, whether they should be there, or to even comply with the law  that says that your country of origin cannot be the sole purpose that  you are held.   If Republicans want to talk about wasting Border Patrol resources,  let's talk about the fact that 227 people, half of whom were U.S.  citizens and legal permanent residents and the rest with valid visas,  were held in a Border Patrol station in Blaine, Washington, for almost  12 hours and unable to leave. That is called detention.   You have now turned the Border Patrol stations into detention  facilities. That is not what we are supposed to do. Why is it so  difficult to say: Yes, a phone call is permissible.   That is what this bill is trying to do.   Throughout the last administration, we saw dozens of Iranian students  with valid visas having their visas revoked or being deported upon  arrival to the United States simply because of their country of origin.  The Access to Counsel Act would ensure that people who have already  been vetted and granted lawful status have a meaningful opportunity to  call an attorney, have a  [[Page H2019]]  meaningful opportunity to call a relative or other interested party,  like a Member of Congress, when they get held for more than an hour in  secondary inspection.   This is a commonsense measure, Mr. Speaker, to make sure that our  Nation treats those who are arriving to our country, whether it is  green card holders who have made their home here in the United States;  visa holders working, studying, or traveling to the United States; or  U.S. citizens who happen to have been identified with a different  country of origin for some reason, let's make sure we treat everybody  with dignity and respect.   I am so proud to be passing the Access to Counsel Act today,  alongside the No BAN Act, to put an end to some of the most cruel and  discriminatory policies adopted by the previous administration and to  make sure that they never happen again.
