 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about what  our tax reform and tax relief legislation actually does.   I want to start by welcoming in advance the President of the United  States to Pennsylvania. The President is going to Pittsburgh, PA, to  talk about the specifics of our tax reform and the effect it is having.  I really wish I could be there with him, but we don't know when we are  going to finish up here, as the President knows very well. We might be  here well into the evening, and I have multiple obligations to which I  have long been committed in addition to juggling that. Unfortunately, I  will not be able to get to Pittsburgh with the President, but I hope to  have another opportunity to celebrate this victory for Pennsylvanians  and Americans because that is what it is.   When we set out to accomplish the biggest tax reform in at least 31  years, we had two big goals.   The first was to make sure we implemented a direct tax cut for  working families, for middle-income families, and for the overwhelming  majority of families and individuals whom we all represent. That was  goal No. 1--to make sure we cut taxes for the people who are working  every day, living paycheck to paycheck, working hard, and making  America what it is. That was item No. 1.   The second thing we wanted to do was to reform what was a completely  archaic, unbelievably complicated, inefficient, and really terrible  business tax code that had become arguably one of the very worst in the  world and one that was systematically discouraging investment in the  United States.   So those were the two goals--direct tax relief for ordinary Americans  and making the business tax code competitive. I am thrilled to be able  to say that I believe we achieved both goals.   First of all, it is a simple, straightforward, factual matter that we  cut taxes on the vast, overwhelming majority of taxpayers--the families  and individuals who pay taxes. That is just a factual matter. That is  easy to confirm. Of course, that has the effect of increasing the take- home pay for anybody who is working. You can increase your take-home  pay by either getting a raise from your employer or by paying fewer  taxes on what you earn or both, and we knew for sure that we were  cutting taxes and that there was going to be a take-home pay increase.   I predicted at the time that we would also be creating an environment  in which there would be upward pressure on wages, where over time we  would start to see people getting bonuses, pay rate increases, and wage  increases because we would be creating a dynamic in which employers  would be competing more and more for workers so that, in effect, they  would be bidding up the compensation for the workers. That is what I  predicted, and I was confident that would happen within some number of  months or a year or so. So I had to come down to the floor today and  confess that I was wrong--very wrong--about the timing of that. You  see, we didn't have to wait 3 or 6 or 12 months for our constituents-- the people whom we represent--to see the benefits in the form of higher  wages. They started happening immediately--I mean, within days. It has  actually been stunning.   It has been about 1 month since we passed this sweeping tax reform,  and many hundreds of businesses--those cumulatively employing well over  2 million workers--have announced bonuses, wage increases, expanded  benefits, and increased contributions to pension accounts. They have  cited the tax reform as the mechanism that has enabled them to do this  for their workers.   What is so exciting about this is that this is happening even before  the wave of new investments has even been able to begin. This is  happening because companies know that with lower tax rates, they are  going to have more free cash flow. They are going to use some of that  to invest in growing their business, but they have already announced  that they are using some of that to enhance the compensation of their  employees.   Let me give you some examples. These are just Pennsylvania-related  companies, a handful of the ones I am aware of. It is typical of  companies across the country. Comcast, a big employer based in  Philadelphia, announced specifically that as a result of the tax  reform, they would make a $1,000 bonus payment to 100,000 frontline  nonexecutive employees, and they committed to $50 billion of capital  expenditure over the next 5 years. How many tens of thousands of jobs  is all of that capital expenditure going to support? It is a big  number.   That is not all. Out in Pittsburgh, PNC Financial Services, a  substantial large bank in Pittsburgh, announced right after the tax  reform that they would pay $1,000 to 47,500 of their employees, and, in  addition, they would contribute $1,500 to each of their employees for  participating in their pension savings plans. They are also raising  their base wage. Their minimum wage for employees at PNC goes up to $15  an hour. No Federal Government edict is forcing them to do it. This is  what they want to do. It is so that they can attract more and  competitive employees. They have also increased their contribution to  their charitable foundation--$200 million to a charitable foundation  that supports early childhood education. That is PNC.   Navient has 900 or so employees in Wilkes-Barre, PA, and they  announced that they are giving a $1,000 bonus to their non-officer  employees--98 percent of their employees. That is not the top brass,  but everybody else is going to get a $1,000 bonus.   Customers Bank in Wyomissing, Berks County, PA, announced that as a  result of the tax reform and the tax relief they are getting, they are  going to be able to offer people who have a checking account with them  a higher rate on their deposits. In another benefit for consumers, they  are going to increase their charitable giving.   NexTier Bank in Butler County, in Western Pennsylvania, is giving a  $1,000 bonus to all their employees.   As to Walmart, I think we all saw that. There are Walmart employees  in every State of the Union, and there certainly are in Pennsylvania.  There are over 160 Walmart locations in Pennsylvania. They are giving a  bonus of up to $1,000, raising their starting wage, expanding their  paid leave policy, and their adoption assistance program for their  employees, all in response to the tax relief and reform that they know  is going to be good for their business, and they already decided to  make it good for their employees as well.   That is just a small handful of the companies that I know of in  Pennsylvania that have made public announcements about this. How many  more are there across the country? It is a huge number, and it is  growing rapidly, and it is fantastic.   I think it is fantastic. I think it is fantastic when the people I  represent are able to earn more to support their family, get a bigger  bonus and get a bonus they might not otherwise have gotten at all.   I know this view is not universally shared. The House Minority Leader  [[Page S235]]  Pelosi doesn't think very much of this. In fact, she said: ``In terms  of the bonus that corporate America received versus the crumbs that  they are giving to workers to kind of put a schmooze on--it's so  pathetic . . . I think it's insignificant.''   I have to state that I don't think it is pathetic, and I don't think  it is insignificant. I think to a family that is struggling, a family  that is working hard, a family that may be living paycheck-to-paycheck,  as most families do, these are not crumbs. This makes a difference. For  the people who wonder, because they heard so much from our colleagues  on the other side that this is not going to help middle-class families,  any mystery that people may think surrounds this will be resolved very  soon because the IRS has already released new withholding guidelines.  The Treasury has done their evaluation, and they have concluded as the  Joint Tax Committee concluded, that over 90 percent of all individuals  and families filing and paying taxes will see a tax cut. So they are  adjusting the withholding table so that the take-home pay goes up and  so that the money that workers pay to Uncle Sam goes down.   Honestly, I have to state that I am convinced that the best in all of  this is yet to come. The best is yet to come because it is too early  for us to have yet benefitted from the wave of new capital investment.  We have made it more affordable for businesses to invest in their  workers, to invest in their businesses, and to invest here in America  rather than overseas. We have made that more affordable so more is  going to happen, and when it happens, people are going to get the  benefits from the jobs they have to provide those capital goods. Other  people are going to benefits from jobs that are necessary to operate  that capital equipment. Wages will rise because workers will become  more productive. This is what is in store for us, and this is what is  so exciting.   It is not just my theorizing on this. Last week the CEO of PNC, Bill  Demchak, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal. He said:         For all the investment decisions that companies make, the       U.S. just got that much more attractive. . . . It's going to       win more than it won before in terms of where people choose       to do business activity and invest.    I couldn't agree more. This is clearly going to be the result. We are  allowing American businesses to compete and to win in a competitive  global economy. This is going to increase the supply of capital. It is  going to increase the productive capacity of the American economy. It  is going to provide better tools for workers when they have that  capital that they can work with that makes them more productive. That  enables them to earn higher wages, and with all the need for more  workers that this is going to generate, it is going to continue to put  upward pressure on wages, because that is what companies are going to  have to do in order to attract and retain the employees they need.   So I would say that I think we are well on our way to seeing the  fruits of this reform. I think it is going to be extremely  constructive. I am thrilled that our legislation has already begun to  have tangible benefits for the people we represent, and I am convinced  that the best is yet to come.   I yield the floor.
