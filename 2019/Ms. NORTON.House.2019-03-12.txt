(d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this Act.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Electronic Message  Preservation Act. This bill would update the Federal Records Act and  the Presidential Records Act to ensure that agencies save records  created through electronic messages, including emails. This bill would  require the Archivist of the United States to issue regulations  [[Page H2667]]  mandating that all Federal agencies manage and preserve their email  records electronically.   Agencies are already supposed to be saving emails electronically. In  2012, the Archivist and the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget issued a directive that required agencies to do so. This bill  would help ensure that email records from Federal agencies and the  White House are all preserved.   According to a September 2018 report from the National Archives and  Records Administration, approximately 35 percent of agencies continue  to print and file hard copies of email messages. This means that these  records are more likely to get lost, and they are harder for the agency  to retrieve during records searches under the Freedom of Information  Act.   This bill would put into statute what agencies are already required  to do under a directive issued by the Archivist and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget in 2012. Agencies are required, under  the directive, to save all permanent electronic records electronically  by the end of 2019. Putting this requirement to save email records  electronically into statute would show agencies to take this issue  seriously.   This bill would also require the Archivist to establish standards for  the preservation and management of Presidential email records and to  certify, annually, that the White House has records management controls  in place that meet those standards. The Archivist would be required,  under this legislation, to report 1 year after the President leaves  office on whether the controls used by the President met the required  standards.   This bill has been introduced and passed by the House under multiple  administrations. This is not a partisan bill for sure. It is a good  government bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If anything, I am surprised, perhaps shocked, that we have had to put  the matter of electronic recordkeeping into statutory form to make sure  it has happened.   We are deep into the electronic era, and perhaps, when you put a  matter into statutory form, it finally is a matter of law and it gets  people's attention. I certainly hope so.   Madam Speaker, I am prepared to yield back unless the gentleman has  something more to say.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1608) to amend the Federal Advisory Committee Act to  increase the transparency of Federal advisory committees, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1608         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H2668]]            SECTION 1.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Federal Advisory  Committee Act Amendments.   Representative Lacy Clay, my good friend from Missouri, has  introduced this bill each Congress for a decade now. The bill passed in  each of the previous two Congresses, and it passed the House last year  without opposition.   The Federal Advisory Committee Act was originally enacted in 1972. It  is intended to ensure that committees that provide advice to Federal  agencies and the President operate with transparency.   The bill we are considering today would strengthen FACA to make  Federal advisory committees more transparent and to make agencies more  accountable in how they select members for these committees.   Agencies often avoid the requirements of FACA by conducting advisory  committee business through subcommittees. This bill makes it clear that  FACA applies to subcommittees as well as parent committees. The bill  also clarifies that a committee set up by a contractor is subject to  FACA if it is formed under direction of the President or an agency.   Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments, agencies would  be required to disclose how advisory members are chosen and whether  they have financial conflicts of interest. They would also be required  to disclose if they are appointed to provide their own expertise and  who they work for if they are representing a specific interest.   Last Congress, this legislation was approved without opposition by  the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the  Senate. Chairman Ron Johnson and his staff were very helpful in pushing  this bill through the Senate.   The bill we are considering today includes changes made following  negotiations we engaged in during the process. These are changes to  address concerns raised last Congress by the Department of Health and  Human Services and technical corrections from the General Services  Administration.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, March 11, 2019.      Hon. Elijah Cummings,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Reform,      Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cummings: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 1608, ``Federal Advisory       Committee Act Amendments of 2019,'' the Committee on Ways and       Means agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as to       provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1608.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       1608, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2019.       As you know, the bill was referred primarily to the Committee       on Oversight and Reform, with an additional referral to the       Committees on Ways and Means.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Ways and Means to       be discharged from further consideration of the bill to       expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no way       affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Ways and Means represented on the conference committee.        I would be pleased to include this letter in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration in order to       memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                Elijah E. Cummings,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I must say that my friend from Missouri has been indefatigable in  trying to get this bill passed. It looks like it received some notice,  at least the last time, in the Senate.   I have joked with my friend that maybe if he got somebody else to  introduce it, we could get the bill passed. But he keeps trying. If at  first you don't succeed--   I believe that because he has understood that these advisory  committees are very important and sometimes amount to enacting  legislation, so important are some of them to our process, that he has  to keep plugging away until we get it done. I thank him for doing so.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1654) to amend title 44, United States Code, to modernize  the Federal Register, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1654         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(g) Code of Federal Regulations Amendment.--Section 1510 of       title 44, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``Sec. 1510. Code of Federal Regulations         ``(a) Special Edition for Codification of Agency       Documents.--The Administrative Committee of the Federal       Register, with the approval of the President, may require,       from time to time as it considers necessary, the preparation       and publication in a special edition of the Federal Register       a complete codification of the documents of each agency of       the Government having general applicability and legal effect,       issued or promulgated by the agency by publication in the       Federal Register or by filing with the Administrative       Committee, and which are relied upon by the agency as       authority for, or are invoked or used by it in the discharge       of, its activities or functions, and are in effect as to       facts arising on or after dates specified by the       Administrative Committee.        ``(b) Code of Federal Regulations.--A codification prepared       under subsection (a) of this section shall be published and       shall be designated as the `Code of Federal Regulations'. The       Administrative Committee shall regulate the manner and forms       of publishing this codification.        ``(c) Supplementation, Collation, and Republication.--The       Administrative Committee shall regulate the supplementation       and the collation and republication of the codification with       a view to keeping the Code of Federal Regulations as current       as practicable. Each unit of codification shall be       supplemented and republished at least once each calendar       year. The Office of the Federal Register may create updates       of each unit of codification from time to time and make the       same available electronically or may provide public access       using an electronic edition that allows a user to select a       specific date and retrieve the version of the codification in       effect as of that date.        ``(d) Preparation and Publication by the Federal       Register.--The Office of the Federal Register shall prepare       and publish the codifications, supplements, collations,       indices, and user aids authorized by this section.        ``(e) Prima Facie Evidence.--The codified documents of the       several agencies published in the Code of Federal Regulations       under this section, as amended by documents subsequently       filed with the Office and published in the daily issues of       the Federal Register, shall be prima facie evidence of the       text of the documents and of the fact that they are in effect       on and after the date of publication.        ``(f) Regulations.--The Administrative Committee, with       approval of the President, shall issue regulations for       carrying out this section.        ``(g) Exception.--This section does not require       codification of the text of Presidential documents published       and periodically compiled in supplements to title 3 of the       Code of Federal Regulations.''.        (h) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--The table of       sections for chapter 15 of title 44, United States Code, is       amended by striking the items related to sections 1502, 1503,       and 1504 and inserting the following:  ``1502. Custody and publishing of Federal documents; appointment of                Director. ``1503. Filing documents with Office; notation of time; public                inspection; transmission for publishing. ``1504. `Federal Register'; publishing; contents; distribution;                price.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1654, the Federal Register Modernization Act, is a good- government bill that will reduce waste and save taxpayer money. I thank  my good friend from North Carolina, Representative Meadows, for his  work on this important measure.   The bill would modernize the Federal Register to take advantage of  modern technology and increase efficiency. The bill would give the  Office of the Federal Register the flexibility to publish the Federal  Register electronically.   It also allows agencies to stop sending unnecessary paper copies of  documents when they send materials to be published in the Federal  Register. That one step alone could save significant sums of money that  could be used more efficiently to address the needs of the American  public.   H.R. 1654 also makes certain technical changes, of course, to a  statute that was originally written in 1935 and does need some  updating.   This is exactly the kind of legislation Congress should be passing.  It is bipartisan; it is noncontroversial; and it would make modest  improvements to bring the Federal Government into the digital age so  that information is more accessible to the public.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I think it should be noted that all the bill does is  give flexibility, flexibility to publish the Federal Register  electronically, so I suspect that there will still be paper copies.   But apparently, the Office of the Federal Register doesn't think it  can go online with the Federal Register, so that is very disturbing  this late into the digital age.   I regard this bill, the bill of my good friend, I regard it as not  prescient, because it should have happened a long time ago, but  absolutely necessary, and I commend him for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I am prepared to yield back. Unless my good friend has  something further today, I yield back the balance of my time.
