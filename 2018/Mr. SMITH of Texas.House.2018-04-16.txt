 Mr. Speaker, Morning Consult recently asked  Americans about their views of television's political bias.   Respondents were four times as likely to say television programs  present a more liberal perspective than a conservative one. The liberal  media, including Hollywood studios, have dismissed the views of most  Americans. They portray American life in their own liberal image. News  reports, movies, and TV shows reflect the liberal leanings of the media  producers, not most American's values.   To be fair and balanced, the media should represent American families  and their values, not just the producers' political and cultural  philosophy.                            ____________________
