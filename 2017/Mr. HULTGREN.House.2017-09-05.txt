 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3110) to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to modify  the term of the independent member of the Financial Stability Oversight  Council.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3110         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Stability       Oversight Council Insurance Member Continuity Act''.       SEC. 2. FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL.         Section 111(c) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12       U.S.C. 5321(c)) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(4) Term of independent member.--Notwithstanding       paragraph (1), if a successor to the independent member of       the Council serving under subsection (b)(1)(J) is not       appointed and confirmed by the end of the term of service of       such member, such member may continue to serve until the       earlier of--        ``(A) 18 months after the date on which the term of service       ends; or        ``(B) the date on which a successor to such member is       appointed and confirmed.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3110, the Financial  Stability Oversight Council Insurance Member Continuity Act. I am proud  to sponsor this legislation, which is a technical, but extremely  important, correction to the Dodd-Frank Act.   I am very grateful for the support of my colleagues on the Financial  Services Committee for helping advance this bill. I especially want to  thank Ranking Member Waters, the lead cosponsor. In fact, we were able  to unanimously report this bill out of committee 60 votes to zero when  it was marked up in July.   The bill amends the Dodd-Frank Act to allow the Financial Stability  Oversight Council's independent member with insurance expertise to  remain a voting member of the council beyond his or her term until a  successor is appointed. The extended term would conclude at the earlier  of either 18 months or until Senate confirmation of a successor.   The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, was created as  part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The general purpose of this regulatory body  is to provide a forum for discussion of our financial markets and  coordination of financial regulations when appropriate.   Under existing law, the 10 voting members of the FSOC include an  independent member with insurance expertise who is appointed by the  President and confirmed by the Senate. The independent member is the  only member appointed by the President to specifically serve on the  council and is the only voting member which is expected to have  insurance expertise.   Dodd-Frank established a 6-year term for the independent member whose  term expires on September 30, 2017. Absent the appointment and  confirmation of a successor, the expiration of the independent member's  term would leave the council without a voting member who has insurance  expertise because Dodd-Frank did not make clear if the position can be  filled by an acting official.   My legislation is about ensuring that the FSOC is able to benefit  from the perspective of a voting member with insurance expertise  without any unnecessary lapses, or to quote a letter that the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners sent to the ranking member and  me: ``It is important that the council have members that have a deep  understanding of the unique aspects of the insurance industry and our  State-based insurance regulatory system.''   I couldn't agree more. In the case of Illinois, we have a very robust  insurance market because of the carefully crafted regulatory system we  have developed. This allows great companies to thrive and protects the  interests of their policyholders. This might not be the case if the  FSOC lacks sufficient understanding of our insurance markets and  regulatory system.   What was not intended by Dodd-Frank is for the position to be vacant  while the President and Senate work to confirm a new appointee. Other  voting positions on the FSOC have the benefit of somebody being able to  serve in an acting capacity until someone new is confirmed. In fact,  the Dodd-Frank Act clearly states that positions on the FSOC can be  filled by someone in an acting capacity.  [[Page H6638]]    My legislation would simply bring continuity with other FSOC voting  members.   This is especially timely given that the term of the individual  currently filling this position, Roy Woodall, ends on September 30 of  this year. Since President Trump has not yet announced who should fill  this role, and given that the Senate will not likely have sufficient  time to react between now and the end of September, we must have this  signed into law without delay.   I understand that the Senate Banking Committee will be marking up  companion legislation later this week, and I am hopeful it can quickly  advance through this Chamber and the Senate Chamber so that this  technical issue can be resolved before the end of Mr. Woodall's term.   I again would like to thank Ranking Member Waters and all of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working with me. I urge  support of this noncontroversial legislation, and I am hopeful it can  move swiftly to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I echo much of what my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) has  said. Again, I want to thank the ranking member for her work on this  legislation with me.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1616) to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Bob Dole, in  recognition for his service to the nation as a soldier, legislator, and  statesman.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1616         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bob Dole Congressional Gold       Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Bob Dole was born on July 22, 1923, in Russell, Kansas.        (2) Growing up during the Great Depression, Bob Dole       learned the values of hard work and discipline, and worked at       a local drug store.        (3) In 1941, Bob Dole enrolled at the University of Kansas       as a pre-medical student. During his time at KU he played for       the basketball, football, and track teams, and joined the       Kappa Sigma Fraternity, from which he would receive the ``Man       of the Year'' award in 1970.        (4) Bob Dole's collegiate studies were interrupted by WWII,       and he enlisted in the United States Army. During a military       offensive in Italy, he was seriously wounded while trying to       save a fellow soldier. Despite his grave injuries, Dole       recovered and was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star       with an Oak Cluster for his service. He also received an       American Campaign Medal, a European-African-Middle Eastern       Campaign Medal, and a World War II Victory Medal.        (5) While working on his law degree from Washburn       University, Bob Dole was elected into the Kansas House of       Representatives, serving from 1951-1953.        (6) Bob Dole was elected into the U.S. House of       Representatives and served two Kansas districts from 1961-      1969.        (7) In 1969, Bob Dole was elected into the U.S. Senate and       served until 1996. Over the course of this period, he served       as Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chairman of       the Finance Committee, Senate Minority Leader, and Senate       Majority Leader.        (8) Bob Dole was known for his ability to work across the       aisle and embrace practical bipartisanship on issues such as       Social Security.        (9) Bob Dole has been a life-long advocate for the disabled       and was a key figure in the passing of the Americans with       Disabilities Act in 1990.        (10) After his appointment as Majority Leader, Bob Dole set       the record as the nation's longest-serving Republican Leader       in the Senate.        (11) Several Presidents of the United States have specially       honored Bob Dole for his hard work and leadership in the       public sector. This recognition is exemplified by the       following:        (A) President Reagan awarded Bob Dole the Presidential       Citizens Medal in 1989 stating, ``Whether on the battlefield       or Capitol Hill, Senator Dole has served America heroically.       Senate Majority Leader during one of the most productive       Congresses of recent time, he has also been a friend to       veterans, farmers, and Americans from every walk of life. Bob       Dole has stood for integrity, straight talk and achievement       throughout his years of distinguished public service.''.        (B) Upon awarding Bob Dole with the Presidential Medal of       Freedom in 1997, President Clinton made the following       comments, ``Son of the soil, citizen, soldier and legislator,       Bob Dole understands the American people, their struggles,       their triumphs and their dreams . . . In times of conflict       and crisis, he has worked to keep America united and strong .       . . our country is better for his courage, his determination,       and his willingness to go the long course to lead America.''.        (12) After his career in public office, Bob Dole became an       active advocate for the public good. He served as National       Chairman of the World War II Memorial Campaign, helping raise       over $197 million to construct the National WWII Memorial,       and as Co-Chair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund,       raising over $120 million for the educational needs of the       families of victims of 9/11.        (13) From 1997-2001, Bob Dole served as chairman of the       International Commission on Missing Persons in the Former       Yugoslavia.        (14) In 2003, Bob Dole established The Robert J. Dole       Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas to       encourage bipartisanship in politics.        (15) Bob Dole is a strong proponent of international       justice and, in 2004, received the Golden Medal of Freedom       from the President of Kosovo for his support of democracy and       freedom in Kosovo.        (16) In 2007, President George W. Bush appointed Bob Dole       to co-chair the President's Commission on Care for America's       Returning  [[Page H6639]]       Wounded Warriors, which inspected the system of medical care       received by U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq and       Afghanistan.        (17) Bob Dole was the co-creator of the McGovern-Dole       International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program,       helping combat child hunger and poverty. In 2008, he was co-      awarded the World Food Prize for his work with this       organization.        (18) Bob Dole is co-founder of the Bipartisan Policy Center       which works to develop policies suitable for bipartisan       support.        (19) Bob Dole is a strong advocate for veterans, having       volunteered on a weekly basis for more than a decade on       behalf of the Honor Flight Network.        (20) Bob Dole serves as Finance Chairman of the Campaign       for the National Eisenhower Memorial, leading the private       fundraising effort to memorialize President Dwight D.       Eisenhower in Washington, DC.        (21) Bob Dole was acknowledged by many organizations for       his achievements both inside and outside of politics,       including being awarded the ``U.S. Senator John Heinz Award       for Outstanding Public Service By An Elected Official'', the       Gold Good Citizenship Award, the American Patriot Award, the       Survivor's Gratitude Award, the U.S. Association of Former       Member of Congress Distinguished Service Award, a       Distinguished Service Medal, the French Legion of Honor       medal, the Horatio Alger Award, the U.S. Defense Department's       Distinguished Public Service Award, the National Collegiate       Athletic Association's Teddy Roosevelt Award, the Albert       Schweitzer Medal ``for outstanding contributions to animal       welfare'', the 2004 Sylvanus Thayer Award, and honorary       degrees from the University of Kansas, Fort Hays State       University, and the University of New Hampshire School of       Law.        (22) Throughout his life-long service to our country, Bob       Dole has embodied the American spirit of leadership and       determination, and serves as one of the most prolific role       models both in and outside of politics.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Bob       Dole, in recognition for his service to the nation as a       soldier, legislator, and statesman.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a       gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions       to be determined by the Secretary.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck under section 3 under such regulations       as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to       cover the cost thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use       of machinery, and overhead expenses, and the cost of the gold       medal.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         (a) National Medals.--The medals struck under this Act are       national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31,       United States Code.        (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and       5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under       this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, statesman, member of the Greatest Generation, lifetime  public servant--these are fitting words as we consider S. 1616,  unanimously passed legislation to honor Senator Bob Dole with a  Congressional Gold Medal.   The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest expression of national  appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions that the  Congress can bestow upon one of our fellow citizens.   I would like to thank Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins and the 86  bipartisan cosponsors for coming together to introduce this legislation  to honor Bob Dole.   Recipients of the Congressional Gold Medal ``have performed an  achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is  likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient's field  long after the achievement.''   For Bob Dole's lifetime of public service--as a soldier wounded in  battle; State legislator; United States Representative; United States  Senator; nominee for both President and Vice President; tireless  advocate for the disabled, our veterans, and the hungry--awarding this  great American with a Congressional Gold Medal is the least we can do  today. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank my friend,  the ranking member, Maxine Waters, for her kind words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms.  Jenkins), sponsor of the House companion legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Yoder).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I also have no further requests for time,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2864) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to  allow certain issuers to be exempt from registration requirements, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2864         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF EXEMPTION.         The Securities and Exchange Commission shall amend--        (1) section 230.251 of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations, to remove the requirement that the issuer not be       subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act       of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) immediately before the       offering; and        (2) section 230.257 of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations, with respect to an offering described in section       230.251(a)(2) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to       deem any issuer that is subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the       Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as having met the periodic       and current reporting requirements of section 230.257 of       title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, if such issuer meets       the reporting requirements of section 13 of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2864, the Improving  Access to Capital Act. I want to start by thanking the Democrat and the  Republican who are the chief sponsors of this bill, the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Hollingsworth). It is always a pleasure to bring good bipartisan  legislation to the House floor, especially when the bill is sponsored  by my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee.   To continue this job growth and ensure that we have a stronger and  healthier economy with opportunities for all Americans, we must  encourage small business growth, and this starts with ensuring that  they have access to the capital and credit that they need to grow.   This bipartisan bill will help the American economy. It will make it  easier for companies, particularly small businesses, to access capital.  This is incredibly important because small businesses are the heart and  soul of the American economy.   In fact, they help to create more than 60 percent of the Nation's net  new jobs over the past 2 decades. This bipartisan bill before us today  carries forward the mission of another bipartisan bill, the JOBS Act of  2012, to increase capital formation in our U.S. markets so more  American workers would be able to find good paying jobs.   As part of the JOBS Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission was  directed to expand something called Regulation A, which is a critical  tool for companies that are trying to raise small amounts of money. And  the aptly named ``Regulation A-Plus'' the SEC came up with has been  effective.   With Regulation A-Plus, prospective issuers have publicly filed 147  offerings seeking up to $2.6 billion in financing. As a comparison, in  the 12 months leading up to Regulation A-Plus, there were only about 50  filings seeking to raise $159 million.  [[Page H6642]]    As we are seeing, Regulation A-Plus has opened up an avenue for these  small companies to seek financing through the capital markets that will  help grow their businesses.   And according to the SEC, these companies are small, early-stage  businesses with median assets of $100,000 in limited collateral, which  often restricts their ability to obtain a bank loan or other financing.   Unfortunately, not all are able to benefit from Regulation A-Plus. As  part of its final rule implementing the JOBS Act, the SEC excluded some  small companies. This was contrary to the intent of Congress when we  approved the JOBS Act.   As a result of the SEC's final rule, some smaller and midsize  companies have been shut out from the benefits of Regulation A-Plus.   Additionally, smaller investors also suffer by not having the  opportunity to participate in the public markets for early-stage  companies and share in their growth.   H.R. 2864 is a simple bill that fixes the problem I just described.  H.R. 2864 would amend Regulation A-Plus to direct the SEC to include  companies that are fully reporting under the Securities Exchange Act.  This will help more small businesses gain access to capital so they can  grow and hire more workers. At the same time, it will give small  investors greater investment opportunities.   H.R. 2864 was approved by the Financial Services Committee with the  overwhelming support of both Republicans and Democrats. In fact, the  vote in committee to favorably report H.R. 2864 was 59-0.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 2864, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), a sponsor of this legislation and a member  of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6643]]         Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Congresswoman Sinema and  Congressman Hollingsworth for their great work on this. This is an  important step that will help our small businesses access the capital  that they need to grow and to hire more workers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support on this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
