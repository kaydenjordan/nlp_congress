 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to defend our democracy.   In this Chamber, we debate the Nation's most pressing issues, and  often, reasonable people can draw different conclusions. But not today.   The facts are black and white. President Trump abused the power of  his office for personal and political gain, and then he engaged in a  coverup. It is up to us to confront those facts and vote to preserve  and protect our democratic Republic.   This is not a fight I or my colleagues sought out when we ran for  Congress, but it is one we pledged when we raised our right hand and  swore an oath to defend our Constitution.   Anything other than a vote to impeach will be read as a vote  endorsing a future President without rules or consequences, an  ``anything goes, no holds barred'' brand of executive branch authority  that will leave us weaker and surely undermine what the Framers passed  down.   We owe it to future generations to transcend personal interests and  party loyalty and to vote our conscience for what is really at stake  here today, the sanctity of our Constitution and the sanctity of our  democracy.
