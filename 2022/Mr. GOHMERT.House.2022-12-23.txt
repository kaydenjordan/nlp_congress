 Mr. Speaker, look, 4,155 pages, and that doesn't include  the couple of thousand pages of explanation, definition, and all this  other stuff.   At least with ObamaCare, 2,500 pages, we had time to go through it. I  did. I read it, highlighted, made notes. This is 4,155 pages, and we  haven't had a chance.   Well, the House rules make sure that you can't shove a bill through  without people knowing what is in it, and that is the rule that  requires that the bill be read. But the majority, for a few days more,  decided we don't want people to know what is in it; and as the Speaker  previously famously said, we have got to pass it and find out what is  in it.   That is why the majority in the Rules Committee, in this rule, said,  we consider it as already read because we don't want you to know what  is in that. That is dangerous because there is so much garbage.   There are people struggling, maxing out credit cards to get gasoline,  and this bill is going to do for inflation--well, I won't go there, but  it is going to do a lot of damage for inflation; and people that can  least afford it will be harmed tremendously by the callous treatment  that the rules of the House have gotten and that the people that are  hurting across America are getting.   It should be voted down, and we should have time to look at exactly  what is being given away.
