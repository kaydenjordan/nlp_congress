 Madam Speaker, I rise today to reflect on  the promise of America.   What is the promise of America? What has it meant for us? And what  does it mean for us today?   America has been around for a few hundred years. That is really not  that long. In that short time, our dreams have informed the  imaginations of people around the globe.   It all started when our Founding Fathers drafted and signed the  Declaration of Independence. It set us on a path for our Nation to be  the greatest experiment in self-governance that the world has ever  known. Our Founders were our first innovators who risked it all for  America to be free.   I am sure there are times when we have fallen short, but our  experiment has been overwhelmingly for the good. It is here in America  that we have led and cultivated history's greatest breakthroughs. We  fought a war to end slavery. We liberated Europe from the Nazis. We  invented flight; put men on the Moon; split the atom; and invented the  microchip, the internet, and more.   At great expense, all this was accomplished by maintaining fleets and  armies for America to be a beacon of hope for freedom-loving people  around the world. We have done more to lift people out of poverty and  raise the standard of living than any nation in the history of the  world.   Madam Speaker, I am sure our Founders never dreamed that any of this  would be possible, but it was because they made their vision for  America a reality rooted in the promise that our rights are self- evident, sacred, and undeniable.   America was born with purpose. It says it right here in the  Declaration of Independence. We all know the words, or at least we  should know the words: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with  certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the  pursuit of Happiness.''   These are more than just words. It is a faith statement, a  distinctive national credo. The moment we fail to believe it, the  experiment is over and this Nation will fade away like all nation- states that have lost belief in themselves and forgotten their  identity.   If we forget our purpose and let the promise of America be broken,  then we are lost. The future is lost.   It is our job and our highest responsibility to transmit the promise  of America to our children and to all who are a part of this great  experiment. It is not enough that we merely assert these as ideas. We  must live them as truths and show the world that they work.   America is where freedom has made its greatest mark. It is where  creativity is unmatched by any time in history. It is where justice  flowers more generously than anyplace on Earth.   The torch must be passed to the next generation. That is what  President John F. Kennedy said, and, Madam Speaker, we must do just  that.   I will keep coming back to this floor, to the people's House, to make  this case that the promise of America is for every person in our  country.   There is a battle going on right now for the heart and soul of  America, so it is worth repeating that we must never forget our  purpose. That is what unites us as Americans, and it is where I find  hope that we can come together around shared values that built our  great Nation.   I am committed more than ever to restore trust and confidence in the  promise of America. It is a promise that will keep us free, empower our  children in the next generation to shine, and strengthen the moral  fabric where our identity rests.                            ____________________
