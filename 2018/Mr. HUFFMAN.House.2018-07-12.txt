 Mr. Speaker, finally, Scott Pruitt is gone.   After months of scandal, 19 separate investigations, countless  ethical failures, abuses of his official office at taxpayer expense,  finally, this corrupt, swamp creature who has been heading our  Environmental Protection Agency announced his resignation last week.   As welcome as this news is for many of us, let's be clear: Scott  Pruitt was far from the only creature in the toxic Trump swamp.   Another great example is our Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, who  profited from short sales in a Russian-linked navigation company. He  made those short sales only after learning that journalists with The  New York Times were about to expose his conflicts of interest. And  apparently, while serving as our Commerce Secretary, Ross was also  partial owner of a Chinese company and a Cypriot bank that is a part of  Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.   These are scandals that, in any other previous time, would bring down  a Cabinet Secretary, but in this swamp climate of the Trump  administration, it is just another news cycle and is soon supplanted by  the next outrage and the next scandal.   Let's also not forget our Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, who  faces many of his own scandals. Our Secretary of the Interior, of  course, oversees oil and gas development on public lands. In this case,  the Secretary stands to personally benefit from a land deal with the  chairman of Halliburton, a company that has literally billions of  dollars of business on the line when Secretary Zinke makes decisions  about where, and how, oil drilling will be permitted in this country.   That is just the tip of the iceberg with this administration. It is  time for this Republican Congress to wake up and take these issues  seriously. Conduct some real oversight and put a stop to this culture  of corruption in the Trump administration.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is an attempt by my  Republican colleagues to approve one part of President Trump's so- called infrastructure plan.   H.R. 3281 would enact a proposal from the Trump infrastructure plan  that approves the de facto privatization of some of the public's most  important water infrastructure, without safeguards to protect the  American taxpayer or our natural heritage.   Now, you may remember, Mr. Speaker, that the Trump infrastructure  plan that was transmitted to Congress in February focuses much of its  attention on giving away the public's infrastructure to private  interests.   For example, the Trump plan calls for privatizing Western electricity  infrastructure, the Dulles International Airport, the Washington  Aqueduct, the George Washington and Baltimore Washington Parkways, and  much of the Tennessee Valley Authority.   This Trump yard sale of critical public infrastructure would raise  consumer costs and would enrich private interests, all while providing  no meaningful funding for much-needed public infrastructure  development.   Now, when it comes to the management of our public infrastructure, it  is clear that this administration and this Republican Congress would  simply rather sell it off than fix it. So today, we have before us the  proposal to dole out much of the public water infrastructure owned by  the United States, with virtually no strings attached.   Mr. Speaker, this may be how Mr. Trump liquidates real estate during  one of his infamous bankruptcies, but it is no way to manage public  infrastructure.   Now, the Bureau of Reclamation owns some of the most important public  water infrastructure in America, including hundreds of dams, canals,  and other associated infrastructure. Reclamation's infrastructure helps  deliver water to tens of millions of people, and it serves numerous  stakeholders, including municipal and industrial water users, farmers,  Tribes, fishermen, and environmental and recreational interests.    H.R. 3281 irresponsibly gives the Secretary of the Interior new  authority to transfer title, which is another term for relinquishing  ownership, to a broad range of reclamation water projects.   Now, this bill's proponents have claimed that it only expedites the  relinquishment of small and easy projects that the Federal Government  should no longer own. I wish that were the case.   Mr. Speaker, if that were actually the case, we would have a  bipartisan bill, and I would be standing here in support of it, because  I have supported title transfers for select, noncontroversial projects  when it made sense for taxpayers and the public. In cases of canals and  waterworks that don't affect water operations and diversions, and where  there is no significant opposition from Tribes or downstream users, it  does make sense, to me, for Congress to give the executive branch some  leeway to dispose of these facilities, as long as appropriate  safeguards are in place.   Unfortunately, the bill before us allows this administration to  unilaterally relinquish ownership of a very broad range of public water  projects without appropriate safeguards that should be there to make  sure taxpayers and other stakeholders are protected.   In fact, this bill is written so broadly that it would allow the  Secretary of the Interior to hand over multipurpose water projects that  have no business being owned by one water user.   Now, the fact is, many of Reclamation's water projects need to be  operated in a manner that balances difficult, conflicting interests.  Giving up ownership and control of that project, handing it over to a  single water user will, in some cases, result in significant harm to  the many other interests who have a stake in the operation of Federal  water projects.   I am also sorry to say that this bill is a bad deal for taxpayers. It  allows the Secretary of the Interior to hand over publicly owned  infrastructure and other Federal assets to private interests without  appropriate taxpayer compensation.   For example, it fails to require that taxpayers be compensated for  the loss of publicly owned lands and mineral interests. And whenever  the Federal Government gives away Federal assets, we should ensure that  taxpayers who paid for these assets are properly compensated. This bill  utterly fails on that score.   I must also point out that H.R. 3281 unwisely removes longstanding  and necessary congressional oversight for an overly broad range of  projects. Under existing law, Congress has responsibility to oversee  and approve the transfer of Federal water projects to ensure that  transfers are in the public interest.   This bill eliminates Congress' current oversight and approval  authority for a host of projects that deserve scrutiny before they are  given away--not after, but before they are given away. Congress should  think twice before it surrenders power and lets this administration  irresponsibly give away the public's infrastructure.   Before closing, I should also note that this bill is rightfully  opposed by numerous conservation organizations, including the Sierra  Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, Defenders of Wildlife, and  many others.   Conservation-minded Americans oppose this bill because transferring  ownership of Federal water projects to non-Federal operators will  frequently mean less protection for the environment. That is because  non-Federal water projects often don't have to be operated with the  same environmental protections that apply to water projects operated,  owned by Federal agencies.   For example, projects operated by Federal agencies must comply with  certain provisions in section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Those  same requirements would no longer apply if a water project was operated  by a non-Federal entity.   For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I request a ``no'' vote on this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it has been brought up that Vice President Al Gore  proposed, in certain instances, that title transfer might make sense.  That is correct.   But I have also acknowledged that I, myself, have proposed that, in  appropriate circumstances, title transfers can make sense. They can be  good for water users, for the taxpayers, and for other users as long as  the right safeguards are in place.  [[Page H6158]]    What we are really talking about here, though, is a bill that fails  to work in that narrowly tailored space that Al Gore and myself and  others have been willing to work. This bill does not include those  safeguards. This bill would not be limited to small, noncontroversial  projects. It could apply to very large multiuse projects, and it could  apply to those projects in ways that do not include safeguards to  protect other stakeholders and other interests. That is why we disagree  on this point.   Now, it has also been argued that because water districts have repaid  the Federal Government through water rates, somehow, that effectively  means they should have an entitlement to transfer of these facilities.   A couple points need to be emphasized here.   First, under reclamation law, water districts generally only pay a  fraction of the total cost to construct reclamation water projects. The  rest of these costs have been borne by taxpayers because the projects  were deemed to have public benefits, such as fish and wildlife  enhancement and recreation.    Given the billions spent by taxpayers on reclamation projects, it is  appropriate for the public to maintain ownership of projects,  especially in cases where title transfer could result in operational  changes that jeopardize those public benefits for which the public has  borne the cost.   Now, project construction costs that are borne by water districts are  further reduced by various taxpayer subsidies that should be part of  the equation, including federally subsidized, zero-interest financing,  power subsidies, and write-offs of debt owed to taxpayers that are  deemed beyond a water district's ``ability to pay'' under reclamation  law.   And then, finally, it is important to note that even water districts  who pay for this water over time, they still don't pay for any land  that might be appurtenant to these facilities. That land, under this  bill, would go along with the title transfer, and so would the mineral  rights underneath that land. These would be essentially bonus  subsidies, potentially, to these water districts without proper  compensation to the U.S. taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, we need to insist on the  safeguards that I and others, when we worked on this issue, have  proposed and that are so lacking, unfortunately, in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on my friend's point about privatization, let me just  clarify that, in many cases, water districts, certainly many of those  in California and many of those that serve agricultural interests in  the Central Valley, are comprised and governed by private agribusiness  owners and private landowners. They elect the board. They set the  agenda.   Further, by the terms of this bill, it allows transfer to joint power  entities which, under California law, at least--I would suspect, the  laws of other States as well--can include nonpublic agency entities.   So I believe the concern about privatization is certainly valid in  this case.   Now, the gentleman from California has mentioned the fact that one of  the safeguards in legislation that I have proposed has been included in  this bill. I am grateful for that. But the back end protection of the  possibility of a joint resolution coming out of Congress within a  certain period of time, while not insignificant, is pretty hard to  actually achieve in a slow-moving Congress.   Far more important are the other safeguards that were in my  legislation on the front end of the process, including safeguards that  were intended to ensure that bigger multiuse, more controversial, more  public benefit-oriented  [[Page H6159]]  projects would not be subject to this type of authority by the  executive branch.                                time  1545    Those front-end protections are important, and the most important of  them, of course, is that for those type of projects, Congress would  retain project-by-project approval authority, and not cede it to the  executive branch.   In effect, my bill included a belt and two suspenders. At best, the  bill from my friend from Colorado includes one suspender and nothing  else. So we disagree on the adequacy of these safeguards.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Colorado.   So let's talk about this Huffman safeguard that has been discussed  most recently. It is a perfectly good piece of a safeguard framework,  if it is accompanied by all of the other pieces that went with it and  that are designed to go with it. And that included all of the front-end  protections that were part of the legislation I had proposed, but which  my Republican colleagues did not include in their bill, to make sure  that only the right kind of projects--not the controversial ones--were  subject to this new grant of authority to the executive branch. That is  what this is all about.   Simply tacking on one safeguard, which, frankly, was the flimsiest of  them all to begin with, doesn't come anywhere close to addressing the  problem. As I have said, instead of a belt and suspenders, it is a  single suspender--a perfectly good suspender, but try walking around  with one suspender all day long and you will find it not very adequate.   This bill recklessly authorizes the de facto privatization of public  infrastructure. It fails to protect interests of numerous stakeholders,  including American taxpayers, Tribes, fishing groups, environmental and  recreational interests, and, finally, it comes from the bankrupt Trump  infrastructure plan that reflects this administration's failed  privatization philosophy.   The public deserves a real infrastructure plan, not a shell game that  simply gives away and privatizes existing public infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the part where I give the usual  stipulation that this is the final amendment to the bill which will not  kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will  immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   This amendment is simple. The underlying bill allows the Department  of the Interior to dole out publicly owned infrastructure and other  public assets to water districts.   My amendment simply says, the Department of the Interior can't give  away public assets to a water district if that district has employed  the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary of the Interior as a lobbyist in  the previous 3 years.   Put another way, the Secretary and Deputy Secretary can't give away  public infrastructure to those who recently signed their lobbying  paychecks. It should go without saying that this basic ethics  requirement is needed, particularly in this administration, where  conflicts of interest and corruption run so rampant.   The Department of the Interior has been mired in scandals. The  Interior Secretary's actions have triggered at least 10 government  investigations. It was also recently revealed that the Secretary and/or  his family, are currently in a business partnership to develop a former  industrial site with the chairman of the energy company, Halliburton.  Halliburton, of course, has a lot of business pending before the  Department of the Interior. This is an outrageous conflict of interest,  and demonstrates how hollow the President's pledge to drain the swamp  has been.   Further, Mr. Speaker, Interior Deputy Secretary Bernhardt, the number  two official at the agency, was most recently employed as a Federal  lobbyist and had a long list of clients with business before the  Department, including clients who stand to gain with the passage of  this bill by taking ownership of public infrastructure. We must not  allow such blatant conflicts to stand.                                time  1600    It is time for Congress to exercise some oversight over this  administration and install some basic rules of accountability and  ethics.   If my Republican colleagues are serious about exercising their  oversight responsibilities, they will support my amendment. It simply  makes sure that the public's assets cannot be given away to big  business and narrow special interests if those same interests employed  agency leadership in the past 3 years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
