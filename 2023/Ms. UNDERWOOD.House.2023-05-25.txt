 Madam Speaker, as a co-chair of the Democratic Policy  and Communications Committee, I am so proud to hold the floor today  with the united House Democratic Caucus.   Let's be crystal clear: The only reason we are here right now is  because Republicans are playing politics with people's lives.   This crisis has been engineered to rip food out of the mouths of  hungry families, take back the benefits our veterans have earned, and  kick children out of childcare, or--they tell us--we can default on our  debt and march right into a global economic disaster.   Now they have gone home for the holiday.   Madam Speaker, 87 Democrats spoke before me over the last several  hours; 87 Democrats have pleaded with you on behalf of our constituents  to keep the House in session, to prevent a default on our debt.  Democrats held the floor.   I ask the Chair and Speaker McCarthy: Will you join us?                            ____________________
