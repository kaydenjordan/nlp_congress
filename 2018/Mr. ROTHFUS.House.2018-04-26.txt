 Mr. Speaker, as someone who went to grade and high  school in the 1970s, I learned about countries, particularly the Soviet  Union and its Eastern European satellites, that severely limited the  right of their people to travel. In effect, they were prisoners in  their own country.   Indeed, in postwar Germany, the Communists even built a wall through  Berlin. They did so not to keep people from West Berlin from traveling  to East Berlin; they did it to prevent the captives of East Berlin from  running to freedom in the West.   There is a tragic story unfolding in Britain this week of a new,  virtual Berlin Wall that British and European authorities have erected  around little 2-year-old Alfie Evans, who lives in Britain. They have  eliminated this child's right to travel, and they are holding him  prisoner.   Alfie is severely handicapped. British officials have made the  decision, over the objection of Alfie's young parents, that Alfie would  be better off dead. As such, they are prohibiting Alfie's parents from  taking him to Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, which has offered to care  for the boy.    Alfie is not suffering, but British officials appear to be projecting  their own subjective views on Alfie's quality of life and are deeming  his life not worthy of living.   Among my most heartwarming experiences in my work in my district are  visits to residences of the severely handicapped. I have visited with  individuals who will never walk and who will never communicate  verbally. But they can and do love, and they are loved.  [[Page H3587]]    For some folks in life, their calling is that simple, to love and be  loved; and their presence makes us better persons. Perhaps that is  Alfie's calling, to love and be loved. Maybe those in Britain  responsible for Alfie's faith should consider that.   To be clear, Alfie's right to life does not come from Parliament; it  doesn't come from the crown; it doesn't come from any British court. It  comes from God.   Mr. Speaker, the British authorities should back down. They should  allow Alfie's parents to take him to Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome. The  British authorities should tear down the virtual wall they have put up  around him and let him be free so he can continue to love and be loved.                            ____________________
