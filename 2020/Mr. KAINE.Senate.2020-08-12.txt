 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the latest  coronavirus emergency aid package, but before I do, as a matter of  personal privilege, I want to offer some comments in praise of a  colleague.   Just as we gather together, regardless of party, to mourn when a  colleague dies or be together with a colleague who is undergoing a  challenge, I think it is good to gather together and acknowledge when  something positive happens to a colleague, regardless of our political  affiliation.   This is the first opportunity on the Senate floor to offer a word  about Senator Kamala Harris, one of our colleagues, who, in a historic  move, was asked by another former Senate colleague, Vice President Joe  Biden, to join him as his preferred nominee to be Vice President of the  United States.   I have come to know Senator Harris in her 4 years in the Senate, as  many of us have, through her service on especially the Judiciary  Committee and the Intelligence Committee.   Her public service track record is a significant one worthy of  praise, from her work as a district attorney, first a line prosecutor,  and then the elected district attorney in San Francisco, where she  focused on trying to keep her community safe, to serving as  California's attorney general, broadening the portfolio to include  environmental justice and consumer protection, and now her work in the  Senate since 2016.   What I find so compelling about Senator Harris, in addition to her  track record of public service during a very long career, is her  personal story. Raised as the child of two immigrants, a Jamaican  father and an Indian mother, as so many in this country raised as  children of immigrants, she developed a passion to serve and a  patriotic love of country.   She is the first African-American woman nominee ever to be on a  ticket. She is the first person of South Asian descent ever to be on a  ticket. And in the year 2020, when we are commemorating the 100th  anniversary of the amendment that guaranteed women the right to vote, I  can think of no  [[Page S5393]]  greater way to celebrate a centennial than for one of our colleagues  who is a woman to have a chance to break a glass ceiling that still has  existed, whereby no woman in this country has ever been a Vice  President or President.   We are so good at so much in this country. In fact, we are so good at  many things with regard to women in this country, but we are sort of  uniquely bad in electing women to higher office. In Congress right now,  24 percent of Congress is women, and that ranks us 76th in the world in  terms of our percentage of women in a national legislative body. We are  tied with Afghanistan, but we trail Iraq and Mexico and many other  nations.   So regardless of how it all works out between now and November, and  regardless of our own political affiliations, this is a good day, I  believe, for the country and a good day for the Senate when 1 of the  100 is recognized in such a way and introduced to the American public  with an opportunity to serve at a significant level.                            ____________________     Mr. President, returning to the latest coronavirus  emergency aid package--currently, the package doesn't exist. There have  been no bipartisan negotiations on it since last Friday. That is  disappointing to all of us who are here, ready and willing to negotiate  and vote for a strong bipartisan relief package.   The House of Representatives passed its strong package back on May  15, now nearly 3 months ago. Today is August 12. There was some hope  that maybe COVID-19 cases were ticking downward. At the end of May,  there was some hope that maybe the economic devastation was reducing,  but COVID cases did not tick down over the summer as some had hoped. In  fact, they have ticked up in many parts of the country, and the Senate  has not taken any votes on the House bill or indeed on any bill. That  is disappointing.   More than that, it is disappointing for millions of Americans who are  in the midst of hard times right now. They are worried about their own  health or the health of their loved ones. They are worried about  whether they will receive unemployment benefits or how they will make  rent or mortgage or how their children will get an education. We know  in this body we can transcend politics as usual to address the  coronavirus because we did so in March by passing the CARES Act, even  as Members of the body, including me, were getting coronavirus as we  were having those negotiations. Even as staffers were getting it, even  as Senate spouses were getting it, we stayed at the table and found a  bipartisan bill that helped us deal with the challenge for a few  critical months.   But we are here debating this again because the magnitude of the  crisis is not a crisis of a few months. No, it is such that the aid  provided thus far is running out while Americans' hardships continue.  That is why it is essential that we not give up and that we stay here  as long as it takes to come through for the American people.   I have heard some in Congress and, indeed, some in this body say  about more Federal aid for the coronavirus response say: I just don't  see the need for it. Indeed, the majority leader has candidly  acknowledged that approximately 20 Members of the Republican caucus  will not vote for more aid. Well, I want to make the case first that  there is need for it, and the need is undeniable because the  circumstances that people are living in are dire.   Last Friday, we found out that the unemployment rate in July was 10.2  percent, which is a number that is higher than at any point during the  2008, 2009 recession. The President called these ``Great Jobs  Numbers!'' But I don't see anything great about 1 in 10 Americans who  are in the workforce not being able to find work.   More than 30 million Americans are collecting unemployment benefits,  and last week their benefit checks were cut by more than 50 percent. In  Virginia, just as an example, unemployed workers are now receiving a  maximum--a maximum--of $378 a week. That is not enough to pay rent, let  alone rent, groceries, childcare, electric bills, and many other costs  that families face every day.   Because they lost their jobs and other income, millions of Americans  are now at risk of eviction or foreclosure. The $600 Federal  unemployment benefit and Federal eviction moratorium were holding this  off for many, but with those relief measures expiring, families are  unable to continue paying their August or September bills.   One estimate is that 12 million evictions will be filed by October,  and 12 million is essentially the combined population of about 6 or 7  States. There could be that many evictions filed by October. Just in  Virginia there was a State-imposed eviction moratorium that lapsed for  5 weeks, and just in those 5 weeks, nearly 10,000 evictions were filed,  potentially forcing people out of their homes.   Three in ten Virginia renters surveyed a couple weeks ago said that  they were uncertain how they could pay August rent, and it was more  than half of all African-American renters surveyed who said that was  the case. Housing instability is difficult at any point in time, but  imagine losing your housing during a pandemic. What are people supposed  to do during a pandemic? The advice is, if you can stay home and don't  go out and don't be with others, that will help keep your family safe.  But how can you quarantine at home if you are in danger of losing your  home?   Like the majority leader, who quoted from constituents in Kentucky, I  am hearing from Virginia constituents every day.   From Allison in Henrico:         I have now exhausted my savings account and have rent due,       groceries to buy and bills to pay. I am now desperate for       immediate help.    From Rhys in Mechanicsville:         I have three children, one with significant special needs.       My wife cannot work now due to covid-19 and the school       closures. I am behind on numerous bills, including mortgage,       utility, and other bills.    From Dominique in Fairfax:         My rent is now 3 months behind as well as my other bills       and I am receiving letters [threatening] evictions and       services being turned off.    Unfortunately, these examples are now not aberrations, but they are  common. We all know people--we all know people--who are at risk of  losing their home or being hungry or losing healthcare or their savings  being depleted because of the absence of work.   So we have to make sure that people are not removed from their homes  in the middle of a health crisis. We need to make sure they can  continue to pay bills until the health crisis is sufficiently addressed  and the economy gets back to where it was.   Schools and colleges across the country are trying to reopen right  now. It doesn't matter if it is in person, online, or a hybrid model,  we want them to reopen safely right now, and this is the time to  provide schools with the resources they need to deliver quality  instruction, not punish them for following public health guidance and  data.   Working families are struggling to find childcare options. This is  critical to reopening the economy. Childcare providers themselves are  struggling. Virginia, according to national surveys, is at risk of  losing 45 percent of its licensed childcare capacity; that is, 130,000  childcare slots in Virginia without the additional support they would  need to help them stay viable. If we lose childcare capacity, that will  have a significant consequence in terms of the ability of people to go  back to work so that the economy can start to grow again.   On the nutrition front, we are facing an unprecedented rise in food  insecurity as thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans have  newly enrolled in the SNAP program. The Brookings Institute estimates  that nearly 14 million children are living in food-insecure  households--14 million children. That is nearly six times the number of  children who were food insecure just as recently as 2018, and nearly  three times as many who were food insecure at the peak of the great  recession in 2008 and 2009.    I bet all of my colleagues have experienced this because we are all  out in our States talking to folks. Food banks have been slammed with  demand they have never witnessed before, and it has been harder for  food banks to get grocery access because grocery store shelves have  also been ravaged because people are going to grocery stores while  restaurants are closed.  [[Page S5394]]    What do food banks do with increasing demand and fewer donations from  grocery stores? The Capital Area Food Bank purchased 100 semitruck  loads of food in April, which is triple what the food bank purchased in  all of 2019. Just in 1 month, they tripled their purchases compared to  2019. The Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, which serves the western part of  Virginia, saw the number of new families seeking food assistance  quadruple from last year, just as of May.   Americans are in a dire state. Their basic needs are at stake. We  Democrats want to address that hardship. We did address that hardship  in the Heroes Act, which we passed in mid-May. We want to keep people  from losing their jobs, being evicted, and going hungry.   I know there are many Republicans who share these same goals, but the  proposals that have been on the table in this body are simply  inadequate. There are areas that we agree on. Aid to small business is  important. Broadband is important because as people telecommute or get  telehealth or get educational content online, they have to have access  to broadband. Testing is important. Childcare is important to open the  economy. These are important priorities I believe we can come together  on, but the Republican plan that the Senate GOP introduced in this  body, which the majority leader again acknowledges that at least 20  Members of the caucus will not support, has large cuts to unemployment  aid, no State and local government aid to prevent layoffs of first  responders and vital programs and services.   The majority leader characterized State and local government agencies  as a ``slush fund.'' I was a mayor. I was a Governor. I know what is  happening to State and local budgets, and when the revenues to State  and local governments decline, there is about one place they can go,  and the one place they can go is furloughs, waivers, salary cuts, and  cutting personnel.   The overwhelming majority of first responders in this country work  for State and local governments. It is never a good time to cut police,  fire, EMT, ambulance, healthcare workers--never a good time--but the  worst time to do it is in the midst of a global health pandemic. It is  not a slush fund; it is a necessity that the communities where people  live and work have basic services to get through this challenge.   The Republican proposal has inadequate education aid, no aid for the  eviction tsunami that is facing us to provide rent or mortgage  assistance, no nutrition aid in the SNAP program or otherwise to help  the 14 million kids who, today, are living in food-insecure households.   The Republican proposal did include a comprehensive liability shield  to prevent anyone from suing if their employer's negligence causes a  virus outbreak. I thought it was interesting that so often on the other  side of the aisle in this body, when this prospective bill has been  talked about, that has been in the front of the line as if the worry  about lawsuits is the biggest concern that the American people have  right now. No one in Virginia, when they tell me about their concerns,  is putting worries about lawsuits up at the top of the list. We are  talking about food, hunger, healthcare, and housing.   The liability shield proposal in the GOP goes even further than  protecting against liability; it wipes out States' abilities to pass  safety regulations. Virginia became the first State in the country to  do an emergency temporary standard to provide guidance to public places  and employers about safety standards that they could use on the job. It  is good to get advice about safety standards because most businesses  don't have an NIH or CDC or a health department, so advice about  standards that should be followed in workplaces is a great idea.  Virginia became the first State in the country to do that. The  Republican liability shield would not only give people liability  protections, but it would take away the ability of the States to do  what Virginia did to try to create lifesaving protections for workers  and customers. That is unacceptable--unacceptable.   Democrats offered to meet halfway. We knew when the Heroes Act  passed--I mean, we have been around the block a few times. It wasn't as  if Senate Republicans were just going to say: That is a good idea. We  will just vote for it.   That is not the way things work. The Senate Republicans would have  their proposal just as the House Democrats have their proposal. The two  proposals have dramatically different pricetags. The Senate proposal,  together with the White House, came in the neighborhood of $1 trillion  and the House proposal came in the neighborhood of $3 trillion.   There is nothing magic about these numbers, but it is important to  understand that willingness to compromise is something Americans expect  of us right now. Democrats said: OK, you have a package that is worth  $1 trillion, and we have a package that is worth $3 trillion. Let's  split the difference. We will have to decide how to compose the $2  trillion package, but let's split the difference. The White House  refused. The White House got an offer to meet halfway and said: That is  not what we are going to do. We insist on the skinny version.   The skinny version is inadequate to meet the challenge of the moment.  This is the worst economic contraction in the 145 years that we have  had measured quarterly economic growth in this country. This is the  worst pandemic that the United States has dealt with since the Spanish  flu of 1917 and 1918. A narrow bill isn't enough.   If you don't like the Democratic bill because you think the pricetag  is too big, how about meeting us halfway? That is the way negotiations  so often happen. After the White House rejected the notion of meeting  halfway, the President issued Executive orders that he claims break  through the logjam.   Like many things the President does, though, an analysis of the  Executive orders demonstrates there is little substance there. The  President proposed a deferred payroll tax collection. That doesn't  actually give Americans more money; it just gives them a larger tax  bill next year. Because it is a deferral, the President cannot lift the  obligation off either the employers or the employees. It is also very  confusing to employers to suggest: OK, you should defer, but it is  likely to start back up again. That is very, very hard for employers,  especially small employers, to figure out.   We all know that the payroll tax is the main pillar of Social  Security, as every generation pays into the system while they are  working so they can enjoy retirement with dignity in their senior  years. President Trump has said that this isn't just a deferral, but if  he has his way and is reelected, he is going to permanently cancel the  tax. That would undermine retirement security for all future  generations.   The Executive order with respect to housing did actually nothing. It  just ordered agencies to look into delaying evictions and foreclosures,  but no assistance and no dollars for those facing eviction or for those  facing foreclosures. Look into ``can you delay them.''   Governors are already saying that the Executive order dealing with  unemployment aid is unworkable. It would be very difficult for them to  reconfigure their UI systems to do what the President has asked them to  do and asked them to help pay for in the Executive order. Even if  States could figure out how to launch a completely new system, the  benefits would run out in 5 weeks.   On the surface, the Executive order with respect to student loan  relief looks like an extension, but if you dig into it, that is not  what it is. The order still leaves out 8 million Federal student loan  borrowers, and it doesn't even mention whether borrowers' credit  ratings and credit scores will be protected if they take advantage of  what is offered to them under the EO.   What about the millions of students who are struggling to financially  find a way to go back to college, or the schools that are trying to  find a way to still make sure students get an education when they  reopen, or the working families that are struggling to find childcare?  School boards and superintendents around the country have come with a  proposal saying that to open schools safely would cost about $175  billion, and that is what Democrats have put on the table. That is not  addressed at all in the Executive orders, even as we stand at the  threshold of schools reopening.   In sum, the President's Executive orders address virtually none of  the hardships, solve virtually none of the hardships, and lift  virtually none of the burdens that Americans are suffering through  right now. We are having hard  [[Page S5395]]  times. We are having hard times, and it is our duty to try to address  that hardship.   Democrats are willing to compromise. When we say, ``Hey, we have a  plan but we will meet you halfway in your plan,'' and the White House  says, ``No,'' you know, what are we supposed to do? What are we  supposed to do? A skinny version isn't sufficient for the magnitude of  the crisis.   The Senate Republican proposal has some elements that we support, but  it leaves so many others unaddressed that it is not adequate. The  Republican White House has rejected compromise. President Trump's  Executive orders are partly illegal, partly unworkable, and completely  insufficient. It doesn't have to be this way because there are many  areas on which we can find agreement.   I know many in this body are hearing from their home States'  Governors, mayors, local governments, colleges and universities, school  boards and housing authorities, food banks, hospitals, and the chambers  of commerce. You are hearing the same thing that I am hearing from  Virginians.   So, as I conclude, it doesn't have to be this way. We can put  together a good bipartisan deal, but it can't be a ``White House my way  or the highway.'' It has to be a willingness to meet and find  compromise between a Democratic proposal and a proposal that is  acceptable to at least some on the GOP side and the White House.   Any large compromise in a divided government is bound to be  imperfect. I am reminded of a quote from FDR during the Depression  years. You never really had to use quotes from the Depression because  the magnitude of the Depression was different than what I have  experienced during most of my life, but now quotes from the Depression,  I think, bear some revisiting. Here is what FDR said as the  administration and Congress, at the time, were doing everything they  could to figure out a way to help out needy Americans: ``Better the  occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of charity  than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its  own indifference.''   By now, everybody knows somebody who has gotten COVID-19 or somebody  who has gotten sick or even died or somebody who has lost a job or  somebody who is worried about rent or food. We all know those people,  and many of us have experienced this in our own families. Are we going  to help or are we going to be frozen in the ice of our own  indifference? Let's surprise the Senate. Let's work together and get  this done.   With that, I yield the floor.
