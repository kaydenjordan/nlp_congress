 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan  resolution. It expresses the commitment of this Chamber to build on the  20 years of success of the George McGovern-Robert Dole International  Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.   Its mission is simple: Reduce hunger and improve literacy and  poverty. By providing countless school meals, the program helps improve  child nutrition, maternal health, and access to quality education,  particularly for girls. I was proud that the Appropriations Committee  was able to include $265 million for this critical program this summer,  the most in the program's history.   During its 20-year history, it has made a positive difference in the  lives of more than 31 million children and families in 48 countries  around the world.   During the pandemic, when school closures were commonplace, the  McGovern-Dole Program quickly shifted from providing meals in schools  to providing take-home options that distributed about 23,000 metric  tons of commodities donated by the United States and 550 metric tons of  locally procured commodities to more than 1.7 million children and  families across 26 projects. These efforts ensured that children would  continue receiving daily meals and, at its crux, they would not go  hungry while they were learning at home.   Let us remain committed to not only carrying on the legacy of these  giants--Ambassador McGovern and Senator Dole--but continue to follow  the example that they set, working to tackle hunger and poverty around  the world.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
