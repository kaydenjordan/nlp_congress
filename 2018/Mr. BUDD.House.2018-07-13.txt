 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize  Mooresville, North Carolina's own, the Penske racing team, as they  recently added yet another big win to their legendary trophy case and  brought home the 2018 Indianapolis 500.   North Carolina is proud of the whole team, Mr. Speaker, but I want to  specifically recognize Will Power who was behind the wheel when they  took home the win. I also want to recognize team owner, Roger Penske,  who, with this latest win, can claim his 17th victory at the speedway.   Iredell County and the entire State of North Carolina is proud of the  32 national championships, including 15 in IndyCar, specifically coming  from the Penske team.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent a group whose leadership,  determination, and drive brings so much pride to our area. I am also  glad they choose this part of North Carolina to call home, and I look  forward to their bringing even more trophies back to our area in the  coming years.                            ____________________
