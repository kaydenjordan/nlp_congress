 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleagues, both of whom have served as not only Members of this House  and members of the parliamentary assembly, but both have led that body  as president emeritus and our current president, Mr. Connolly.  [[Page H4179]]    I was there in Brussels with my colleagues just a month ago in the  days immediately preceding Vladimir Putin's brutal Russian invasion of  Ukraine. And there our delegation, on a bipartisan basis, made the case  for this resolution, made the case for why such a center is needed now  more than ever.   We are seeing an attack not only on the people of Ukraine, but on our  democratic values. They are at stake in a way today that they haven't  been since the fall of the Berlin Wall. And in some sense, they haven't  been under this sort of attack since 1945.   I am proud to be a part, as Mr. Connolly mentioned, of our NATO  Parliamentary Assembly. We will be going this weekend to another such  NATO PA meeting.   This association, this alliance is needed now more than ever. I am so  proud to see this country redouble its commitment to the alliance, but  as Mr. Connolly has said time and time again, this cannot just be an  alliance built on our shared interest, it must be an alliance based on  our shared values.   So I strongly support this resolution, and I urge its unanimous  bipartisan adoption.
