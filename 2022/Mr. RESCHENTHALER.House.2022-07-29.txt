 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and the  distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to, for the record, say there is nothing  before us in the rule that has anything to do with any kind of assault  weapons ban or policing. This is simply a rule that would waive the 24- hour requirement.   Look, to be candid, the Democrats have now opened the door for  Republicans to use this in the future to push  [[Page H7412]]  forward our agenda, which is going to protect the rights and liberties  of individual people.   I would like to take this time to point out the hypocrisy and the  irony I see coming from across the aisle. Let me just talk about that.   Madam Speaker, 9 days is all it took before the Speaker reinstated  her authoritarian COVID lockdown, proving once again that House  Democrats are unable to govern unless they stack the deck. I would also  remind my good friend that he consistently referred to these tactics as  ``martial law'' during his time in the minority.   If I can just quote the chair on same-day authority during the 109th  Congress: ``My problem is with significant pieces of legislation, some  legislation which may not have even been heard by committees of  jurisdiction, which may not have been reported out of committees of  jurisdiction, bills that will come before us that the House has never  even considered, things that we will not have an opportunity to be able  to read before we vote on them.''   That was in the 109th Congress. Where is the outrage now?   Madam Speaker, for over 790 days, the Speaker used COVID-19 as a  weapon to deny the Republicans the ability to advocate on behalf of  millions of Americans that they represent. Just last week, it looked  like we were finally returning to regular order. Now, it is more of the  same tricks and tactics.   The blanket same-day rule before us this morning allows House  Democrats to ram through their radical agenda, an agenda that does  nothing to address the serious problems the American people are facing.   What are those problems? Under the Biden administration, our Nation  has careened from one crisis to the next. It has been absolute chaos.   Right now, families across the country are facing 40-year high  inflation that is expected to cost the average American household an  extra $6,000 a year. Yesterday, we were told that we are officially in  a recession when the GDP fell for a second quarter in a row. Although  the Biden administration is attempting to deflect blame by referring to  this latest economic disaster as a ``transition period,'' the American  people know that we are in a recession and facing hard times to come  because of the radical policies of the left.    It is only going to get worse with the recently announced build back  broke deal, which will raise taxes on Americans. It will try to  socialize American healthcare, and it will try to implement the radical  Green New Deal policies that have led to this energy crisis in the  first place.   Madam Speaker, this is no way to run the people's House, but I want  it noted that the door is now open. I find it absolutely hypocritical  that there was outrage against us when Republicans used the same tactic  but now it is okay when the Democrats want to do it. I am looking  forward to the day when power returns to the Republicans, and we will  see if there is outrage at that point.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am glad the gentleman also quoted himself. You can  tell how I am handling this debate because I don't want to be quoted in  the future when the shoe is on the other foot. But I will point out the  hypocrisy from my friends on the other side of the aisle that their  outrage is obviously selective of who is waiving the rule and who is  not.   Look, we can talk about procedure all day here. That is not going to  fix the real problems that are facing the American people. According to  the National Federation of Independent Business, inflation is the top  problem reported by businesses. This is the highest inflation we have  had since 1980, literally the highest inflation in my lifetime.   Instead of working to lower costs for businesses and workers, the SEC  proposed burdensome new rules requiring businesses to disclose  extensive climate-related data and additional ``climate risks.''   Setting climate policy is the responsibility of Congress, not  unelected career bureaucrats who are absolutely unaccountable to the  American people.   That is why, if we defeat the previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 8589 that  would prohibit the SEC's woke climate rule from moving forward.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, here to explain my amendment is my  good friend, a senior member of the House Committee on Financial  Services and the sponsor of this bill, Congressman French Hill of  Arkansas.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Arkansas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who is a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Michigan.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want the Record to reflect that I am not outraged about this  rule. I just was simply, at the beginning of my remarks, my opening  statement, pointing out the hypocrisy from my friends across the other  side of the aisle who had this selective outrage when we waived the 24- hour requirement. But it is okay when they do it.   And again, I am almost gleefully looking forward to the opportunity  when we are in the majority for myself to help the then Chairman Cole  of the Rules Committee do the same thing; and we will see what kind of  hypocrisy comes from the other side of the aisle and how they will then  have outrage when we do it.   But I am not outraged about this. I think that if we are going to  move forward today, we should defeat the previous question. That is  what I am passionate about, and that is what my friends that have  spoken here today are passionate about, because they want to run a  bill, authored by my good friend from Arkansas, that would actually  help the economic crisis; that would actually help fight inflation.   So, please don't confuse passion for helping the American people out  of this financial problem with outrage. There is no outrage on this  side of the aisle.   But to explain more, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), my good friend, and a rising star of the  Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, it is quite remarkable that the gentleman is now  telling us that this is about gun-related bills, because 14 hours ago  we had questions in the Rules Committee. Those questions went unasked  because the minority is unsure.   You know who was unsure when they were in the minority? My good  friend. Let me quote him again. When the Republicans tried to waive the  24-hour requirement, my good friend said: ``Once again, we are here on  the floor debating a martial law rule that also makes the suspension  day. Here we are, once again, unsure of what we will be considering  today, tonight, or tomorrow.''   So last night, at 7 P.M., my good friend, ranking member of the Rules  Committee, Mr. Cole, asked a series of questions because we wanted to  get some light shed on it. He asked, what would this rule specifically  be used for? The majority said they didn't know. They were unsure.   He asked if this were to be related to gun-related bills, and if  those bills would be changed. The majority said they didn't know. We  are unsure here.   He asked if this authority would be used for other bills. The  majority said they didn't know.   He asked if the House would be in session this weekend, and also the  response was, the majority didn't know.   So it's amazing how the majority is, today, so confident on what is  being run today through this rule when, just 14 hours ago, when we  asked those questions, those answers were not provided to the minority.   But here to talk more about the resolution that I will personally  offer if we defeat the previous question is my good friend. I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to again say we asked a litany of questions to try to give the  minority guidance on what bills would be considered today, the context  of those bills, the timing of those bills, whether we would be here  this weekend. The response constantly was either: I hope not; I am  unsure; I don't know. So, here we are, in the dark.   But for the purpose of a rebuttal, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to quote my good friend, the chairman, again,  this time from 2017, when he stated that martial law allows the  majority to ``rush their bill with its brand-new backroom deals to the  floor today without any proper deliberation.''   I think that pretty much sums up perfectly what we are doing here  today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us today makes in order H.R. 1808, an  unconstitutional bill to ban hundreds of the most popular firearms in  the United States, including the sporting rifle, the AR-15.   Law-abiding Americans in places like southwestern Pennsylvania and  across the country use firearms every single day for things like sport  shooting, hunting, and self-defense. So despite what the House  Democrats claim, this bill would do little to prevent the mass  shootings or the crime they are saying that it would, and this bill  would not prevent criminals from obtaining firearms.   I know the chairman just referenced a 1994 study. That was a  congressionally mandated study to look at the 1994 assault weapons ban.  That study found that ban was ineffective in reducing violent crime.  ``The banned guns were never used in more than a modest fraction of all  gun murders.''   A follow-up study to that 1994 ban came out in 2004, and that study  found that ``the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small  at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.''   Even UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, the resident anti-gun, so- called subject matter expert, a left-leaning professor, stated:  ``There's no way to make assault rifle bans effective.''   To that point, we saw that during the tragic shootings in San  Bernardino, Newtown, and Buffalo, those all occurred in States that  already had assault weapons bans on the books.   So the question is this: Why are my far-left Democratic colleagues  bringing this bill to the floor today?   Well, in the words of Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Jerry  Nadler, `` . . . banning these `common use' firearms is the `point of  the bill.' ''   In other words, let's call this what it is. It is a gun grab, pure  and simple.   This bill is not about public safety. Rather, this is the most severe  restriction on the Second Amendment since the passage of the assault  weapons ban of 1994. It would turn an American lending a firearm to a  friend to go hunting into a criminal.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This false equivalence between an AR-15 and a so-called weapon of war  just shows the ignorance of my friends on the other side of the aisle.   An AR-15 is not an M16. An M16 has numerous functions: safety, three- round bursts, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. An AR-15 has no such  setting as a three-round burst and the fully automatic. So this false  comparison between a so-called weapon of war and what we would describe  as sporting rifle, again, shows the lack of understanding about these  platforms.   Additionally, the AR-15 is by far the most popular sporting rifle in  the United States. There are over 20 million that are in the possession  of Americans right now.   But while we are talking about statistics, a 2020 FBI study shows  that there are more murders committed with knives, clubs, and fists  than with firearms.   Also, when you are looking at firearm deaths, just in the year 2020,  both the CDC and the FBI reported that over half of these firearm- related deaths were suicides. So let's just be clear when we are  talking about statistics.   If you are breaking down those studies, you can look at 2020, where  59 percent of murders were committed by handguns. Only 3 percent were  committed with what is being described as assault rifles, what I would  describe as sporting rifles.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Mrs. Fischbach), my good friend from the Committee on Rules, who is  here to talk more about this issue.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want it noted that the gentleman from Massachusetts said that  no one on his side is describing these weapons as ``weapons of war,''  and then the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), the first thing he  said was that AR-15s are ``weapons are war.''   So, we need to understand that when the left and when radical  Democrats are describing AR-15s as ``weapons of war,'' and as the  gentleman from Texas just said, ``machine guns,'' they are doing two  things simultaneously. Number one, they are showing their absolute  ignorance for how these platforms operate; and two, they are  deliberately trying to mislead the American people on what these  platforms do.   No one on my side of the aisle is trying to say that machine guns  should be legal. An AR-15 is a sporting rifle; it is a semiautomatic.  It is not the kind of platform that is used by the military. It is not  an M16, it is not an M4; but, again, the other side tries to use this  to muddy the waters and confuse the American people and to put all  firearms in the same category.   Let's talk about some more statistics. In 2021, a Georgetown study  found that 1.67 million instances were found where firearms were used  in self-defense. In 2019 alone, there were 386 self-defense killings  that were determined to be justified. So, these are just some of the  ways in which someone can legally use a sporting rifle.   Let's talk about the chaos at the southern border. Since Joe Biden  took office, over 3.1 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended  at the southern border, and that includes 56 illegal immigrants who  were on the terror watch list.   President Biden and House Democrats have this open-door policy that  has created a humanitarian crisis and a security crisis, as well, and  they want to make things worse by lifting title 42.   Republicans know border security is national security. That is why if  we defeat the previous question, I will personally offer an amendment  to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act of 2021, to  enforce title 42.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend, to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Texas,  but when the question is asked why servicemembers can't bring their  M16s and their M4s home, it is because those are fully automatic  weapons. They are not AR-15s.   The gentlewoman actually answers her own question. The M16 and the M4  platform are automatic. The AR-15 is not automatic. They are two  different platforms.   The gentlewoman and the gentleman from Texas said words to the effect  of, ``What are we doing? Why are Republicans not doing enough?'' or  words to that effect.   Well, let me remind my colleagues across the aisle that it was  Republicans, not Democrats, it was Republicans in 2017 that had the Fix  NICS Act. It is Republicans that are trying to get legislation passed  to keep guns  [[Page H7496]]  out of the hands of criminals, not out of the hands of law-abiding  citizens. It was the last administration under President Trump that  banned bump stocks when the Obama administration let that ban expire.   Those are just a few things that Republicans are doing in this arena.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Diaz-Balart), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Hice), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Greene), my good friend.     Whether it is Pennsylvania or Massachusetts, they  are still two great Commonwealths, right?   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, and I yield  myself the balance of my time for closing.   Madam Speaker, I am incredibly disappointed but, unfortunately, not  at all surprised that, once again, we are considering legislation that  will do nothing more than penalize law-abiding citizens while doing  absolutely nothing about the root cause of gun violence.   We know from history, and we know from numerous studies that I have  talked about today, that assault weapons bans do not work.   So, why is this bill coming before us today? It is just the latest in  the House Democrats' never-ending attack on America's Second Amendment  rights.   Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and vote ``no'' on the rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
