 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 589, the  Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act.   H.R. 589 provides policy direction to the Department of Energy on  basic science research, nuclear energy R&D, research coordination and  priorities, as well as important additional reforms to streamline  national labs management.   I want to particularly highlight title IV, which is the Nuclear  Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. I introduced the same legislation  in the 114th and 115th Congress, and it does a lot of good things. It  lays out a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete a research  reactor, which is a crucial part for us.   Right now, we are behind, Mr. Speaker. The Russians are outpacing us  on the next design of nuclear reactors. That is simply unacceptable.   We need a versatile neutron source, and title IV of this will produce  a situation where we will have the ability for the national labs to  partner with private industry and be able to do that so that they don't  get built overseas, which is totally unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has spent a  long time developing this. There is lots of bipartisan buy-in, I might  add, and I appreciate that.   So it is time, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, for us to get this bill  passed and make sure that we remain on the cutting edge. It helps us  with economics, and it helps us actually with nuclear proliferation as  far as that goes.   So I encourage all of my colleagues to join in supporting H.R. 589.
