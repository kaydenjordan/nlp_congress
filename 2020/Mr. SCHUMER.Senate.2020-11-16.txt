 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the  nomination of Judy Shelton to serve on the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve. Judy Shelton's views are breathtakingly extreme and  retrograde. She actually seems to prefer the economic policies that  foregrounded  [[Page S6689]]  the Great Depression. She has openly advocated a return to the gold  standard. She has long questioned the need for Federal deposit  insurance, and, in March 2009, in the midst of our last economic  crisis, she questioned: Why do we need a central bank?   Imagine someone like Ms. Shelton, with her retrograde views, sitting  on the Federal Reserve during a time of economic crisis? Imagine  someone like that making decisions about monetary policy back in April,  when our economy was in free fall? We should not confirm to the Federal  Reserve someone who would likely stymie efforts to dig ourselves out of  this economic crisis.   I urge every one of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, to  reject this terrible, terrible nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, COVID-19, as we know, unfortunately, has  upended nearly every aspect of American life for the better part of a  year. But as impatient as we all are for our lives to return to normal,  the harsh truth of the matter is that the coming months may be, by far,  the worst of the pandemic.   Cases have skyrocketed to well over 150,000 Americans per day. We are  now recording more than 1 million new COVID cases a week. Hospital ICUs  and morgues in many parts of the country are approaching or even beyond  capacity.   Americans must brace themselves for a long winter. We cannot tire of  the simple precautions that limit the spread of the disease and save  lives. Wear a mask, social distance, avoid large indoor gatherings, and  stay vigilant. We must all continue to do our part to prevent this next  surge from overwhelming our health systems and endangering our fellow  citizens. Congress, as well, should be doing all that is necessary to  support those efforts and prevent the worst from happening.   Too many Americans have lost healthcare coverage as a result of  losing their jobs this year. Medicaid has seen a huge increase in new  enrollees and needs resources. As unemployment remains in the tens of  millions, extending unemployment insurance is paramount, and many more  things besides.   Speaker Pelosi and I have been in regular communication with  President-Elect Biden and his transition team. Unlike the current  administration, the incoming administration wants to move rapidly to  get a handle on the virus and recover our economy. Today, President- Elect Biden urged the Senate to pass the Heroes Act--comprehensive  legislation that leaves no one behind. That is just the right approach.  Our country deserves a bill that meets the needs of the American people  and that meets the needs of the moment.   If Leader McConnell and our Republican colleagues want to sit down  and negotiate a bipartisan solution with a bipartisan process,  Democrats are ready and willing and able to do so, but, unfortunately,  it has been 2 weeks since Leader McConnell said he was in charge of  negotiating the next COVID-19 relief bill, and he still hasn't spoken  to Speaker Pelosi or myself.   We have 14 votes on the floor this week on nominations for a lameduck  President, but we have nothing--nothing--pertaining to COVID. There is,  however, a bit of good news today. A second U.S. company announced that  it has discovered an effective vaccine in phase 3 trials. Early figures  suggest it is close to 95 percent effective. As these two vaccines move  through the final approval process, we should prepare the country to  produce and distribute them to everyone in a comprehensive bill that  includes robust vaccine funding.   Finally, there is light at the end of the tunnel, but we are still in  that tunnel and may be so for several months. So we must pull together,  once again, to do everything in our individual power to turn the tide  of the virus                            ____________________     Mr. President, instead of working to pull the country  back together so we can fight our common enemy, COVID-19, the  Republican majority is busy spreading conspiracy theories denying  reality and poisoning the well of our democracy.   It seems like Republicans all over Washington are auditioning for  ``Profiles in Cowardice,'' nudging each other aside to say who can say  the most outlandish thing in support of President Trump's baseless  claims of election fraud. Two Members of this Chamber went so far as to  accuse their State's election result of not being delivered honestly  because President Trump didn't win. They demanded their own Secretary  of State, a fellow Republican, resign. The two Senators provided no  evidence--not a shred--to support the claim that the election wasn't  conducted honestly.   A Republican Governor this weekend supported the idea of States  sending alternative slates of electors to the electoral college. He  encouraged Republican State legislators and States that voted for Joe  Biden to literally ignore the will of the voters to send electors who  would vote for Donald Trump.   I understand my Republican colleagues dislike the results of the  Presidential election, but this has gone beyond ridiculous. This is  reckless. President Trump is working to convince millions of Americans  that the election wasn't fair and was stolen without a scrap of  evidence. Whatever fears my colleagues might have about President Trump  abandoning their party if they don't show sufficient support, that is  no excuse for sanctioning his efforts to discredit our democratic  elections.   The percentage of Republicans who now believe that the election was  not free and fair has doubled to 70 percent--7-0--in the United States  of America. How much longer will Senate Republicans stand by while  President Trump shreds Americans' faith in our democracy.   So I have a very simple message for my colleagues. The election is  over. President Trump lost. Joe Biden will be the next President of the  United States. Kamala Harris will be the next Vice President of the  United States. All over the country legal claims by the President are  being laughed out of court. Ironically, the President's legal  challenges have accomplished one thing: They have revealed just how  secure our elections were. As courts from Pennsylvania to Michigan, to  Arizona dismiss these claims, they are confirming there is no credible  evidence of fraud or irregularities. So far, not one vote has been  tossed out. These are facts, and the longer Republicans refuse to  acknowledge them, the more damage is done.   In order to keep up this charade, the Trump administration is now  actually denying national security briefings to President-Elect Biden.  It is actively refusing to coordinate with the incoming administration  on the coronavirus. How unimaginably stupid is that? We shouldn't even  be discussing for 1 minute whether or not Republicans will accept the  democratic results of our Presidential election or whether the next  President should receive security briefings. That should be a given.  But it appears, sadly, unfortunately, my Republican colleagues will  follow President Trump all the way down the rabbit hole to the very  bitter end of his very bitter Presidency. And every day that goes by,  the more damage is done to our country, to our national security, to  our ability to fight COVID, and to America's faith in our democracy.   So I plead with my Republican colleagues: Stop denying reality. Stop  recklessly sowing doubt about our democratic process. Stop going down  to the lowest common denominator that President Trump seems to live  with all the time, and start focusing on COVID. Let's bring this  country together and get some things done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
