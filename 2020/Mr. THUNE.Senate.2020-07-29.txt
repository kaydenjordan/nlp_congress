 Madam President, I intend to talk about section 230 here  in just a moment. I just want to react to what the Democratic leader  said and also make some observations generally about where I think we  are with respect to a coronavirus relief bill.   The Democratic leader indicated that the Republican bill wasn't a  serious bill. Frankly, I think it could be argued that the bill he has  endorsed, passed by the House of Representatives, was not a serious  bill. It was about $3.5 trillion, which would make it about $1 trillion  larger than the massive coronavirus relief bill we passed unanimously  in the Senate back in March. That bill, at the time, for a lot of  people, represented something unlike anything they had ever seen  before, both in terms of scale and scope, the expanse of all the issues  that it addressed. I think in many respects it was a bill that most  Members believed at the time that we needed to get as much assistance  out there as quickly  [[Page S4556]]  as we could, and as a consequence of that, there was broad support for  that.   We are at a different point now, obviously, several months later, and  have some perspective that enables us to look at what might be  effective, what has worked, and what hasn't worked. We have gotten a  lot of input from State and community leaders, from businesses,  schools, hospitals, and healthcare providers who have been impacted by  the virus, and have been able to respond to what has already been done  by the Congress in terms of assistance.   So I think at this point, as we look at what the greatest needs are,  it is pretty clear that we have to do something to provide safety net  assistance for those who have lost jobs in the form of unemployment  insurance. I think there is a commitment on both sides to address that.   I would argue that the proposal advanced by the Democrats, which  would just be a continuation of the existing program, is not one that I  think most people across this country think is wise policy, and  certainly to the degree that it provides an incentive for people to  stay home and not go back to work, it does provide a disincentive to  work.   I think that is something this legislation ought to address, and that  is pretty much a widely held view, not just by Republicans but by  Democrats. There are Democrats here in the Senate, Democrats in the  House, and Democratic Governors who have said that the existing  unemployment benefit needs to be modified, needs to be reformed, needs  to be revised.   The question has been raised: What level? It strikes me, at least,  that we ought not be putting a benefit out there that exceeds the  amount that people would make if they were actually working, because  what that essentially says is that those who are working, those who  stayed in the workforce are basically paying benefits to those who did  not, when, in fact, if there weren't a benefit that exceeded the amount  that they made when they were working, they might get back in the  workforce if those jobs become available again. That is certainly  something we want to incentivize.   So I would hope that in any deal that is struck where we address  unemployment insurance, we can come up with a solution that does tailor  it to the need of the moment, and that is to get people back to work.  We want to have policies that create jobs. That is something I think  ought to be first and foremost in this bill.   We have indicated that this ought to be about kids, getting them back  to school in the fall. It ought to be about healthcare, about coming up  with therapeutics and more testing, better testing. It ought to be  about ultimately, hopefully, getting a vaccine and in the meantime  making sure that we are addressing the needs of our providers, those  doctors and nurses and nursing home caregivers who are on the  frontlines.   So those are the priorities that I think ought to be in this bill. It  seems to me there is plenty of room for bipartisan cooperation, and it  will take that. It also strikes me that this suggestion that you have  to do more dollar-wise isn't always necessarily a sound approach. In  fact, I would argue that anything we do right now ought to be targeted.  It ought to be focused on those who have needs. If it is assistance to  State and local governments, if it is assistance to small businesses  that are out there creating jobs--anything that we do at this point  ought to be based and predicated upon where the needs are, and we ought  to have accountability for the funds that are going out there.   My impression from the bill passed by the House Democrats and  supported by many Senate Democrats here is that the more we spend, the  better it is. I don't think the American people subscribe to that view.  I think they realize, like I do, that we are operating in an  environment where we have a $26 trillion debt, and we have already  added this year, because of the first coronavirus bill, about another  $3 trillion to that debt and increased our debt to GDP ratio up over  100 percent, which is pretty dangerous territory if you look at any  relevant metric in history.   So I would argue that the approach that we take right now ought to be  focused, it ought to be targeted, it ought to be measured, and it ought  to be directed to those who really have needs--by that, I mean people  who are unemployed--through unemployment insurance. It ought to be  small businesses that are trying to keep their employees employed and  trying to get back and going again and creating jobs. It ought to be  healthcare providers who are dealing with the frontline crisis and also  the heavy investment we need to make in the ultimate solution, which  will be the vaccine, and, of course, in terms of the fall, getting kids  back to school. That entails a whole lot more testing. Those are all  things that are included in the bill that was put forward by  Republicans.   Most of the Democratic objections to that bill are that it doesn't  spend enough, that it is just not generous enough. Well, again, I think  we have to be very, very careful, very thoughtful and aware and  conscience of the fact that we are operating at a time when we have $26  trillion in debt, where every dollar we spend is a borrowed dollar, and  we need to be effective, surgical, targeted, and wise about how we  spend the American people's hard-earned tax dollars.   I am hopeful these discussions will lead to a solution. We knew right  away that there wasn't going to be unanimous support for this. It is  not like the last time around, and I have said all along that I  wouldn't expect every Republican to support the bill that came out and  was released a couple of days ago. I think it is a starting point.   I hope the Democrats will negotiate in good faith and not simply try  to raise the ante because they have a bill that has already passed the  House at $3.5 trillion. That, to me--not to mention the size of it but  also the components of it--was a very irresponsible bill. That is not a  serious bill. And the fact that it mentions the word ``cannabis'' more  times than it mentions the word ``jobs'' I think gives you all you need  to know about how serious that effort was.    But there is a place that we can land that addresses those critical  elements that I mentioned, and I hope that, notwithstanding the  rhetoric we are hearing from the Democratic leader, the Democrats will  enter into good-faith discussions and play a constructive role in  trying to come up with a bipartisan solution to the challenges we face  because of an unprecedented and historic pandemic.                           PACT Act and Section 230    Madam President, yesterday in my role as head of the Commerce  Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the  Internet, I led a hearing looking at proposed reforms of section 230 of  the Communications Decency Act.   So what is section 230? Section 230 provides internet sites that host  user-generated content--sites like YouTube or Twitter or Facebook--with  immunity for the content users post on their sites. So, for example, if  somebody uploads a YouTube video with defamatory content, YouTube isn't  held responsible for that content.   It is not fair to say that section 230 has enabled the internet as we  know it. Without section 230 protections, many of the sites we rely on  for social connection or news or entertainment would never have come  into being. If a solo blogger, for example, could be held responsible  for monitoring each and every comment on his or her site, no matter how  many hundreds or thousands there are, it is unlikely blogging would  ever have taken off. If YouTube were responsible for the content of  every one of the millions of videos on its site, it is unlikely that  YouTube would have grown the way that it has.   There is a reason that user-generated sites like Twitter and Facebook  are U.S. companies and not, for example, European companies. That is  because other countries do not offer the liability protections of  section 230.   But section 230 was written in the infancy of the internet, long  before sites like Twitter and Facebook were created. As we have seen  the internet grow, we have come to realize that there are also some  changes that need to be made.   For example, while I support the principle that sites should not be  held responsible for everything users generate, there is a difference  between an inappropriate video a site misses and a site that knowingly  allows itself to be used for criminal purposes   In 2018, after it became obvious that certain sites were knowingly  allowing  [[Page S4557]]  themselves to be used by child traffickers and predators, Congress  passed a law to hold these and other sites responsible for enabling  child sex trafficking.   As the previous chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and current  chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology,  Innovation, and the Internet, I have been focusing on internet issues  related to user-generated content sites for the past couple of years. I  have chaired several hearings on the topic, including a hearing on  terrorist content on sites like Twitter and Facebook and a hearing on  the opaque algorithms that these sites use to filter the content that  users see.   At the end of June, Senator Schatz and I introduced legislation, the  Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act, or the PACT Act,  to address some of the issues surrounding section 230 and user- generated content sites.   Our bill would preserve the benefits of section 230, like the  internet growth and widespread dissemination of free speech it has  enabled, while increasing accountability and consumer transparency. One  reason section 230 has become so controversial is that internet  platforms have cultivated the notion that they are merely providing the  technology for people to communicate and share their thoughts and  ideas.   But the reality is somewhat different. The truth is that websites  have a strong incentive to exercise control over the content each of us  sees, because if they can present us with content that will keep us  engaged, we will stay on that site longer. Today, sites like Facebook  and Twitter make use of sophisticated content moderation tool,  algorithms, and recommendation engines to shape the content we see on  these platforms.   Moderation can certainly improve the user experience. Most of us  would prefer that YouTube suggest videos that match our interest rather  than something completely unrelated. The problem is that content  moderation has been and largely continues to be a black box, with  consumers having little or no idea how the information they see has  been shaped by the sites they are visiting. The PACT Act would address  this problem by increasing transparency around the content moderation  process.   It would require internet platforms like Facebook and Twitter to  submit quarterly reports to the Federal Trade Commission outlining the  material they have removed from their sites or chosen to deemphasize-- for example, posts they have chosen to mostly exclude from users'  feeds.   Sites would also be required to provide an easily digestible  disclosure of their content moderation practices for users and,  importantly, they would be required to explain their decisions to  remove material to consumers. Until relatively recently, sites like  Facebook and Twitter would remove a user's post without explanation and  without an appeals process. Even as platforms start to shape up their  act with regard to transparency and due process, it is still hard for  users to get good information about how content is moderated.   Under the PACT Act, if a site chooses to remove your post, it has to  tell you why it decided to remove your post and explain how your post  violated the site's terms of use. The PACT Act would also require sites  to create an appeals process, so that if Facebook removes one of your  posts, it would not only have to tell you why, but it would have to  tell you a way to appeal that decision. To some extent, some platforms  like Facebook are already starting to do this, but by no means are they  all doing so.   The PACT Act would preserve companies' 230 protections for material  posted on their sites, but it would require companies to remove  material that has been adjudicated as illegal by a court. Large sites  like Facebook and Twitter would be required to remove illegal content  within 24 hours, while smaller sites would be given additional time.  Failure to remove illegal material would result in the site's losing  its 230 protections for that content or activity, a provision that  matches a recent recommendation made by the Department of Justice for  section 230 reform.   Finally, in addition to promoting transparency and accountability,  the PACT Act also contains measures to strengthen the government's  ability to protect consumers. As the Department of Justice has noted in  its recommendations to reform section 230, broad section 230 immunity  can pose challenges for Federal agencies in civil enforcement matters.   It is questionable whether section 230 was intended to allow  companies to invoke section 230 immunity against the Federal Government  acting to protect American consumers in the civil enforcement context.  This contributes to the creation of a different set of rules for  enforcing consumer protections against online companies, compared to  those in the offline world.   I am grateful to Senator Schatz for his work on this bill, and I am  proud of what we put together. We both have done a lot of work on these  issues, and this bill is a serious bipartisan solution to some of the  problems that have arisen around section 230. Our hearing yesterday,  which included one of the original authors of the section 230  provision, former Representative Chris Cox, confirmed that the PACT Act  would go a long way toward making our user-generated internet sites  more accountable to consumers.   I look forward to working with Senator Schatz to advance our  legislation in the Senate, and I hope that we will see a vote on our  bill in the near future.   I yield the floor.
