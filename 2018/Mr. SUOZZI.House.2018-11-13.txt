 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii  and the gentleman from Colorado for recognizing me to support H.R.  6064, which will rename the Oyster Bay Wildlife Refuge as the  Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge.   As Congressman Lamborn pointed out, Congressman Wolff is the oldest  living former Member of Congress, and he will be celebrating his 100th  birthday on January 4, 2019.   The Congressman, back in the 1960s, got into a big battle with a very  well-known figure in New York in government and politics at the time,  and really known throughout the Nation as the Power Broker, Robert  Moses.   They wanted to build a bridge across the Long Island Sound from  Connecticut to Oyster Bay, and Congressman Wolff, who was a freshman  Congressman at the time, recognized the importance of preserving this  important natural resource and created the Oyster Bay National Wildlife  Refuge. It is one of the most important areas for natural refuge  anywhere on the north shore of Long Island today and home to many types  of waterfowl, such as black ducks; greater scaups; bufflehead,  canvasback, and long-tail ducks; as well as great herons; and, now,  osprey and red-tailed hawks.   This was a major battle when the environmental movement was very  nascent at the time in the United States of America, and it took  tremendous courage on the part of Congressman Wolff to stand up to  Robert Moses at the time and the Governor of New York State, then- Governor Nelson Rockefeller, to preserve this important piece of  property, as well as to block the bridge that would have gone across  the Long Island Sound, an 8.5-mile bridge across the Long Island Sound  from Connecticut to Long Island.   So this is a great, fitting tribute for a wonderful man who we hope  will be able to enjoy his 100th birthday celebrating the naming of the  Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge.
