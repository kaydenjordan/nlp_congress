 Mr. Speaker, this week many people and leaders from the  USA and all around the world converged on Washington, D.C., for the  National Prayer Breakfast.   Its tradition started 65 years ago under President Eisenhower and  with partners in the Congress to take a little time to come together as  leaders and a people in prayer and fellowship. It is a bipartisan  effort--indeed, ideally, a nonpartisan coming together. Some might say  a bunch of politicians coming together, well, but some very powerful  testimonies come from this time together.   This year, from right here in this building, Senate Chaplain Barry  Black, who also served as a Navy admiral, gave a strong message on the  power of prayer, that our prayers are, indeed, heard in Heaven.   Two years ago, an amazing, humble, personal testimony delivered by  NASCAR race driver Darrell Waltrip had everyone talking later. I would  recommend anyone to find this video and enjoy that moving personal  message of the lows and the highs, the lows and the highs of fame and  celebrity and that you need God in your life.   This can also happen, and does, in local communities as tens of  thousands of prayer breakfasts happen on the National Day of Prayer,  which this year will be May 4, as it is always the first Thursday of  May, as proclaimed by President Reagan.   I urge you as Americans, if you don't have one in your community,  start one. If you do have one, please participate.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the measure for  congressional disapproval of the BLM's methane rule under this  Congressional Review Act. This egregious rule passed in the last few  days of the previous administration is yet another regulatory blow to  responsible energy development on lands held by the Federal Government  for the American people.   I think the American people have a right to expect that their Federal  Government is not only holding these lands, but that it is utilizing  this asset, an asset that can gain income to the Federal Government on  their behalf to maintain more lands, and also to utilize the energy at  low cost from domestically produced energy that comes from their lands,  instead of importing it from somewhere else, et cetera. It goes without  question that producing it here in this country is a giant benefit to  the U.S. and its economy.   As a strong proponent of an all-of-the-above energy approach, I  believe natural gas will continue to significantly transform and  modernize our Nation's energy infrastructure. Domestically produced  energy has so many positive effects it should be a no-brainer.   The BLM claims that this rule helps capture methane waste, resulting  in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Let's face some facts.  According to a report by the EPA, methane emissions from natural gas  production have decreased by 38 percent in the last 10 years, while gas  production on Federal lands has increased by 33 percent. Believe it or  not, this reduction was done through voluntary action on behalf of  industry, without changes to Federal regulations, in capturing and  utilizing this asset.   Even in my home State of California, the oil and gas industry has  created  [[Page H955]]  tremendous opportunity for our workforce. A recent report shows that  total economic contribution of oil and gas in California, in 2013,  resulted in the creation of 455,000 jobs and $72 billion in value added  to the State economy, approximately 3.4 percent of State GDP; indeed,  no small numbers when the State of California is in big trouble  fiscally, as it pursues more things like high speed rail and other  nonsense.    Stifling this vibrant and booming economic driver in my State and  others would be detrimental to the U.S. economy as a whole, while  making us more reliant upon energy from unstable regions of the globe  and the higher costs to consumers at home and in their workplace.   Furthermore, the BLM falsely claims it has authority under existing  law to regulate oil and gas emissions. Such authority already belongs  to the EPA and the States under the Clean Air Act, not the BLM.   Indeed, the BLM needs to get its priorities and its jurisdiction in  order. The agency spends valuable taxpayer resources developing a rule  to prevent methane flaring, yet denies rights-of-way permitting for  pipelines, which would help eliminate these kinds of releases  altogether. That is one of the important benefits of the Congressional  Review Act is accountability by an elected Congress over a bureaucracy.   Failure to reverse this rule would result in a net loss in royalties  that would negatively impact not just the Federal Government but Indian  tribes as well which rely on energy revenue to meet their health care,  housing, and other needs of their members on their lands.   The abuses and overreach by a previous Obama administration have gone  long enough. It is time we put an end to the senseless,  counterproductive regulations, and restore commonsense solutions to  energy development on the people's Federal lands.   The administration taking credit for increased gas production is  disingenuous, as most of it occurred on private lands, leaving our  public assets and potential unused.    Indeed, it would be a loss for the American public to  continue along that path.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts in bringing this forward and  the opportunity to have a Congressional Review Act for the  accountability.
