 Madam Speaker, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 are attempts by the  Federal Government to exert more force over law-abiding citizens who  want to protect themselves and their families.   Let me remind my Democrat colleagues that the Second Amendment  explicitly states that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be  infringed. Maybe they would remember that if they carried a pocket copy  of the Constitution with them like I do every single day. Apparently  not.   I am proud to stand with the millions of gun owners in this great  country who share an abiding gratitude for the Constitution and the  Second Amendment itself.   Make no mistake, these bills are created in bad faith. They are  partisan shams that rob us of our freedoms.                            ____________________
