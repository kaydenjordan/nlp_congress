 Mr. Speaker, the lynching of George Floyd  shocked our Nation, not because he was the first Black man murdered by  police, but because he is one of countless Black men unjustifiably  murdered, and with video. It was indisputable.   After centuries of inequality, prejudice, and discrimination, the  American people are crying out for justice.   Today, we are taking action.   The Justice in Policing Act curbs the excessive force and lack of  transparency that has contributed to police brutality; chokeholds and  no-knock warrants for drug cases would be banned; deadly force would be  restricted, as would military equipment meant for battlefields, not  American streets; and body cameras would be mandatory. Crucially, it  also limits qualified immunity, which protects police from  accountability.   But reform is not enough. We must also change the culture of  policing, which this bill does through funding for States and  communities to conduct badly needed de-escalation training.   George Floyd was not the first Black man killed by police, but with  this legislation, he can hopefully be among the last.
