 Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, say how grateful  we are that, as the assessment has been made, none of our brave  soldiers lost their lives last night in the Iranian attack and that it  is crucial this week that this Congress assert its authority, its  constitutional authority as it relates to any declaration of war, which  is our authority under Article I, in spite of the unfortunate  determination made by this administration putting American soldiers in  danger, diplomats making their families have great concern, and,  certainly, jeopardizing the security of the American people.   Our soldiers, most of all, we respect and honor, but we must do our  job. As we do that, it is important, as well, to recognize that our  work must go on.   Over the years, I have worked on any number of responses to improving  the quality of life of our young juveniles. On any given day, over  48,000 youth in the United States are confined in facilities away from  home as a result of the juvenile justice or criminal justice  involvement. In many instances, they are not assigned a particular  sentence and can stay incarcerated or detained until they are 21. Most  are held in restrictive correctional-style facilities, and thousands  are held without even having had a trial--no sentence.   Mr. Speaker, 92 percent of youth in juvenile facilities are in locked  facilities. According to a 2018 report, 52 percent of long-term secure  facilities, 44 percent of detention facilities, and 43 percent of  reception and diagnostic centers also use mechanical restraints like  handcuffs, leg cuffs, restraining chairs, straightjackets, with 40  percent of long-term secure facilities and detention centers isolating  youth in locked rooms for 4 hours or more.   In the State of Texas, we have had a long history with our foster  care system and our detention system where young people--juveniles-- have been abused, sexually assaulted, and other indignities, altering  them for life.   According to selected findings from the Juvenile Residential Facility  Census released in December 2018, 46 percent of all facilities reported  locking youths in their rooms. Among public facilities, 81 percent of  local facilities and 68 percent of State facilities reported locking  young people in sleeping rooms.   These young people are going to be the future leaders or the future  citizens, residents of this Nation. They will have to take their  rightful place.   This is wrong, and so I intend to introduce an omnibus reformation of  the juvenile justice system to reform it so that we can respond  appropriately to these 48,000-plus and really restore their lives.   I have already introduced legislation to ban solitary confinement,  and locking juveniles in their rooms, lockdown, is equal to that.   We don't know the altering factor in the development of these young  people. Studies have shown brains are not fully developed until the age  of 25, and yet we put on the brains of these young people under 25 in  the juvenile justice system the kinds of stimuli that would alter their  life forever.   We also want to address the question of juveniles having a future, to  ban the box of having to admit being arrested or in a juvenile  detention center.   Remember, most of these juveniles have not had trials. They have not  had due process. They don't have a sentence. They can remain in that  facility until, in many instances, the age of 21 if they came in at 12  or 14 a for nonviolent offense.   Then, of course, we need to find alternative places for juveniles to  be able to have wraparound services that really restore them to being a  full, young person who can enjoy life and get an education.   Many times when juveniles are in juvenile detention centers, their  educations are spotty, at best. They don't return to the school system,  and they are isolated and prone to dropping out.   Yes, families need help. Families wind up in the juvenile justice  system or the family court system out of desperation because we don't  have help for those families.   We need wraparound services, support services, that will encourage  and enhance family unity and the ability to address the needs of this  young person.   Maybe it is volatility, immaturity. Maybe it is a response to home  life. Maybe it is because there is drug abuse in the family or criminal  activity in the family, or maybe there is poverty in the family or one  parent struggling to raise a number of children.   We cannot abandon 48,000 children every year in this Nation, Mr.  Speaker, and so I will introduce the omnibus reform bill of the  juvenile justice system to ensure that we save and build the lives of  our young people.                            ____________________
