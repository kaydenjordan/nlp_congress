Response to congressional subpoenas.''.       SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to diminish       Congress' inherent authority or previously established       methods and practices for enforcing compliance with       congressional subpoenas, nor shall anything in this Act be       interpreted to establish Congress' acceptance of any asserted       privilege or other legal basis for noncompliance with a       congressional subpoena.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 4010, currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 4010, currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill comes to you, having been unanimously voted on  a recorded vote out of committee, but it has been a long time in coming  and it has a long history of its need. Both under Chairman Conyers,  during the last years of the Bush administration, and under my  chairmanship on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we  discovered a flaw in Congress' subpoena power.   Congress has, and has always had, and has been supported all the way  by the Supreme Court, the need to do oversight. With that, we issued  subpoenas. The enforcement of those subpoenas has come into conflict  over the last several years, both during Mr. Conyers' chairmanship when  he subpoenaed Harriet Miers to appear, and during my time when I  subpoenaed records by the Department of Justice. In both cases, the  administrations decided that it was appropriate to question the  standing and to delay.   Those delays were unfair to the body and unfair to the American  people because it denied them in any reasonable period of time the  effect of factfinding. This is not a partisan issue. It is, in fact, an  issue that has already been decided for the American people. Under the  Freedom of Information Act, if you do not receive documents within a  reasonable period of time, you have the right to go to court. You have  standing as a private citizen or an interest group, and the court will  decide what documents are appropriate for you to receive.   Yet this very question that was not once, but twice, defended by two  different administrations of two different parties calls into question  the ability in a timely fashion for Congress, the House or the Senate,  to receive the information or the appearance of a witness it needs. We  do not seek any new power under this legislation. We only seek an  expeditious review by a Federal judge of a claim, either for the  appearance of an individual or for documents appropriate to our  oversight.   For that reason, I am pleased that both Republicans and Democrats  within the committee saw fit to unanimously support this legislation.  We believe that it is measured and it is also time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to further echo the gentleman from New York's  comments. Mr. Nadler is right. We will often, almost unanimously, find  a way to disagree on what to look into at various times as a body. But  whether it is a Democratic chairman or Republican chairman looking into  something, whether it is a Republican administration or a Democratic  administration, it is clear that we must, in fact, if a subpoena is  issued, be able to enforce it in a timely fashion.   Under this legislation, it has a number of safeguards, but the most  important one is the three-judge panel that will review these, followed  by an expedited process at the U.S. Supreme Court.    I might note, the interesting history of the two cases Mr. Nadler and  I are talking about is one in which a Democratic chairman enforced a  subpoena, but had to go to a recently appointed Republican judge, who,  in a fairly reasonable period of time, reached the conclusion that:  one, the committee had standing, and the House had standing and; two,  that it was really without merit for the administration--then the Bush  administration--to claim this immunity, this newfound immunity.   Similarly, in a slightly longer period of time, but coincidentally, a  Republican chairman went before a freshly minted appointee of the very  President who was refusing to comply, and she reached the decision that  the documents were unfairly withheld and ordered them released.   So I think the interesting thing to all of us is the independence of  the judiciary has worked not once but twice. We only want to codify it  in a way that would cause the judiciary to have that opportunity in a  timely fashion, and for the people's right to know to be recognized in  that same expeditious fashion.   As Mr. Nadler said, the Senate has, for a long time, had a portion of  what we are doing here today. It is an oddity that two coequals have  not had the same ability during those many years since the late 1970s.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H8061]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge the House to pass this bill, move it to the  Senate in a timely fashion, and create an equal standing between the  House and the Senate as to enforcement of its subpoenas.   I join with my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr.  Swalwell), in the frustration that individuals often feel that they  have privileges in a vague sense that are not to be asserted, but  simply not to occur.   In the last administration, we have even had individuals claim that  they basically lied as little as they needed to, to protect some  question of a classified nature. These kinds of claims, in addition to  the law enforcement sensitive, confidential, and other security  clearance claims, which are not codified in statute, yet often are the  reason for delay or outright refusal to deliver documents, flies in the  face of the ability--sometimes behind closed doors, sometimes in  public--for Congress' ability to conduct oversight. I look forward to  this legislation becoming law, and I think I will close with just one  more item.   Mr. Nadler and I have served together as chairman and ranking member  for a number of years. We share something which is the many years that  we have been here in Congress, we have seen the frustration of both  parties trying to do their job against another branch that often takes  advantage of the natural rivalry between two different parties.   This legislation is designed to reduce that, to reduce the ability  for the executive branch or other outside groups to, if you will, take  advantage of the natural division between the two of us. After so many  years of being here, the one thing I have learned is that to diminish  the House's and the Senate's ability to represent the American people  is to diminish our Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
