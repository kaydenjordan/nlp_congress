 Mr. President, over the weekend, the State Department-- that is, our State Department--imposed visa restrictions on several  Ethiopian and Eritrean Government officials. They claim these officials  have not done enough to end the hostilities in the Tigray area.   Now, the Tigray area is in the northern part of Ethiopia, and it is  an area that is one of the very old parts of that continent.   First, we need to be clear. Everyone, especially the Ethiopian  Government, wants nothing more than a peaceful resolution to the  conflict in the Tigray, but this action puts the terrorist organization  TPLF--that is a terrorist organization--on equal status with the  Ethiopian Government. Now, that is unacceptable, and it is wrong. It is  outrageous that we have them in the same issue as if they are somehow  equals.   Let me say something to be 100 percent clear, to make sure no one can  misunderstand this, and that is that humanitarian atrocities are wrong  and have no place in our world. I am proud that Prime Minister Abiy of  Ethiopia has clearly stated that any atrocities are not condoned by the  government and those responsible will be held accountable. That is  going to happen.   To truly understand this issue and why putting the Ethiopian  Government on equal footing with the TPLF is so offensive and downright  wrong, you need to understand how we got here. Indulge with me in just  a little bit of history.   Now, I know the changes Ethiopia has seen over the last decade. Since  2005, I have visited Ethiopia 19 different times, engaging and  developing relationships with Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers,  legislators, businesspeople, aid workers, and everyone else in between.  I say this to show that I know Ethiopia probably better than anyone  else in this Chamber. But more than that, I know its history.   Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in all of Africa but one  that is newly democratic. That comes with problems, and we understand  that.   The current controversy and why we are here today started back in the  1970s with a man named Mengistu. From 1974 to 1991, Mengistu was the  leader of the Communist Derg. That is the Communist Party in Ethiopia.  This was the  [[Page S3487]]  controlling party at the time. It is a Communist Party. They ran  Ethiopia. It was a terrible time for Ethiopia. That was during one of  the worst famines they ever had on that continent or actually anywhere.  It killed over a million people. That might be the most significant  famine in history in terms of deaths.   Then, in 1991, the Communists were booted out. At the time that this  took place, one person who was responsible for the getting rid of the  Derg Communists and the Communist threat in Ethiopia was a guy named  Meles. He was a member of the Tigrayan political party.   Now, we got to know him quite well. He is the one who got communism  out of that part of the world. He ended up as Prime Minister. This is  really the election that a lot of people don't like, and they forget  about the fact that he was the Prime Minister who actually got rid of  the Communists in Ethiopia.   So he became the Prime Minister. He started to build democracy. He  died in 2012. I got to know him quite well during his lifetime, and I  saw the progress that he made and the advances that they made.   He was then replaced by another Prime Minister whose name is  Hailemariam. Now he became Prime Minister, and he continued to push for  democracy. Hailemariam worked diligently to improve things. Under his  tenure, Ethiopia established the Independent Ethiopian Human Rights  Committee that reported on violence and human rights problems, and it  was tremendously successful. They didn't just establish it; they acted  on it. They came out with a report and acted on it to hold perpetrators  accountable and to make the improvements that were being made at that  time. Our relationship wasn't just government-to-government; it was  brother-to-brother.   In February of 2017, Prime Minister Hailemariam suggested that since  the provinces were all fighting at one time--and at that time, there  were nine provinces in Ethiopia. Each province had a Governor. We  suggested on the phone with the Members of the Senate here in  Washington and the House prayer group in the House of Representatives  that what we ought to do is follow the recommendation of Eisenhower. We  are talking about former General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower. He  was a great, great President of the United States. This was right after  World War II. He said--this is a quote. I am quoting Eisenhower now. He  said:         The problems of this world are so great that we will never       resolve the problems until we learn to sit down and pray       together.    So we decided, let's all get the Governors, the Prime Minister,  Members of the House, Members of the Senate, and the rest all together,  and we will pray with them. We did this. In fact, we had five Senators  with me at that time, and we went over. The problem was, only two of  the Governors showed up, out of nine, so it didn't work.    Eight months later, we had occasion to be back there, and we put  together the same thing, but we talked to them to let them know--we  talked to the Governors at that time, the nine Governors who were in  Ethiopia. So we got them and explained what it was all about. The  Governors who had been fighting with each other and had been fighting  with Hailemariam all prayed together, and we were joined in prayer by  18 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. We were joined with  them by phone, and the Prime Minister and all of us, Members of the  Senate and others who were there, we all rejoiced and embraced each  other.   That was really significant. The nine Governors had never been  together before. They didn't like each other. They never had been in  the same room before. But most of the people didn't live in cities, and  that made this effort that much more difficult. The vast majority of  people who live there are in rural communities, and that made this  widespread change in development a longer and more difficult path.   In Ethiopia, the tribal factions also played a great role. If you go  from province to province, that used to be from tribe to tribe, and  they historically have not gotten along until this time. So it made it  more difficult because of the factions and all of that, but it worked.  We unified them together, and that was unlike anything that has ever  happened.   One of the Governors who was there at the time was named Dr. Abiy.  You might remember that name because he is now the Prime Minister of  Ethiopia. I have often said that Dr. Abiy is arguably the most  educated, the smartest guy I have seen in that position in--of the  entire continent of Africa. He is just a tremendous person.   We got them together at a leaders breakfast. We put something  together where he told the story of his journey in faith in Jesus. This  is Dr. Abiy.   We met a year later, where we prayed and talked about how to unify  the country in peace, not conflict. It is from these meetings that I  know Abiy is committed to democracy and committed to the future of  Ethiopia. He is showing that with his actions as well.   Abiy was elected Prime Minister in 2018 after active and spirited  protests against the existing ruling party, the Ethiopian People's  Revolutionary Democratic Front, which had run the country for almost 30  years. Abiy was elected by a country looking for fresh leadership. He  immediately took steps to create positive change. He promised unity and  reconciliation, and against all odds, he delivered. He passed liberal  democratic reforms, and he freed political prisoners and journalists.  Abiy even did what was once believed impossible: He negotiated a peace  treaty with Eritrea after decades of long cold war and was recognized  with a Nobel Peace Prize for his work. He was the recipient of a Nobel  Peace Prize for all the wonderful work he had done. That was in Africa.  It was a leading operation.   So how does all this play into the situation before us today? The  Ethiopian People's Democratic Front--the previous ruling party--is  dominated by people from Tigray, the area up north that we talked about  before, one of the regional provinces.   When Abiy set up a new governing body and focused on governing for  the whole of Ethiopia, and not just a few politically powerful regions,  the TPLF wasn't happy. That is the terrorist group. They felt like they  were losing the outsized influence that they held for decades and  decades.   They also weren't happy about the peace deal with Eritrea, the TPLF,  who were ruling Ethiopia in the 1990s when the bitter Eritrea-Ethiopian  conflict was going on. Decades later, they still feel aggrieved and  didn't want peace. The result, they started acting out.   In 2019, they started to refuse to participate in the new government  and the new ruling party. They expressed their frustration in more  overt and destabilizing ways. They held their own regional  parliamentary elections in September during the height of the  coronavirus pandemic instead of agreeing with the other provinces and  the Prime Minister that they should be postponed because of the  pandemic.   The militia affiliated with the TPLF--that is the terrorist group  that has been designated by the Ethiopian Parliament as a terrorist  group--attacked an Ethiopian army base in Mekelle on November 4 and  stole weapons there.   Let me restate this plainly. A regional party, TPLF, attacked a  government military base. The government rightfully responded, and the  regional terrorist group is well equipped and has been fighting back  and continuing the conflict for a long period of time now.   That is what is going on right now. That is the situation we find  ourselves in, and that is why it is astounding to me that our  government continues to treat this situation with both sides being  equal when clearly they are not. One side is the democratically elected  government, and the other side is a disgruntled faction that is  reacting with violence because they are no longer in power. It is a  terrorist group.   And again, the Ethiopian Government has been clear that they do not  condone any of the reported atrocities, and they will hold anyone who  commits atrocities accountable. We, the United States, need to continue  to engage Ethiopia and try to understand how what we are seeing today  is a product years in the making. It is not a simple matter of two  aggrieved parties. It is Prime Minister Abiy working to protect a  unified, peaceful, stable Ethiopia.   We should be talking to him about how we can help him restore peace,  not slapping punitive sanctions on his government--an action that does  nothing but demonstrate that we can't or won't  [[Page S3488]]  appreciate the history and the regional differences that lead to this  situation.   And I want to close by speaking to Prime Minister Abiy and our  friends in Ethiopia directly: Brother, I am with you. Those of us who  understand the history of what you are facing and what you are working  to support, we are with you, Prime Minister Abiy.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
