 Mr. President, I think we should be honest with ourselves  and the people around the world and present the reality of what Iran is  today.   Iran pursues a host of dangerous activities around the world that  threaten the United States, its interests, and its allies. It is  fomenting a proxy war in Yemen. It supports Hezbollah and Hamas. It  appears to be using its foothold in Syria to test Israel's defenses.  And in tragic irony, Iran supports the Syrian butcher Bashar al-Assad,  who has stooped to using chemical weapons and barrel bombs to kill his  own people. How a regime like the Iranian regime--whose own people  suffered under heinous chemical attacks from Iran during the Iran-Iraq  War--can stand behind Assad and Syria is incredible.   Having said that, we entered into an agreement with Iran to stop them  from developing a nuclear weapon. Despite all these other challenges  and all the differences we continue to have with Iran, we said that-- gathering together with allies around the world--we wanted to make  certain that Iran did not develop a nuclear weapon. There were lengthy  negotiations and agreements, which led to the nuclear agreement with  Iran to stop its development of nuclear weapons. I think it was a  critically important step forward because Iran with a nuclear weapon  would be a danger not only to Israel and the Middle East but also to  the world.   It was that agreement which I supported and which was overwhelmingly  supported by Democrats in the Senate when President Obama negotiated  it. The Republicans opposed it. The candidate for President on the  Republican side, Mr. Trump, said that it was a terrible agreement, and  he thought we should never have entered into it. He had all sorts of  derogatory things to say about the Iran nuclear agreement. But the fact  is, that agreement went in place and was implemented. International  inspectors were sent into Iran. Those inspectors enforced that  agreement and have reported to the United States--and personally to  Members of the Senate, including me--repeatedly that Iran is complying  with the terms of this agreement and is not developing a nuclear  weapon. For all of the differences we have with Iran, the facts and the  evidence are clear: They were living up to the terms of the nuclear  agreement so that they would not develop a nuclear weapon and threaten  Israel and that region of the world.   Despite the progress made by this agreement, today President Trump  announced his decision to halt the waiver of sanctions related to Iran  and the nuclear agreement--in essence, to step away from the agreement  and to say that the United States will no longer be party to it. That  nuclear agreement with Iran removed the threat of nuclear weapons being  used to pursue destabilizing Iranian activities. Just imagine how hard  and difficult it would be to push back on Iranian aggression if, in  fact, they had a nuclear weapon. The purpose of the agreement was to  avoid that possibility--the very agreement President Trump walked away  from today.   Because of this agreement, Iran's nuclear weapon program has been  stopped in its tracks. In fact, you have to go back over 10 years to  find any plans being made in Iran in the past to even consider it. The  agreement was working. International inspectors have unprecedented  access to Iran to watch for cheating. Iran does not have a nuclear  weapon or a quick breakout ability to make one. These are real  accomplishments toward world peace.   We live in a dangerous world. President Trump's decision today will  make it more dangerous. By eliminating U.S. participation in this  agreement to stop the development of nuclear weapons in Iran, we run  the real possibility that terrible things will follow--terrible things  that will cost human life and cause even more misery around this world.   Let's be clear. That agreement clearly states that ``Iran reaffirms  that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop, or acquire  any nuclear weapons.'' That is an unequivocal statement. And to ensure  that Iran never does, the agreement provided for ongoing inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency. They weren't just inspecting  the obvious places; they were inspecting the entire supply chain that  Iran would have to turn to to develop a nuclear weapon.   Ernest Moniz was Secretary of Energy under President Obama. He is a  physicist by training. He has received global recognition for his  expertise. He sat at the table because he knows what it takes to  develop a nuclear weapon. He put into this agreement which President  Trump is walking away from today the kind of access for inspection that  gives us the assurance that Iran cannot cheat, and if they tried, we  would catch them.   Anyone arguing that Iran is allowed to build a nuclear bomb under  this agreement after a certain period is simply wrong and misleading  the American people. I have met with IAEA Director General Amano  several times. Each time, I was very blunt and direct with him: Tell me  what your experience has been in Iran. Tell me, if your inspectors  wanted to go through a certain door, inspect a certain installation, go  inside a certain facility, were they stopped by Iran?   He told me: If we were stopped and protested, they opened the door.  We have never had a failure of access.   That is what he told me repeatedly, over and over again. He said the  same thing to Democratic Senators he spoke with--that Iran was in  compliance with the nuclear agreement and that IAEA inspectors were  able to resolve any  [[Page S2538]]  areas. Where they contested and said ``We should have access,'' they  were given access.   I hope President Trump will actually read this agreement. I wish he  had sat down and spent a few minutes with Inspector Amano before making  this fateful decision today. I know it is probably good political  theater for some to blast any international agreement or related effort  that was taken up by President Obama, but let me remind my colleagues  of other negotiations undertaken with troubling regimes that served our  national security interest.   It was President John Kennedy who negotiated with the Soviets during  the Cuban missile crisis, bringing us back from the brink of nuclear  war.   It was President Richard Nixon who negotiated with the Chinese on  normalizing relations, even while that Communist regime was providing  weapons to the North Vietnamese who were fighting our soldiers.   Of course, who can forget that it was President Ronald Reagan who  negotiated with the Soviets while that Communist nation had thousands  of nuclear warheads pointed at the United States of America? They were  occupying Eastern Europe, and they were supporting troubling regimes  around the world. Yet President Reagan sat down and negotiated with  them.   Let's recall how many on the right of the political spectrum savaged  President Reagan for negotiating with the Soviets on nuclear arms  reduction. Let me read an excerpt from the January 17, 1988, New York  Times about the opposition President Ronald Reagan faced in negotiating  an arms agreement with the Soviets--criticism eerily familiar to what  we have been hearing today from President Trump. Here is what they said  about President Reagan:         Already, right-wing groups . . . have mounted a strong       campaign against the INF treaty. They mailed out close to       300,000 letters opposing it. They have circulated 5,000       cassette recordings of Gen. Bernard Rogers, former Supreme       Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,       attacking it. And finally, they are preparing to run       newspaper ads this month savaging Reagan as a new Neville       Chamberlain, signing an accord with Hitler--    Of his day--       and gullibly predicting ``peace for our time.''    The conservative National Review's May 22, 1987, edition had a cover  titled ``Reagan's Suicide Pact.''   While opposed by some at the time, I doubt few in this Chamber on  either side of the aisle would look back today and say that President  Reagan's negotiations with the Soviets and the eventual agreement  weren't in the best interest of America's national security.   So here we are today with President Trump plunging us and our allies  into uncertainty when it comes to an Iranian nuclear weapon and the  credibility of America's word around the world. It is not very good  timing if we seriously hope to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula by  putting the American signature and name on the line in a negotiation to  stop the development of nuclear weapons in that area of the world.   What will President Trump do if Iran restarts its nuclear weapon  program? Is he prepared to face the prospects of another war in the  Middle East--a war with nuclear weapons? Certainly we will have no  inspectors there anymore if President Trump has his way, and that can  only set us back and open the door to the possibility of a nuclear Iran  in the future. Does that make America safer? Does that make the world  safer? Of course not. Is this just about undoing what President Obama  did, keeping some campaign promise, which, frankly, doesn't serve the  best interest of peace in the world or our own national security.   Mr. Trump and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who  support this move and are unwilling to speak against it, the situation  being created by walking away from the nuclear agreement with Iran is  now in your hands, on your watch. I hope something good can come from  this.   By all accounts, the American people overwhelmingly oppose what  President Trump did today. The American people know we live in a  dangerous world. They have heard over and over again about the  prospects of a nuclear attack from North Korea. The notion that Iran  would now develop a nuclear weapon does not make America feel any  safer, and by a margin of 2 to 1, they tell President Trump: What you  announced today was wrong. It does not make us any safer.   There have been many opportunities in this country to work together  on a bipartisan basis on foreign policy. Historically, that was almost  always the case--as it should be. Sadly, those days are behind us.  Instead, now it is straight partisanship. If President Obama wanted it,  President Trump happens to oppose it.    Look at the decision on the Paris climate agreement. That was an  agreement reached by every nation in the world, and President Trump  stepped away from it, saying: When it comes to climate change, the  United States does not want to engage in this global conversation.   When it came to healthcare in the United States, President Trump  said: I want to eliminate ObamaCare--eliminate the Affordable Care Act.  Across the United States, we are now seeing dramatic increases in  health insurance premiums because of President Trump's decision and the  opposition by Members of Congress on the Republican side against the  Affordable Care Act.   Now we are walking into a new territory. It is not just climate  change; it is not healthcare; it is the safety of this world. It is a  question about whether another nation will join the nuclear club--a  nation we have plenty of differences with.   We had an agreement, a good one. It was brokered by a group of  nations that were unlikely allies: China, Russia, Western European  nations, and the United States. Of course, that is an unusual grouping,  but they all agreed Iran should not have a nuclear weapon, and we moved  forward with an agreement that was working until this President, just 2  hours ago, came before the American people and said the United States  is walking away from that agreement.   Sadly, it is a reckless decision. It is a historic, tragic, and  reckless decision, which runs the risk of allowing this country, Iran,  to develop a nuclear weapon, threaten the region, and threaten the  world. We live in a dangerous world, and we need a President who  understands that.   I yield the floor.
