 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, before I turn to the main portion of my  remarks, I wish to speak briefly on the situation in the Middle East.   The protests across cities in Iran reflect the failed leadership of a  corrupt regime. The Ayatollah's negligence in denying the basic rights  of his own people is inexcusable. Instead of allocating resources to  care for families in need, the regime has chosen to use what economic  gains it has accrued through the Iran deal to fund terrorism and  sectarian violence in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the  region. I stand with the Iranian people in their demand for prosperity  and freedom, and I call upon my colleagues in Congress to do the same.
