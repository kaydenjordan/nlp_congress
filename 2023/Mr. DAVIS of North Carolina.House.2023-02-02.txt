 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  Black History Month.   It is particularly meaningful to me this year because I am so honored  to represent the great people of North Carolina's First Congressional  District.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today to celebrate the integral  roles that African Americans have played in every aspect of American  life. I stand on the shoulders of giants who came before me despite the  obstacles in their way and the glass ceilings they had to shatter.   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the ideals of Black History Month, I am  reminded of the legacy of my predecessors, like the Honorable Eva M.  Clayton, the first Black woman to represent North Carolina in the  Congress. She and others, all fighting the good fight of faith to  ensure young boys and girls can thrive in eastern North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, this moment is about taking a look at the past so that  we can better shape tomorrow.                            ____________________
