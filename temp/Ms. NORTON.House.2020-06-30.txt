 Mr. Speaker, this is one of the very few bills that is  moving forward during this pandemic, and it is named H.R. 2, which  means it was of great importance even before the pandemic.   The transportation bills we have been filing have been essentially  flat funded. It is time we put some money into our transportation  system. The last bill was no mere extension. Our last bill was  essentially that. There was no new funding on it. In fact, this bill  breaks new ground.   I have been on this committee ever since coming to Congress. Each  transportation bill looked essentially the same as the last. However,  with climate change, we can't write these bills in the same way.   You see attention to climate change throughout this bill. You see a  fund for greenhouse emissions. We have in this bill discretionary  grants for electric vehicles. That was unknown and unseen in the last  bill.   We are paying special attention to disadvantaged business  enterprises. We remember the George Floyd killing. We have not done a  good job with these enterprises in my own region. We found that  minority and women-owned firms were unlikely to receive contracts, even  if they seemed fully qualified.   And, of course, in this district, which staff and Members use to get  to the House, we have funding money for the Metropolitan Transit  Authority. Almost half of Federal employees in this region use Metro to  get to this very House.   Mr. Speaker, this bill breaks new ground, and this Congress should  indicate that it is ready for a 21st century bill.
