 Madam President, because it has been announced that we  have gone to the bill, it makes it necessary for me to ask to speak for  a few minutes, as in morning business, on a subject that is unrelated  to the bill before us.    Madam President, before I go to that subject, I just  heard Senator Schumer speak about the bill before the Senate, the  criminal justice reform bill, but he has left the floor now. I thank  him for his kind remarks and his backing of that bill--a very  overwhelmingly bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to be the  first major change in criminal justice legislation since the Clinton  era of the early 1990s.                            Tribute to Jill Kozeny    Madam President, throughout my 38 years in the U.S. Senate, I have  come to the floor tens of thousands of times. I have come to vote, to  give speeches, to manage bills, and to debate issues that impact Iowans  and the American people. As all of us do, I also vote from the Senate  floor. Since 1981, I have cast 12,800 votes on behalf of Iowans. I take  pride that I haven't missed a single vote since 1993. In fact, I hold  the longest consecutive voting streak in Senate history. Since my  reelection to a seventh term, I am now the longest serving U.S. Senator  from Iowa.   It is the privilege of my life to represent my home State. I wake up  every day being grateful to work another day for my fellow Iowans. I am  also grateful for the service, dedication, and loyalty of my Senate  staff, who work every day to help me to serve Iowans. The work of my  staff is what brings me to the Senate floor today. I am here to pay  tribute to an extraordinary staffer who is also an extraordinary  individual.   Jill Kozeny has served on my staff for the last 30 years. To put that  in perspective, she has worked on behalf of Iowans and the American  people for more than half of her life and has done that right here in  the Senate. Jill is a patriot and a public servant and has a servant's  heart through and through.   They say all good things come to an end, and at the end of the 115th  Congress, Jill Kozeny, my chief of staff, will close this incredible  chapter in her life.   After graduating from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the  Omaha native worked for Nebraska Senator David Karnes. Then she applied  to be my assistant press secretary. I offered her the job. At first,  she turned it down. She said she had decided she wanted to attend law  school. Yet 24 hours later, she called back. She had changed her mind  and wanted to come to work for me. She never looked back. Nebraska's  loss was Iowa's gain.   Jill first joined my Senate staff in 1989. She arrived to Hart 135  under the name of Jill Hegstrom. After having worked for 30 years for  the people of Iowa, I would say Jill more than qualifies as an honorary  Iowan. In fact, she was married in Des Moines to Tom Kozeny, her  husband. As many of my colleagues know, for the last 38 years, I have  held a meeting in each of Iowa's 99 counties--at least 1 every year-- and for the last 30 of those years, Jill has staffed hundreds of those  county meetings and Q and A's along the way. This is where the rubber  meets the road--in sitting down and talking to Iowans and in meeting  Iowans in their hometown communities to hear their concerns and doing  it face-to-face.   Day after day, Jill Kozeny has worked her tail off to make sure that  our office and my staff have addressed the concerns of Iowans. Whatever  uncertainty Jill had before joining my staff has evaporated completely  through these years. Her confidence and her competence have grown as  she has risen through the ranks. As press secretary and director of  communications, she worked for years in leading my communications  staff. She developed respect, trust, and credibility with reporters,  and that is hard to do in this town. A request for information from  even a weekly newspaper in Iowa was treated as importantly as one from  a national correspondent or a television news anchor.   Jill has been a loyal and trusted adviser to me and a trusted leader  and mentor to my entire staff. In 2013, when the job opened up, I  didn't hesitate to hire her to lead my office as chief of staff. Jill's  tenure as a trusted and loyal adviser truly understates the depth of  her contribution and service over these many years. At every turn, she  has gone the extra mile--above and beyond the call of duty--to make  sure my office has operated effectively and efficiently for Iowans.  With Jill at the  [[Page S7741]]  helm, I have never once had to worry if the office has been working the  way ``Grassley works.'' Those two words, ``Grassley works,'' are famous  in Iowa because they have been my campaign slogan since 1978.   Jill has set a tone of professionalism, courtesy, fairness, and  integrity. As chief of staff for 15 staffers in Iowa and 25 here in  Washington, Jill has set a tone of camaraderie, collegiality, respect,  and confidence. Just ask members of my current staff or even people who  had left my staff, maybe, 10 years ago about Jill Kozeny or ask her  work colleagues in the press corps. They describe Jill's reputation and  work ethic as dependable, substantive, thorough, and exemplary.  Reporters say she is fair, patient, professional, and has ``set no  better standard.''   She has known how to build policy coalitions and how to navigate  high-stakes political dramas that require a thick skin and a shrewd  intelligence. It is a pressure cooker here in Washington, DC, on any  day, and Jill has never rattled. Throughout her service, Jill's  leadership has been instrumental in advancing the important legislative  achievements and oversight work, including the historic tax cuts and  the judicial confirmations achieved just this Congress. She has served  as a pivotal political adviser to me in my last four political  campaigns as well.   Without a shadow of a doubt, I will miss having her by my side. I  have total confidence in her ability and complete trust in her advice.  As Jill has shared with staff through the years, I quote her: ``I grew  up in the Grassley `cut-your-teeth school of work ethic,' where  anonymity and hard work are the most effective way to serve and be  effective.''   For over 30 years, she has mentored scores of employees, from interns  to entry-level staffers, to the most senior investigators and attorneys  in my office. Both current and former staff have counted on her counsel  and leadership. They say she has offered uncommon grace, goodness, and  guidance. Jill has brought joy to the job, and it has shown in her work  product and our workplace. She has been a highly skilled communicator,  well organized, very articulate, and gracious. There is no other way to  say it. For 30 years, Jill has brought 100-percent devotion to this job  and 100-percent devotion to the people of Iowa, and I would have to  say, without equivocation, that she has made me a better Senator.   As a chief of staff in the U.S. Senate, Jill has reached the highest  rungs of the congressional staff ladder on Capitol Hill. She has made  her mark in these marbled hallways and has done so with an unassuming  anonymity, with competence, and with a confidence that has been hard  earned but has been very well deserved.   My staff has become like family to one another. After so many years  of working together at all hours of the day--you might say 365 days a  year for the last 30 years--the professional relationship that I have  grown to value tremendously has evolved into a warm friendship that  Barbara, my wife, and I have valued even more. Capitol Hill staffers  know that this workplace and its work pace are all-consuming. Yet life  marches on. It is a true joy to share in the joys of life that my staff  share with one another and with Barbara and me.   Without a doubt, Jill takes pride in her work. After a long day's  work, Jill goes home to her most cherished pride and joy. Jill and Tom,  her husband, are proud parents to three beautiful children. Mary is a  sophomore in high school, and their twin boys, Andrew and Teddy, are in  the seventh grade. As Jill once said, ``a full nest is best.''   Barbara and I have had opportunities to attend a couple of the boys'  baseball games. They are very good athletes. They bring this same  determined mindset to the game as their mom does to her job. As one of  the boys approached the batter's box, he purposely tapped his bat to  the underside of his cleats. Clear-eyed and laser-focused, it was  obvious the steely, competitive spirit was inherited from Mom.   The sense of family and friendship was manifested, more than ever, on  that famous day we refer to as 9/11. Shortly after 11 a.m. that  morning, Barbara and I, along with dozens of staff members from the  office, took refuge in Jill's home near Capitol Hill. It is a day we  will never forget for so many reasons, one of which is how Jill opened  up her home because everybody needed a place to go because you couldn't  go anyplace else.    When terrorism struck the Nation's Capital, Jill Kozeny showed grace  under fire. As usual, she set the tone: Keep calm and carry on.   Earlier this year, Jill woke up very early to catch an international  flight to China. She and another staffer were joining me on a  congressional trade trip. As she prepared to leave for the airport, she  smelled smoke. It turned out that the neighbor's house next door was on  fire, but it affected her home as well. After putting out fires for 30  years in the Grassley office, Jill, also known as, as we call her in  our office, not CEO, but COE--chief of everything--she jumped into the  crisis mode and got her family safely outside. But she also had that  flight to catch, so she left the substantial mess--tremendous smoke  damage and inconvenience--in the capable hands of her husband.   I would like to express my gratitude to Jill's family because they  also participate in this thing we call public service, which is a noble  calling. It often requires unsung sacrifice from family members, as  happened on that day last April.   Although Jill wasn't on my staff when I was elected to the House of  Representatives, she knows I admired my predecessor. He represented  Iowa's Third District--Congressman H.R. Gross--for 26 years. His  approach to constituent service was legendary. He once advised me in  the first days of my membership in the House of Representatives that if  a little old lady called and wanted her toenails trimmed, well, clip  her toenails. Throughout my public service, I have used that as a  benchmark.   I have worked to uphold the highest standard of constituent service  in representative government, and it takes a person's staff--people  like Jill--to help get that job done. Throughout her service to me and  to the people of Iowa, Jill Kozeny has fulfilled and exceeded this  expectation that Congressman H.R. Gross set for me, including my  priority to respond to every Iowan who writes or calls into my office.  Some days, constituent correspondence may seem like the movie  ``Groundhog Day,'' but it is the way ``Grassley Works.'' And Jill has  ingrained and managed this philosophy with my staff throughout her  years of service.   In closing, I have a message for my chief of staff. Honestly, I am  sad to see her go. At the same time, I am happy for her. Considering  all that she has done and sacrificed for the people of Iowa and, more  importantly, for me, I wish her the very best.   I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your loyalty and service.  Barbara and I extend our warmest wishes to you and your family. It is  hard to think about the passing of the baton. You have had a remarkable  run in the Senate. May God bless you as you blaze a new trail. I have  no doubt it will be extraordinary.   Being extraordinary runs in Jill's veins.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 730, H.R. 6615.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Alexander amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Reserving the right to object, I would like to explain  my--make a point before I object.   This amendment is inconsistent with current Federal law and would  allow States the right to break existing law. If there is an attempt to  legalize across the country, we should have that debate and let the  Congress decide the issue instead of creating a back door to  legalization.   Furthermore, the amendment would allow financial institutions to bank  marijuana distributors. This is inappropriate to consider in the  context of a criminal justice reform bill. Criminal justice is not a  vehicle through which we create reform for banks to create more  business.   The Senator from Colorado is very much an advocate for the people in  his State. I understand that. I respect his position. He works hard on  this, and he may be ahead of the time when there will be a real debate  on this, and maybe there will be, at that point, an opportunity to  consider his approach as something lesser than the legalization of  marijuana generally.   For those reasons, I will object to what the Senator from Colorado is  trying to accomplish.    Mr. President, before we go to the amendments, I want  to give a general overview of what it took to get to the point at which  we are now.   The first thing we had to do was show the leader we could produce 60  or more votes for this bill. This is a big bipartisan bill. Senators  Durbin, Lee, Graham, Booker, and I--and I suppose I am leaving out some  people--had spoken extensively with our colleagues to address their  concerns and to gain their support. As we saw last night, more than 80  Senators showed that they were ready for the debate in the culmination  of this bill on the Senate floor.   The next step we had to take was to show the people we had broad  bipartisan support. On November 15, the FIRST STEP Act was introduced  in the Senate. At that point, we had 12 cosponsors. We now have 38  cosponsors.   Of course, the question that always comes up is, Will the House of  Representatives take any action if we are successful on the floor of  the U.S. Senate? Every step of the way, the House was read in on the  Senate bill. The leaders in the House of Representatives, who happen to  be Representative Collins, Representative Jeffries, and, of course,  Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee, were all strong partners  in this compromise.   We have reached a point with the House of Representatives at which,  when the Senate passes this bill--and hopefully we will--Speaker Ryan  will be ready to act on this bill. We don't have problems with the  House of Representatives as sometimes come up late in a session like we  are in--hopefully, the last week of this Congress. We know what we are  spending our time doing will be considered by the House of  Representatives.   About 3 or 4 weeks ago, we had a Republican caucus, and we listened  to the concerns our colleagues had. We were asked to show more  Republican support within the Congress. So, with several changes that  were made in the bill in the last 3 or 4 weeks, we addressed our  Republican colleagues' concerns--the same ones that were raised in our  caucus. We did this, obviously, because we wanted to gain support for  our bill. The concern among Republicans was that the caucus was divided  to the point that more of a majority was against the bill than for the  bill. I think, with the answers we had from colleagues, as we  individually talked to them about their support for the bill, we gained  that support.   We also had to show support from outside the Congress of the United  States. I have here, without reading any names, just broad bipartisan  support from conservative organizations. At the same time, there are a  lot of law enforcement organizations and liberal organizations, and I  will just name four or five at this point: The Fraternal Order of  Police, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative  Union, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.  [[Page S7778]]    We had to show the colleagues in the Congress that we had broad  support from, you might say, the extreme right to the extreme left in  support of this legislation. I don't know whether we have had  legislation like this before the U.S. Senate, whereby we have put  together such diverse groups of people and organizations that support  the bill.   Of course, once we had gone through this hard work of getting this  bill where it is now on the Senate floor, it was very legitimate for  our colleagues to ask: Is the President going to sign it? We worked  very closely with the House of Representatives and had even made some  changes at the House's suggestion. We also talked to individual Members  of the Senate, and the House knew what some Senators had concerns  about.   We got admonition from the President and the White House to change  some things to bring the President on board. We now have a person who  has a reputation for being tough on crime but also a person who  recognizes that within our criminal justice system and the prison  system and the way judges have to make decisions under mandatory  minimums, there is some unfairness. We have a President who may now be  seen by a large part of this country as being somebody who not only  wants to be tough on crime but be fair on crime.   The President of the United States had a news conference when we put  the original bill together, but it was before the fine-tuning, which I  have already talked about, to get additional Members' support. At the  end of the news conference, at which many Members of the House and  Senate were present, the President said, I have my pen ready to sign  this bill.   If anybody has any doubt whatsoever about whether the President is  for this bill, I am telling you what I heard from his own words--that  he has a pen ready to sign this bill. So I hope nobody comes up here  and wonders, what does the President of the United States think about  this bill? I heard him say it.   So I hope we have a Senate majority--particularly, the Senate  majority. When you have an opportunity to have the President of the  United States, who is tough on crime but understands there has to be  some fairness to it, that the majority party in the U.S. Senate would  support the President of the United States--I hope that is what they  will think about as they cast these votes on these amendments that we  are soon going to have.   I think it is fair to say that as we proceeded over the last 4 years  to get a piece of legislation like this, they would be skeptical about  this President. But don't be skeptical anymore, because this President  gives this bill his full backing.   This is an opportunity for a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate  to show that this Republican President can do something that even  President Obama couldn't get done, because this was a big issue in the  last Congress, but we couldn't get it here to the Senate. So the  Congress can deliver a big bipartisan legislative accomplishment for  President Trump with the passage of this bill.   I have just described to my colleagues how the legislative process is  supposed to work--one on one. How do you eat 10,000 marshmallows? One  at a time. How do you get support for a bill? One person at a time, and  that is pretty much what the Republican supporters of this bill have  been trying to do. Why do it? To placate the honest interests of people  in our caucus that raised those same concerns 3 weeks ago.   So this is how the legislative process works. You work in a  bipartisan way to build support for your policy and debate it on the  floor of the Senate.   Later on I will ask for support for a unanimous consent request.    The Senator from Louisiana is ready to object to what I  am doing.   I am going to ask unanimous consent, but before anybody objects, I  would like to make, maybe, a 1-minute statement on the reason for my  unanimous consent request.   I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4132 be made pending and  agreed to.   This is why I ask that. This amendment ensures that faith-based  groups can operate in Federal prisons to help prisoners turn over a new  leaf. It also excludes dangerous criminals from earning time credits.  Finally, it extends the independent review committee from 2 years to 5  years, and it also requires an annual report.   Now, I have had a little bit of conversation with Senator Cotton, the  main opponent of our legislation, and Senator Kennedy as well. I think  that everything that is in amendment No. 4132 is something that at  least every Republican ought to support, and I think a large part of  the Democrats support it. As far as I can tell, from reading the point  of view of my friend from Arkansas on some of these amendments, this  point about extending the independent review committee from 2 years to  5 years and requiring an annual report is about the only part of this  amendment No. 4132 that Senator Cotton disagrees with. I don't know why  he would disagree with an independent review that could be done over a  period to go on from 2 to 5 years, because there is going to be  periodic decisions made in the meantime, and there is an annual report.   That is what this amendment does, and I hope we can get it adopted.    Mr. President, before I speak, I think we need to give  the Senator from Arkansas another 2 minutes because he was speaking on  the wrong amendment that is before the Senate.    It is the victims notification amendment.    Mr. President, before I take my 2 minutes in opposition  to this amendment, for the leader I ask unanimous consent that the  votes following the first vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  This amendment is unnecessary. This amendment is duplicative of  requirements already enacted into law under the Crime Victims' Rights  Act.   Current law requires notification to crime victims who choose to be  notified. It allows others to opt out to avoid being retraumatized.  This would change the law to require victim notification, which could  retraumatize victims who choose not to be notified.   This is not a victim-centered approach. It is a heavyhanded violation  of a victim's choice. This amendment would require notification even if  the victim doesn't want it, raising the specter of retraumatizing a  victim who has tried to move on with their life.   This is not a victim-centered approach. It is a heavyhanded  government violation of a victim's choice. Victims' rights groups  oppose this amendment for this reason.   The public notice mandates create a series of new bureaucratic, big- government requirements and a new unfunded mandate for the Bureau of  Prisons.   So I will vote against this amendment. To support my reasons, I will  quote a whole list of conservative groups: the American Conservative  Union, FreedomWorks, Right on Crime, R Street Institute, Jessica  Jackson's group, U.S. Justice Action Network, and a whole host of  groups like that.   Heritage Action scores it   We have from the victims' rights groups, Crime Survivors for Safety  and Justice, fairness, dignity, and respect for crime victims and  survivors, and the National Coalition of Police and Prosecutors warns  of hostile amendments.   I am going to end by simply stating what you heard me say in my  opening remarks before this--that we have a chance to send a bill to  the President. In his news conference, he said that he is ready to sign  it. We have a President who is tough on crime, but he wants to be fair  on crime. The bill we put together with the White House does that. I  ask you to vote no.    As we talked about the earlier amendment, we talked a  great deal on the previous amendment about victim's notification. There  is also a victim's notification in this amendment as well. So I don't  want to go into--the arguments are the same. Remember, victim rights  groups oppose this amendment because it is covered by current law.   So I want to spend my time on talking in opposition to this amendment  from the standpoint of granting wardens veto authority over what this  law sets up as an objective, evidence-based system--or you could call  it a risk assessment system--in the act to make sure that we have a  good foundation for determining whether somebody is a risk to society  if they take advantage of this program and to do it in a studied way.  Once that is set up, then this amendment would allow a warden to veto  it.   If a low- or minimal-risk inmate works hard to make themselves ready  to be productive citizens and community leaders or members, then they  ought to reap the rewards of that work under the FIRST STEP Act and not  have a person step in who could put bias into the system and human  error into the system. We are trying to set up a system to get away  from it, because this legislation is all about bringing fairness to the  prison system and to the judicial system as well.   How much time do I have left?    I am done.   Did you say 2 seconds?    OK. Vote against the amendment.    Mr. President, if I had 2 minutes the last time, I  should have had more than 2 seconds left over.    No, I can't do that.   Let's see if we can keep our bipartisan coalition together to pass a  bill that the President said he is ready to sign. That is what he said  at the end of his news conference. It is pretty important to  understand, this is something the President is behind. So we are facing  a very serious vote on this next one.   Obviously, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment is  very finely tailored to scare you that if you don't vote for this  amendment, you are going to have somebody out on the street, contrary  to the intent of this law, who is going to commit some awful act.  Remember, this law is centered on those people who are the least  violent people who are in prison already.   Don't be scared by what you have heard about this amendment--it is  unnecessary--because the system that is set up by the FIRST STEP Act  itself renders dangerous and violent criminals ineligible for the  benefits available to low-level offenders under this bill. We are only  going to help low-level offenders.   This tactic that is being used to scare you into voting for this  amendment and then into destroying the bipartisan cooperation we have  gotten in order to get this bill passed undermines the goal of  incentivizing low-level offenders to prepare themselves to be  productive on reentry.   My 2 minutes are up already?    Will you vote against the amendment, please?    Will you vote against the amendment, please?    Mr. President, I have asked to be notified before any  unanimous consent agreement to process this bill because I oppose S.  281, the Fairness in High-Skilled Immigrants Act. High-skilled  immigrants are a benefit to the United States. We welcome those  talented individuals from across the world who can supplement our own  domestic labor workforce. In Iowa, we have seen the benefit of high- skilled immigrant doctors, healthcare professionals, and medical  specialists who serve our rural communities. These immigrants provide  quality healthcare and immerse themselves in our communities. In turn,  Iowans welcome them with open arms. I look forward to improving the  integrity of our  [[Page S7783]]  H-1B program through regular order in a bipartisan manner. However, I  have strong objections to S. 281 or the Fairness in High-Skilled  Immigrants Act.   This bill would eliminate the per country numerical limitation for  employment-based immigrants and increase the per country numerical  limitation for family-based immigrants from 7 percent to 15 percent of  the total number of family-sponsored visas. It would also do nothing to  improve serious problems in our H-1B visa program. In fact, it does not  address any employer abuses, fraud, protections for American workers or  protections for the H-1B workers themselves.   Congress must deal with the visa backlog issue, but this bill is a  bandaid over a bullet hole that I fear will lead to unintended  consequences. First, eliminating the per country caps will not  necessarily clear out the backlog. Inevitably, with tens of thousands  of people waiting in line, a backlog will ensue from a processing  standpoint regardless of whether or not there are per country caps.  Second, this bill does not replace the per country caps with any sort  of metric-based system or order. This is problematic at best. Of  course, an immigrant's country of origin should not dictate their place  in line for visas, but surely a clear corresponding domestic labor  demand should.   Members on both sides of the aisle have said they are committed to a  merit-based immigration system. Certainly then, if we eliminate per  country caps, we should have a merit-based system that prioritizes not  based on country of origin, but on what jobs need to be filled and a  showing that there are not enough Americans to fill that position. Some  of my colleagues have proposed a points-based system. I believe this  could be a good starting point. Ultimately, however, a replacement  system for the per country limitations should be discussed and fully  vetted through hearings and debate. I am willing to work with any  Member, Democrat or Republican, including the proponents of this bill,  to create a smarter and fairer system.   President Trump and congressional Republicans promised the American  people that we would address chain migration, but this bill does not do  that. Instead, it more than doubles family-sponsored visas but does not  limit this privilege to the nuclear family. Before we talk about  expanding family-sponsored visas, we should right-size immigration in a  manner that balances domestic economic demand with American values.  Limiting family-sponsored visas to spouses, children, and elderly  dependent parents seems both fair and prudent.   Finally, this bill does not include overdue reforms to our H-1B visa  program. This bill does not include any safeguards, such as requiring  employers to recruit American workers prior to hiring an H-1B worker  and increasing wages for H-1B workers. Too often we have seen employers  undercut wages for U.S. workers by intentionally classifying H-1B  workers at a lower wage level for the work they are performing. This  bill also ignores harms that befall the H-1B workers, many of whom are  underpaid, vulnerable to abuse, and frequently placed in poor working  conditions. There is bipartisan agreement that we need to address the  visa backlog and H-1B reform. I look forward to working with any of my  colleagues on this effort in the next Congress.                            ____________________
