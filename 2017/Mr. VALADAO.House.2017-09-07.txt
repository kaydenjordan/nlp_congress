 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which ensures critical funding for ongoing demining projects in  Nagorno-Karabakh.   As a result of land mines laid during the Nagorno-Karabakh war, the  men, women, and children of the region have lived their lives under the  constant threat of crippling injury or death from an exploding mine.  Not only have many families in Nagorno-Karabakh lost loved ones as a  result of land mine accidents, families have had their entire  livelihoods destroyed from economic and societal consequences.   Since 2000, the HALO Trust, an organization dedicated to restoring  communities threatened by various weapons of war, has cleared more than  approximately 90 percent of the minefields scattered throughout  Nagorno-Karabakh. According to the organization, $8 million will be  required to make the region mine-free by 2020. My amendment will help  secure $1.5 million to be used as an important downpayment for this  effort.   Mr. Chairman, ensuring families in Nagorno-Karabakh can live without  fear of land mine accidents is indisputable, and I urge my colleagues  in the House of Representatives to support my amendment.
