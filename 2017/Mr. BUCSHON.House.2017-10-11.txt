 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true champion for  higher education, Dr. Daniel J. Bradley, the 11th president of Indiana  State University.   During his 9-year tenure at Indiana State, Dr. Bradley has led ISU to  achieve the highest enrollment in school history, added new degree  programs to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce, and  completed more than $300 million in capital projects on the campus.  Most importantly, Dr. Bradley has improved student success by  increasing the student retention rate and increasing the student  graduation rate.  [[Page H7928]]    From his service to our country in the U.S. Army to his service to  the students of Indiana State University, I urge my colleagues to join  me in congratulating Dr. Bradley on his retirement at the end of this  year.                            ____________________
