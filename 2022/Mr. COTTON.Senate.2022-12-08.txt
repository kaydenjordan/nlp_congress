 Mr. President, part of China's strategy to defeat the  United States includes unfairly helping corporations buy out American  companies. We can prevent these propped-up companies from gobbling up  American businesses, but we don't always know which companies China  subsidizes or by how much.   A bill I introduced with Congressman Fitzgerald, the Foreign Merger  Subsidy Disclosure Act, would require companies to disclose any  subsidies they receive from foreign adversaries before a merger. If a  company has received subsidies from a nation like Russia or China, U.S.  antitrust regulators can use that information to determine whether or  not the merger is fair. This bill has support from Republicans and  Democrats, the administration, and the House of Representatives.   We should pass this package of bills today to protect American  businesses and consumers and to stop China's economic war against the  United States.   I yield to the Senator from Utah.
