 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Edna Morris,  who recently joined our Lord in Heaven.   During my time as a Smith County judge, I had the pleasure of working  directly with Edna, an optimistic, gentle, and patient woman who  treated everyone around her with kindness.   Edna was devout in her faith and firmly knew that her eternal future  was rooted in it. She never worried. Edna consistently encouraged those  around her to see the good in every situation, and she led by example.   She persevered through many obstacles and lived a full life,  passionately serving her community in any way that she could, from  serving Smith County as chief deputy of elections to helping in her  church office, to volunteering at her granddaughter's school.   In a world where people have the choice to be anything, she always  chose to be kind.   Edna will be missed deeply by me and so many others in Smith County.  My prayers are with her family, friends, and all who were blessed to  know her.                            ____________________
