 Mr. President, last week, President Biden met with top  congressional leaders to talk about the debt ceiling. This meeting came  4 months after the United States hit the debt limit and just a few  weeks before a potential default.   Considering the high stakes in this looming debt crisis, it is  remarkable that it took this long for the President to sit down with  the four leaders and to talk about how to solve this problem together.  A debt default, of course, would set off an unprecedented economic  crisis and inflict real pain on families all across the country.   We all know our economy is just trying to get back on its feet after  COVID. Our banking system has endured three high-profile collapses, and  inflation continues to wreak havoc on family budgets. If the United  States defaults on its debt, those challenges will only intensify. And  that is an understatement. Social Security and Medicare benefits could  be delayed. Members of the military and Border Patrol would be left  without a paycheck. We would see our economy reeling--skyrocketing  mortgage rates, sinking stock prices, and instability across our  economy.   Given the already fragile state of the economy, default is the very  last thing we need. Fortunately, that is a point of agreement between  the parties. I haven't heard anybody say it would be a good idea for us  to default.   But the $31.7 trillion question is, What does the path forward look  like?   As the American people know, the Republican position is not shrouded  in mystery. My Republican colleagues and I have said over and over that  a clean debt ceiling increase is not an option. It simply doesn't have  the votes to pass the House or the Senate, making it a nonstarter. So  we should move on.   In order to have a chance of passing both Chambers of Congress, a  debt ceiling increase must come with some spending reforms. You would  think President Biden, after all of his years serving in the Senate,  now as President of the United States, would understand that $31.7  trillion in debt is unsustainable. That is just common sense. But the  President has dragged his feet for the last 4 months, saying he would  not negotiate--until now. It looks like he, grudgingly, is  acknowledging that he has to negotiate, which he knew or should have  known all along.   Thanks to the leadership of Speaker McCarthy, the House of  Representatives passed a bill last month to avert the debt crisis. I  think President Biden actually thought that the Speaker of the House  would be unsuccessful in passing any increase in the debt ceiling, so  he was happy to sit back, hoping that they would fail and then they  would come running to him and agree to his demands. But by passing the  House bill, they put the ball in President Biden's court and put the  onus on him to drop his ``no negotiations, no reforms'' position, which  was absolutely ridiculous in the first place.   For months, the President has said he won't negotiate. He ruled out  negotiations over any spending reforms, even though he signed into law  trillions of dollars in new debt which has caused us to come to this  juncture in the first place. He said he expects Congress to raise the  debt ceiling with no conditions attached and let the runaway spending  spree continue.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: If you maxed out your  credit card, your credit union or your bank is going to say: Well, if  you want an increase in your spending limit, you are going to have to  talk to us about how you are going to pay this money back.   Those are the sorts of conversations that would occur in our daily  lives, and those are the sorts of conversations that the President  should have started to have 4 months ago.   Before the President's meeting with congressional leaders last week,  his advisers parroted saying his ``no negotiations, no reforms''  message. The White House insisted time and time again that the  President wouldn't drop his demand for a clean debt ceiling increase.   Now we have seen a massive shift in the President's rhetoric. I am  actually grateful that he's made that shift in his rhetoric because his  earlier position was completely irresponsible and unsustainable. But,  now, over the weekend, the President was asked about the status of  conversations with Republicans about the debt ceiling. He said:         It is never good to characterize a negotiation in the       middle of a negotiation.   [[Page S1662]]     So there he goes using the ``N'' word, ``negotiation,'' when he said  he wouldn't negotiate.   And while he offered no insight into the discussions themselves, the  fact that he described them as negotiations actually marks a major  turning point. After insisting for months that he wouldn't negotiate,  the President has finally caved in, as we knew he ultimately would. He  has finally accepted the inevitable reality that a bipartisan  compromise is the only way to avoid a debt crisis. But that has been  obvious from day one.    We have a Democrat majority in the Senate, a Republican majority in  the House, and a Democrat in the White House. We know that in order to  pass a bill, all three branches--two branches of Congress and the  executive branch--would have to agree on something. So by definition,  it has to be bipartisan. That is the baseline for success in divided  government.   It really is baffling why it took so long for the President to come  to terms with this reality, particularly given his long experience as a  Member of this body, the U.S. Senate. But I am glad he got off the  sidelines, finally, and now is at the negotiating table with Speaker  McCarthy.   Reportedly, White House and congressional aides worked over the  weekend trying to identify the framework for a deal; and the President,  as I said, will meet with congressional leaders again today.   The White House is projecting a great deal of optimism, and I hope  that is warranted. I mean, I hope that means they will come with a  serious offer. But we still have a long way to go because once a deal  is reached, there is still going to be a lot of work that needs to be  done.   First, the agreement needs to be translated into legislative  language. Once the bill is completed, Members need time to review it,  then the bill has to pass both Chambers of Congress. This is a process  that can occur over several days or much longer. But remember,  Secretary Yellen said the United States can default as early as June 1,  which is 16 days away.   With this as a backdrop, President Biden is planning to hop on a  plane to Japan tomorrow. We are 2 weeks away from a potential economic  disaster--largely of the President's own making for taking his  ridiculous ``no negotiation'' stance for the last 4 months--but we are  2 weeks away from potential economic disaster, bipartisan discussions  have begun, and the President is still planning to go overseas.   The President spent months refusing to negotiate. He said he wouldn't  even entertain the idea of negotiations to avoid a debt crisis. Now the  President is at the negotiating table. This isn't a time to get up,  walk away, and jump on Air Force One and go overseas. You can't fly  half way around the globe just as negotiations are gaining momentum,  because as he accurately said, the United States cannot default on its  debts over the next 2 weeks. So it is crunch time. It is time to roll  up their sleeves, get to work, and to work this out.   Speaker McCarthy and the House of Representatives have been ready to  negotiate since the beginning, but the President wasted months that  could have been spent on hashing out a bipartisan compromise to avoid a  debt crisis. And he knew it from the very beginning that, ultimately,  he would have to negotiate. So now is the time for the President to  take this crisis seriously and to own his responsibility to negotiate a  successful outcome.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of quorum.
