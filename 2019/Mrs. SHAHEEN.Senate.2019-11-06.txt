 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my  concern and my disappointment over the decision by the President to  formally withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.   Though the President announced this decision over 2 years ago, this  past Monday marked the first day his administration could send a letter  to the United Nations formalizing the year-long withdrawal process. Of  course, we know that they did that.   American leadership on climate action is being ceded to other  countries before our very eyes. With this move, the President is  betraying the trust of the American people and betraying the trust of  our international allies in the fight against climate change.   Climate change is a very real and present threat to our environment,  to our national security, to our economy, to our health, and to our  very way of life. That is why I introduced the International Climate  Accountability Act, to prevent the President from using funds to  withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. This  bipartisan bill would also require the administration to develop a  strategic plan for meeting the commitments we made in Paris in 2015.   We can see on this chart that the House passed legislation over 6  months ago. It has been 188 days since the House passed their  legislation, the Climate Action Now Act. Yet in the Senate the majority  leadership has refused to call up this bill for a vote.   The administration's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and  the general refusal to bring climate change legislation to the floor is  out of step with the desires of the American people.   Approximately two out of every three Americans believe it is the job  of the Federal Government to combat climate change, according to a  recent poll from the Associated Press. The same poll found that 64  percent of Americans disapprove of the President's climate change  policies.   Unfortunately, the Senate majority leadership continues to refuse to  act on climate change. Yet what we hear from our scientists and experts  is that they tell us that we need to act and act now on climate change  before it is too late. This poll shows us, as others have, that a  supermajority of the American public wants us to do just that.   I have come before this body a number of times in the past to  highlight the impact of climate change in my home State of New  Hampshire. We see very directly the effects of climate change. The  farther north you go, the more you see those impacts. Our fall foliage  season is shortened. Our maple syrup production season is disrupted.  Our outdoor recreation industries are hampered. Our ski and our  snowmobiling industries are hampered. Our lobsters are moving north to  colder waters. Our moose population is  [[Page S6436]]  down 40 percent, and Lyme disease is on the rise.   But today what I really want to highlight are the revelations that  have been made clear in recent weeks by our national security experts.  A report entitled ``Implications of Climate Change for the U.S. Army,''  which was commissioned by the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, GEN Mark Milley reads: ``The Department of Defense is  precariously unprepared for the national security implications of  climate change-induced global security challenges.''   The Pentagon's ``Report on Effects of a Changing Climate to the  Department of Defense'' reads, as we can see right here: ``The effects  of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential  impacts to Department of Defense missions, operational plans, and  installations.''   When former Secretary of Defense James Mattis was before the Senate  Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing in 2017, his  testimony read, in part: ``Climate change is impacting stability in  areas of the world where our troops are operating today.''   I had the chance to ask him in that hearing: ``Do you believe climate  change is a security threat?''   He responded this way: ``Climate change can be a driver of  instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention to  potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.''   He went on to say: ``Climate change is a challenge that requires a  broader, whole-of-government response.''   I could go on detailing the calamitous conclusions of our national  security experts, but, instead, I ask unanimous consent that a letter  addressed to the President from nearly 60 national security and  military leaders be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                          American Security Project,                             The Center for Climate and Security,                                                      March 5, 2019.        Dear Mr. President: We write to you as former US national       security leaders to offer our support to our uniformed       military, civilian national security professionals, and       members of the scientific community, who across the past four       Administrations have found that climate change is a threat to       US national security.        Climate change is real, it is happening now, it is driven       by humans, and it is accelerating. The overwhelming majority       of scientists agree: less than 0.2% of peer-reviewed climate       science papers dispute these facts. In this context, we are       deeply concerned by reports that National Security Council       officials are considering forming a committee to dispute and       undermine military and intelligence judgments on the threat       posed by climate change. This includes second-guessing the       scientific sources used to assess the threat, such as the       rigorously peer-reviewed National Climate Assessment, and       applying that to national security policy. Imposing a       political test on reports issued by the science agencies, and       forcing a blind spot onto the national security assessments       that depend on them, will erode our national security.        It is dangerous to have national security analysis conform       to politics. Our officials' job is to ensure that we are       prepared for current threats and future contingencies. We       cannot do that if the scientific studies that inform our       threat assessments are undermined. Our national security       community will not remain the best in the world if it cannot       make decisions based on the best available evidence.        When extreme weather hits the United States, it degrades       the fighting force. Just last year, Hurricane Florence caused       $3.6 billion in damages to Camp Lejeune, home of the Marines'       expeditionary units on the East Coast. You called Florence       ``One of the biggest to ever hit our country.'' Stronger       storms and storm surges have long featured in predictions       about a changing climate. Around the world, climate change is       a ``threat multiplier''--making other security threats worse.       Its effects are even used by our adversaries as a weapon of       war; ISIS used water shortages in Iraq, in part driven by a       changing climate, to cement their hold on the population       during their reign of terror from 2014 to 2017.        We support the science-driven patriots in our national       security community who have rightly seen addressing climate       change as a threat reduction issue, not a political one,       since 1989. We support the bipartisan finding of the US       Congress, which you signed into law on December 2017, stating       that ``climate change is a direct threat to the national       security of the United States.'' We urge you to trust and       heed the analysis of your own national security agencies and       the science agencies on which their assessments depend,       including the 21 senior defense officials that have       identified climate change as a security threat during your       Administration. A committee designed to undermine the many       years of work they have done will weaken our ability to       respond to real threats, putting American lives at risk.        Our climate will continue to change, and the threats will       continue to grow. We spent our careers pledged to protect the       United States from all threats, including this one. Let's       drop the politics, and allow our national security and       science agencies to do their jobs.            Sincerely,          Hon. John Kerry, Former Secretary of State; Hon.

This letter very directly rebukes the attempt by the President to  create a committee within the National Security Council that would  undermine military and intelligence judgments on the threats that are  posed by climate change. So instead of recognizing those and developing  a plan to address them, what the President has been trying to do is to  figure out how to undermine those very judgments.   At this time, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1743 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am not surprised by my colleague's  objection. I am, however, disappointed, and I have to disagree, to some  extent, with the rationale because in fact this was not a treaty. It  was a voluntary, nonbinding agreement that the United States entered  into voluntarily.   I am not saying President Trump doesn't have the authority to  withdraw from the agreement. I am saying he is wrong to withdraw  because it is not in the U.S. national interest to withdraw from this  agreement.   There is an international race to develop clean energy technologies  and practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and this race  exists, in large part, because of the goals that were established in  the Paris climate agreement.   Instead of leading the pack in this race, which the United States  should be doing, the President has chosen to put us on the sidelines.  We are going to watch our allies and our adversaries clamor to fill the  void he has created. After decades of American leadership in clean  energy technology innovations, other countries are now poised to  develop new low-carbon technologies to help countries throughout the  world meet their Paris commitments. Those could be American  technologies. Those could be American jobs. Instead of being developed  in the United States, too many of these new technologies and the jobs  that go with them will be developed outside of our shores. This is a  missed opportunity for the United States. It is a setback for the  American economy and for American workers.   The scientists are in agreement worldwide. Climate change is the  single greatest environmental public health and economic challenge our  world has ever faced. Right now, watching this President withdraw the  United States from the Paris Agreement, sitting idly by, this Congress  is surrendering American leadership in the fight against climate  change.   I hope that as time goes by, the President and our Republican  colleagues will rethink the position and acknowledge the need to do  something to address the climate challenge we are facing and to make  sure the United States is in line for those jobs and the new energy  economy that is being created.   With that, I yield the floor.  [[Page S6438]]     Mr. President, yesterday a bipartisan group met with  seven Fortune 500 companies. They were all on the cutting edge of new  energy technologies, and everyone around the table said what they need  is to see policies at the Federal level that encouraged the development  of new energy technologies and what we can do to address climate  change.   I like what my colleague said about being able to work together to  address this. I hope we can do that, and I am ready to sit down anytime  he is to look at things we might be able to agree on that will help us  move forward to address climate change. I appreciate his willingness to  work in a bipartisan way.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of Christa McAuliffe.   Christa McAuliffe was born on September 2, 1948, in Boston, MA. She  grew up in suburban Massachusetts, and she studied American history and  education in college and graduate school. After some time teaching high  school in Maryland, she moved in 1978 with her family to New Hampshire,  where she started work as a teacher at Concord High School.   She was a passionate and dedicated teacher. She taught a variety of  subjects, including history, economics, and law. Her former students  describe her enthusiasm and her creativity in planning lessons and  activities for students. She even developed an original course, called  ``The American Woman.''   One of her former students says, ``She was very exuberant in her  teaching and excited about what she was teaching. She was always  willing to help outside of the classroom if you needed it. I remember  her constantly, every day that I stayed late after school to make up  work that I'd missed for other classes. . . . checking in to see if  there was anything she could do to help me.''   Christa believed strongly in the importance of the teaching  profession and in working creatively to help students understand the  human side of historical events. When NASA launched its Teacher in  Space Program in 1984, Christa seized the opportunity and applied for  what she called the ``ultimate field trip.'' She wrote in her  application to NASA:         In developing my course, The American Woman, I have       discovered that much information about the social history of       the United States has been found in diaries, travel accounts       and personal letters. This social history of the common       people . . . gives my students an awareness of what the whole       society was doing at a particular time in history. They get       the complete story. Just as the pioneer travelers of the       Conestoga wagon days kept personal diaries, I, as a pioneer       space traveler, would do the same . . . My perceptions as a       non-astronaut would help complete and humanize the technology       of the Space Age. Future historians would use my eyewitness       accounts to help in their studies of the impact of the Space       Age on the general population.    Her application was chosen out of more than 11,000 applications  submitted by teachers from around the country.   Even during her busy NASA training schedule and newfound public  attention, she remained dedicated to her students back home in New  Hampshire. She flew all the way back from Houston, in the middle of  training, in order to be there for the first day of school at Concord  High. She even somehow found the time to write college recommendations  for her students on the day before the Challenger launch.   She planned to keep a journal and teach lessons from space. She  wanted to humanize space travel and make the experience accessible to  regular people. She said that she hoped her experience and the public  attention would inspire more people to become teachers.   Tragically, on January 28, 1986, the Challenger shuttle exploded just  73 seconds after launching, killing Christa as well as the rest of the  crew: Gregory Jarvis, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judy Resnik and  Dick Scobee.   Many people know that Christa's motto was ``I touch the future, I  teach,'' and that statement remains as true today as it ever was. More  than 30 years later, Christa McAuliffe continues to inspire new  generations of students and teachers. In fact, a number of Christa's  former students have gone on to become teachers themselves. One in  particular says she at times turns to the question ``What would Christa  do?'' for guidance.   Schools and science centers across the country are named for her. In  New Hampshire, we have the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center, an air  and space museum and planetarium, as well as the Christa McAuliffe  School, an elementary school in Concord. There have even been an  asteroid and a crater on the moon named after her.   The Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act was signed into law by  the President on October 9. The enactment of this legislation means  that a commemorative coin in Christa's honor will be minted by the U.S.  Treasury in 2021. Proceeds from the sale of this coin will go to  support science, technology, engineering and math, STEM, education.   Christa McAuliffe demonstrated throughout her life how to make the  world a better place, not only through once-in-a-lifetime feats of  bravery but also through her everyday actions and interactions with  those around her. I hope we can all continue to look to her example for  inspiration and ask ourselves ``What would Christa do?''                            ____________________
