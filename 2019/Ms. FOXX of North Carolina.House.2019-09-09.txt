 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate  Winston-Salem State University, WSSU, in North Carolina's Fifth  District on its recent ranking by Money magazine as the Nation's best  public Historically Black University for value. The publication  considered 26 different measures of value, including affordability,  education quality, and graduates' record of landing well-paying jobs.   Many institutions do not make timely completion of college a  priority, leading to increased debt for the six out of 10 students who  take more than 6 years to graduate. WSSU is a bright spot in our  Nation's university system, though, with the average student graduating  in under 5 years and alumni earning an average $46,200 annually within  3 years of graduation.   Chancellor Elwood Robinson, WSSU administrators, and faculty should  be very proud to lead our Nation's Historically Black Universities and  Colleges in value. I applaud the school's dedication to honoring the  financial sacrifices made to pursue postsecondary education.                            ____________________
