 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  tennis star Chris Eubanks on his impressive Wimbledon run.   Chris Eubanks is an Atlanta native who played tennis at Georgia Tech.  During his time at Tech, Eubanks was named the ACC Player of the Year  twice and was a two-time all-American.   At Wimbledon, Eubanks beat the number one British player and 2022  Wimbledon semifinalist in a second round in front of a lively crowd. He  advanced to the quarterfinals of the tournament after defeating the  world number five player in a more than 3-hour battle.   Eubanks is now the 13th man in the Open Era to reach the final eight  in his debut at Wimbledon and the first American man to do so since  1984.   His performance at Wimbledon propelled him to a world number 43  ranking and has now guaranteed himself entry into every tournament and  a seeding at the U.S. Open.   I congratulate Mr. Eubanks on his valiant Wimbledon run and wish him  the best of luck in his future endeavors. He has made Georgia proud and  made his country proud.                            ____________________
