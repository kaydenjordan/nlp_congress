 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr.  Edward C. Monahan, a professor at the University of Connecticut and  longtime director of Connecticut Sea Grant.   Throughout his two decade tenure as director, Dr. Monahan positively  transformed Connecticut Sea Grant, which is an integral part of a  national network of programs that strive to protect and enhance our  coastal and marine ecosystems through outreach, education, research,  and technology. His remarkable work and visionary leadership secured  vital funding for initiatives that improved the water quality in the  Long Island Sound and helped establish a full-fledged Sea Grant College  Program in our State.   Dr. Monahan demonstrated his excellent qualities as a leader through  his decisive problem solving and readiness to find and implement  solutions to critically important issues. A notable example came in  1999, when the Long Island Sound faced lobster die-off, an  unprecedented disaster for the sound's resources. He responded  immediately by awarding development funds for pathobiologists to  investigate the cause. The issue turned out far more complicated than  initially expected, but Dr. Monahan smartly worked to allocate $3  million in Federal disaster relief funds to investigate the source.  Over 3 years, 65 researchers at 30 institutions too part in 21 lobster  research projects. This research helped uncover essential information  for lobster biologists and led to changes in State and local pesticide  usage for mosquito control.   One of the other landmarks of Dr. Monahan's directorship was his  expansion of Sea Grant's international collaboration. Recognizing the  advantages of overseas partnerships, Dr. Monahan worked with  universities and government agencies to forge new connections that  would support the exchange of innovative marine education, research,  and technology. Impressively, he launched the Irish-American  Aquaculture Initiative. This initiative launched a formal collaboration  between Northeast United States Sea Grant programs and universities in  the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Dr. Monahan also helped  to establish relationships with Sea Grant activities in Mexico, Chile,  China, and Germany, which set a new standard for international  cooperation.   Among his many accomplishments as director of Connecticut Sea Grant,  Dr. Monahan also served on the Sea Grant Association, a nonprofit that  organizes events at the national level and advocates for better  understanding, use, and conservation of natural resources. Thanks to  his outstanding efforts, Sea Grant has developed into an even more  successful program. In recognition of his immense and ongoing  contributions, the Sea Grant Association awarded Dr. Monahan its  prestigious President's Award in 2000 and 2001, along with its  Distinguished Service Award in 2005.   I applaud his lifetime of dogged commitment to Connecticut's coastal  and marine health and hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dr.  Monahan for his extraordinary contributions to the marine  sciences.                            ____________________
