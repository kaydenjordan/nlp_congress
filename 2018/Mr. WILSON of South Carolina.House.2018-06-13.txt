 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, President  Donald Trump arrived in Singapore for the historic meeting with Kim  Jong-un of North Korea, the first-ever meeting between a sitting  President and the leader of North Korea. I applaud President Donald  Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and National Security Advisor  John Bolton for their successful efforts.   This summit was a substantive step forward, but to protect American  families, the United States will continue to insist that North Korea  take concrete, verifiable steps toward denuclearization.   I remain hopeful that North Korea will commit to regular, unannounced  nuclear inspections by both U.N. and American experts, leading to  prosperity for the people of North Korea, as has been achieved  phenomenally for the people of South Korea.   As one of only two Members of Congress who have visited Pyongyang, I  am especially grateful that President Trump has maintained his  effective foreign policy of peace through strength, without which this  summit would have never occurred.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations to State Representative Katie Arrington on the  dynamic primary victory yesterday to represent the historic First  District of South Carolina.                            ____________________
