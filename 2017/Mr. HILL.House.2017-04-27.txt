 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Florida for the  opportunity to speak on this bill. And as a member of the House  Financial Services Committee, I am grateful for the bipartisan  leadership in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in bringing  H.R. 1694 to the floor, for it is high time that Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac be subject to the regimen of the Freedom of Information Act. This  critical oversight tool is sorely past due for these government- sponsored agencies.   Over the past four decades, we have seen the waste and largess  exhibited by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac embedded in their everyday  operations. And while they got their start during the height of the  Depression and performed an able task of setting high standards for the  liquidity for mortgage credit, they have long outlived their original  charter.   Oakley Hunter, the president and chairman of Fannie Mae back in the  1970s, described Fannie Mae as the world's largest floating crap game.  Nothing has changed.                                time  1430    In the early 1980s, we found Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominating,  as they do today, 9 out of 10 mortgages in the United States, and yet  they were highly unprofitable and highly suspect in their management.  During that time, Senator William Proxmire led the charge in the United  States Senate seeking answers about the enterprises' executive  compensation.   Flash-forward to the 1990s, we saw executive compensation at Fannie  Mae run amok.   During the 2000s, their imprudence and desire for growth paved the  way for the U.S. housing crisis and global economic collapse.   More recently, we have discovered that Fannie Mae is spending $171  million in taxpayer funds on a new Taj Mahal office in Washington,  D.C., to replace their already extraordinarily luxurious campus on  Wisconsin Avenue, which one Washingtonian, Mr. Chairman, described as  what Versailles would look like if Louis XIV had any money. According  to the inspector general's report from last June, this 15-year cost of  relocating Fannie Mae's headquarters and the construction of the new  building now topped $770 million.    Mr. Chairman, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac languish in  Federal conservatorship following their collapse from the 2008 housing  crisis, it is high time to apply FOIA to these GSEs and bring  accountability and transparency for the American taxpayers.
