 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Special Order.   You know, I walked in this Chamber tonight, and I thought: This  brings a new meaning to ``major in the minor.'' We have something that  is as important as the sovereignty of this country in securing our  borders, and here we are, at the last hour, saying we are going to get  out of here before Friday on something this important.   You know, I was in line, getting some work done, and the President  came on. He challenged Speaker Pelosi, and he challenged the Senator.  He said: Bring the fight on. We are going to stay here. We are going to  fund the wall. We are going to get the $5 billion.   Now we hear talk that maybe we won't. We are going to pass a  continuing resolution for 2 months.   I am sick of it. Nobody can fund your business month by month by  month.   Here we are, abdicating our constitutional obligations to make this  country sovereign.   As has been pointed out by Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan, the drugs, all  the things that come into this country--I am for immigration, but it is  legal immigration. We need to sit up here as long as it takes. If it is  the next 6 months, sit up here until we get it.   If we think we are going to get it when the gavel passes on January  3, it is not going to happen. I support what we are doing. Now is the  time for us to have a backbone, finally, and support this country and  make sovereign borders a law. Fund it.   You know, $5 billion? How did the previous administration get $153  billion to give to a rogue country? We can't come up with $5 billion?  It is sad, to say the least.   I support what we are doing. Hopefully, we can get this thing done.  Sitting up here, it is time to fight.
