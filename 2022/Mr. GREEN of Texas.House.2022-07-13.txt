 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise with a message for  those it may concern.   At Robb Elementary School, more than 15 good guys with guns,  ballistic shields, and body armor confronted a bad guy with a gun and  didn't do what many expect teachers to do with a pistol.   Expecting teachers to take out bad guys with guns is unreasonable,  outrageous, and dumb. Let teachers teach.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler and all of the  hands that have made this moment possible.   Madam Speaker, I have been here in this House when we have given our  thoughts and prayers to many persons who have died, many as a result of  an active shooter circumstance.   Thoughts and prayers are important. My grandfather was a preacher. He  talked about thoughts and prayers, but he also talked about doing God's  work. Thoughts and prayers are important, but thoughts and prayers are  not enough. Thoughts and prayers, unfortunately, are not saving lives  when we can make the difference.   `` . . . here on earth, God's work must truly be our own.'' These are  the words of John F. Kennedy. Thoughts and prayers are not enough.   There seems to be an argument today that we can give too much notice.  Too much notice. We already have a system that can do this. Too much  notice. Ask the loved ones of those who lost lives in the Atlanta,  Georgia, area. Ask those loved ones if there was too much notice.   I went there. I saw them. I saw the hurt and the pain. I saw them  pleading for additional help. Thoughts and prayers are not enough.   You can't give too much notice. Too much notice? Well, this shooter  in Atlanta went to three different spas over a 3-hour period. Three  different spas. I do believe this is an active shooter. Killed eight  people--eight people--three different spas over a 3-hour period. This  is an active shooter. Didn't have too much notice.   I believe that we have a duty, responsibility, and obligation to do  all that we can. When you can't do enough, you still have a  responsibility to do all that we can. This is an opportunity for us to  do more to save lives.   For edification purposes, since 1968--1968--more individuals in the  United States have died from gun violence than in battles during all  the wars the country has fought since its inception.   Since 1968, more individuals in the United States have died from gun  violence than in battle during all the wars since this country's  inception.   Too much is not enough. Too much notice is not enough, and we don't  have enough.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the Reforming Disaster  Recovery Act which I have submitted as an amendment No. 448 to the  National Defense Authorization Act.   This amendment would permanently authorize the Community Development  Block Grant Disaster Recovery Program which provides States, Tribes,  and communities with flexible, long-term recovery resources needed to  rebuild affordable housing and infrastructure after a disaster.   The amendment also provides important safeguards and tools to help  ensure that Federal disaster recovery efforts reach all impacted  households, including the lowest income and most marginalized survivors  who are often hardest hit by disasters and have the fewest resources to  recover.   The amendment also provides important safeguards and tools to help  ensure that Federal disaster recovery efforts reach all impacted  households in the future, including the lowest income and most  marginalized survivors.   These measures would help to prevent the repetition of what happened  in Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey where more than 4 years  after the disaster, relief funds that were appropriated by Congress  have not filtered down to the hands of people who need them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for my dear  colleague and friend. I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. I  understand the rules of the State and the people. But he and I have a  difference of opinion about which committee should have jurisdiction.   I sit on the Financial Services Committee. HUD has jurisdiction. He  sits on Transportation. He wants jurisdiction. He is not going to get  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, this bill requires the Secretary of  HUD to develop a formula to allocate assistance to the most impacted  and distressed areas resulting from a catastrophe or a major disaster.  This bill requires HUD to balance the use of Federal recovery funds  between rebuilding infrastructure and housing, ensuring that funds are  spent proportionally between homeowners and renters unless the  Secretary determines there is a compelling need to do otherwise.   This bill requires HUD to ensure that States prioritize the  activities that help extremely low- and moderate-income survivors  recover, address pre- and post-disaster housing needs, and prepare for  future disasters.   This is the bill that is on the floor. The wish list is not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
