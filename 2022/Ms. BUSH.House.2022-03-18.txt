 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in honor of a  beloved member of our community.   Cora Faith Walker was truly a one-of-a-kind leader. She constantly  found innovative ways to advocate for those in our communities who had  the most need.   No matter the role she was called to serve in, Cora was unwavering in  her commitment to uplifting those around her. Above all else, Cora  always stood for what is right; for herself, for her loved ones, for  her neighbors, for St. Louis, and for Missouri.   Cora's warmth and genuine spirit translated seamlessly to her  legislative leadership, and she relentlessly advocated for at-risk  women, children, and families.   Cora has left an indelible mark on me and on our district. Though we  deeply mourn this painful, untimely loss, St. Louis and I celebrate her  beautiful life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of the  CROWN Act.   As a Black woman who loves my braids, I know what it is like to feel  isolated because of how I wear my hair.   For the last time, we say no more to Black people being demeaned and  discriminated against for the same hairstyles that corporations profit  from, no more to Black people being made to feel like we have to cut  our locs just to get a job.   For the last time, we say no more to Black people being made to feel  like we have to straighten our hair to be deemed professional, no more  to Black children being suspended from school because their hair  doesn't align with their school's dress code. This is actually a thing.   We are American, and we stand up and say no more for the last time.  We are American. Black hair is not to be policed.   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleagues for their work on the CROWN  Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
