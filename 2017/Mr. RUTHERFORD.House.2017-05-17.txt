 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here this evening  with my friend, Sheriff Dave Reichert, and all of my colleagues who  stand with our law enforcement officers, their families, and their  communities for this National Police Week.   It is a time where we come together as a country to recognize the  sacrifices our police officers make for us every time they put on that  uniform.   Last week I had the privilege of attending the Nassau County  Sheriff's Office Law Enforcement Memorial Service in Florida, where we  recognized those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. And in  a very special way, we honored the life of Officer Eric James Oliver,  who was killed in the line of duty on November 22, 2016.   Officer Oliver died doing what he loved, protecting and serving his  community. Before he joined the sheriff's office, Officer Oliver served  our Nation in the United States Navy. But his most important job, Mr.  Speaker, was being the loving father to his 6-year-old daughter,  Shelby.   Tonight I commend the many sacrifices made by each and every law  enforcement officer in Florida's Fourth District, but this year we give  special recognition to Officer Eric Oliver and the great loss felt by  his family, his Nassau County Sheriff's Office colleagues, and our  entire northeast Florida community.   Tonight I also want to honor in a special way two Department of  Homeland Security officers who lost their lives in service to their  country.   First, I rise to honor Special Agent Jeremy Scott McGuire. Scott  served with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, assigned to  the National Security Investigations Division at the Homeland Security  Investigations office in New Orleans, Louisiana.   On January 25, 2016, Special Agent Scott McGuire lost his life while  on special assignment in Miami, Florida. In his final assignment, he  was conducting investigations to identify, disrupt, and dismantle  transnational criminal enterprises and terrorist organizations that  threatened the security of the United States.   He is survived by his wife, Suzy, and son, Finn. Special Agent  McGuire earned an extensive list of awards and accolades in recognition  of his academic accomplishments, and his investigative successes. In  fact, posthumously, Scott received the HIS national award for top  illicit drug trade investigator of 2016.    Special Agent McGuire left behind the greatest legacy a man can live.  He was truly a man of distinction and a man of devotion to not only his  work, but also to his family and friends, and he lives on as a hero.   Second, I rise to honor fallen Officer Brian Beliso, a U.S.  Immigration and Customs enforcement officer assigned to the Fugitive  Operations Unit at the Enforcement and Removal Operations office in San  Francisco. Officer Beliso began his work with ICE in 2007. Very early  in his career, Brian distinguished himself as a charismatic leader and  a dedicated employee who always went above and beyond in all of his  duties.   In his final assignment, Officer Beliso conducted field operations to  locate at-large criminal and fugitive aliens who are in violation of  our Nation's immigration laws. He was directly responsible for  prosecutions of numerous criminal aliens who illegally reentered the  country following their deportation.   On June 8, 2016, Officer Beliso died in the line of duty. Not only  was Brian greatly respected by his colleagues and superiors, he was  also known for his selfless service to his family and community. He was  a beloved husband and father. He is survived by his wife, Christina,  and their three children, Noah, Sophia, and Bella.   Mr. Speaker, law enforcement is a noble profession, and it is a noble  profession not only because these men and women serve, but because they  serve with self-sacrifice. Officer Oliver, Officer Beliso, and Special  Agent McGuire laid their lives on the altar of freedom, and we must  never forget them and the many other men and women who have  [[Page H4301]]  lost their lives so that we may experience the safety and freedoms that  we enjoy today.   On behalf of a very grateful nation, we thank them for their noble  service and we honor them for their duty and sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't mention two other  officers. I had the great honor for 12 years of being sheriff of the  Jacksonville Sheriff's Office in Jacksonville, Florida.                                time  1930    During my tenure, I was deeply saddened to bury two of my officers  who died in the line of duty. They were Officer Scott Bell, who gave  his life in service in 2007, and Officer Christopher Kane in 2008.   I say again, on behalf of a very grateful nation, we thank them for  their noble service, and we honor them for their duty and sacrifice.
