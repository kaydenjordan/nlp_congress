 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the tragic  passing of a 7-year-old child, Jakelin Caal, on December 8 of this  year.   Jakelin died in Customs and Border Patrol custody, reportedly due to  shock and dehydration. It is an understatement to say that we need a  thorough and independent investigation to understand exactly what  happened in this case and to make sure it never happens again.   Jakelin entered Customs and Border Protection custody and was held  with her father overnight with about 160 migrants, nearly half of whom  were minors, at the Antelope Wells border station.   Customs and Border Protection has stated that food and water were  made available, but the child's father and news articles have stated  that water was not--was not--available.   It is not visible from a distance, but I will just hold up a story  and a headline from today's Washington Post. The headline reads:  ``Lawyers: No water provided to migrant who died.''   Here is what the first paragraph of this Washington Post story, dated  today, says:         El Paso. Seven-year-old Jakelin Caal and her father, Nery,       were not provided water during the eight hours they were held       in a remote Border Patrol facility with 161 other migrants,       the family's lawyers said Wednesday, contradicting statements       by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.    The story goes on from there.   Similarly--and I am getting back to my observations of this--although  health screenings were reportedly conducted, news reports indicate that  none of the agents on duty had advanced medical training.   Though the father signed a DHS Form I-779, which is titled ``Juvenile  Medical Screening,'' and he apparently also signed other medical  paperwork, there are questions as to whether he understood the form  itself. I believe it is critical that we evaluate this form and also  evaluate the medical screening that children undergo.   I would like to know--and I am sure many Americans would like to  know--whether the American Academy of Pediatrics and our Nation's  medical professionals believe the current system is adequate. I would  add this: When this form and other protocols and procedures were put in  place, were those experts, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics,  consulted? Was this process or the forms informed by the expertise that  is available? That is another set of questions.   This has to be about improving the conditions at our Border Patrol  stations to make sure they are safe, including ensuring that there is  sufficient food, water, and medical attention at every one of these  Border Patrol stations. If that means that the administration comes  forward to the Senate or the House in the appropriations process to  have more dollars appropriated for this purpose, not just general  appropriations but for this purpose--to make sure that food and water  and appropriate medical attention is available, and trained medical  professionals are available at every Border Patrol station--we should  make sure that we engage in a dialogue about such specific  appropriations.   Understanding what happened in this tragedy is not about assigning  blame. That is easy. That happens all the time in Washington. This  shouldn't be one of those instances. This is about fixing the problem  so it never happens again. It is also about making sure that our policy  and the procedures that surround this policy and the details of the  policy and the resources dedicated to it are not just correct, but that  these policies are consistent with our values.   Therefore, we need an expeditious, thorough, and independent  investigation. We are told that the inspector general is reviewing  this. That is good, but that report has to be done expeditiously, and  we have to get to the bottom of what happened to this 7-year-old child.   In addition to all of that, there needs to be debate about how to  improve the system and how to investigate what happened, with  recommendations on the record to improve these policies. We also need  Commissioner Kevin McAleenan and Secretary Nielsen to come to testify  before Congress so they can provide testimony about what happened here  and about what both of them and their Agencies are doing to make sure  this never happens again.   Finally, we must take a moment to think about the broader atmosphere  and the policies that relate to our border. Those who come to our  shores seeking asylum are often fleeing terrible conditions of violence  and poverty. In some cases, they are fleeing from almost indescribable  horror. All of those seeking asylum should have a fair opportunity to  present their claims and should not be subjected to unhealthy,  unsanitary, or unsafe conditions while their claims are processed.   It is entirely possible to have an immigration system that treats all  individuals with compassion and dignity while also securing the border  and protecting national security. None of that is internally  inconsistent. A great nation can do all of that. I am certain that our  Nation is capable of that.   We must come together as a nation to mourn the loss of Jakelin and  others who die under similar circumstances. We need to put politics  aside to fix our broken immigration system so that these policies are  consistent with our American values.   I would yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to former  President George Herbert Walker Bush who died on November 30 at the age  of 94. Henry Clay once said, ``Recognize at all times the paramount  right of your Country to your most devoted services, whether she treat  you ill or well, and never let selfish views or interests predominate  over the duties of patriotism.'' Beginning at the age of 18 when he  joined the Navy and served in World War II, President's Bush's life was  a life of service and of a greater commitment to his country. Over  several decades and in numerous roles, President Bush served with honor  and decency offering his country the best of his wisdom, experience,  and dedication. When he lost reelection in 1992, he left a note to his  successor that ended with ``Your success is now our country's success.  I'm rooting hard for you. Good luck.'' Even in defeat, President Bush's  focus was on the future of the country and its success.   While many commentators have highlighted his achievements in foreign  policy, we should remember as well his domestic policy accomplishments,  such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. George Bush was a great  supporter of people with disabilities even before he became President.  As Vice President to Ronald Reagan, he met with disability advocates  Evan Kemp and Justin Dart, forming both a policy partnership and  friendship with  [[Page S7982]]  them. Both Kemp and Dart were wheelchair users and were able to  convince the then-Vice President of the need for a civil rights bill  for Americans with disabilities.   When he became President, Bush tapped two key legal advisers, his  White House Counsel Boyden Gray and distinguished former Pennsylvania  Governor Attorney General Richard L. Thornburg, to work with Congress  to craft legislation that would be the civil rights law for people with  disabilities. Working closely with House leaders Tony Coelho, Steny  Hoyer, and Steve Bartlett and Senate leaders Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy,  Bob Dole, and Orrin Hatch, they crafted a bill that was introduced in  the spring of 1989 but failed to pass.   The following year, with President Bush himself and his White House  staff working with the congressional leaders and advocates, the  Americans with Disabilities Act passed the House and the Senate with  overwhelming bipartisan support. The signing ceremony was held on the  South Lawn of the White House with hundreds of disability advocates in  attendance. As President Bush signed the bill into law, he said, ``Let  the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down,'' and with  the stroke of a pen that represented years of advocacy and political  compromise, President Bush signed the last great civil rights law of  the 20th century.   The world is emptier without President Bush, but his legacy lives on  in those who knew and worked with him and in the millions of people  whose lives were made better by his policies and his service. They are  his ``thousands of points of light,'' and they carry forth his vision  and his commitment every day.                            ____________________
