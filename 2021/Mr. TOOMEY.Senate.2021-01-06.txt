 I intend later to address the specifics of Pennsylvania  if and when an objection is raised in regard to Pennsylvania.   For now, I want to address my remarks to what I think is the  fundamental question being posed by the objectors, and that is, does  Congress have the constitutional authority to decide which States'  electoral college votes should be counted and which should not based on  how well we think they ran their elections? This is what the objectors  are really asking us to do--to federalize elections by rejecting  electoral college votes from States whose processes they say they  disapprove of and thereby having Congress select the President of the  United States instead of the American people.   The answer, Mr. President, is no, there is no such authority under  the Constitution. The Constitution assigns to the States the  responsibility to conduct elections. It is clear in article II, section  1. It leaves courts with the responsibility to adjudicate disputes, and  it assigns to Congress the ministerial function of counting ballots,  except for extreme circumstances, such as when a State sends competing  slates of electors to Congress, which brings me to the 1877 President.   Some objectors claim to merely want a commission to conduct an audit  and then let States decide whether to send electors. Well, first, the  situations are not at all analogous.   In 1877, Congress had before it two slates of electors from several  States. There are no Trump electors from swing States; there are just  Biden electors.   Second, legislators from the swing States--they have already spoken.  They have made their decision. They have chosen not to send us  alternative electors.   Third, a commission--really? It is completely impractical, and we all  know it, with 14 days to go before a constitutionally mandated  inauguration.   Look at it this way: If the electors are right and it is Congress's  job to sit in judgment on the worthiness of the States' electoral  processes, what is the criteria for acceptable electoral processes?  What investigations have been conducted of these processes? What body  has deemed that certain States' processes are unacceptable? What  opportunities were these States given to challenge the findings? Why  are the objectors objecting only to swing States that President Trump  lost? What about the ones he won? I don't know--North Carolina? What  about California? They have ballot harvesting, I am told. If this is  all supposed to be Congress's job, you would think we would have  answers to these questions and procedures in place because we would  have done this every 4 years, right? But we don't because it is not our  job.   If we adopt this new precedent that we sit in judgment of States'  processes, then we are federalizing the election law. We would  necessarily have to establish the permissible criteria and rules for  the States' elections   The ballot harvesting example--it is illegal in some States; it is  encouraged  [[Page S17]]  in others. Does it become mandatory or forbidden depending on who is in  control of Congress? And, as the leader pointed out, it would be the  end of the electoral college. The electoral college is the mechanism by  which the people select the President. But if Congress gets to decide  which States get to vote in the electoral college, then clearly  Congress is electing the President, not the people. Whichever party  controls both Houses of Congress would control the Presidency.   The public would never tolerate Congress picking the President  instead of themselves, so they would abolish the electoral college, as  many of our colleagues would like to do, and the end of the electoral  college, of course, means the Nation will be governed by a handful of  big blue States and regions that can drum up very large numbers.   Mr. President, the Constitution does not assign to Congress the  responsibility to judge the worthiness of State election processes nor  its adherence to its rules. That is the responsibility of the States  and the courts.   Let me conclude with this. I voted for President Trump. I publicly  endorsed President Trump. I campaigned for President Trump. I did not  want Joe Biden to win this election. There is something more important  to me than having my preferred candidate sworn in as the next  President, and that is to have the American people's chosen candidate  sworn in as the next President.   A fundamental defining feature of a democratic republic is the right  of the people to elect their own leaders. It is now our duty. It is our  responsibility to ensure that right is respected in this election and  preserved for future elections. I urge you to vote against this  objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my  colleagues allowing me to speak twice today. But my understanding is  that later this evening, objectors will object to the certification of  Pennsylvania's electoral votes because they disapprove of the process  that my State used in the last election. So in light of my expectation  of this objection, I rise to defend the right of my citizens, my  constituents, to vote in the Presidential election.   Let's be clear. That is exactly what this objection is about. It is  what it would do. It would overturn the results of the Presidential  election in Pennsylvania, and it would thereby deny Pennsylvania's  voters the opportunity to even participate in the Presidential  election.   Even if Congress did have the constitutional responsibility to judge  the worthiness of a State's election process, which it does not,  rejecting Pennsylvania's electoral votes would still be wildly out of  proportion to the purported offenses and very damaging to our Republic.   Let me go through a few facts about Pennsylvania.   First, some of the objectors and, in fact, even the President of the  United States this morning have observed that the Pennsylvania Supreme  Court disregarded existing law when it ruled that mail-in ballots could  be counted even if they arrived up to 3 days after election day.   Now, the objectors are right about that. In my view, the Supreme  Court of the United States should overturn that illegal decision. But  only 10,097 ballots arrived in Pennsylvania during the 3 days after the  election, and those 10,097 ballots have been excluded from the vote  count that resulted in President-Elect Biden winning Pennsylvania by  about 80,000 votes. What greater remedy could the objectors possibly  want than the complete exclusion of the late-arriving ballots? How  could we possibly invalidate the entire Pennsylvania election over  10,000 votes that were not even included in the vote count?   A second charge we heard--and the Senator from Missouri alluded to it  this evening--is that a 2019 Pennsylvania law that allows mail-in  ballots for any reason--that that might violate the Pennsylvania  Constitution. First of all, as Senator Casey observed, this was a  bipartisan law passed with nearly unanimous Republican support.  Clearly, the State legislators and the Governor believe it is  consistent with the Pennsylvania Constitution.   Secondly, this law was not challenged when it was passed. It wasn't  challenged when it was applied during the June primary election. It was  challenged only after President Trump lost the general election. But  2.6 million Pennsylvanians voted by mail-in ballot in the general  election. Over 37 percent of Pennsylvania voters, in good faith, relied  on a law to cast their votes, as they had done previously. Now, I  understand you can make a theoretical argument about whether this is  consistent with Pennsylvania's Constitution, and that needs to be  resolved for future elections. But because of this constitutional  question that some people have, the objectors want to prevent  Pennsylvania voters from participating in the Presidential election  entirely. That would be an outrageous remedy to this purported offense.   A third charge we have heard is that Pennsylvania officials did not  properly implement Pennsylvania election law in a variety of other  ways. But the Trump campaign has shown that many of these issues have-- well, first of all, none of these issues would have changed the  election outcome, but more importantly, the campaign had many  opportunities, of which it availed itself, to litigate these issues.  They did time and again, and they lost repeatedly, often in unanimous,  bipartisan decisions.   Some of the objectors also cite Congress's own failure to investigate  allegations of election irregularities, and that is their justification  for refusing to certify the election results. But the allegations of  election irregularities and fraud have been investigated. They have  been adjudicated. They were adjudicated in the States in which they  were alleged to have occurred.   In Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign took their case of election  irregularities into the courtroom of Judge Matthew Brann of the Federal  district court. Judge Brann is a conservative Republican Federalist  Society member. Here is what he said about the Trump campaign case:         This court has been presented with strained legal arguments       without merit and speculative accusations . . . unsupported       by evidence. In the United States of America, this cannot       justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone       all [the] voters of the sixth most populated state.    So the campaign then appealed Judge Brann's decision to the Third  Circuit, and they drew a three-judge panel, all Republican-appointed  judges, one appointed by President Trump. The panel concurred with  Judge Brann.   Certainly there were irregularities in this election--there always  are--but there is no evidence of significant fraud, conspiracies, or  even significant anomalies that cast any serious doubt on who actually  won the election.   You know, one of the ways you can tell is to look at the big picture  in Pennsylvania. Look at what happened. In 2016, President Trump won  Pennsylvania by eight-tenths of 1 percent. In 2020, he lost  Pennsylvania by a little over 1 percent. Is there anything at all that  is implausible or surprising about a 2-percent change in the election  outcome?   Relative to 2016, in Pennsylvania the President lost a little ground  in most of the rural counties he had carried. He lost a lot of ground  in the big suburban counties, and he slightly narrowed his large loss  in Philadelphia. There are no surprises here. This reflects a pattern  that occurred all across the country.   My colleagues, as I have said, it is not our responsibility to sit in  judgment of State election procedures in the first place, but if it  were, there would not be nearly sufficient reason to deny my  constituents their right to participate in this Presidential election.   Joe Biden won the election. That is not what I had hoped for, but  that is what happened. It was an honest victory with the usual minor  irregularities that occur in most elections.   We witnessed today the damage that can result when men in power and  responsibility refuse to acknowledge the truth. We saw bloodshed  because the demagogue chose to spread falsehoods and sow distrust of  his own fellow Americans. Let's not abet such deception. Let's reject  this motion  [[Page S33]]
