 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with concern  regarding our ongoing use of Continuing Resolutions.   While this Continuing Resolution (CR) is necessary to keep the  federal government open in the short term, CRs are an expensive and  wasteful solution that we should not continue to rely on. Congress has  a constitutional responsibility to ensure that our government serves  the American people effectively. Short term funding resolutions  hamstring federal agencies and our national defense by freezing their  ability to award grants, sign contracts, and do any long-term planning.   The House of Representatives completed consideration of a majority of  our full year appropriations bills months ago. The refusal of some to  come to the table and do the hard work of legislating has created the  need for these short-term bills to avert a shutdown.   While I am pleased that this CR includes additional funds to keep the  critically important Columbia Class Submarine program on track, we  should not need to rely on small carveouts to ensure funding for  important defense programs that have already been authorized by  Congress. Other critical programs, such as those that ensure children  are fed, the elderly can afford their heating bills, and everyone can  file their tax returns, are also stymied by short-term funding.   I urge my colleagues to pass full year appropriations expeditiously  and work together to ensure that we can complete the Fiscal Year 2023  appropriations process on time before September 30, 2022.
