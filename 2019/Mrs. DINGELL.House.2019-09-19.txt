 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 239, the Christa  McAuliffe Commemorative Coin Act of 2019.   We all remember where we were on January 28, 1986, the day we lost  the space shuttle Challenger and its crew, and Americans all across the  country mourned. Among the brave crew members was New Hampshire's own  Christa McAuliffe, who had been chosen as the first teacher in space.   Through her spirit and enthusiasm for pioneering the unknown, she  encouraged a generation to reach for the stars. Her quest for knowledge  and her commitment to inspiring young people  [[Page H7800]]  to pursue their dreams has had a lasting impact on children everywhere.  To honor her and keep her dream alive for the next generation, my dear  friends Representative Upton, who has been incredible, Representative  Annie Kuster, and Representative Pappas, Michigan and New Hampshire,  have worked together for this, and I thank them for their leadership.   The bill will mint a commemorative coin, with the proceeds going to  support the New Hampshire-based nonprofit FIRST, or For Inspiration and  Recognition of Science and Technology.   Each year, they host the first robotics competition, and we see young  people building these robots, encouraging and inspiring them to invest  in science and math. I try to go to them every time I can. I was just  at an all-women's one last Saturday. They strive to inspire young  people to be leaders in the science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics fields.   There is no better way to honor the memory and life of Christa  McAuliffe than to continue to inspire and encourage young people to be  at the forefront of innovation and technology.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this.
