 Madam President, first, let me thank all of my  colleagues who were here until late last night and made such persuasive  arguments as to why the new Supreme Court Justice matters so much to  the American people, to their healthcare, the working people's rights,  to women's rights, to preserving the right to choose, to making sure we  have a good green planet, to LGBTQ rights. They did an eloquent job.   I hope America was listening because this nomination matters; it  matters to the average daily lives of average Americans. And last  night, by holding the floor until the late hours, Democrats made really  strong arguments.   I thank my colleagues for doing that.   Madam President, for the third day in a row, Leader McConnell has  come to the floor and completely ignored the ``principle'' he  established in 2016, when, mere hours after Justice Scalia passed away,  Leader McConnell said that ``the American people should have a voice in  the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice''--his words: ``The  American people should have a voice in the selection of their next  Supreme Court Justice,'' referring to the upcoming election.   That election was more than 8 months away. We are now only 42 days  away. But the so-called McConnell rule--the supposed principle that the  American people deserve a voice in the selection of a Supreme Court  Justice--hasn't come up. The Republican leader can't mention it. No  wonder he never mentions it. And he sticks to just diversionary,  irrelevant remarks in his speeches on the floor instead of addressing  the main issue--why he said one thing in 2016 and a different thing  now.   Instead, the Senate is forced to suffer these tortured explanations  and misleading precedents. At a press conference yesterday, here is how  the Republican leader described the Senate role in confirming the  Supreme Court Justices. He actually said: ``[W]e have an obligation  under the Constitution [to consider a Supreme Court Justice] . . .  should we choose to take advantage of it.''   Did you catch that? Did you catch that? It is an obligation, but only  if the Republican leader chooses to take advantage of it. I see. So,  when there is a Democratic President, it is one of those obligations  you don't have to take advantage of, but when there is a Republican  President, it is a solemn constitutional duty.   Are we really supposed to swallow the argument that, when the Senate  and the President are of the opposite party, one rule applies, but when  they are of the same party, a different rule applies? I didn't hear  that right after Scalia died when Leader McConnell explained why he was  holding it up.   So this idea that when it is one party, one rule applies and another  party, a different rule applies, we have a term for that. It is called  a double standard.   If the leader really wants to discuss precedent--real precedent, not  fiction--we can dispatch with that conversation in about 30 seconds   Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry for the Chair: Is  there a Senate precedent for confirming a Supreme Court nominee between  July and election day in a Presidential year?    Thank you, Madam President.   July is long gone. August is over. We are now at the end of  September. As you just heard--not from the Democratic leader but from  the records in the Senate, as spoken by the Chair, there is no, no, no  precedent for confirming a Supreme Court Justice between July and  election day. The Republican leader can come up with arguments that  twist things, that jump through hoops, but it doesn't gainsay no, no,  no precedent for any Supreme Court nominee being confirmed between July  and election day. As you know, July is gone. August is over. We are now  at the end of September. It is 6 weeks before an election in which some  people have already begun to vote.   Simply, my Republican friends have no ground on which to stand--none.   There is no logic to excuse flipping their position 4 years apart,  under the same circumstances. There is no justification for the  Senators who said on the record that they would ``say the same thing if  a Republican president were in office''--``say the same thing if a  Republican president were in office'' they said then, but it doesn't  apply now that we have a Republican President in office. There is no  defense for the Senator who said: ``Precedent set. Precedent set. I'm  sure come 2020, you'll remind me of that.'' There is no place to hide  for the Senator who said: ``You can say that I said, let the next  president decide. Hold this tape. I want you to use my words against  me.''   Why are Senate Republicans going to such extreme lengths to ram  through a Justice weeks before an election, making a complete mockery  of their previous ``principle''? Why are they committing a power grab  so egregious that it risks shredding the last vestiges of trust that  remain between our two parties? For what? Because this is the only way  for Republicans to achieve their radical, rightwing agenda--an agenda  so far away from where average Americans think, even average  Republicans, that they wouldn't dare bring such things on the floor of  the Senate.   Unable to thrust comically unpopular positions on the American people  through Congress, they have to try through the courts--a cynical  strategy that dates back to the 1950s.   Republicans are sick and tired, for instance, of this annoying law,  the Affordable Care Act, and that it keeps providing healthcare to  millions of Americans. They tried to repeal it in the House just about  a million times, and they tried here, too, in the Senate but failed by  one vote. So now they have taken it to the courts.   President Trump and Republican attorneys general are suing right now  to eliminate the entire law, including protections for up to 130  million Americans with preexisting conditions. In fact, President Trump  is meeting with those Republican attorneys general at the White House  today, this afternoon. Less than a week after Justice Ginsburg's  passing, the President is meeting with the leaders of the Republican  lawsuit against our healthcare law. Ostensibly, it is about how social  media companies are biased against conservatives, but who wants to bet  that the healthcare lawsuit doesn't come up? I would like for someone  to ask them that.   If he cared about healthcare and the American people, President Trump  himself would ask the AGs to withdraw their lawsuit. I am calling on  him to do it right now. I doubt he will, given his record, given his  lack of concern for the American people's healthcare, but he should.  But, unfortunately, let's remember, President Trump already told the  American people his goal. He said: ``My judicial appointments will do  the right thing, unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts, on ObamaCare.''   He is about to make a Supreme Court pick while there is an ongoing  lawsuit that seeks to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. Hear that,  America? The healthcare law you want, the healthcare law you need, the  healthcare law that protects you against overreaching insurance  companies that will not give you insurance when you have a preexisting  condition--President Trump has said he will appoint a nominee who will  undo it, and we know he said it because of what he said about Justice  Roberts when Justice Roberts opposed his view on healthcare.   Guess when the case is being heard in the Supreme Court, America.  November 10, a week after the election. Is that why Senate Republicans  are in such a rush to get a new rightwing Justice confirmed before the  election--so that the Supreme Court can do what they failed to do here  in the Senate--repeal this healthcare law, which protects so many  Americans?   Leader McConnell slammed on the brakes while tens of thousands of  Americans died from COVID, and now he is slamming his foot on the gas  to approve a Supreme Court Justice who could rip away Americans'  healthcare in the middle of a pandemic. Shame. Shame.  [[Page S5798]]    For 4 months, the Republican majority delayed a COVID-relief package  while the Nation suffered, but 1 hour--1 hour--after the news of  Justice Ginsburg's passing broke, Leader McConnell said ``batten down  hatches, we're full steam ahead'' on confirming another rightwing  Justice--a Justice who could undo Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy; who  could rip away healthcare from millions of American families; who could  decide there is no more right to choose for millions of American  women--Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance here; who could crush unions  for millions of American workers; who could make it harder to vote for  millions of African Americans; who could end marriage equality for  millions of LGBTQ Americans, like my daughter and her wife, who looked  at each other this weekend and wondered, is our marriage on the line?   Average Americans are thinking, what are they going to lose with this  new, hard-right, special interest-dominated Supreme Court if--if--our  Republican friends have their wish, which we are going to fight every  step of the way? The stakes of this election, the stakes of this  vacancy concern no less than the future fundamental rights of the  American people.   My friends on the other side will tell you that we are being  hysterical, that they actually support protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions. That is hysterical? Ask the mother whose son or  daughter has cancer and can't get insurance and watches their child  suffer. That is not being hysterical; that is doing what we are  supposed to do, not what the folks on the other side are doing--rushing  through a Justice who, in a very strong likelihood if that Justice gets  approved, would rip healthcare away from the American people.   America, you have to ask yourselves, if Republicans will completely  reverse themselves on a major principle whenever it suits them, what  can you trust them on? How can you take their word seriously?   Republicans have praised the legacy of Justice Ginsburg with flowery  words about her impact, but in the resolution I offered yesterday, they  even didn't want to acknowledge her dying wish that she not be replaced  until the next President is installed.   President Trump had the gall, the temerity, the baseness to suggest  her dying words were not issued by her. How low can the President go?   Senate Republicans are working with every fiber of their being to  confirm a Justice--despite her last wish, in contradiction to her  dying, most fervent wish--who will reverse her legacy. This is not  speculation. This is not hyperbole. President Trump has said again and  again and again that he wants the Supreme Court to ``terminate'' the  healthcare law. He made it clear he has a litmus test: Any Trump  nominee must want to strike down Roe v. Wade.   For once, Republicans should be straight with the American people.  They are fighting to reverse Justice Ginsburg's legacy, not honor it.  All of their speeches of praise run totally hollow and are belied by  their actions.   America, you can't trust them at their word. You can't trust them to  protect your healthcare, and you definitely can't trust this Senate  Republican majority to protect you.                            ____________________     While the rest of the country was busy fighting COVID,  Senate Republicans have been abusing the power of the Senate to conduct  opposition research for President Trump's campaign.   This morning, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee  released his report, which reads as if Putin wrote it, not U.S.  Senators. The bogus narrative of this report, peddled by a Russian  disinformation campaign, was disproved by every witness who testified.  Despite their zeal to smear Vice President Biden and his family, Senate  Republicans found no evidence--no evidence--to support the conspiracy  theories pushed by Putin's intelligence agencies.   Senators Grassley and Johnson should reimburse taxpayers for the  money they wasted. This entire disgraceful affair and the Johnson  report should be relegated to the dustbin of history.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
