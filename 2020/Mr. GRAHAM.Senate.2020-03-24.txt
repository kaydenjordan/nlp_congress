 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a  colloquy with my good friend Senator Daines from Montana.    He is on the way.   Here is the state of play, folks. If you are at home and you are a  nurse or you are a doctor and you are running out of supplies, there is  a lot of money in this bill that will help you. We just need to pass  the damn bill.   What is going on here? Endless negotiations.   Mr. President, in case you are watching, tell Steven Mnuchin to come  back to the White House and end negotiations.   I am all for negotiating. I try to make deals. I understand the give- and-take of life and the give-and-take of politics, but I have been  called by two good friends on the Democratic side in the last 5 or 6  hours wanting more money.   End the negotiations. This bill is $2 trillion. There is a ton of  money in this bill for people who need it. But what we are doing now is  every special interest group in town is trying to get a little bit  more--nickel-and diming--at a time when people are dying--literally  dying. Businesses are having to make a decision: Do I send my employees  on unemployment or do I hope that Congress can act so that I can keep  them on the payroll?   I tried to do my part in terms of bipartisanship, but this is  ridiculous. Steven Mnuchin has done a good job. I appreciate his  efforts to negotiate a bill that will help America.   Senator McConnell says we are on the 2-yard line. I believe it. The  problem is that there are 20 people playing defense, and we need to  take some people off the field. What bothers me is that at this late  hour, I am still getting calls from people wanting more money.   This is not the last bill we will do, but this is the last chance we  have to save some lives in realtime. I am encouraging the President-- begging the President--to end negotiations now. Write what we have  done, and let's vote. If it is not perfect, we will try to fix it  later, but it is damn good.   There is money in here to help people in small business who have had  to close because they have no customers. Maybe we can change the  containment policies, but it needs to be based on science.   States now are sheltering in place. Anything the President does to  try to open up the economy, count me in if it is based on sound  science. It needs to be conditions-based. I want to leave Afghanistan  like everybody else, but it has to be conditions-based.   I think we are a long way from beating this disease. I want to bomb  it; I want to starve it; and I want to kill it. But right now, I want  to get money, paychecks up and running that have been shut down--no  fault of your own.   If you own a bar or a restaurant in Arizona or South Carolina, if we  can pass this bill, you can go to a bank, a credit union, and you can  borrow money, which we will forgive. It will not be a loan. It will be  a grant for your employees, up to $80,000 per employee. You can borrow  money, which will become a grant to pay the rent. We just need to pass  the bill.   If you are on unemployment in South Carolina, the most you can get is  $326 a week. We add $600 to that--if we can pass this bill.   To the hospitals on the frontline, there is a ton of money to help  you with supply shortages on the medical side. To the nurses and  doctors, there is money there for you. Elective surgery has been banned  in some States. We need to help hospitals which are losing revenue. It  is all in the bill.   If you have student loan debt, we defer all payments, I think, until  October. I can't remember. It is in there. That is good for you. It  takes one rock out of your sack that you have to carry. It relieves  your burden.   Pass the damn bill. Stop negotiating. Enough is enough. This has been  going on for 2 days. Like everybody else in the country, I have lost my  patience with the political process. We are being nickel-and-dimed now.  The big stuff we have pretty well right. If it is not perfect, we can  fix it later, but we need to vote tonight.   The reason I am on the floor is because I have been called by two  Democratic colleagues in the last 5 or 6 hours wanting more money. The  store is closed.   Mr. President, end negotiations. Require us to vote. Draft the bill.  Do it tonight.   There is $10 billion in this bill--a $2 trillion bill--that may do  more good than any $10 billion in the bill in terms of defeating the  coronavirus. Everybody says we are at war.   Senator Daines, do you agree we are at war with this virus    How do you win a war? I want to starve the virus, starve  the enemy. If we will practice good containment policy and stop going  to the beaches and interacting with each other in an irresponsible way,  we will starve the virus because it needs human transmission to  survive. Containment policies well-practiced will starve the virus.  Therapies, bomb the  [[Page S2004]]  virus. The anti-malaria drugs--I hope they work, but therapies are in  the pipeline that can take the virus from a 10 to a 1 or 2 so it is not  so fatal. Bombing the virus is therapeutic drugs that lessen the  mortality rates. Killing it is a vaccine or an antibody that will get  to the underlying problem.   Senator Daines has been a one-man band to try to accelerate the  ability to produce a virus that is the nuclear bomb to kill this damn  thing.   We have $10 billion in this bill--thanks to Senator Daines--that will  tell the drug companies that are in the business of creating vaccines  and antibodies: Do your trials. But if there is any promise, start  production, and we will cover you. If it is a dry hole, we will pay the  cost; but if we strike oil, we will all benefit.   That $10 billion is going to allow drug companies that are in the  virus-destruction business, creating vaccines and antibodies, money to  start production of anything that is promising--a dual system.   Here is when we turn the corner: When infections go down, not up;  when therapies begin to degrade the virus; and when a vaccine is on the  horizon. That is when we have turned the corner. The money in this bill  will accelerate turning the corner.   I want to thank Senator Daines and my good friend from South Dakota  presiding, who has been a Governor, who understands give-and-take,  getting to yes. Nobody does a better job of getting to yes than our  Presiding Officer. Both of you come from the part of the world--the Big  Sky Country--where you have to live off the land, where neighbor helps  neighbor. We need that attitude in this body. The store needs to close.   Mr. President, end negotiations, write the bill, and let's vote.   The reason we need to vote is because people are suffering and  literally dying.   Senator Daines, can you tell me what it is like in Montana right now?    Would you yield for a question?    Have you gotten phone calls from Democratic colleagues  wanting more money?    That makes it appear to me that negotiations are not on  the 1-yard line.    Would the Senator yield for a question?    I would like to ask a question. I don't know how many  employees the gentleman has, but do you agree with me that if you have  500 or less employees, you are a small business, and under this bill,  instead of laying off your employees, you can go to a bank or credit  union and get an SBA loan that will eventually become a grant to pay  your employees up to $80,000 per employee; you can also pay the rent  that is coming due? Do you agree that is in this bill?    Hire back the people.    Everybody knows that. You don't need to tell us stuff we  already know.    If the Senator would yield for a second, all of the  people who are negotiating are my friends. I have been in tough  negotiations, and it is hard to get to yes, but we have never faced a  problem like this since World War II and 9/11. This is not any time.  This is not any bill. This is not just another legislative endeavor.  This is life. It is death. It is the difference between bankruptcy and  having economic hope. It is the difference between having the supplies  you need to save lives and not getting them.   To my colleagues who are doing the negotiations, stop. It is over.  Write the bill. Let's vote.   Every time I hear it is close, that means we are just a couple of  hundred billion dollars away. The reason I am so agitated is not to try  to be cheap--the bill is $2 trillion. It is that, like Senator Daines,  I have been called in the last few hours by people who are wanting more  money for this and that. All of them may be very worthy projects, but  we need to stop negotiating at this very moment, write the bill, and  vote tonight or no later than tomorrow.   Senator Daines, I have a proposition for you. If we cannot do that as  the U.S. Senate, don't you agree with me that we should stop getting  paid?   Now, legally, maybe we can't stop our salaries, for it will take a  future Congress to do that, but we can all voluntarily give up our  money. I have a hard time with my continuing to get paid when we can't  solve the problem. We have been doing this for days now, and enough is  enough.   Senator Daines, do you believe it is time for there to be  consequences for the body in our failing to deliver for the American  people?    Yes.    Yes, I can.    If I may, I think the Senator is speaking for most  Montanans. I know he is speaking for South Carolinians. Let's go back  to the 14,000 people in Montana who are on unemployment. I don't know  what kind of spike that is. I have been to Montana--a great place, a  lot of land, not that many people, hardy folks. They don't want to be  unemployed; they want to be working. I know the Senator's people pretty  well. They are probably pissed off that they have been laid off, but  there is nothing we can do about it until we control this virus, and we  will.   Do you realize, Senator, that in this bill, every unemployed person  in Montana will get $600 on top of the State unemployment benefit? In  South Carolina, the maximum benefit is $326. This bill will take it up  $600. Doesn't the Senator think that will matter to the people in  Montana?    Yes.    If I may, we keep talking about being at war. I have made  50-something trips to Afghanistan and Iraq. We are at war with a virus,  not with radical Islam, and we need to destroy this virus before it  destroys our economy and kills thousands of Americans.   The Senator's legislation--his proposal--of $10 billion to accelerate  our finding an antibody or a vaccine is the ultimate nuclear weapon,  and that is the best $10 billion in this entire package--to kill the  virus.   Yet the people in Montana, South Carolina, and South Dakota are out  of work today because of containment policies. We have had to make a  decision to stop the spread of the virus. It is probably one of the  most draconian decisions we have made since World War II, when we  rationed goods and couldn't have the lights on at night.   Everybody says we are going to get through it, and they are right,  but I want you to know it will not be easy. It is going to take a while  until we find the therapies and the vaccines to kill this virus. Until  then, we need to act in Congress to get help to those who need it. They  are the people the Senator has just described--the business owner and  the unemployed person. There is a lot of help.   You can call this bill whatever you would like, but the two Senators  who are here with me tonight are from out West. This is the cavalry  coming over the hill. You are under attack; you are under siege. If we  can pass this bill, the cavalry will be there for your businesses, and  it will be there for your families.   The only way we are going to pass this bill, Senator Daines, is to  stop negotiations and write the bill.   Do you agree?    How do you kill it?    How do you kill this virus?    We will end where we began. The reason I am here with  Senator Daines is that I have been getting phone calls over the last  several hours from people who want to add more money. It is not that it  is a bad idea as much as it is we need to get this bill done. It will  not be the last time we get to address this problem. It rattles me to  no end to know that people are still asking for billions of dollars at  8:30 at night or 8 o'clock at night. That tells me that we haven't sent  the right signal, which is that this is a good bill. It is time to  write it, and it is time to vote on it. It is time to end the  negotiations.   Mr. President, you have done a very good job today. That news  conference with you and Dr. Fauci was the most encouraging I have seen.  We are going to listen to good science, and we are going to turn on the  economy in a smart way with conditions being faced. You have encouraged  Congress. You have been very nice to Congress.   The reason we are here tonight is that we are both upset that people  are still talking about adding to the bill 48 hours after having been  on the 5-yard line. We may be on the 1-yard line, but, apparently,  there are 20 people on defense when we need to get the ball in the end  zone.   I am just begging of my colleagues who have worked very hard--and I  am not being critical as much as I am being insistent--because enough  is enough. You have done a good job for the Democratic causes. We have  done a good job for the Republican causes. The cause is the country.   If you are out of work, we are going to keep you on the payroll so  you don't have to go on unemployment if your employer decides to go  that route. If you are on unemployment, we are going to give you $600  more so you can actually survive better than you would have without  this bill. If you are a nurse or a doctor and you are running out of  supplies, this bill has a tremendous supply chain in it.   So our message is simple: No more negotiations. It is over. Let's  vote.    One last thing. Who is the gentleman who is thinking  about laying people off from Montana, that business?    Mr. Luebeck, I have never met you. Maybe one day I will.  I enjoy my visits to Montana. Give us 24 more hours. I am hoping and  praying that we can write the bill. End the negotiations right now,  write the bill, and vote on this thing, House and Senate, and put it on  the President's desk in the next 24 hours. Sir, if we can't, we have  let you down and everybody else in the country like you.   To my Governor in South Carolina, you had to institute some very  strong containment policies so we don't become New York. People in my  State--there are 1,700 restaurants in Myrtle Beach, restaurants and  bars. We are going into Easter in a few weeks, and that is when the  season begins.   Our Canadian friends would be coming down any day now. They want to  go swimming in March. We are glad to have them. We don't like swimming  in March because it is too cold for us, but the Canadians like it. It  is a win-win. They are not coming.   Those 1,700 restaurants and bars, in this bill, if we pass it, can go  to a credit union or a bank. You can borrow money to pay your employees  up to $8,000. You can borrow money to pay the rent, pay yourself as the  owner, and we will forgive it and make it a grant for 6 or 8 weeks.  That will change everybody's life all over South Carolina.   It is time to change people's lives. It is time to stop negotiating.  It is time to vote.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 9:30 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:32 p.m., recessed until  9:30 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Ms. McSally).
