 Madam Speaker, it is time to make the Pulse nightclub a  national memorial, and the reason is that what Pulse symbolizes is  relevant to all Americans.   Let me say this: Orlando does not need Congress in order to honor the  49 victims, nor the 53 who were wounded that night. We have honored  them and will continue to do so for as long as their memories live on.   But it is still the right thing to do, that Congress take this action  today, because, by making Pulse a national memorial, we honor not only  the victims, but what they stood for, what they represent, and what our  country could be and should be.   Pulse is in my district. It was a sanctuary. It was a place where  Orlando's LGBTQ residents could find safety and friendship. The people  there that night were not in the wrong place at the wrong time. They  were exactly where they were supposed to be, among friends and loved  ones, taking joy together in what my bishop referred to as a late night  fellowship.   Isn't that worth celebrating? Isn't that worth protecting for every  American? Could there be any right more basic?   And that is why we are here: to honor and remember them.   We will continue to grieve for those we lost and to help those who  survived. We will continue together and remember.    We will continue to act on gun violence and civil rights, for the  survivors of Pulse have called upon us to honor those we lost with  action, not just words.   Today, with this vote, we state that Pulse was a national tragedy not  only for what it was, but for what it meant; and it will be a national  memorial not just to commemorate our past, but to guide our future.
