 Madam President, as my colleagues have said, it has now  been 26 days since President Trump shut down the government and began  holding Federal workers and their families hostage to force funding for  an expensive, ineffective, and unpopular border wall.   That is 26 days of working without pay for hundreds of TSA and  Customs and Border Patrol officers in my State of Michigan and across  the country. That is 26 days of our Federal workers wondering how they  will pay their mortgage and keep their lights on. That is 26 days of  grocery stores, restaurants, and other local businesses watching their  sales dry up.   This shutdown is also hard on Michigan farmers, including Jessica  Youngblood, whom I want to take a moment to talk about.   She and her husband David, who is a veteran, are raising their three  young children on their farm in Macomb County. Like many farmers,  Jessica is also a small business owner; the Youngbloods are launching a  winery. For 3 years, they have poured all of their time and they have  poured all their money into their 25 acres of wine grapes. I have had  the opportunity to walk with Jessica and her children through the rows  of grapevines, and I have seen how hard they are working as a family  every single day.   This year, they finally had grapes to harvest so that they could  launch their small business. They planned to open their winery on their  farm and start selling their wine on Memorial Day weekend.  Unfortunately, the government shutdown threw a huge roadblock in front  of this homegrown Michigan business.   The Tax and Trade Bureau at the Department of the Treasury approves  their labels--when they are open. Jessica needs to bottle her wine in  March, but that can't happen without labels being approved and printed.  As Jessica said:         We are 100% dependent on the grapes we grow on our family       vineyard. . . . We are farmers! We need the government to       open so we can run our business.    It is time to end this shutdown. Let Jessica and her family benefit  from all of their hard work. So I say: Leader McConnell, open the  government so that the Youngblood family can open their small business.   I yield the floor.
