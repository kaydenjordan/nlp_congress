 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 276, as amended, introduced by the  gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen), which will ensure  reliable air service into American Samoa.   American Samoa is situated in the center of the South Pacific, about  2,500 miles south of Hawaii. Its nearest neighboring islands are at  least 500 miles away, and the territory is more than 7,000 miles from  where we stand today.   This remote location already makes export and travel difficult and  costly. Complicating matters more is the fact that the current cabotage  laws prohibit foreign air carriers from carrying passengers between the  islands, except in certain emergency situations.   The Department of Transportation has authority to issue waivers in  such emergency cases, but the waivers are good for only 30 days. A  foreign airline that is otherwise fit to provide service between  American Samoa's islands is, therefore, forced to apply monthly for a  waiver.   H.R. 276 would remove this burden by permitting DOT to grant the  cabotage waiver for up to 6 months. This change ensures that domestic  air transportation is provided and sustained between the islands,  benefitting both the people and the economy.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.
