 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Edward Poe Bostic,  an American hero and Korean war combat veteran who passed away in  August of this year at 87 years of age.   Mr. Bostic joined the Marine Corps at the age of 16 during the Korean  war. He fought at the amphibious invasions and battles at Inchon and  Seoul. He also participated in the Blockade of Wonsan, the longest  naval blockade in modern history, and the Battle of Chosin Reservoir,  known as the Frozen Chosin due to the harsh winter weather conditions.   Mr. Bostic was proud to serve his country and proud to be a marine.   Mr. Bostic retired from Y-12 Martin Marietta in Oak Ridge, Tennessee,  after a 40-year career. He was an active member of the Campbell County  Honor Guard; commander of the Disabled American, Veterans Appalachian  Chapter 105; and commander of the Campbell County Young Marines.   There are real heroes in this world, Madam Speaker, and they aren't  music stars, famous athletes, or Hollywood actors. Our country's heroes  are the men and women of our Armed Forces like Mr. Bostic, who served  and sacrificed for our freedom.   It is my honor to recognize Edward Poe Bostic as the Tennessee Second  District's October 2019 Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
