 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gun  Violence Awareness Month, which began mere days after another tragic  shooting in Virginia Beach and weeks after the Chabad of Poway  synagogue shooting just outside of my district in southern California.   This is wrong.   After the Poway shooting, I called for concrete action to help end  the scourge of senseless gun violence in our country. I called on the  Senate to pass H.R. 8, which would put commonsense gun safety measures  in place, requiring a background check on every gun sale or transfer. I  also called on the Senate to pass H.R. 1112 to close the Charleston  loophole, which currently allows the sale of a firearm to proceed if a  background check is not completed within 3 business days.   Months after the House passed those bipartisan bills, they continue  to languish in the Senate.   The American people deserve better. The American people deserve a  vote. They deserve elected officials who aren't afraid of the NRA.   The American people deserve action. That is what Gun Violence  Awareness Month is about. We have an epidemic of gun violence that is  unique to our country, and we must finally do something about it.                            ____________________
