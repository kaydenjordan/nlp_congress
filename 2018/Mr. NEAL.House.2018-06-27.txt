 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to mourn the loss of a  great American patriot, Major General George W. Keefe, former adjutant  general of the Massachusetts National Guard who passed away last week  at the age of 79.   A lifelong resident of Northampton, Massachusetts, which I had the  honor of representing for 20 years, General Keefe dedicated his life in  service to our country, his community, and protecting the freedoms we  all hold so dear.   He was called an airman's airman and wore the uniform with great  honor and, indeed, distinction.   I knew General Keefe well and got to see firsthand what an exemplary  leader and decent person he was. Beyond his military accomplishments  and commendations, he was a loving husband, a dedicated father and  grandfather, and, indeed, to many of us, a very good friend.   General Keefe enlisted with the 104th Fighter Wing at Barnes Air  National Guard Base as an airman in 1956 at the age of 17. He continued  to work his way up the ranks, becoming an officer and eventually  serving as the wing's vice commander.   In 1999, General Keefe was asked to serve as adjutant general of the  Massachusetts National Guard, the first Air Force officer and western  Massachusetts resident to hold that post in more than 200 years of  history. He retired in 2005, ending what is deemed a remarkable  military career.   The motto in the Air Force is: ``Aim High. Fly-Fight-Win.'' George  Keefe did that for nearly a half century. On behalf of the United  States of America, I want to thank him for his distinguished service to  our Nation.   My thoughts and prayers today are with his sons, Gary, Jim, Patrick,  Tim, and their families. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
