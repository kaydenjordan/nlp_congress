 Mr. Speaker, I want to recite this prayer:   Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom  come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day  our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who  trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from  evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever  and ever.   In Jesus' name, Amen.                            ____________________
