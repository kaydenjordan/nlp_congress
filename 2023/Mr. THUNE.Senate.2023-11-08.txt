 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, engraved on a wall at the Korean Veterans  Memorial in Washington, DC, are these words: ``Freedom is not free.''   ``Freedom is not free.''   It is a stark reminder that our freedom has come at a cost; that it  has been bought and paid for in blood, in dark days and terrifying  nights of battle, in fear and loneliness, in Christmases and holidays  and birthdays spent far from home, in visible wounds and in invisible  wounds.   And on Veterans Day, above all, we remember this. We remember that we  live in peace and freedom because men and women have answered our  country's call, have stepped up and said, ``I will serve,'' and have  paid a price for that service.   One of my greatest honors as a U.S. Senator is having the opportunity  to interact with military veterans. And in addition to meeting veterans  around South Dakota, I have had the immense privilege of visiting with  veterans who come to Washington, DC, on Honor Flights.   For anyone not familiar with the organization, Honor Flight is a  nonprofit that exists to bring military veterans to Washington, DC, to  visit the memorials that have been created in their honor.   At its inception, it focused on bringing World War II veterans to DC,  but now, with members of the ``greatest generation'' few and far  between, Honor Flights have been filling up with veterans of Korea and  Vietnam as well as critically ill veterans from all eras.   I have been lucky enough to participate in three Honor Flight visits  so far this year, organized by Midwest Honor Flight, which is our local  Honor Flight hub in South Dakota. And the chance to interact with these  heroes who have sacrificed to defend and preserve American freedoms is  not something I take for granted. Seeing the look in their eyes as they  visit the memorials--knowing that for some it will be the last  opportunity they have to visit--is a profound privilege and a reminder  of all these men and women have given for our country.   It is also deeply moving to hear from the family members who  accompany these veterans, a number of whom have told me how cathartic  these visits have been for their loved ones--sometimes marking the  first time they really talked about their wartime experience.   On multiple occasions when I have been down at the memorials visiting  with Honor Flight veterans, I have seen students with school groups  come up to these veterans and thank them. It is really an amazing thing  to witness. And it has made me reflect on just how important it is that  children have these opportunities to see and thank our veterans and to  understand what they have given us.   Ronald Reagan once said that freedom is always only one generation  removed from extinction. It can't be passed on in the bloodstream. It  has to be fought for and defended and handed down for our children to  do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our  children's children what it was once like to live in the United States  of America where men are free.  [[Page S5411]]    Freedom is, indeed, a fragile thing. It is easy to take it for  granted when you have it. But it is not a guarantee, and it must,  indeed, be fought for and defended constantly by each generation.   Seeing those schoolchildren interact with veterans who have helped  secure our freedom reminded me of the importance of handing down an  understanding of that freedom to our children, of teaching them just  what our military men and women have fought and died for, and of  reminding them that it will be their responsibility to preserve it.   Seeing those schoolchildren and veterans interact also reminded me  that we should hold up our veterans to young people, not just as  examples to revere but as examples to imitate. We should make sure that  young people know that serving their country in the U.S. military is  one of the noblest paths that they could take and that while military  life is a life of sacrifice, it is also a life of meaning and purpose,  one that offers pride and brotherhood and the lasting knowledge that  your labor has made a difference.   On Veterans Day and every day, I am grateful to those who have  answered our Nation's call and taken up arms in defense of liberty. May  God bless all the men and women who serve or have served in the U.S.  military and may He help us to live lives worthy of their sacrifice.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).
