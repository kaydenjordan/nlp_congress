 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Bass for her  extraordinary work and leadership on this bill.   When history is written, it will ask: Why our Nation had to watch  George Floyd have the life drained from his body by the knee of a White  police officer to know that our system was broken? Why our country had  to learn Breonna Taylor's name to know that no-knock warrants get Black  people murdered in their rooms? Why our country had to see Ahmaud  Arbery hunted and lynched to know that there is an unshakeable target  on Black men in this country?   For too long, we let ignorance coddle white supremacists, we let  idleness shelter oppression and hate. But we can move from ignorance  and idleness to action. We can use the power of this body and this  Chamber to do more than acknowledge the movement. We can join it. We  can pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act today.   Because justice is a nation that didn't have to learn George Floyd,  Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery's names. That is justice.
