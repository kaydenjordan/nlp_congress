 Madam Speaker, this week, House Democrats have led the  effort to pass comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation to  address this epidemic here in America. We will also ensure that the  American people know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the  truth with respect to the violent insurrection and attack on our  Capitol to protect the integrity of our democracy.   At the same time, we continue to fight for good-paying jobs, to lower  costs and ensure an economy that works for everyday Americans. We  believe in a country where if you work hard and play by the rules, you  should be able to provide a comfortable living for yourself and for  your family, educate your children, purchase a home, and retire with  grace and dignity. That is the great American Dream that we are  fighting to preserve for the people.                            ____________________
