 Madam President, the great American labor organizer  Delores Huerta said:         Every moment is an organizing opportunity, every person [is       a] potential activist, [and] every minute [is] a chance to       change the world.    In that spirit, I rise to bid farewell to a member of my team, Dan  Mahr.   Dan sees every constituent as an opportunity to connect and every  townhall meeting as a chance to change someone's world.   I host a lot of townhall meetings in Oregon--one in every one of our  36 counties every year. One time, Dan and I were hosting a townhall  meeting in rural eastern Oregon, where an older, conservative rancher  was waiting in line to talk to me and had that look on his face where  he just knew he was pretty unhappy and wanted to let me know why. Well,  Dan noticed him too. He started chatting with him, and pretty soon,  that stony expression began to crack, and the conversation began to  warm up. By the time that stern rancher had made it to me, he was  chuckling and patting Dan on the back.   As we left that meeting, everyone, including our church ladies and  our ranchers and our farmers--everyone--to our rural hippies, was  giving Dan extra handshakes on the way out the door. That is how it was  in townhalls where Dan was staffing.   He joined my team in 2016, 7 years ago, after a decade of fighting  for unions and working families across America. As my senior labor  adviser, he has stood up to the powerful on behalf of the working  people all across our State. He has been one of my field  representatives, serving folks in North Central Oregon, in Clackamas  County and Wasco and Hood River and Sherman and Gilliam Counties. But  he didn't just get the job done in those counties; he was always the  first person to volunteer to staff a townhall meeting for his teammates  no matter how far away it is across the State. He just loves being out  on the road in Oregon. He has driven thousands of miles, set up  thousands of chairs, met thousands of Oregonians. Whenever a new field  representative joined our team, he was the first to welcome that  individual to Team Merkley, to go with him or her to their first  townhall, to lend a helping hand at the events.   Our work is important to him because if folks are taking their time  out of busy lives to come to a townhall meeting, he wants to give them  the respect that goes with feeling welcome and feeling heard. And, of  course, that is exactly the attitude I take to those meetings.   Well, Dan's dedication to constituents' services is renowned on the  team, not just for his personal touch but also for his personal  tenacity. There is a saying--a saying I like a lot--that tenacity is a  superpower. I experienced that a few times in my life. I certainly  believe it is true.   Ever since I was first elected to the Senate in 2008, I have been  hearing about funding for economic development in the Columbia River  Gorge.  [[Page S5356]]  That funding had been authorized when the Columbia River National  Scenic Area was established in 1986. In that scenic area, every  community had restrictions on what additional buildings they could  create, so they felt for sure the Federal Government would hold up its  side of the deal and deliver that money for economic development in  compensation. They did get some of that money in the 1990s but not the  full amount. They were millions of dollars short. It came up at meeting  after meeting after meeting: Where is that money the Federal Government  promised us? It was an issue folks were not going to let go of.   Of course, I wanted to deliver that funding, but I had to have a key  staff member work on it, and that key staff member was Dan--working on  it for 5 years, finding strategies in which we could get additional  pieces of funding delivered until every single dollar had made it  through tricky local politics, bistate politics, to help the  stakeholders who live throughout the Columbia Gorge. There was no  silver-bullet moment; it was just year after year of planning and  pushing and seizing key opportunities to fulfill promises to ordinary  Oregonians. In the end, fulfill they did. Dan secured those millions of  dollars in economic development for the Columbia Gorge.   He was just as tenacious about protecting local services, too, like  when he kept open the West Linn Post Office. After 2 years of searching  for a permanent site, one day in August, we heard that the U.S. Postal  Service had decided to just close the doors on the post office in  September, right before the November election. Just 6 weeks before the  2020 Presidential election, in a State where we vote by mail, in the  midst of COVID, right before the holidays, the post office is going to  close the doors on that post office. They had just given up on finding  a new location. That post office serves a city of 26,000 people.   Dan went immediately to work, organizing our delegation, our local  officials, working with the Postal Service to find a better solution,  insisting that no way those doors could be closed, making sure that  everyone felt the urgency, and ultimately secured the extension of that  post office and kept it open. At the election, people could cast their  ballots. People could receive their medications, and they could mail  their gifts to their loved ones during the holidays.   But there is more to the story because the post office continued to  insist on closing. Well, again, Dan helped organize. He helped carry  the message that that was unacceptable, and eventually the U.S. Postal  Service got the message, found a suitable location, and the people of  West Linn, OR, were overjoyed. But it took tenacity, and that is what  Dan brought to the ballot.    He is also tenacious, by the way, when he is trying to win a game of  table tennis. I can neither confirm nor deny that he ripped a pair of  suit pants in a table tennis match with an unnamed U.S. Senator.   He has been tenacious as my labor adviser. Whether working with  bakers, the building trades, nurses, teachers, timber workers, public  employees, everyone knows that Dan is a partner they can trust. He has  navigated countless labor issues to ensure the working families of  Oregon get the pay and benefits they earned.   A few years ago, there was a difficult discussion about a major  project in Oregon. It would have created a lot of construction jobs,  but it also would have done a lot of damage to the climate. In that  situation, with this benefit and this problem, Dan was a supreme  professional, the supreme diplomat, ensuring that full and accurate  information was brought to bear and that everyone's perspectives was  carefully considered and weighed. In the end, of course, not everyone  agreed with the ultimate outcome, but so many were impressed by the  thorough and transparent process that Dan facilitated.   Dan is the kind of guy who brings a positive angle to every  situation. One time, my team members, after driving 8 hours across  Oregon--big State; I know that is hard to envision here on the east  coast--they were driving 8 hours to host an event and discovered the  local motel rooms were out of commission, so they would have to drive  after the event an additional 3 hours to find accommodation. The team  really was exhausted and just wanted to climb in bed and go to sleep,  but they couldn't. But Dan said:         Hey, let's use this as an opportunity to see Oregon's only       geyser.    The water table had come up, and the geyser was back in action. So  they went in search of the geyser before hitting the road, and they  found it, and they were thrilled to see it because few in Oregon ever  have. It was an effective pivot for an exhausted and quite cranky crew.  As one of them said afterward:         It was very, very cool. I'm so grateful that Dan made us       slow down a bit. He always encourages us to enjoy the trip,       enjoy the sights, and enjoy each other's company.    I know he has done that for me. I remember a day after many miles and  many events when we had a little bit of time before our next stop. We  went by his house in Hood River, sat on his porch--sat on his rocking  chairs on his porch--hung out, laughed, relaxed, and played with his  dog. It was just what we all needed, and Dan knew it.   I began these remarks quoting Dolores Huerta, who said that ``every  minute is a chance to change the world.'' She also said:         I think the importance of doing activist work is to engage       people and give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for       a better tomorrow. Hope that change is possible, and that       they can be part of that transformation.    Dan has engaged and given hope to so many ordinary people--hope for a  better Oregon, hope for a better community, hope for a better tomorrow.  Most importantly, he has shown folks that, working together, change is  possible and that they can be part of that transformation.   So many people I met have a great story about Dan and some way he has  helped them or helped their town or just that they have enjoyed knowing  him. He embodies the best spirit of Team Merkley. So it is with deep  gratitude that Team Merkley and I thank Dan Mahr for his service to the  people of Oregon, and we wish him all the best in his next chapter.
