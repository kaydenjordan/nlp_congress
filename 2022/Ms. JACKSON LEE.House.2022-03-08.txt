 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Bipartisan  Congressional HBCU Caucus and an original co-sponsor, I rise in strong  support of H. Con. Res. 70, a resolution condemning threats of violence  against historically Black colleges and universities (``HBCUs'') and  reaffirming support for HBCUs and their students.   I thank Congresswoman Alma Adams and Congressman French Hill, the co- chairs of the HBCU Caucus, for their work in bringing this important  legislation to the floor.   A high-quality education is central to economic prosperity and social  well-being in the United States and HBCUs provide educational and  economic opportunities for postsecondary students.   As early as the 19th century, HBCUs were established in response to  discriminatory practices that excluded Black Americans from pursuing an  education in the United States.   HBCUs educate and produce a significant share of the Nation's Black  leaders and innovators.   On January 5, 2022, at least 8 HBCUs received bomb threats, including  Howard University, Xavier University, University of Arkansas at Pine  Bluff, Prairie View A&M University, North Carolina Central University,  Florida Memorial University, Norfolk State University, and Spelman  College.   On January 31, 2022, at least 6 HBCUs received bomb threats,  including Southern University and A&M, Howard University, Bethune- Cookman University, Albany State University, Bowie State University,  and Delaware State University.   On February 1, 2022, the first day of Black History Month, at least  18 HBCUs received bomb threats, including Shorter College, Philander  Smith College, Arkansas Baptist College, the University of the District  of Columbia, Howard University, Edward Waters University, Spelman  College, Fort Valley State University, Kentucky State University,  Xavier University, Coppin State University, Morgan State University,  Jackson State University, Alcorn State University, Mississippi Valley  State University, Rust College, Tougaloo College, and Harris-Stowe  State University.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the bomb threats  made in January and February 2022 against HBCUs as racially or  ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes.  [[Page H1352]]    Mr. Speaker, I am proud that one of the greatest HBCUs in the  country, Texas Southern University, is located in my congressional  district.   Texas Southern University has a rich history with nine academic  units, 1,000 dedicated staff members, and over 9,200 esteemed students.   Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, I have worked closely with my  local HBCU to provide funding and resources needed to enable them to  fulfill their mission of educating the next generation of social  engineers and conducting research programs addressing issues of major  concern to the African American community.    As Chairwoman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on  Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection in the 111th  Congress, I authored the legislation to establish a Transportation  Security Center of Excellence at TSU and worked to help TSU secure $1.2  million in funding over four years from the Department of Homeland  Security for this Center of Excellence.   One of my proudest accomplishments as a member of Congress is my  success in working with federal officials in the Clinton Administration  to settle the lawsuit against TSU that had been pending for more than  23 years.   I was proud to spearhead the initiative that brought more than $13  million in financial aid relief for the students and campus of Texas  Southern University.   I also worked with TSU administrators to initiate digital archive  projects to preserve the records of two of its most distinguished  alumni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, both of whom  preceded me as the Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional  District of Texas.   I was pleased to facilitate a partnership between Comcast and TSU's  School of Communication to provide' scholarships and internships to TSU  students and in-kind marketing services to the university.   I helped secure funding needed to establish the Center for  Transportation, Training and Research in the TSU College of Science,  Engineering, and Technology.   HBCU's have played a critical role in American history.   As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stated:   ``The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and  to think critically. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of  true education.''   HBCUs do not just educate--HBCUs have and will continue to fill an  important role in education opportunity and engagement for millions of  young people from diverse backgrounds.   I ask my colleagues to joining me in voting to pass H. Con. Res. 70,  condemning threats of violence against one of the nation's greatest  resources, historically black colleges and universities.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary and Homeland Security, the Tom Lantos Human Rights  Commission, the bipartisan Congressional International Religious  Freedom Caucus, and the Helsinki Commission, I rise in strong support  of H. Res. 881, a resolution that puts the House on record in  condemnation of the heinous terrorist attack on Congregation Beth  Israel in Colleyville, Texas on January 15, 2022 and against anti- Semitism wherever this hate rears its ugly head.   On January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal Akram entered Congregation Beth  Israel in Colleyville, Texas, taking four individuals hostage.   Britain's counterintelligence and security agency, MI5, investigated  Mr. Akram in 2020, and he was listed as a subject of interest, but was  later determined to no longer pose a threat.   Mr. Akram arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on December  29, 2021, staying in New York City for two days until taking a flight  to Dallas, Texas.   Whereas it is reported Mr. Akram chose the synagogue because it  appeared to be the closest gathering of Jewish people to a Federal  prison where he demanded to see a woman who is in custody after being  found guilty of two counts of attempted murder,  [[Page H1355]]  armed assault, using and carrying a firearm, and three counts of  assault on United States officers and employees in Afghanistan.   The four hostages were held for nearly 11 hours, during that time  Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker used the skills he learned by attending  several security courses hosted by local law enforcement, the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Secure  Community Network.   Worshipers who were watching the service virtually contacted local  law enforcement once they realized there was an incident underway at  Congregation Beth Israel.   Thankfully, because of the swift response from local, State, and  Federal law enforcement officers and emergency responders on the  ground, no hostages were harmed during the hostage situation.   Mr. Speaker, nearly thirty years ago, as a young mother, I first  visited Israel and the Holy Land, and I have returned many times since  then to the region that gave birth to three of the world's great  religions, civilizations, and cultures.   I have been a passionate supporter of the Mickey Leland Kibbutzim  Internship program, which for nearly thirty years has enabled inner- city high school students who live or study in the 18th Congressional  District the opportunity to spend a summer in Israel.   As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe,  better known as the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I have traveled abroad on  numerous occasions to participate in parliamentary diplomacy in support  of OSCE and other European efforts to combat anti-Semitism, including  legislation calling for increased security for the Jewish community,  funds for civil society coalitions to combat hate, and a U.S.-EU Joint  Action Plan to combat prejudice and discrimination that would include a  specific focus on anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 74 years have passed since the end of World War  II but for those who survived, and the descendants and relatives of  those who perished, the Holocaust is not ancient history but a reminder  of the evil that can be unleased when humans give into their worst  instincts and appetites.   The Holocaust is the worst example of man's inhumanity to man in I  human history and the magnitude of its destruction numbered more than  12 million deaths, including 6 million Jews and 1.5 million children.   A haunting quote in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  refers to the story of Cain and Abel:         The Lord said, ``What have you done? Listen! Your brother's       blood cries out to me from the ground (Genesis 4:11).    The Holocaust is a testament to the fragility of democracy, and it  forces us to confront uncomfortable questions such as the  responsibilities of citizenship and the consequences of indifference  and inaction, and the importance of education and awareness.   That is why we, all of us, must reject and resist prejudice and  intolerance in any form.   Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is the name for the bigotry and form of  racism endured for centuries by Jewish people for no other reason that  simply because they are Jews.   According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2020 and 2021 there were  a combined 8,366 acts of extremism or hate crimes against Jews or  Jewish institutions, constituting 55.1 percent of all religious-based  hate crimes.   There is an urgent need to ensure the safety and security of Jewish  communities, including synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other  institutions.   Outside of the United States, Jews are the targets of anti-Semitic  violence at even higher rates in many other countries.   Anti-Semitism includes scapegoating or blaming Jews as Jews when  things go wrong; calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or  harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or extremist view of  religion; or making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or  stereotyped allegations about Jews.   Mr. Speaker, we need to denounce and reject forcefully and  continuously the scapegoating and targeting of Jews in the United  States that has persisted for many years, including by the Ku Klux  Klan, the America First Committee, and by modern neo-Nazis, whose  membership decidedly is not comprised of ``very fine people.''   Let us be very clear: these purveyors of hate will not win because as  the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., taught; persecution of any  American is an assault on the rights and freedoms of all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is wrong and based on a lie--as are  racism, Islamophobia, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia--but remember  the words of William Cullen Bryant, who said:       Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again;      The eternal years of God are hers;      But Error, wounded, writhes in pain,      And dies among his worshippers.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for H. Res. 881 and  I encourage every person in the United States to confront and reject  anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry and do all they can to ensure  that the United States lives up to the transcendent principles of  tolerance, religious freedom, and equal protection as embodied in the  Declaration of Independence and the first and 14th amendments to the  Constitution that have made it the envy and the hope of the world.    Madam Speaker, I rise to support H. Con. Res. 70,  Condemning Threats of Violence Against Historically Black Colleges and  Universities.   What an appalling, atrocious act to attack these historic colleges  founded in the midst of the 19th century in the aftermath of slavery.   On January 5, 2022, at least eight HBCUs received bomb threats; on  January 31, 2022, at least six; and then on February 1, 2022, 18. We  must not only denounce it; we must protect these young people and  ensure their protection.   I also rise in support of H. Res. 881, Condemning the Heinous  Terrorist Attack on Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas.   We must denounce and reject forcefully and continuously the  scapegoating and targeting of Jews in the United States and, as well,  terrorism that subjects them to this kind of action.  [[Page H1358]]    Let's continue to stand for the freedom of all.   And I, as well, stand for the freedom of Ukrainian women and Ukraine.  I support their freedom and bravery as they fled to protect their  families, but yet, those who stood their ground and are fighting on the  front lines.   We must stop the heinous, evil, vile, and terrorist Mr. Putin, who is  attacking Ukraine violently. We must win, and we must win right, and we  must fight and preserve democracy.                            ____________________
