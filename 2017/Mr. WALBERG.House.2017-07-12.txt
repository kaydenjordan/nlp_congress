 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the FDA  Reauthorization Act, and I want to thank Chairman Walden and the other  bipartisan leadership on the committee for bringing this bipartisan  bill to the floor today.   As science and technology advances at a rapid rate, the potential for  breakthroughs to treat and cure some of the worst diseases are truly  within our reach; yet all too often, our laws and regulations are stuck  in the past. That is why reauthorizing the Food and Drug  Administration's user fee programs is so important.   This bipartisan bill builds off the important work we accomplished  through the 21st Century Cures Act. It will help speed up the approval  process for lifesaving drugs, foster greater competition, and bring  down costs for patients. It will also help ensure America remains on  the forefront of medical innovation and that good-paying jobs in the  medical device industry remain here at home.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and together we  can offer a healthier future for our patients.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2664) to direct the Secretary of Labor to train certain  Department of Labor personnel how to effectively detect and assist law  enforcement in preventing human trafficking during the course of their  primary roles and responsibilities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2664         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Detection of Human       Trafficking Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.         In this Act the term ``human trafficking'' means an act or       practice described in paragraph (9) or (10) of section 103 of       the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C.       7102).       SEC. 3. TRAINING FOR DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO IDENTIFY HUMAN                     TRAFFICKING.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall implement       a program to--        (1) train and periodically retrain relevant personnel       across the Department of Labor that the Secretary considers       appropriate, how to effectively detect and assist law       enforcement in preventing human trafficking during the course       of their primary roles and responsibilities; and        (2) ensure that such personnel regularly receive current       information on matters related to the detection of human       trafficking, including information that becomes available       outside of the Department's initial or periodic retraining       schedule, to the extent relevant to their official duties and       consistent with applicable information and privacy laws.        (b) Training Described.--The training referred to in       subsection (a) may be conducted through in-class or virtual       learning capabilities, and shall include--        (1) methods for identifying suspected victims of human       trafficking and, where appropriate, perpetrators of human       trafficking;        (2) training that is most appropriate for a particular       location or environment in which the personnel receiving such       training perform their official duties;        (3) other topics determined by the Secretary to be       appropriate reflecting current trends and best practices for       personnel in their particular location or professional       environment;        (4) a clear course of action for referring potential cases       of human trafficking to the Department of Justice and other       appropriate authorities; and        (5) a post-training evaluation for personnel receiving the       training.       SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, and each year thereafter, the Secretary of Labor       shall report to the appropriate congressional committees on       the training provided to the personnel referred to in section       3(a), including--        (1) an evaluation of such training and the overall       effectiveness of the program required by this Act;        (2) the number of cases referred by Department of Labor       personnel in which human trafficking was suspected and the       metrics used by the Department to accurately measure and       track its response to instances of suspected human       trafficking; and        (3) the number of Department of Labor employees who have       completed such training as required by this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from the Northern Mariana  Islands (Mr. Sablan) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2664.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2664.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, the Enhancing  Detection of Human Trafficking Act.   Labor trafficking is the illegal exploitation of an individual for  commercial gain. It knows no geological limits. It happens across our  country and around the globe, including in my home State of Michigan.   Victims of labor trafficking are not a uniform group of people.  Victims are young children, teenagers, men, and women.   In my home State of Michigan, the National Human Trafficking Hotline  reported over 38 cases in 2016 involving labor trafficking. This is a  52 percent increase in the number of reported cases since 2015.   Globally, the International Labor Organization estimates there are 21  million people trapped in forced labor.   The growing number of human trafficking cases is alarming and more  needs to be done to identify victims, catch traffickers, and end this  form of modern-day slavery.   In the course of inspecting workplace safety and labor law compliance  within the United States, Department of Labor employees often have a  front line to view and to identify patterns of labor exploitation.  Providing these employees with the proper training to detect and  respond to the signs of human trafficking is an important part of the  larger comprehensive effort to eradicate this unthinkable crime.   The Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act would ensure the  Department has a formal framework in place to detect trafficking and  refer cases to law enforcement for prosecution.   Specifically, H.R. 2664 would:   Direct the Department of Labor to train appropriate staff on how to  effectively detect instances of human trafficking;   Ensure personnel regularly receive information on current trends and  best practices;   Allow flexible training options, including in-class and virtual  learning options;   Establish a clear course of action for referring suspected instances  of human trafficking to law enforcement; and   Require an evaluation and report to Congress on the implementation of  the training and the metrics used to measure and track the agency's  response to human trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest obstacles we face in the fight  against human trafficking is awareness. H.R. 2664 will ensure  Department of Labor employees have the right training so that they  recognize and effectively respond to this modern-day slavery.   I also thank Ranking Member Sablan for his bipartisan support and  work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the distinguished chairman  of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, each year millions of men, women, and children are  trafficked around the world, including in the United States. It is  important that we combat this epidemic.   The Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act is truly a  bipartisan bill that will ensure that those who are in the field have  knowledge, skills, and tools that they need to identify instances of  human trafficking, assist victims, and properly refer cases so  perpetrators can be brought to justice.   I would like to reiterate my appreciation to Representative Sablan  for his support and work on this important issue. This is truly a  bipartisan issue. It is an American issue. It is a human issue.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2664, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2664.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
