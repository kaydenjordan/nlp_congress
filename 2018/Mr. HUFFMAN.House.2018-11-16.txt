 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill for a number of  reasons, but I would specifically like to address how the bill  undermines science.   Congress enacted the ESA to conserve and protect endangered and  threatened species and their habitats in the U.S. and abroad. Congress  also recognized that scientists, not Members of Congress--even me, ones  like me with political science degrees--scientists have the necessary  expertise to make decisions about species' protection. So the ESA  requires that the Fish and Wildlife Service make the decisions  regarding species listing and delisting. The law entrusts the Service's  scientists to determine what is best for imperiled species, such as the  gray wolf, using the best available science.   The ESA is credited as being one of the most science-based laws on  the books, but this bill completely eliminates scientists from the  decisionmaking process. It mandates that all gray wolves be removed  from the ESA in the lower 48. In doing so, it short-circuits the law's  science-based process  [[Page H9545]]  that determines when species have recovered and when protections are  appropriately removed.                                time  0930    Despite years of Republican efforts to ignore the science behind the  ESA, we know it has been a huge success. Ninety-nine percent of listed  species have continued to survive, and 90 percent are on schedule to  meet their recovery goals. So we should be working to make the gray  wolf another one of those ESA success stories, not eliminating the  protections that have helped put it on a path to recovery.   When the gray wolf was listed in the early 1970s, there were only a  few hundred left in the wild. Since then, scientists have shown that  the reintroduction of gray wolves in the Northern Rockies has been a  huge ecological and economic success. I was able to see gray wolves in  Yellowstone with Mr. Beyer and Mr. DeFazio earlier this year and to see  the ecosystem that has rebounded since their reintroduction.   We are on the right track, but science shows that ESA protection is  still needed. Currently, these wolves occupy only 5 percent of their  historic range and only 36 percent of their suitable habitat. So while  it is encouraging that the wolves are recovering and even coming into  California for the first time in 90 years, a handful of these animals  hardly shows that it is time for them to be delisted.   Instead of enacting a new law to eliminate protections, we ought to  be working with landowners, local and State agencies, and others to  prevent conflicts so that we and wolves can both thrive.   I would like to point out that if American citizens believe an agency  does not follow the letter of the law, under the ESA, they have the  right to hold the government accountable in court. It is part of the  system of checks and balances that must be protected.   Politically driven, species-specific legislation like this sets a  dangerous precedent for delisting. It opens the door to future partisan  attacks on vulnerable species. Legislative delisting measures like this  one undermine the scientific process fundamental to the success of the  Endangered Species Act. Scientists, not Congress, should make these  decisions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
