 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and the ranking  member for H. Res. 104. Mr. Speaker, I stand to support this  resolution.   The sovereignty of any nation should, at the very least, be defined  by its physical barriers. Certainly, sovereignty extends far beyond  geographic borders, but at its base, a sovereign nation not only has  the right to defend itself against intrusion, but it has the  responsibility to do so.   Daily, our executive branch chooses policy pathways in the areas of  national defense, foreign affairs, and homeland security that weaken  the sovereignty of these United States. We see this on the southern  border on a minute-by-minute basis.   This past week, we saw this weak-minded leadership when we failed to  [[Page H798]]  take timely and decisive action to shoot down what we knew was an  intelligence-gathering balloon on a mission from the Chinese Communist  Party.   This Nation is capable of strong and decisive action to protect its  national interests, but we must be willing to act on this capability.   Let the foreign affairs and national defense policies in this Nation  be strong, strategic, and steady. If we are not, our sovereignty will  certainly erode to nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I stand again to support H. Res. 104 and appreciate the  bipartisan support on this issue. In doing so, I stand to support the  sovereignty of the United States and the security of its people.
