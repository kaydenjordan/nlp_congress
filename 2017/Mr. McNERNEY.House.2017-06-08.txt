 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the safety and future  of the American people is in jeopardy.   Last week, the President made the irresponsible decision to withdraw  the United States from the Paris climate accord. Military and national  security leaders have asserted the need to address climate change as an  imminent global threat. Removal from the Paris accord abdicates  America's global leadership and increases the likelihood of climate  disasters.   However, where our President has failed, State and local leaders are  stepping up and leading. For example, last week, California's Governor,  Jerry Brown, brokered an agreement with China on reducing emissions. On  the campaign trail, the President had a lot to say about China taking  American jobs, but when he had the chance to pave the way to create  American job growth, he failed.   We must combat climate change and continue to deploy clean energy  sources across the Nation that benefit our national security and create  jobs.                            ____________________
