 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   We are living in a time of record job loss with 10 million people out  of work and many businesses devastated by this pandemic. That is why  this legislation is critical.   We must invest in helping people gain the skills they need to prepare  for high-quality jobs that earn good wages. This apprenticeship act  will do exactly that, including those with barriers to employment.   This investment is projected to yield $10.6 billion in net benefits  to U.S. taxpayers by increasing their productivity and decreasing  spending on public assistance programs and unemployment insurance.  Equally important, it will help countless Americans achieve the dignity  of providing for their families and the satisfaction of having good  jobs.   This is exactly the kind of investment that will help us build back  better.
