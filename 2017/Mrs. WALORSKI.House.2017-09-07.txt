 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Indiana's  State Senator Luke Kenley on his retirement, and to thank him for the  many years he dedicated to serving our fellow Hoosiers.   From balancing the budget to reforming State taxes, he has worked for  25 years to empower local communities and strengthen Indiana's economy.  He led important efforts to enhance our schools, roads, businesses,  local institutions, and more.   Senator Kenley's commitment to Hoosier common sense, and his tireless  efforts to bring our State's economy into the 21st century, helped  transform Indiana and improve Hoosiers' lives. I am grateful for  Senator Kenley's leadership and his keen understanding of the Hoosier  values that are so important to our way of life. I have no doubt his  impact on our State will last far into the future.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Indiana State  Senator Luke Kenley the absolute best as he embarks on this next  chapter in life.                            ____________________
