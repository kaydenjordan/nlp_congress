 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 600,000 DACA  recipients who are terrified that a forthcoming court ruling will force  them to leave the only country they've lived in and loved.   These young men and women came to the U.S. as newborns and small  children. They've attended American schools, served in the U.S.  military, and they contribute their multitude of talents to our  nation's economy every day.   Despite having built their lives here, DACA recipients live with fear  that their legal status will be ripped away from them by a disastrous  court decision. They've lived with this uncertainty for over a decade,  and they deserve a permanent solution.   I'm proud to have voted for the Dream Act which offers a pathway to  citizenship for Dreamers. The legislation passed the House with a  bipartisan vote last year and is supported by the faith community,  business leaders, law enforcement, and over two-thirds of the American  people.   Despite being supported by a large majority of Americans, Senate  Republicans have repeatedly blocked the Dream Act, forcing the lives of  Dreamers to remain in limbo. This is unacceptable. Denying basic  protections to these brave young men and women dishonors our proud  heritage as a nation of immigrants.   Dreamers are Americans in all but name. They've been subjected to the  cruelty of our broken immigration system for far too long, and it's  time for Congress to live up to our promise to protect the Dreamers so  that they can continue to strengthen and enrich our Nation.                            ____________________
