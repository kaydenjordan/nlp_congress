 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the tremendous  news we all received over the weekend that the world's most wanted  terrorist and leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a  U.S.-led raid in northern Syria.   As the self-proclaimed leader of the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi was  directly involved in countless atrocities and demonstrated complete  disregard for human rights and human life. Genocide, sex slavery,  organized rape, mass executions via crucifixion, stoning, burning in  cages or flogging--al-Baghdadi's brutality knew no limits.   The world is unquestionably a better place without this purveyor of  evil inhabiting it at this time.   I commend U.S. Joint Special Operations Command's 1st Special Forces  Operational Detachment-Delta, also known as Delta Force, for the  flawless execution of their mission--and without any U.S. casualties.   I also commend President Trump and his administration for authorizing  this raid and bringing one of the most dangerous men in the world to  justice. They are doing good work in the Syria situation. This will go  down as a significant achievement in the war against terror.   In the immediate aftermath of the announcement becoming public, most  rational people from both sides of the aisle celebrated this  accomplishment--but not all.   Mr. Speaker, you may have seen the headlines from the Washington  Post: ``Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an austere religious scholar at the helm  of Islamic State dies at 48.''   Even in this age of questionable reporting, this headline and others  like it are reprehensible. In fact, his last cowardly action on Earth  was to detonate a suicide vest as he was being hunted down by some of  our specialized military dogs as well as our personnel. Great work. In  doing so, with his suicide vest, he also took the lives of three of his  own children.   U.S. Special Operations Forces didn't kill just a noble religious  scholar as was headlined. They actually killed a deranged, radicalized  madman who was directly responsible for the brutal murders of countless  people: Americans and his own country people from that part of the  world as well.   While the headline has since been changed by the Washington Post,  they should be ashamed of themselves. We don't mourn the loss of  terrorists in the United States of America.    Now, this victory doesn't mean the war against terror is won by any  means, but it should send a loud, clear, and unmistakable message to  the rest of the world that the United States will root out evil  wherever it is and wherever it hides. Our enemies are not safe, and  they never will be.   We celebrate this evil's removal from the Earth embodied by al- Baghdadi. Anyone who is willing to commit these types of atrocities  should understand one thing: We will not rest as a Nation and as a  military until they are wiped out from the face of the Earth.                            ____________________
