 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   Mr. President, I have major concerns about this unanimous consent  request. But let me start first with the process, whether we should be  legislating a policy in regard to the health of our pages. Despite what  the Senator from Kentucky has said, the policies concerning our pages'  health is not set on a partisan basis; it is set based upon the  recommendations of our health professionals. They are not politicians.  They are not making partisan decisions. They are making their  recommendations based upon what they believe is in the best interests  of the health of the people who work in this institution, including our  Senate pages.   So I am concerned about the unanimous consent request because it  would legislate areas that should be left to the administration based  upon the recommendations of our health professionals.   Secondly, as I look at the legislation that the unanimous consent  would adopt, it goes well beyond COVID-19 vaccines. It goes to wearing  a mask, having a legislative prohibition about requiring a page to wear  a mask.   That is pretty broad. We don't know what is coming. We don't know  what our requirements are going to be and needs to deal with public  health in this institution. Again, that should be left to the health  professionals. We shouldn't be micromanaging what the health  professionals tell us is in the best interests of the people who work  in this institution.   Let just me point out that COVID-19 cases are rising all over. We  know that. We don't know what is going to be the best countermeasures  in order to deal with that, but we do know that vaccinations, testing,  and masking are effective countermeasures to reduce the spread of  COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.   I recognize that Senator Paul has put into his comments studies that  he has quoted. The overwhelming evidence that has been presented by the  health professionals globally, including here in the United States, is  that vaccinations, testing, and masking are effective.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the listing of those types of studies that would counter what Senator  Paul has said.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  COVID-19 Studies Regarding Countermeasure Effectiveness for Adolescents         COVID-19 Vaccination Protects Children and Adolescents (The       Lancet, Sept 2022), https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ laninf/article/PIIS1473-30992200575-8/fulltext        Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines in Adolescents Over       6 Months (Pediatrics, Nov 2022), https:// pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3594567/  Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization among       adolescent and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases between May 2021       and January 2022 in Ontario, Canada: A retrospective cohort       study (PLoS One, 2023) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ articles/PMC10065234/  Effectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in Children       and Adolescents (Pediatrics, April 2023), https:// publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/151/5/e2022060894/ 191035/Effectiveness-of-BNT162b2-COVID-19-Vaccination- in?autologincheck=redirected        Safety of COVID-19 Vaccination in United States Children       Ages 5 to 11 Years.

Mr. President, schools throughout and the Nation  implement public health requirements to keep students, teachers, and  their communities safe. Let me remind my colleagues, the pages are in  the Page School. They should be treated no differently, as far as the  protection of their health, than other students around the Nation and  those responsible for their safekeeping.   We need to follow science. We need to follow what science tells us we  should do. We shouldn't respond to the political whim or the political  pressures. We should let science make the judgments that keep our  people safe, particularly our Senate pages.   There is no credible evidence that supports a prohibition on  requiring COVID-19 vaccinations, testing, or masking. In contrast,  overwhelming evidence indicates that they are important tools in  helping to deal with these issues.   I will mention one other issue just in passing because I know we are  going to get to debate on the floor soon about the spending programs  for our country and how we are dealing with the costs. Well, there are  a lot of healthcare costs that we would like to get contained. Every  time we don't deal with the spread of an illness or a disease, it adds  to the costs to the taxpayers of this country.   The Senate has a duty of care with respect to the pages. Their well- being is our responsibility. For those reasons, I object.    Mr. President, 60 years ago last week, on Monday, August  28, hundreds of thousands of men and women descended on our Nation's  capital for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.   The march has become synonymous with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s  ``I  [[Page S4262]]  Have a Dream'' speech, which he delivered from the steps of the Lincoln  Memorial and has become a central rallying theme for the civil rights  movement.   Dr. King was prophetic in his remarks, beginning by saying that the  day ``will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom  in the history of our nation.''   To this day, it is the standard by which every other march and rally  in Washington is judged. I thank all the Marylanders who attended the  march and wanted to give a special thanks to those who joined the  reenactment last week in Annapolis, which was kicked off by the Morgan  State Marching Band. Had he lived to see the progress that has been  made, and sometimes lost, six decades later, I am confident that Dr.  King would have been uneasy and deeply frustrated that we are still  fighting many of the same battles against bigotry and racism as well as  economic repression and hate-fueled gun violence. Yet I am sure he  would have leaned into the words he spoke on March 31, 1968, just days  before his assassination, when he said:         We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is       long, but it bends towards justice.    Of course, Dr. King knew that we cannot leave it to fate to bend the  arc of the moral universe on its own. We must work together for  justice, equality, and democracy so that all people in this great  Nation can be free. As Dr. King said:         All men, yes, black men, as well as white men, would be       guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the       pursuit of happiness.    Labor leader A. Philip Randolph's opening speech at the march was  also explicit in the broad demands of the moment:         We want a free, democratic society dedicated to the       political, economic, and social advancement of men along       moral lines.    To that end, for many years in the U.S. Senate, I have been humbled  to lead the fight for a number of key civil rights measures that would  move the arc in the right direction of progress. These are basic  measures that rebuke the structural racism that has been so deeply  ingrained in our legal, social, and economic system for generations.   All of these legislative measures have healthy Democratic support;  but, regrettably, with few exceptions, they are not yet bipartisan.   So let me go through some of these efforts. First, the End Racial and  Religious Profiling Act would ban discriminatory profiling by Federal,  State, and local law enforcement nationwide. Prohibited behavior would  include targeting based on actual or perceived race, ethnicity,  nationality, religion, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.   This prohibition covers Federal, State, and local law enforcement  agencies carrying out criminal, immigration, or custom laws. Nothing in  this bill would keep law enforcement officers from pursuing suspects  based on legitimate descriptions--including their race and ethnicity,  et cetera--but the days of targeting groups of people solely on how  they look would end. My legislation was included in the broader George  Floyd Justice and Policing Act, and I was pleased to see the U.S.  Department of Justice recently strengthened their guidance against  discriminatory profiling.   Next in my efforts, I would like to mention the Democracy Restoration  Act, which would finally end the permanent denial of voting rights  nationwide for individuals with criminal convictions who have been  released from incarceration.   The bill aims to eliminate the complicated patchwork of State laws,  many harkening back to the Jim Crow era. The current system worsens  racial disparities in access to the ballot box and contributes to  confusion and misinformation regarding voting rights.   In early August, a Federal appeals court issued a decision stating  that the Mississippi's lifetime ban on voting for individuals convicted  on some felonies ``violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against  cruel and unusual punishment.''   As described by the Brennan Center For Justice:         The remarkable 2-1 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for       the Fifth Circuit will re-enfranchise tens of thousands of       people.    My legislation was included in the broader For the People and Freedom  to Vote Act legislation.   On voting rights, I joined a bipartisan working group to help pass  the Electoral Count Reform Act to address some of the tactics used to  attempt to overthrow the 2020 elections, which led to the January 6  insurrection at the Capitol.   But Congress still needs to take up and pass the John Lewis Voting  Rights Reauthorization Act to begin to repair the damage done by the  Supreme Court in curtailing the rights to vote and the use of voter  suppression tactics, particularly against minority communities.   And when it comes to the lower Federal courts such as the district  and circuit courts, I have continued to work with the Biden  administration to recommend highly qualified and diverse Federal judges  for lifetime appointments who believe in equal justice under the law  that protects all Americans.   In regards to equal rights for women, we still have unfinished  business. In May of this year, a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate  voted to remove the arbitrary deadline for the ratification of the  Equal Rights Amendment and making it the 28th Amendment to our  Constitution.   I was proud to lead the effort on this historic vote, along with my  partner in this effort, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. For more than  a decade, I have been working with a full grassroots army of women and  men who understand that constitutional equality will not be a reality  until the Equal Rights Amendment is recognized and ratified.   I first introduced a similar resolution in 2012. At that time, I had  only 17 cosponsors, and we were still three States short of  ratification.   Today, we have a bipartisan majority of Senators affirming that 38  States have ratified the ERA thanks to Virginia's ratification as the  38th State in 2020. This vote was decades in the making. I served in  the Maryland House of Delegates in 1973 when the Maryland General  Assembly voted to ratify the ERA. For my wife, my daughter, and my  granddaughters, I have been working to complete the ratification of the  ERA to protect their rights and the rights of all people across this  Nation.   The ERA simply states that equality of rights under the law shall not  be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of  sex. That is it. That is the very straightforward text of what the  Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution says. Ratification would  affirm women's equality by enshrining the principles of women's  equality and explicitly prohibiting against sex discrimination in our  Nation's founding document.   Most Americans think the ERA already is part of our Constitution, and  nearly three-quarters support it. A majority of States covering a  supermajority of Americans have equal rights or gender equality  provisions in their State constitutions--as does Maryland--but millions  are still left behind.   At the Federal level, the only current explicit guaranteed right in  the United States Constitution based on sex is the 19th Amendment,  which is the right to vote. That amendment was proposed by Congress in  1919, shortly after the end of World War I, and ratified by the States  in 1920. Clearly, existing legal protections against sex discrimination  fall well short of addressing the systemic sex-based inequality in our  society.   Congress ratified the ERA in 1972 and sent it to the States for  ratification. But back in 1972, an arbitrary deadline of 7 years was  included in the enabling legislation for the ERA. The deadline was  not--is not--in the amendment itself.   Congress extended the deadline to a full 10 years when it was clear  that 38 States would not complete their ratification in time. What we  are now trying to do is follow that precedent and change that deadline  again. Actually, we want to remove that deadline.   With Virginia's ratification in 2020, the States completed their  work, and it is now up to Congress to remove any doubt about the ERA  being part of our Constitution. This has been a struggle, but we must  make it to the finish line. Our resolution S.J. Res. 4 would clarify  once and for all that the ERA has met all the requirements of article V  of our Constitution.  [[Page S4263]]    As the 28th Amendment, the ERA would serve as a new tool for  Congress, Federal Agencies, and in the courts to advance equality in  the fields of workforce and pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual  harassment and violence, reproductive autonomy, and protection of the  LGBTQ+ individuals. It is also a signal to the courts that they should  apply a more rigorous level of review to laws and government policies  that discriminate on the basis of sex.   That is what the ERA is all about: equality, the most fundamental of  American values. I am disappointed by the outcome of the vote this May,  but this is not the end. Just before the Senate vote on the measure, I  led my colleagues in a vigorous floor debate in support of the ERA and  our resolution to affirm the ratification.   Not one opponent showed up to debate the merits of the resolution or  equal rights. No one. It tells me that we are on the right side of  history, and they know it.   So make no mistake about it, this march towards equality on account  of sex continues. We will not rest until the ERA is in the Constitution  of the United States. The States have done their job. We will get the  necessary votes to make that a reality.   My life of public service was inspired by my faith but also by the  civil rights movement and elected leaders of the 1960s. I was first  elected to Congress in 1986 and sworn into office in 1987, along with  Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, who would become a lifelong friend  and mentor.   Years earlier, John was one of the original Freedom Riders and served  as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was  one of the major organizers of the 1963 March on Washington.   For John, the movement for freedom, justice and equality-- economically, socially, and all aspects of life--was not merely a  movement; it was his life's work.   As times changed and as the struggle for equality took on new forms,  his commitment never faltered. He marched on Washington through Selma  and in the Halls of the U.S. Capitol with the same faith, courage, and  conviction.   This past weekend, tens of thousands gathered on the National Mall to  continue to march for freedom and justice, hearkening back to those who  stood on the same ground six decades earlier. Dr. King's daughter-in- law, Arndrea Waters King, described to the crowd:         We are here to liberate the souls of the Nation, the soul       of democracy from the forces who would have us all go       backwards and perish rather than go forward as sisters and       brothers.    As President Joe Biden said recently, recalling Dr. King's reference  to a ``promissory note'' to every American, it is ``a promise derived  from the very idea of America, that we are all created equal and  deserve to be treated equally throughout our entire lives. While we've  never fully lived up to that promise, we've never--thank God--fully  walked away from it . . . for our administration and with your help, it  means pushing back against voter suppression, election subversion, and  hate-fueled violence.''   So, Mr. President, my message to our colleagues is let us work  together to do the work necessary to make sure that the moral arc of  the universe moves toward justice. We must carry out that mission.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of S. 294, and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2747, introduced by  Senators Klobuchar and Fischer.    Mr. President, I ask that the bill be considered read  three times.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I further ask that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
