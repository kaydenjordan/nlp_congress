 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, and congratulate  him for the chairmanship of the Western Caucus, and I appreciate being  included in this discussion this evening.   Madam Speaker, on the way over here, here is a bit of breaking news:  POLITICO, in their online newsletter, 6:30 tonight, the headline:  ``Biden's plans for recovery imperiled by swelling ranks of long-term  jobless.''   First sentence reads:         Millions of Americans are staring at the reality of long-      term unemployment, a precarious and worsening situation that       threatens to drag on the economic recovery after the pandemic       ends.    You know what, I remember when Democrats used to be the champion of  the working class, the champion of the working man and woman.   Long-term unemployment is so damaging to people's families and  people's lives. Suspending the production on Federal lands--granted  Texas doesn't have the amount of Federal lands that some of the other  Western States do, but still, it affects us.   And Todd Staples, our former agriculture commissioner in the State of  Texas--now the head of the Texas Oil and Gas Association--writes in  January: ``Banning energy development on Federal lands and in offshore  waters not only threatens thousands of the best-paying jobs, but  needlessly erases much-needed revenue that helps pay for schools and  other essential services,'' so said Todd Staples, the president of  Texas Oil and Gas Association.   Going on: ``American oil and natural gas is safe, clean and abundant,  and misguided policies will only stifle our Nation's energy and  environmental progress.'' A million jobs across the country--120,000 of  those in the State of Texas alone.   And as we heard from our colleague, Ms. Herrell, it does affect tax  revenues for local activities in our schools, building our highways.   Todd Staples went on to say:         The oil and natural gas industry is producing energy in       cleaner and more efficient ways than 10 to 15 years ago, all       while producing more affordable and reliable energy to power       our daily lives. Increased use of natural gas is the number       one reason the United States power sector cut carbon dioxide       emissions 33 percent.    Now, look, everybody talks about going to electric cars. Where is the  electricity going to come from? Well, some of it is going to come from  natural gas, natural gas-fired power plants.   But, again, I do remember when the Democratic party used to be the  party of the working man and woman. I question why President Biden has  strayed so far from that. A little over 2 weeks ago, he said, on the  western steps of this Capitol building, that his number  [[Page H368]]  one priority was going to be American jobs. And then he immediately  causes immeasurable harm to millions of Americans.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for leading this hour and for  letting me participate.
