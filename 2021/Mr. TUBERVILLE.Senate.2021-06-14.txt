 Madam President, Ronald Reagan said:         We maintain peace through our strength; weakness only       invites aggression.   [[Page S4510]]     The United States of America remains a beacon of strength and  freedom. Generations of Americans purchased this strength through  blood, treasure, and self-sacrifice. We do not want to be the first  generation of Americans to abandon that tradition, but we will unless  we give our men and women in uniform the tools they need to do the job.   The President's proposed budget does not deliver for our military. In  fact, it tells our military to do less every day than what they have in  the past. President Biden's budget proposal cuts money from the  Department of Defense when accounting for inflation. I have said before  that this budget is disappointing, dangerous, and a disservice to our  men and women in uniform   The President's advisers surely know the threat our country faces.  Here is what the Office of National Intelligence said in its annual  threat assessment: The Chinese Communist Party will continue to  undercut the United States, drive wedges between Washington and its  allies and partners, and foster international norms that favor the  authoritarian Chinese system.   That is from the President's own Director of Intelligence. But talk  is cheap, and cheap talk is what we are getting because this budget  does not rise to meet that threat.   Question: Does the President not believe the dire warnings of his own  advisers?   At the same time, President Biden and congressional Democrats'  policies are giving us a weak economy when it should be roaring. The  last two job reports fell way short of expectations. In April,  economists expected 1 million jobs, but we only got one-fourth of  that--25 percent.   Democrats' out-of-control spending is driving inflation to levels we  haven't seen in over a decade. President Biden's own budget assumes  policies will only lead to a weak 2-percent GDP growth--2 percent--when  it should be double that amount.   Democrats aren't stopping at a weak military and a weak economy. They  have put forth thinly veiled attempts to strip our country of what  makes it so great. They want to undo our very system of federalism and  local control by eliminating States' right-to-work laws through the PRO  Act. They want a Washington takeover of every State's election laws  through S. 1 or, as I like to call it, the corrupt politicians act. But  worst of all, it is teaching our kids to hate our country. The Biden  administration has embraced the divisive curriculum of critical race  theory to rewrite history and paint the United States as a villain.   Question: How can we expect the Biden administration to defend  America's ideals abroad if the President won't even defend them at  home? This isn't Building Back Better.   Teddy Roosevelt, another successful Republican President, always  said: ``Speak softly and carry a big stick.'' President Biden is  certainly speaking softly all right, but he is whittling away our big  stick down to a twig.   We are already seeing the results. Weakness invites aggression.  President Biden and his aides seem to believe that a return to the  appeasement policies of the Obama administration and a rejection of  President Trump's policy of strength are the best way to ensure peace.  That is going to be tough for them and for the American people. We are  already seeing how these policies do not work.   Take Palestine, for example. Just 2 months ago, the President decided  to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians. And  I ask, For what reason? Why are we sending millions of dollars to  Palestine at this time when we are having a tough point in our country  with this pandemic?   They just took American dollars and turned around and rained terror  on our No. 1 ally in the Middle East, with thousands of rockets aimed  at Israeli civilians. It triggered the worst fighting between Israel  and Hamas since 2014. The President's policy and millions of taxpayer  dollars were wasted. They did nothing but arm Hamas. The President's  policy did not work.   President Biden made no secret that he wanted to bring back the  failed Iran nuclear deal that was the pride of President Obama's second  term. Well, Iran responded by supplying Hamas with those rockets to  kill Israeli civilians. Iran is also sending warships to help their  socialist ally, Venezuela. Again, the President's policies did not  work.   One of President Biden's first acts in office was to cancel the  Keystone Pipeline with our northern border neighbor in Canada. Yet the  President is allowing Russia to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to  Germany, further isolating Ukraine from its Western friends. Russia has  responded by amassing troops along the Ukraine border. Once again, the  President's policies did not work.   The week after President Biden announced his skinny budget proposal  with no increase to the Department of Defense, China sent a record  number of fighter jets into the Taiwanese airspace. That is a clear  pattern that the President's policies aren't working, and they are  emboldening our enemies.   The fallout from the Biden administration's weaknesses isn't just  limited to far-off countries across the sea, we are seeing the very  real cost at our southern border. The Biden administration refuses to  take this crisis seriously. The number of illegal immigrants crossing  the border this fiscal year is already the most since 2006, and there  are 4 months left to go.   In May of this year alone, Customs and Border Protection apprehended  more than 180,000 illegal immigrants along the southern border. And it  is not just folks coming from Central America. According to the CBP,  there have been at least 59,000 illegal immigrants apprehended who were  not from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, or Honduras.   They are from as many as 90-plus countries, as far away as  Bangladesh, Ghana, and Nepal.   And the problem is that it is not just people seeking a better life.  Customs and Border Protection reports that they have arrested 95  convicted sex offenders attempting to enter the United States since the  beginning of the fiscal year, and those are just the ones that are  being caught.   Biden, 2 months ago, said: ``What's wrong with 2 million illegal  immigrants?''   So what the Biden administration is doing is they are not stemming  the tide. President Biden threw his hands up and put Vice President  Harris in charge.   Has she visited the border since she has been put in charge? No.   She thinks her words, ``Don't come,'' are enough to stop the flood of  illegal immigrants. Well, they are not. Her words are too late and too  little.   I remember how then-Candidates Biden and Harris pushed back against  President Trump for wanting to secure the border, for wanting to  enforce our immigration laws as written, and folks across the globe  were listening. They heard the rhetoric. They packed their bags, and  they made the dangerous journey.   They took then-Candidates Biden and Harris at their word. It is why  so many illegal immigrants wear T-shirts saying: ``Biden, let us in.''   Why would they listen to her saying ``Don't come'' now?   But here is what really got me. When asked why she hasn't gone to the  border to see the crisis for herself, Vice President Harris laughed and  said: ``I haven't been to Europe'' either. I couldn't believe what I  was hearing. We need leadership, not a tourist.   Well, Madam Vice President, I have been to the border, and I have  seen how dangerous it is for these people coming here. I have actually  listened to our Border Patrol agents, who talk about how the cartels  really run things and how they have total control of the U.S. southern  border. I have seen how many drugs are pouring across the border  because our law enforcement is too busy processing illegal immigrants  instead of catching the bad guys.   But I sat beside a teenager leaving McAllen, TX, on the flight to  Houston. She had her new 3- or 4-month-old baby. She was being sent on  a plane by the Biden administration to Houston and then on the way to  Denver, not knowing what she was to expect when she got there.   It is not easy to see. It certainly wasn't for me. But that is the  price of being in a position of power, to be able to do something about  the problems facing the people and our country. The Vice President  needs to see the human cost of the policies she and the President are  supporting.  [[Page S4511]]    Ladies and gentlemen, peace is only possible when the United States  is strong. That means a strong military, a strong economy, a strong  educational system, and a strong border.   Unless we reverse our course soon, it will be too late to stop the  violence and aggression President Biden's weakness has invited across  the globe and here at home.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
