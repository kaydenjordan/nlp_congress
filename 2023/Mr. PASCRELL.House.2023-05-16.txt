 Mr. Speaker, as the longtime co-chair of the Law  Enforcement Caucus, I am a staunch advocate for our law enforcement  community.   How the House is recognizing this Police Week is a disappointment.  Before us are partisan messaging bills instead of measures that support  our men and women in blue.   This rule makes in order a pathetic resolution that ignores the  service of federal law enforcement officers, including our Capitol  Police.   These brave men and women protected us when Donald Trump incited a  mob of armed insurrectionists to attack our Capitol.   The attack resulted in the death of five Capitol Police and MPD  officers, and the injury of 150 officers.   The resolution ignores the Republicans currently seeking to defund  federal law enforcement agencies, like the FBI, ATF, and Homeland  Security.   And the resolution is silent on increasing funding for the Byrne JAG  and the COPS Hiring programs.   I offered 5 specific amendments to add these crucial elements to this  resolution. But the Republicans did not make them in order. What are  they afraid of?   Armed officers can enhance public safety. But an officer in good  standing is not defined in the Law Enforcement Officer Service Weapon  Purchase Act.   We know an officer could be in good standing with their department  but ineligible to carry a handgun.   I offered two amendments to align this bill with New Jersey's  interpretation of current law. Again, neither were made in order.   Next Police Week let us take up actually make a difference for  officers and their families. Not this partisan approach.   God bless our police and God bless America.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 398 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 5. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.
