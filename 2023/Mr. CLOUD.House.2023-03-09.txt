 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his  efforts to always pull the curtain back on the games and gimmicks that  Washington plays sometimes and to bring creative ideas to the table on  how to fix things. I appreciate it, and I thank him for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Goliad County Sheriff  Deputy and Operation Lone Star Task Force Commander John Davis, who  passed away this Monday.   A man of faith, integrity, and relentless dedication, John served the  great State of Texas for 40 years during his law enforcement career.  His career stretched over a variety of roles in local, State, and  Federal agencies, and because of this, John became known as one of  Texas' most distinguished law enforcement officers.    Commander Davis helped lead the effort to locate and arrest the Texas  Seven escapees back in 2000. In 2022, due to his long track record of  success, John was selected to command the newly formed Operation Lone  Star Task Force. Most recently, Commander Davis oversaw a successful  multiagency operation in Wharton and Jackson counties to combat human  and drug trafficking cartels and their criminal invasion into Texas.   Throughout his life, Commander Davis gave his all and gave all he had  to protect our families and our communities and to make our State a  safer place to live.   While we mourn his passing, we know that he lived a life well lived  and that he has gone on to his reward. May his service be an example  for all of us in years to come and may God bless and his peace be with  his family.                           Remembering Claud Jacobs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a true hero  of the Crossroads, Mr. Claud Jacobs.   A native of Yoakum and Victoria, Texas, Claud lived a life of  extraordinary service to his community. His life's motto, ``You always  get back more than you give'' guided him through public service in the  Governor's office and in starting multiple businesses that helped his  neighbors.   Claud's faith in our savior Jesus Christ led him to be a friend to  all,  [[Page H1246]]  dedicating his time to training young people in his community.   In 1968, his passion for at-risk youth led him to help found the  Bluebonnet Youth Ranch and raise millions of dollars through charity  events.   For his extraordinary work, in 1986 Claud Jacobs was knighted as a  Knight of Saint Gregory by Pope John Paul II.   Claud was a friend to everyone in our community, it seems, and I know  he was a friend of mine. We will miss his optimism, his warmth, and his  can-do spirit.   May God bless his family as we remember him and his legacy.
