 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Congressman John Lewis.   Our Nation mourns his loss. An icon of the civil rights movement,  John Lewis dedicated his life to fighting for equality. He was an  American hero who never wavered in his pursuit to make our country a  more fair and just place.   During my first term in Congress, I met John Lewis when we sat near  each other at the President's State of the Union Address my first time.  We became friends after that and often spoke on the House floor and in  his office. While we served on different sides of the aisle, he was  always willing to hear and consider the perspectives of others.   It was an absolute honor to serve alongside him in Congress. John  will forever be remembered for his strong leadership, his commitment to  peaceful action, and the tremendous sacrifices he made to enact change.   I wish the family, loved ones, and all who knew and admired him peace  during this difficult time.                            ____________________
