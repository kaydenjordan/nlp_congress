 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for recognizing me  tonight. I appreciate it.   Recognizing that the time is drawing short, and we have lots of other  people who want to speak on this issue, I will attempt to keep myself  in check on the time.   Mr. Speaker, everybody knows we have to secure our border. When we  talk about building the wall, we are not talking just about bricks and  mortar. We are talking about securing our borders with all devices  available to us, whether that be drones or smart fences like they have  in Israel where they protect 17 miles of border with a fence that, if  something hits it, they send people out to see what is going on.   We have to use all the tools in the toolbox. And the $5 billion is  just the start on what we need to do to protect all of our borders, but  it is an important start.   We have heard about the drug crisis, and all of our districts are  affected by it. A lot of times, people say in the mountains of  southwest Virginia: Morgan, why are you so concerned about this illegal  immigration?   Let me tell you why. The Mexican drug cartels are bringing  methamphetamine into my district. They use it as a distribution area.  They are the main supplier of that drug. Now that we have gotten  opioids a little bit under control, and we are starting to get that  where it should be, the Mexican cartels are our biggest problem in the  mountains of southwest Virginia.  [[Page H10329]]    It is important that we secure our borders, build the wall, protect  the American people, protect our borders, and protect our laws.
