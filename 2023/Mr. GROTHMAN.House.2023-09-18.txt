 Mr. Speaker, I call attention one more time to the  Members of this body about the lack of respect for the Second Amendment  that took place in the State of New Mexico recently.   We all know where the increase in crime rate came from; probably  three things: first of all, the breakdown of the family, which was  encouraged by Lyndon Johnson's war on the family; secondly, liberal  judges, who are not predisposed to put criminals in jail; and finally,  liberal district attorneys who do not want to put members of the  criminal class in jail.   As a result, we wind up with an increase in murders and an increase  in crimes committed with guns. We have to rally and make it impossible,  politically impossible, for anybody else to do what the New Mexico  Governor did a few weeks ago.   The Second Amendment is designed to keep the power in this country  with the people. Just because we have a family breakdown, together with  ultra leftwing judges and district attorneys, is no reason to give up  on our Second Amendment.   Rally, America. Rally around that Second Amendment.                            ____________________
