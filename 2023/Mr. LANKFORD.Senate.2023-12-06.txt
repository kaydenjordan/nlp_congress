 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 12,080, it is not just a random  number; it is the highest number of crossings ever in a single day  across our southwest border. That is the record, 12,080. We have never  had a day more than 12,080 crossing our southwest border.   You might ask: What day did we set the record for the most number of  crossings across our southern border? And my answer would be yesterday.  Yesterday was the highest number of illegal crossings in the history of  the country. September was the highest September ever in the history of  the country for illegal crossings.   October was the highest October ever in the United States in the  history of illegal crossings. November was the highest November ever in  the country in the history of our Nation for illegal crossings. And  there is the highest number ever in the history of the country-- yesterday.   What is really happening? The numbers continue to be able to  skyrocket. If we look at what is actually occurring with the number of  illegal crossings, they continue to accelerate day after day, month  after month, unchecked.   We face very real threats in our Nation, and it is not just me saying  that. People may recognize the FBI Director, Christopher Wray, who just  this week in a hearing was asked about the threats that we are facing  in the United States after October 7. He was asking what he saw with  that, and his answer was, ``I see blinking red lights everywhere.''   ``The threat level has gone to a whole other level since October 7,''  in the United States.   Yesterday, of those 12,080 people who illegally crossed the border,  the vast majority of them were released into the country today. They  had no criminal background check. They didn't have to prove their ID of  what country they were from because right now the soft-sided facilities  that are housing migrants all along our southern border are currently  running at 400 percent occupancy.   So the goal is, get them through and into the country, hand them a  piece of paper, and--literally--ask them to promise to turn themselves  in, in the future at some point, just go because we need your space  because there are more people coming.   At the same time the FBI Director is saying, ``I see blinking red  lights everywhere,'' we are literally releasing thousands of people,  day after day, no criminal background check, no evaluation of their  history--many of them we don't even know what country they are from-- and releasing them into the country.   In the last 2 years, this White House has designated on our southwest  border  [[Page S5786]]  70,000 people they designated as what they call ``special interest  aliens.'' These are individuals who are coming from areas known for  terrorism, but we had no background information on these individuals.   What happened to those 70,000 individuals? They were released into  our country with a piece of paper saying: Please turn yourself in, in  the days ahead, because we have no room to be able to house you here.  That is what is happening.   Am I the only one who noticed this? Well, let's see, the mayor of El  Paso has said that ``the city of El Paso only has so many resources and  we have come to . . . a breaking point right now.''   The mayor of New York City is talking about this, and he said that  ``this issue will destroy New York City,'' as they are over capacity in  every spot that they have got.   The mayor of Chicago has called this an ``international crisis'' that  he is actually experiencing in Chicago to try to be able to manage  this.   As the stories come out on this over and over again, this is a New  York Times story that came out:         Migrant-smuggling is now a $13 billion business. Mangled       limbs. Raped women. Congressional inaction is a boon to bad       actors.    From the New York Times.   So my question is, What are we going to do about this? Currently, it  has been nothing.   So what are we going to do about this? About 6 weeks ago, the White  House sent over a request for supplemental funding. They labeled it a  national security supplemental. They asked for funding for Israel, for  Ukraine, for the Indo-Pacific, and for border security. In fact, what  is interesting is the second highest request they put in the entire  piece was actually for border security. And then literally within days,  the administration put out an op-ed that said the funding request for  border security is a tourniquet. What we really need is a change in  policy.   That same day, Ali Mayorkas from Homeland Security, President Biden's  Homeland Security Director, was in front of a hearing that I was in. I  asked him some very specific questions during that:         What are the things that need to be able to change [in our       system]?    He said:         Senator, we need . . . the ability to remove individuals       who do not qualify [for asylum] with efficiency and [with]       speed.    Secretary Mayorkas went on to say:         The asylum system needs to be reformed from top to bottom.    I asked him again:   [Are] policy changes needed?   Secretary Mayorkas said:         Yes, policy changes are needed.    The issue is not is the need there. The issue is not is there a  problem in our immigration system. The issue is not is this a crisis at  our border. Everyone knows that it is a crisis that literally the  people working on our border have no tools in their hands to be able to  stop this issue.   This needs a solution from Congress, and it requires all of us having  the determination to say: 12,080 people that crossed our border  yesterday is not sustainable.   So what is the request? It is pretty straightforward. It is what  anyone would look at and, quite frankly, what DHS has talked about for  years--not just this DHS; the Trump DHS, the Obama DHS have all asked  for these issues.   They are looking for some very basic things. They want to know how to  be able to manage the asylum requests. That accelerated and took off  during the late half of the Obama administration.   If I can take us back in history to ancient history, in 2010, there  were 21,000 people who asked for asylum a year on our southern border-- 21,000 people a year in 2010. That is now every 2 days of what we are  facing now.   What the request was, at the end of the second term of the Obama  administration, was that we have got to reform our asylum system. We  have got to be able to process people at the border. We have got to be  able to not change the rules of what asylum means but change when we  actually do the screening--do it right there, to be able to manage  those issues, so that people who qualify for asylum under our law are  able to come into our country lawfully and people who do not qualify  for asylum cannot come into our country unlawfully.   We all know it is happening. Every administration has identified it.  So far, this body has been unwilling to be able to act on it.   We also know that, every day, the cartels actually run our southern  border. They are a ruthless criminal organization that we have  experienced firsthand in my State. There is drug smuggling. There is  human trafficking and what they have done to literally millions of  people whom they have trafficked from around the world. We need to take  control of our border, not give control to the cartels.   I would challenge anyone in this body to be able to go to our  southwest border and ask any Border Patrol agent: Do we have control of  our border?   Most every one of them will respond the same way, because I have  heard it over and over. There is situational control of our border. It  is just on the south side, not on the north side, because the cartels  are managing who is actually coming in, in what order, and how it is  actually done. And they are paid, as the New York Times article  detailed, billions of dollars to be able to traffic people into our  country. They are the ones who are managing it.   So the simple, straightforward issue is, As the United States of  America, are we going to manage our border or are the cartels going to  manage our border? Are we going to be able to have a system where we  allow people who qualify for asylum to actually get a hearing on a  timely basis or are we going to take people and push them into the  country? And then real, legitimate asylum seekers don't get a hearing  for years, and people who don't qualify for asylum--and we all know  it--disappear into the country and live underground.   This is the decision that we have got to come to. President Biden  asked for a national security supplemental and included into that  border funding and then a request for policy changes. It is time to be  able to address this issue.   And I will tell you what I will vote later on today. Republicans are  going to speak clearly to say: We will not move to a national security  bill that does security for other nations and ignores our own. We will  not do it.   And we believe the American people, regardless of party--I don't find  many people who want chaos on our southern border. They want an orderly  process. I also don't find people who are opposed to immigration. They  are just opposed to illegal activity on our border, unchecked activity  on our border.   So let's get back to an orderly process. Let's have a system that  actually works for everybody in the process, and let's not put the  national security for other nations ahead of the national security of  Americans. Let's do it together.   With that, I yield the floor.
