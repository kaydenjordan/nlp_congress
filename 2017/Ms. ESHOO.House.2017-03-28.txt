 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Colorado  for his leadership and for yielding time to me.   First of all, I would like to respond to the gentleman's presentation  about the underlying bill.   Make no mistake about it, what the underlying bill does today is it  wipes out--it totally wipes out--privacy protections for consumers on  the internet. That is what it does. There are not duplicative  regulations. I know that it was stated on the floor that there are  duplicative regulations.   There are two agencies--the Federal Communications Commission and the  Federal Trade Commission--however, it is only the FCC, the Federal  Communications Commission, that can actually protect consumers by  enforcing the protections. The FTC does not have that authority.   What happens today if these privacy protections are ripped away from  the American people? Well, all the information that you give to your  internet service provider, whether it is Comcast, whether it is cable  providers, Charter, AT&T, the one that you pay a pretty big bill to,  they can take all of the information that they have--my account, your  account, your account, your account--and use that information to sell  it to the highest bidder to make money off of it.   Now, there is an additional charge in this thing, alleged charge, and  that is,  [[Page H2480]]  well, what about Google and Netflix and Facebook? What about them? Why  aren't they subject to what the FCC did? Well, they are edge providers.  They are edge providers.   You don't have to go to Google. You don't have to go to Facebook. You  don't have to go to Netflix in order to get your internet service. That  is why the FCC did not apply these rules to them. Maybe there should be  a debate about them. But to equalize and say that Google and Facebook  are equal to your internet service provider suggests to me that some  people just don't know what they are talking about.   This is a subject that the American people feel very, very deeply  about. In fact, I think it is in the DNA of every American: ``I want my  privacy, and it should be protected.'' We all feel that way.   What is being done today is a ripping away. It is like taking a  bandage, just stripping it away. Who do you go to? Who do you go to  complain to? No one. No one. Because there isn't anything left to  enforce.   I think it is a sad day if the underlying bill passes. I think it is  shocking that my Republican colleagues, either out of a lack of  understanding of how the internet works, how their constituents--all of  our constituents benefit from these protections of our privacy, and our  information is private. I don't want anyone to take my information and  sell it to someone and make a ton of money off of it just because they  can get their mitts on it. That is why the privacy protections were  adopted.   May I ask how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will close that one off and go to the other  reason that I am on the floor today. I thank the gentleman again for  yielding me the time.   I rise in opposition to the rule and, obviously, the underlying  resolution; and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  that my bipartisan bill, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be  made in order for immediate floor debate and a vote.   Mr. Speaker, my legislation would require the President and all  future Presidents and Presidential nominees to publicly disclose their  tax returns. It is a very simple bill.   This is the third time this year that I have offered this bill as the  previous question motion, and for the last several weeks, Members-- including Mr. Polis, Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Crowley, Ms. Lofgren, and  myself--have offered privileged resolutions directing the House to  request the President's tax returns. Nearly every day we give the  majority the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on this issue, and  nearly every day they continue to help the President hide his tax  returns from the public.   Now, every President of both parties, since Gerald Ford, has  voluntarily made their tax returns public. The President has 564  financial positions in companies located in the United States and  around the world, according to the Federal Election Commission, making  him more susceptible to conflicts of interest than any President in our  history. Without disclosure of his tax returns, the American people are  prevented from knowing where his income comes from, whether he is  dealing with foreign powers, what he owes and to whom, and how he may  directly benefit from the policies he proposes.   There are daily revelations about previously undisclosed meetings  between the President's staff and Russian officials, as well as a  steady flow of troubling information about The Trump Organization's  ties to state-connected businesses and individuals in Turkey,  Azerbaijan, China, and other countries. Last week, The New York Times  reported that The Trump Organization is finalizing an agreement to  build a hotel in partnership with a firm that has ``deep Turkish  roots'' and business ties in Russia, Kazakhstan, and two dozen other  countries.   Without the disclosure of the President's tax returns, there is no  way for the American people to know the full extent of his foreign  entanglements and possible conflicts of interest on this or other deals  that his family business is engaged in.                                time  1330    I think the House is failing, Mr. Speaker, to exercise our  constitutional obligation to conduct effective oversight and operate as  a check on the executive branch. We can change that today by taking up  and passing this bipartisan bill, which will ensure that the President,  and all future Presidents, will be held to a baseline level of  disclosure. That is why I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous  question, so we can hold an immediate vote on the Presidential Tax  Transparency Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Doyle, for both his  leadership and for yielding time to me.   America, listen up today. There may not be that many people on the  floor of the House, but this is a big one. This is really a big one.  Congress is poised today to betray the American people on one of the  issues they care the most about: their privacy--their privacy. Every  single one of us cares about it, and so do the American people. I often  say that every American has it in their DNA: Keep your mitts off my  privacy, what I consider to be private.   Now, the consequences of passing this resolution are clear. Broadband  providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your  personal information to the highest bidder without your permission, and  no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade  Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking  about. It is like open the door and there is no one there. That is what  this thing creates.   The Republicans are blowing a gaping hole in Federal privacy  protections by barring the FCC from ever adopting similar protections  in the future. So, if it is gone today, it is gone, period.   The FCC rules are simple. They require broadband providers to get the  permission of their customers--including all of us--before they can  sell their web browsing history, their location information, and other  sensitive data to third parties.   The majority claims that we need to repeal these protections because  they treat broadband providers differently than other online service  providers, edge providers. Broadband providers are in the unique  position of seeing everything we do on the internet. This is the  reason, and it is reason enough, to put privacy protections in place;  but it is also important to keep in mind that consumers, all of us, pay  a high monthly fee to broadband providers, and they face serious  barriers if they want to switch. If I want to switch, if you want to  switch, you have to, many times, pay early termination fees.    This is completely different from other online services that collect  consumer data. Consumers don't pay to use search engines or social  media applications like Google and Facebook. If they don't like  Google's privacy policy, they can switch over to Bing without paying  any fees. But consumers can't do this with broadband providers, and  therein lies the difference.   Last week, we heard the Republicans bemoan the lack of choice in the  healthcare market. They should take a closer look at the state of the  broadband market, particularly in rural America, where only 13 percent  of consumers have access to more than one high-speed broadband  provider.   So the majority is telling Americans today, particularly those in  rural areas, that they need to choose between their privacy and their  access to the internet. If this resolution passes, people across the  country will certainly not have both.   This resolution is--excuse the phrase--repeal without replace. The  Republicans have not put forward any privacy proposal at all to replace  the FCC's rules, despite knowing that repealing these rules will leave  a gap in the Federal protections.   So the message to the American people is clear: Your privacy doesn't  matter, and your web browsing history should be available to anyone who  will pay the highest price for it.   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to stand up for privacy  rights and oppose this joint resolution.
