 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, we had an  important victory for democracy. A Federal judge in New York ordered  the Trump administration to remove a planned citizenship question from  the 2020 Census in response to a lawsuit filed by the State of New  York, which was joined by 17 other States in support. I am proud to  have led an amicus brief of 126 Members of Congress, also in support of  this lawsuit.   The court affirmed what we already knew: adding a citizenship  question was driven by partisan politics, in violation of the law. The  Constitution requires that the Census count every person living in our  country, and the administration's attempt to add a citizenship question  was a deliberate effort to scare away noncitizens and their families in  order to undercount this community.   Fortunately, the court agreed, but there will likely be an appeal.  That is why I will be introducing legislation to remove the citizenship  question. We must act quickly.   Our democracy depends on a full and accurate count of our Nation, and  we cannot allow the Trump administration to compromise that                            ____________________
