 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past few days and weeks,  reports about the democratic protests in Hong Kong have grown more and  more troubling. The authorities in Hong Kong have cracked down  violently on some of the protesters, firing hundreds of rounds of tear  gas at a local university and even using lethal force in a few tragic  situations. As many have observed, some of the pictures coming out of  Hong Kong are reminiscent of a war zone.   Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party dealt another blow to Hong  Kong's special status, criticizing the ruling by the territory's High  Court that reversed the Hong Kong Government's ban on masks. The  Communist Party declared that only the Chinese legislature has the  right to decide whether Hong Kong's laws are consistent with the Hong  Kong basic law and that no other authority has the right to make these  judgments. That assertion by the Chinese Communist Party is a direct  assault on Hong Kong's judicial independence. Make no mistake about it,  this Communist Party is cruel and relentless in cracking down on any  dissent in every part of China. What they are doing to the Uighurs at  the other end of the Chinese country--far away from Hong Kong--is just  brutal and awful.   We in the United States stand in solidarity with the democratic  protesters, who have every right to assemble and petition their  government for the rights of the citizens of Hong Kong. The  administration and the President himself should voice their support for  the protesters in Hong Kong, which would send an important message to  the Chinese Communist Party not to get involved or in any way escalate  the situation. Secretary Pompeo's call for calm yesterday is weak tea-- not close to enough. Beyond the Presidential statement, there are  actions we can take here in Congress because, frankly, I have been very  disappointed that the President, in this dramatic situation  [[Page S6633]]  with Hong Kong, does not do what Democratic or Republican Presidents  have done in the past in standing up for human rights and democracy. He  has not done that. He doesn't seem to care. As we know, he seems more  eager to please dictators than to please those who are fighting for  democracy.    Congress can act. We have a bipartisan bill in the Senate that has  many cosponsors, including the senior Senators from Florida and New  Jersey and from Maryland as well, that would reaffirm our steadfast  support for Hong Kong's autonomy, democracy, and respect for human  rights. It would amend the Hong Kong Policy Act in order to give us the  tools to safeguard and protect Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy and  hold accountable those responsible for the abuse of the human rights of  the people of Hong Kong.   There is no objection to this bill on the Democratic side of the  aisle. We believe the Senate should pass it. If there are objections on  the Republicans' side, let's take a few days and work through the bill  on the floor. We haven't done much legislation. Here is a place at  which we can come together in a bipartisan way. So, if there are no  objections, great. Let's pass it this afternoon. I believe the Senator  from Florida will make a unanimous consent request in that regard. If  there are objections, I urge the Republican leader, who has spoken out  and defended the protests, to take a few days. Let someone try to  invoke cloture--it will fail miserably--and let's vote on this. Then,  maybe, the House will pass it. That would be something, I think, that  would happen and with the President as well.   In addition, the Senator from Oregon, along with some others, has a  bill that U.S. companies shouldn't sell lethal types of equipment to  the Hong Kong police that have been used on the protesters. I would  hope we could find a way to work that proposal into this bill or,  maybe, we could make a unanimous consent request alongside it.   Nonetheless, we should pass the bipartisan bill in the Senate,  reconcile it with similar legislation in the House, and quickly send it  to the President's desk. It would be the strongest action Congress  could take immediately to demonstrate Americans' support for the  protests in Hong Kong. It would send a strong and clear message to the  ruling party in Beijing. It would make a real difference.   The words on the floor the Republican leader mentioned yesterday were  good but were not sufficient. Again, I urge him to move on this  legislation, if we can, by unanimous consent. If not, let's have a  debate on the floor so the handful of Senators who might try to block  it are thwarted, and the bill will move forward.                            ____________________     Madam President, this morning, during the House's  impeachment inquiry, the American people will hear more important  testimony from LTC Alexander Vindman, of the National Security Council,  and from Jennifer Williams, an adviser to the Vice President.   Regrettably, some Republicans, including one in this Chamber, have  tried, without evidence or substantiation, to undermine, to call into  question, and to smear the credibility of the witnesses, including of  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman--a Purple Heart recipient who has spent his  life in service to our country. The attacks on the witnesses are  painful and wrong. They are reminiscent of the actions of a brutal  country, not of the democratic Republic that we are.   I hope everyone will treat these witnesses with respect and listen to  their testimony with an open mind. Whether they agree or disagree with  their testimony, it is unbecoming of any Senator to smear these  patriots. The House has a responsibility to seek the truth and uncover  all of the facts, and if it comes to it, the Senate has a  responsibility to examine the evidence and render impartial judgment.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on infrastructure, as the  impeachment inquiry continues, the Democrats in both Chambers continue  to do the work of the American people. Just last week, my colleagues in  the House discussed a proposal for a very significant investment in  infrastructure. At the very beginning of the Trump administration, the  Senate Democrats proposed a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that  would create 15 million jobs.   At our meeting at the White House, I mentioned this to President  Trump and asked him to join us in either supporting our bill or in  working to modify it in a way that he might be able to support it. At  the time, after promising over and over again in his campaign that he  would pursue a major overhaul of our Nation's infrastructure, we had  hoped President Trump would have worked with us on specific  legislation. Unfortunately and typically, after 3 years into the Trump  administration, instead of working with the Democrats, President Trump  has done next to nothing. Earlier this year, the President walked out  of a meeting on infrastructure that was held between him, Speaker  Pelosi, me, and some other Congressmen and Senators. We haven't heard  from him on the issue since.   Meanwhile, Leader McConnell has turned the Senate into a legislative  graveyard and seems uninterested in any bipartisan, bicameral  legislation. It is so typical of this administration--of President  Trump. He campaigns on infrastructure and has commercials running right  now that say the Democrats are not doing anything on infrastructure  when he is the one who is doing nothing. He has an amazing penchant for  looking at his own faults and then of pointing the finger at others and  saying those faults are theirs. It is glaring on infrastructure.   The idea that the House impeachment inquiry is some sort of  distraction from other issues is plain wrong.   President Trump, we are doing nothing here in the Senate. Come talk  to us about infrastructure, and we can get something done.   The Democrats in the House and the Democrats in the Senate are  willing to work with our Republican colleagues right now. We have over  200 House-passed bills we could consider here on the floor and have  plenty of bipartisan Senate bills besides--from bills to lower the cost  of prescription drugs to election security, to the Violence Against  Women Act. We would like to work on a large infrastructure bill as  well. It is entirely up to President Trump and Leader McConnell to  decide if we are going to make progress on a topic like infrastructure  or if the Senate, under McConnell's leadership, will continue to be a  graveyard for commonsense ideas to help so many millions of Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I sincerely thank my colleagues. This  has been a great bipartisan moment on the floor of the Senate for a  very important issue.   I particularly thank my colleagues from Florida, Senator Rubio; from  Maryland, Senator Cardin; from New Jersey, Senator Menendez; and from  Idaho, Senator Risch, as well as all the others who had a hand in this  work.   The Senate has just sent a resounding message to the Chinese  Communist Party and President Xi that the United States stands with the  democratic protestors in Hong Kong. The bipartisan legislation, with  the great help of the chair and ranking members of the Foreign  Relations Committee, will safeguard Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy  and hold accountable those responsible for any human rights abuses in  Hong Kong. The bipartisan legislation that will soon be offered by the  Senators from Oregon and Texas will make sure that U.S. companies don't  sell riot equipment to Hong Kong.   We have sent a message to President Xi: Your suppression of freedom,  whether in Hong Kong, in northwest China, or anywhere else, will not  stand. You cannot be a great leader and you cannot be a great country  when you oppose freedom, when you are so brutal to the people of Hong  Kong, young and old, who are protesting, when you are so brutal to the  Uighurs in northwest China, and when China is censored so that Chinese  people can't get the truth. History has shown that that always fails,  President Xi--always fails.   China has taken dramatic steps backward in the curtailment of  freedom.   As my colleagues well know, the protests in Hong Kong have now taken  an ominous turn. The Hong Kong police--no doubt at the behest of the  Communist Party in Beijing--have undertaken an increasingly violent  crackdown on student protesters. As the ruling party in Beijing  continues to flout Hong Kong's judicial independence while perpetrating  a brutal suppression of minority groups from one end of China to the  other, Americans' support for the democratic rights of Hong Kong  citizenry is paramount.   To the people of China: We stand with you in freedom.   To the kids in Hong Kong, the students and the adults: We stand with  you.   To the Uighurs who simply want to practice their religion: We stand  with you.   Freedom will prevail, and the Chinese system will either change or  fail.   I yield the floor.
