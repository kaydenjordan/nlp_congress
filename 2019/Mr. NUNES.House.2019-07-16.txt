 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3494, the Damon Paul  Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for  Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020.   Passing an annual intelligence authorization bill is the most  important tool Congress has to conduct effective oversight of the  intelligence activities of the United States.   Today, Chairman Schiff and I are bringing the tenth consecutive  intelligence authorization bill to the floor. I am pleased that, as in  years past, this bill is a bipartisan product that reflects the  contributions of all the committee's members. It was reported out of  the committee by a unanimous voice vote.   This legislation is the product of bipartisan work by the majority  and the minority and provides the intelligence community the necessary  resources and authorities to ensure the IC remains capable of  protecting and defending the United States.   The bill folds in many priorities from fiscal year 2018 and 2019,  including the defense of elections from foreign threats, enhanced  injury benefits to CIA employees, and bolsters intelligence oversight  by improving the IC accountability to Congress.   Additionally, the bill protects all CIA covert intelligence officers'  identities, establishes a paid parental leave program for the IC, and  it mandates counterintelligence briefings and notifications to the  intelligence committees by the FBI on a quarterly basis and prompt  notification when an investigation is carried out regarding a  counterintelligence risk related to a Federal election or campaign.   This bill supports critical national security programs, particularly  those focused on countering threats from hard targets, such as China.   Lastly, the bill continues to ensure that the dedicated men and women  of our intelligence community have the funding, authorities, and  support they need to carry out their mission and to keep us safe.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5860]]         Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this year's IA is named after Damon Nelson and Matthew  Pollard, two staffers who passed away unexpectedly last year.   Matt Pollard was a staffer with the Senate Intelligence Committee,  and he is remembered fondly by staff and members who had the pleasure  of working with him.   Damon Nelson was a former Republican staff director on the House  Intelligence Committee and a personal friend. Damon would be happy with  the bill today, and I am happy that this committee was able to produce  a bipartisan product.   In closing, I want to take a moment to thank the men and women who  serve in our intelligence community. I am honored to get to know so  many of them in the course of the committee's oversight work.   I also thank my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee for their  contributions to our oversight over the past year.  [[Page H5861]]    I also thank all of the staff on the committee for their hard work on  the bill and their daily oversight of the intelligence community. In  particular, I thank the professional oversight staff from the minority,  especially Nick Ciarlante, Laura Casulli, Meghan Green, Andrew House,  Lisa Major, Bill Flanigan, Steve Keith, Marissa Skaggs, Betsy Hulme,  Jack Langer, and Allen Souza.   I would also like to take just a moment to thank our fellow from Los  Alamos National Laboratory, Scott Miller. Scott joined the committee in  2016 and, in a few weeks, will be finishing up his midcareer  educational program with the House and will be returning to New Mexico.   Mr. Chairman, I wish Scott all the best as he, his wife, Rebecca, and  daughter, Sarah, return home.   All the staff members spent long hours working on the legislative  text and its classified annex, and the bill is stronger for it.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Schiff and all of his staff for the  bipartisan work product.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of H.R. 3494, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
