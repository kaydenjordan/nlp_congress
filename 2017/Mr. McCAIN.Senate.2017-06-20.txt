 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess, following my and Senator Nelson's remarks, until 5 p.m. for the  all-Senators briefing and that the time count postcloture.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized  to speak on issues not associated with the present subject of debate.    Mr. President, last week, the Senate voted 97 to 2 to  strengthen sanctions against Vladimir Putin's Russia for its attack on  America's 2016 election and its other aggressive and illegal behavior.  I hope the other body will take swift action to send this legislation  to the President's desk.   We need strong Russia sanctions now because it has been 8 months  since the U.S. intelligence community said publicly that the Russian  Government directed this attack on our democracy. Yet, in the last 8  months, the Russian Government has hardly paid any price for its  aggression. Thus, Vladimir Putin has been learning all over again that  aggression pays. He learned that in Georgia in 2008. He learned that in  Ukraine in 2014. He has learned that in Syria since 2015. So Vladimir  Putin remains on the offense. This year, Russia attempted to interfere  in France's election. We have already seen attempts to influence German  public opinion ahead of elections in September. And there is every  expectation that Russia will do the same thing in the Czech Republic,  Italy, and elsewhere in future elections.   But perhaps the most disturbing indication of how far Vladimir Putin  is willing to go to advance his dark and dangerous view of the world is  what happened in October 2016 in the small Balkan country of  Montenegro, when Russian intelligence operatives, in league with Serbia  nationalists and others, attempted to overthrow the democratically  elected Government of Montenegro and murder its Prime Minister on the  country's election day. Why would Vladimir Putin go this far? To answer  this, one must understand why Russia was so interested in the outcome  of Montenegro's election.   Russia opposes the spread of democracy, human rights, and the rule of  law across Europe, which is advanced by the European Union and  protected by the NATO alliance. To Russia's great frustration,  Montenegro's Government had committed the country to a Euro-Atlantic  future and pursued membership in both the EU and NATO.   Indeed, NATO's invitation to Montenegro to join the NATO alliance in  December 2015 was considered particularly insulting and threatening by  Moscow. After all, Montenegro had once been part of Russia's  traditional Slavic ally, Serbia. Montenegro has long been a favorite  destination for Russian tourists. Russian politicians and oligarchs are  reported to own as much as 40 percent of the real estate in that  country. A few years ago, when it feared losing its naval base in Syria  due to the civil war, Russia reportedly sought a naval base in  Montenegro but was rejected. Now, if Montenegro joined NATO, the entire  Adriatic Sea would fall completely within NATO's borders.   Montenegro's accession into NATO would also send a signal that NATO  membership was a real possibility for other nations of the Western  Balkans--Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and, according to  some optimistic voices in the region, perhaps even Serbia.    That is why Montenegro's October 16 election was no ordinary one. In  Russia's eyes, it was a last chance to stop Montenegro from joining  NATO, to thwart Montenegro's pursuit of a Euro-Atlantic future, and to  reassert Russian influence in southeastern Europe. That is why there  was little doubt that Russia would exert heavy pressure on Montenegro  ahead of the election. Russia had already been accused of fomenting  anti-government demonstrations and funding opposition parties. Yet few  would have guessed how far Russia was willing to go. But now we know.   This April, as part of my visit to seven countries in southeastern  Europe to reaffirm America's commitment to the region, I visited  Montenegro and was briefed by Montenegrin officials on  [[Page S3632]]  the status of the investigation into the coup attempt. On April 14,  Montenegro's special prosecutor filed indictments against 2 Russians  and 12 other people for their roles in the coup attempt. This past  weekend, a Montenegrin court accepted the indictments. As a result, the  evidence before the court is now public.   I believe it is critically important that my colleagues and the  American people are aware of the allegations made in these indictments.  Pieced together, they reveal another blatant attack on democracy by the  Russian Government--an attempt to smash a small, brave country that had  the nerve to defy its will. And it is another unmistakable warning that  Vladimir Putin will do whatever it takes to achieve his ambition to  restore the Russian Empire.   According to the indictments, the coup planning got off to a slow  start in March 2016. That was when opposition leaders in Montenegro  allegedly sent an emissary known as Nino to Belgrade to meet with  Slavko Nikic. In the first meeting at Slavko's office, Nino said that  he had been doing business for years in Russia, and he claimed that he  was in contact with powerful men in Russia. He claimed that one of the  men with him was a Russian FSB agent in charge of special tasks. Nino  tried to enlist Slavko and his men to lead a plot to destabilize  Montenegro, and Slavko indicated he was able and willing to  participate. Later, Nino and Slavko met on the Pupin Bridge in  Belgrade, this time with the supposed FSB agent in tow. The Russian  told Slavko it would be good if he traveled to Moscow.   After these encounters in Belgrade, Nino enlisted the help of  Bratislav Dikic, the former chief of Serbia's special police and  someone we will meet later in this story, to use his contacts to check  into Slavko's reliability. He didn't pass the test, and this original  version of the coup plot was abandoned.   It was at this point that the two Russians, Eduard Shishmakov and  Vladimir Popov, stepped in to take control of the plans for  destabilization operations in Montenegro. Both of these men are  believed to be members of the Russian military agency, the GRU.   Shishmakov in particular already had a colorful past. In 2014,  Shishmakov had been serving as deputy military attache in Russia's  Embassy in Warsaw, Poland. After a scandal involving a Russian spy  network within the Polish Government, the Polish Government identified  Shishmakov as a GRU agent, declared him persona non grata, and ejected  him from Poland.   Having taken over the Montenegrin operation, Shishmakov moved quickly  to contact Sasa Sindjelic. The two had first met in Russia back in  2014, when they discussed their opposition to the EU and NATO.  Shishmakov even offered to help support Sindjelic's organization, the  Serbian Wolves, which promotes Pan-Slavism and close relations between  Russians and Serbs and opposes NATO and the Government of Montenegro.   The two met again in Moscow in 2015. This time, Shishmakov had  Sindjelic submitted to a polygraph test that lasted for hours. After  the test went well, he sent Sindjelic home with $5,000 and a promise to  contact him if something urgent came up. That was in the spring of  2016. Shishmakov wrote that Montenegro's Prime Minister, Milo  Djukanovic, and his government must be removed immediately and that the  people of Montenegro must rebel in order for this to happen.   Then in September 2016, Shishmakov told Sindjelic to urgently come to  Moscow. Shishmakov even sent $800 to Sindjelic to buy his ticket. It  was no trouble for Shishmakov to send the money--after all, he sent it  from a Western Union conveniently located on the same street as GRU  headquarters in Moscow. Once in Moscow, Shishmakov and Sindjelic  discussed the planning and operation of the plot to overthrow the  Montenegrin Government, install the opposition in power, and abandon  all plans for Montenegro to enter NATO. Shishmakov said opposition  leaders from Montenegro had already visited Moscow a number of times  and were in agreement with the plan.   In total, Sindjelic received more than $200,000 to support the  operation. He used those funds to pay personnel, acquire police  uniforms and equipment, and purchase weapons, including rifles, gas  masks, bulletproof vests, electrical tranquilizers, and a drone with a  camera. He was also provided encrypted phones to enable secure  communications between the coup plotters and GRU agents.   Sindjelic and Shishmakov stayed in close touch as preparations  continued ahead of the October elections. The plan was this:   On election day, the Montenegrin opposition was planning large  protests in front of the Parliament, expecting to draw nearly 5,000  people. Sindjelic and his coconspirators, including Bratislav Dikic,  the former commander of the Serbian special police, would recruit as  many Serbian nationalists as they could to travel from Serbia to  Montenegro to join the demonstrations. They were hoping 500 would join  the protests and be ready to act when called upon.   As the protests were underway, a group of 50 armed men recruited by  Shishmakov and wearing police uniforms provided by Sindjelic would  ambush and kill the members of Montenegro's Special Anti-Terrorist Unit  to prevent them from interfering with the coup. The armed men, still  wearing their police uniforms, would then proceed to the Parliament  building, where they would begin shooting at members of the police  defending the Parliament building. They hoped to create the impression  that some members of the police were changing sides and joining the  protesters against the government. As the coup plotters saw it, this  was poetic justice--reminiscent of how former Serbian President and  convicted war criminal Slobodan Milosevic had fallen from power.   Led by the coup plotters and the Serbian nationalists, who would wear  blue ribbons to be recognizable to one another, the protesters would  then storm the Parliament building and declare victory for the  opposition. Within 48 hours, the new government would be formed and  arrests would be made across the capital, including Prime Minister  Djukanovic. If the Prime Minister could not be captured, he would be  killed.   The coup plotters obviously wanted to create chaos, and it appears  they may have had someone in mind to blame for the violence. Ahead of  the election, the Montenegrin opposition hired a U.S. company to  provide services, including countersurveillance and planning to extract  personnel from the Montenegrin capital, around the time of the  election. It is still unclear, the precise nature of this outreach to  the U.S. company by the Montenegrin opposition or what services the  company may have ended up providing, if any. Now, this is speculation,  but if I know the Russians, American security personnel--some likely to  have military or intelligence background--on the ground during the coup  in the Montenegrin capital would have made excellent patsies for  stories on Sputnik and Russia Today.   Fortunately--one might even say luckily--the plan never got off the  ground. Four days before election day, one of the coup plotters got  cold feet and informed the Montenegrin authorities. On election day,  Montenegrin police arrested 20 Serbian citizens, including the on-the- ground leader of the nationalist protesters, Bratislav Dikic, the  former commander of the Serbian special police. News of the arrests  sparked fear among others involved in the plot, many of whom retreated  to Serbia.   Furious that the plot had been disrupted, Shishmakov, the Russian GRU  agent, grasped at straws for new ways of bringing down the Montenegrin  Government. He ordered Sindjelic to procure an assassin to kill the  Prime Minister. Sindjelic did not carry out that order and later turned  himself into police, fearing he would be next for assassination by the  GRU.    Shishmakov also ordered a false flag attack on the opposition party  headquarters to create the appearance of an attack by the government.  He even hoped to entice one of the political parties that was part of  the Prime Minister's coalition to leave the government with a bribe  using Russian money funneled through Chechnya. Again, fortunately none  of this worked.   Montenegrin police made several arrests in the aftermath of this  failed coup attempt, but those arrests did not  [[Page S3633]]  include the alleged GRU agents, Mr. Shishmakov and Mr. Popov. They were  in Belgrade, Serbia's capital. Presumably, Montenegrin authorities  hoped the Serbian Government would consider expediting the pair to  Montenegro as the government had done with some of the lower level coup  plotters, but that did not happen, and the two Russian agents returned  to Moscow.   I know that sounded a little complicated. Every American should be  disturbed by what happened in Montenegro. We should admire the courage  of the country's leaders who resisted Russian pressure and persevered  to bring Montenegro into the NATO alliance, which finally took place  officially 2 weeks ago.   If there is one thing we should take away from this heinous plot, it  is that we cannot treat Russia's interference in America's election in  2016 as an isolated incident. We have to stop looking at this through  the warped lens of politics and see this attack on our democracy for  what it is--just one phase of Vladimir Putin's long-term campaign to  weaken the United States, to destabilize Europe, to break the NATO  alliance, to undermine confidence in Western values, and to erode any  and all resistance to his dark and dangerous view of the world.   That is why Putin attacked our 2016 election. That is why Putin  attempted to overthrow the Government of Montenegro. That is why he  tried to influence the election in France and will try the same in  Germany and elsewhere throughout Europe. That is why it probably will  not be long before Putin attempts some punitive actions in Montenegro  to show other countries in the Western Balkans what happens when you  try to defy Russia.   That is why it will not be long before Putin takes interest in  another American election. The victim may be a Republican. It may be a  Democrat. To Putin, it will not matter as long as he succeeds in  dividing us from one another, weakening our resolve, undermining  confidence in ourselves, and eroding our belief in our own values.   I urge my colleagues again that we must take our own side in this  fight, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans. It is  time to respond to Russia's attack on American democracy and that of  our European allies with strength, with resolve, with common purpose,  and with action.   I would like to finally add we will be holding a hearing in the Armed  Services Committee on this whole situation that took place in  Montenegro.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, every indication, I would say to my friend  from Florida, a most valued member of the Armed Services Committee,  they will continue to try to interfere in any election they possibly  can. They are spending large amounts of money. They have certainly, to  some degree, undermined confidence between countries in the NATO  alliance, and that, coupled with the degree of uncertainty here in  Washington, has probably put as great a strain on the NATO alliance as  you have seen since its very beginning. I thank my colleague from  Florida.    Mr. President, I would just say to my colleague from  Florida that when you look at their early attempts versus their latest  attempts, they learn with every experience. It is a lot easier--as my  colleague from Florida knows, it is a lot easier to play offense than  defense.   We are going to have a hearing on this whole Montenegrin thing, and I  know the Senator from Florida will play a very significant role. Every  time we turn around, we have a new revelation of some of the activities  that have been carried out, not just by Russian hackers but by Chinese,  by Iranian, even by single individuals. This is probably the national  security challenge that may not be the greatest, but I would say we are  the least prepared for.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to  congratulate Larry Voyles, the former executive director of the Arizona  Game and Fish Department, for his 40 years of dedicated service to the  State of Arizona and the Nation.   Larry recently retired from the helm of my home State's wildlife  management agency. He leaves with a litany of accolades and  achievements that underscore a remarkable career. During his time at  the department, Larry also served in a variety of national posts that  advanced Federal policies important to outdoor sports and wildlife  conservation, including as president of the Association of Fish and  Wildlife Agencies.   Larry first began at the department as a district manager and  eventually ascended to become the agency's top training officer and  later a regional director before being selected by the Arizona Game and  Fish Commission to serve as the executive director for the past 8  years.   Faced with daunting challenges like regional drought and catastrophic  wildfires, Larry proved time and again that the department understands  how to care for the land and the large variety of animal life in the  Grand Canyon State. Larry also knows the importance of safeguarding a  State's right to manage wildlife populations without undue interference  from the Federal Government, and he remains a tireless advocate for  sportsmen community and those pursuing meaningful wildlife  conservation.   I thank Larry, my friend, for his honorable service at the Arizona  Department of Game and Fish and wish him the best in his future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these  nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of  Senators.
