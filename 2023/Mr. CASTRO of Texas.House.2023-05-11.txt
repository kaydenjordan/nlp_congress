 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2,  which should be known as the child deportation act.   Last year, my family marked 100 years since my grandmother, Victoria  Castro, came to the United States as a young orphan in the wake of the  Mexican Revolution. On her paperwork, the San Antonio relatives who  took her in wrote that she was coming ``to live,'' to live in the  United States.   From the discussions on the floor today, it seems that many of my  colleagues have forgotten about the lives of the asylum seekers who  will be affected by their legislation.   Under this bill, for example, if a Uyghur Muslim family escapes from  one of China's concentration camps in Xinjiang and seeks asylum in the  United States by way of Mexico, they will be turned away.   If a group of Cuban dissidents sail to Florida and land outside of a  port of entry, they will be turned away.   Ukrainian families fleeing from Putin's state-sponsored kidnapping,  Catholics fleeing religious persecution in Nicaragua, and Christians in  Iran would all be required to remain in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or  El Salvador at the mercy of cartels and violent gangs.                                time  1400    Under the Trump-era remain-in-Mexico policy, human rights observers  recorded thousands of violent attacks against migrants, including  kidnapping, rape, and other brutal crimes.   That policy, as cruel as it was, included exemptions for  unaccompanied minors and people who don't speak Spanish. This bill  includes neither of those exemptions.   H.R. 2 would also end humanitarian parole for tens of thousands of  Afghan evacuees who fought side by side with our troops for over 20  years of war. These heroes and their families barely escaped from the  Taliban last summer, and less than 1 year later, Republicans are trying  to send our Afghan allies back to die.   Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed  concerns about how the current immigration system will be able to  handle a rising tide of immigrants post title 42. I agree that we need  to build a more resilient, more effective, and more efficient system,  but this bill is not the way to do that.   Time and again, we have seen that cruel, restrictive policies like  those in this bill do not stop desperate people from fleeing  persecution, oppression, and violence.   This bill would send the world's most vulnerable people to places  where many Americans won't even drink the water. It would force asylum  seekers to take dangerous, irregular paths to the United States, which  is the exact kind of journey that led to the deaths of 53 people in the  back of a sweltering tractor-trailer in my hometown of San Antonio last  summer.   There are meaningful bipartisan solutions to address the causes of  forced migration to the United States. I have been proud to work across  the aisle to introduce several bills that would do that, but this is  not the answer.    Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 does not  include any serious attempt to address the root causes of immigration,  and it will not make any real progress to fix our Nation's broken  immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason and many others, I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no.''
