 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Kapusinski family for their hard work and dedication that has enabled  70 incredible years of business for Huletts-on-Lake-George.   On the east shore of Lake George, this family-owned and operated  small business has provided welcoming vacations for those wishing to  explore the incredible beauty that Lake George and the Adirondacks has  to offer.   In 1953, George and Margaret Eichler purchased property in Huletts  Landing, New York, after falling in love with the quiet oasis on Lake  George. They wanted to share this quaint vacation spot with those who  want to appreciate time with their families. There is nothing more  important than family time together.   I am proud to recognize the hard work and dedication of three  generations of the Kapusinski family. Their contributions to Huletts  Landing and the Lake George area have been instrumental in the lives of  many.   Their demonstrated entrepreneurial spirit is a trademark of upstate  New York and the North Country.   I look forward to witnessing 70 more years of their strong business  in the Lake George region.   On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, it is my honor  to congratulate the Kapusinski family for 70 years of successfully  operating Huletts-on-Lake-George.                            ____________________
