 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs,  for bringing this bill up, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul),  my good friend and colleague, the lead Republican on the House  Committee on Foreign Affairs.   I can't tell you how important this bill is, and I rise today in  support of H.R. 3352, the Department of State Authorization Act of  2019.   You heard how long it has been since we have passed this. It recently  passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee with wide bipartisan  support. This is the hallmark of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and it  shows the good work that is done and how important this is, and that is  why the Foreign Affairs Committee is the most important committee in  the House.   This legislation helps support the important work that the State  Department does and its diplomats do to protect our national security.   I have had the honor to travel on codels that are so important, and I  encourage Members to do that, because it strengthens America's foreign  policy, our engagement, and it leaves a belief in those other countries  that America is here to be allies.   What I am always amazed at is the hard work of our State Department  employees; and not reauthorizing a bill that gives them the ability to  work, it kind of affects their attitude. So this is a critical bill to  be approved at this time.   Despite the essential need for a fully functioning, operational  Department, this is the first time in 6 years that there has been a  comprehensive Department of State authorization bill.   It is the duty of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the  Congress as a whole to provide our departments with the necessary tools  to advance the United States' foreign policy.   Again, I thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for including  the language from my bill, H.R. 1677, which repeals certain foreign  affairs reporting requirements within the State Department. This  provision will repeal, again, the unnecessary, redundant requirements  that are outdated and no longer needed.   I would also like to commend my colleagues in the House Committee on  Foreign Affairs, the staff for coming together and supporting a  bipartisan bill that will protect America's national security. We must  not let partisan divide continue to handicap our diplomats and their  mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the passage of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I have a three-part series, and I would like  to open at this moment and yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I am entering into the second phase of my  Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Rosewood and  reflect upon the tragedy that happened in 1923.   Rosewood was a small, rural town in my district. It is in northwest  central Florida, in between Otter Creek, Chiefland, and Cedar Key. It  was built around the pencil mill and turpentine industry. It was a  mixed town of Blacks and Whites.   In 1915, it had a population of approximately 355 people. The town  had started to become segregated. The neighboring town of Sumner was  developed at the time and was primarily White.   In January of 1923, a young White woman claimed that a Black man had  assaulted her. The accusation started a riot, ultimately resulting in  the burning of the entire town and the death of countless members of  the Rosewood community.   Within hours of the violence starting, many survivors fled to the  surrounding woods, where they hid and waited for a rescue train that  was sent there to take people out of the area of violence.   At the end of the week, only one building remained standing, and to  this day, the death toll is still unknown, and no buildings remain.   The story by the young White woman was found to be a lie. She was the  Black man's lover. Her significant other beat her, and she lied and  blamed the young Black man to save face.  [[Page H7452]]    The Rosewood massacre, which occurred just outside of my district, is  one that went nearly forgotten for over 60 years because of the  destructive nature of prejudice and hatred caused by the survivors who  lived in fear, rarely sharing their stories, even with families and  close friends.   I firmly believe that in order to learn from our history, we have to  make an effort to remember it. We should memorialize these events, and  that is why we put up plaques. We put up markers or statues, lest we  forget it, and within a generation or two, the mistakes of the past are  repeated because the next generation will grow ignorant of the  struggles of the past.   When the stories of Rosewood first started recirculating in the  1980s, it brought in a new level of awareness to the State of Florida  and the understanding that we, as a society, cannot be complacent in  senseless acts of violence. It even inspired a movie in Hollywood to  illustrate the ugliness of the past hatred and the violence.   Violence and prejudice have no place in our society, and we have a  duty to ensure that this type of tragedy never happens again.   Today, in Rosewood, a marker stands just off the highway  memorializing the town that never returned. Survivors and their  descendants have shared their stories, hoping that Rosewood's memory  would not be erased.   One of these is a constituent of mine, Ms. Lizzie Jenkins, who has  been working on this tragedy for the last 25 years. Her goal and ours  is for individuals to remember and to never forget the hatred, the  racism of the past, and to honor those who suffered in the past so  future generations do not repeat the pain, suffering, and mistakes of  the past.   She has a dream to accomplish this, and that is to create the  Rosewood Museum.    Madam Speaker, it has been almost a century since the Rosewood  massacre. By remembering and learning from this tragedy, we can work  towards a future full of acceptance. Knowing Ms. Jenkins, I can  confidently say that there will be a Rosewood Museum.                 Solving the Problem at the Southwest Border     Madam Speaker, I would like to move on to the third portion  of my Special Order. We are going to talk about how to solve the  problem at the southwest border and how to move beyond border security.   I just listened to an hour of people ranting and putting blame on  this President for the hatred, the racism he has caused. I heard the  Member on the other side talk about the ban on Muslims.   We can't move forward and fix things if we use false narratives.  There was not a ban on Muslims. President Trump put a ban on countries.  In fact, they are the same six countries that President Obama put a ban  on and recommended to put a ban on. There was never a ban on Muslim  countries.   I went to Indonesia on a codel, a bipartisan one, and there was a  Member of this Congress from the other side who asked the Indonesian  Prime Minister at the time: What is the sentiment in a Muslim country  about a ban from our President--President Trump at the time--about the  Muslim ban that he has placed on there?   He knew good and well that President Trump didn't ban Muslims in this  country. He put the ban on the same six countries that President Obama  did, but there was no complaint.   I bring that up just because, if we are going to solve the problems  of this country, one that this body--look at it. It is empty. There are  two Members of Congress in here, and they have been complaining--I am  sorry. I stand corrected, Madam Speaker. There are three Members of  Congress.   But if we are going to fix this problem, it is going to take more  than three of us. I am sure everyone agrees. They sit there and they  give great speeches about how it is tearing our country apart. The  President is tearing our country apart. What a shame this is, the  hatred, the vitriol that is coming out of the White House, how people  are being taken away from their families, and there are no toothbrushes  or diapers, or they are sleeping on floors.   I am just glad the other side is acknowledging that there is a  crisis, but for the first half of the year, there wasn't a crisis. They  refused to say there was a crisis.   There was a Special Order here last week, and my good colleague, Mr.  King, was here. We had other Members, and we had pictures from 2014  when President Obama was here. It was funny because my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle were railing about the crisis in 2014.                                time  1930    There have been times in this body when the Democrats had the  majority in the House, the Senate, and the White House. There were  times, and I was there, when the Republicans had the same majority, the  House, the Senate, and the White House.   It saddens me because this discussion about our having to fix these  things, when both parties were in control, they didn't do it. What  really saddens me is I see people using political opportunities for  their next election. I heard a lot of that tonight. There were no  solutions in that.   We talked for an hour last week about the crisis at the border, the  situation at the border, and the atrocities at the border. The drug  cartels are profiting from this. We stay as a divided House. I implored  President Trump--and I will do it again tonight--that he needs to call  Congress back in session when we reconvene tomorrow, and I would do it  every time this body goes on a break until we fix our border security  and until we come up with an immigration bill.   I want to move into what I really want to talk about. In order to  move forward, we have to have solutions. I have been here for 7 years,  and I have seen ``comprehensive'' come up in healthcare, and I have  seen ``comprehensive'' come up in immigration. What I have learned is  that when you put ``comprehensive'' in front of a cause, it doesn't  happen. It is political speak that says it is not going to happen  because the room becomes divided, and everybody uses it as a political  tool for the next election.   What I want to do is, instead of trying to do comprehensive  immigration reform, I want to focus on a small bite of the apple.   We have a proposal. We have legislation that we are working through  the House in a bipartisan manner. We have shared this with over 40  Members of Congress in a bipartisan manner, and we have shared this  with the Senate in a bipartisan manner. It is a guest worker program.   The bill will be a guest worker program. There will be three silos,  agriculture, hospitality, and construction. These are all positions  that, in general, are in the lower-skilled fields. They are not rocket  scientists, and they are not engineers. These are the skills that we  need in our labor workforce for agriculture, for food security, for  construction, and for our hospitality. In the past, we have not had a  good program for people to come into the country legally and stay in  the field that they have decided to work in.   This bill will be under a banner, but there will be three separate  bills. The first bill will be a guest worker program for agriculture,  and that is what I would like to focus on tonight.   America has the lowest-cost food of the industrialized world because  our farmers can produce so well. But they can't benefit from that if we  don't have the workers willing to go out and work in the fields.   I was a person who, at the age of 15, worked in produce. We loaded  trucks. The produce came in from the farm, and we loaded the produce. I  did that to work my way through college. Yet, today, people said that  domestic people, Americans, won't do that work. I disagree with that,  and I think we put a stigma on that.   In order to fix this, we have to have a labor solution, or our  farmers won't be able to keep farming. The goal of this bill is to  create a dependable, reliable workforce. The way this program would  work is it would be in two phases.   The first phase is that we create a prescreened pool of workers  before they come into the country. We will have a relationship and an  agreement between country A and our State Department.   If we pick out a country, Guatemala, the Guatemalan state department  will have a relationship with our State Department. When a person  applies, he becomes what we call the applicant. The country he comes  from will verify the person's date of birth and their residence. Then,  they will verify that this  [[Page H7453]]  person has not been involved in violent crimes, drug activity, or gang  activity.   Once they apply, that information goes through the Department of  Homeland Security. They do a background check. They do it on their  international database, and they do it on the domestic database. If  that person clears the database, then that information goes to the  USDA. We moved the agriculture labor workforce from the Department of  Labor to the USDA, where it can be better monitored to fulfill the  needs of agriculture.   That person does not come into the country until a job is open. The  employer in this country, an agriculture producer, still has to  advertise for domestic help. When that position is not filled, the  producer can ask for that worker to come in. That worker comes in under  the agreement that they are going to work in the agriculture sector.   They have to be a minimum of 18 years of age. It is not chain  migration. If they have family members who want to come in, they, too,  can apply, but it applies to them individually.   Once they get accepted into the program and come into the country,  they become a participant. At that time, they get issued a guest worker  identification card that we call a GWIC card. That GWIC card will have  15 digits in there for security. In addition, it will have the initials  ``AG,'' designating that that is an agriculture worker permit.   When the worker comes in, they now have been allowed into the country  legally. The work permit goes on for 5 years. That means they can stay  in this country for 5 years at a time. They have to work a minimum of  75 percent of the year in agriculture, but it allows them to move back  and forth to their host country seamlessly because we have an agreement  between two countries.   The person can travel around the country to work a seasonal crop. In  Florida, our citrus harvest is done usually by mid- to late June. That  would allow that worker to go from that farm up to New York, Maine, or  Washington State to work crops. He also has the ability to go back  home.   That permit is good for 5 years at a time. He can renew 4\1/2\ years  into it, and he can do this indefinitely. There will be a cutoff age.  We are recommending approximately 50 or 55 years of age. There is a fee  of $2,500 for that.   The second part of this program will be dealing with the people here  who came in illegally. Our proposal would allow a person to apply to  this program under the understanding that the Federal Government is not  here to deport them. The Federal Government is here to give them a way  that they can get into a program and have legal residence here.   During that period of time, when the applicant is applying, there  will be a waiver over that person, meaning that he won't be deported. A  background check will be done. If DHS says this person is okay, then he  can enter this program. If that person has minor violations--a fender  bender, didn't return a book to the library--he will have a period of  time where he can get straight with the legal system.   Upon completing that, he enters into the guest worker program and  becomes a participant. He, too, pays a fee of $2,500. That is to go for  running the program. In addition, there will be a fine for coming into  the country illegally. What has been proposed is approximately $1,500  to $2,000 for the first time they apply to the program.   Every year a person renews, 4\1/2\ years into this program, there  will be a $2,500 fee, and that is subject to change as the times  change.   As a person comes into the program, they get issued the guest worker  identification card, which is called the GWIC card, and that will be  embedded biometrics. We gave the list to the DHS to pick out what they  think is necessary from facial recognition pictures, DNA, fingerprints,  and retinal scans, all that they can choose from. We asked them to put  enough of those biometrics in there so that card is secure.   In addition, it will have a 15-digit code that will be a hack-proof,  secure card. As I said, there will be the initials ``AG,'' designating  that person as a guest worker in this country in agriculture.   He is allowed to get a driver's license. If he passes the test in a  State, then he will get a guest worker driver's license. It would not  be used for voter registration. It is something to give that person a  driver's license so that he can work on a farm.   If that person who is here illegally gets accepted into the program  and has a family who came in with him illegally, as he is applying to  the program, there is a waiver over his family. If he gets accepted  into the program, or they get accepted into the program, his family is  also good to stay in the country for 5 years at a time, provided the  participant renews 4\1/2\ years into it.   If his children came in illegally, then they are protected until the  age of 18, at which time they have to make a decision to apply to one  of the programs. There will be three sectors. It will be agriculture,  hospitality, and construction.   At that point, again, as I said, that person can move around the  country. They can work crops wherever they choose. They can go back  home knowing they can get back into this country.   E-Verify will be a component of this, and it would work such that, as  a person enters the program, their data is already in DHS. When they go  to start their job, the employer puts their smart card, the GWIC card,  into a reader. It identifies the person, a positive identification. We  have eliminated probably close to 100 percent of the fraud that occurs  with the current system.   We request that the individual worker has to check into a Federal  office on a monthly basis. Every town in America has a Federal office,  either a courthouse or a post office. Part of the $2,500 fee goes to  pay for the equipment in there. It would be inexpensive equipment. It  would be the same equipment that we use when we go to do a retail sale  like at a big box store. You put your card in there; it reads it; and  it tells DHS and USDA where this person is.   The employer also is required to use E-Verify. This will be seamless  because he is pulling people out of a pool who are already prescreened  and who are in the E-Verify system. They go through this system.   E-Verify will become mandatory once we get 75 to 80 percent of the  expected population that we need in our guest worker fields. At that  point, all employers will be using the E-Verify system.   The beauty of this system is that we have given a portal for people  to come into this country legally. We have given them a way to stay in  this country for up to 5 years at a time. Then, we give them a way that  we can monitor bad players who sneak into the country or employers who  are hiring people here illegally that suppresses the wages of domestic  workers.   If an employer hires people outside of the system once it is  mandatory, when they get caught, it is a $2,500 fee the first offense,  per offense per individual. If it is a repeat offender of an employer,  then that fine will go up, and they are subject to jail time.   The beauty of this is if a worker leaves a guest worker program in  either agriculture, hospitality, or construction, and they try to work  in a different sector and are found out by the people who are doing the  inspection, they have given up their right to stay in this country on a  guest worker program.   The things that we hear back about that is that people voluntarily  enter this program. They have agreed to work in agriculture and  agriculture only or one of the other sectors. If they work outside of  that, they have agreed that they have broken that. This is a policy  that is self-policing when people get found out.   For the people who choose not to enter any of these programs, they  are here illegally, and they will be dealt with according to the laws  on the books.   We are asking to have sequencing done on this, and the first part of  that is we have to agree on border security. It is interesting because  I hear this fight over border security, but when I go on trips and talk  to my colleagues on the other side, they always tell me that they agree  with border security and that we have to have border security. If we  agree to it, let's do it.    Again, this body is empty other than us three. I think the President  should call us back. Let's get border security.  [[Page H7454]]  Let's get this done, Madam Speaker, so that we can move on to the next  thing.   We have to have enforcement of the laws on the books. We are  providing a guest worker program for the majority of the people whom we  need in our labor force for lower skills.   The third part of the sequencing is that we can deal with Dreamers  and DACA down the road. We can't do that until we do border security  and have a way for people to come into the country legally, to work in  this country legally, and to take that group who came in illegally and  put them in a legal process.   Madam Speaker, this is something we have shared with probably close  to 60 people in a bipartisan manner. We have shared this with  agriculture groups from all over the Nation, from California to Maine,  New York, Washington State, Florida, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and  from every sector in agriculture, from dairy to pine, timber, fruits  and vegetables, citrus, and fruits and nuts. Everybody tells us this is  the most commonsense reform they have seen.   We have shared it with ranking members of different committees on the  Democratic side. They said this is something they plan to help support.  I am excited because of the bipartisan nature in the House. We have  shared this with Senators, and the Senators are working with us to make  this happen. Our goal is to make this happen this Congress.   We are looking for people to go to our website, https:// yoho.house.gov, to get more information. We have a short video that  covers this.   If we do nothing, we are going to have a repeat of the last 30, 35  years, when Ronald Reagan gave amnesty to 3.5 million to 4 million  people.                                time  1945    This body has sat there and argued and blamed the other side for  inaction or blamed the other side for hatred and racism or blamed the  other side for wanting to give everybody amnesty. If we do nothing,  this problem will grow and grow and divide this Nation more.   This is the time to act, and I would hope people would come back to  Congress over the break and let's get something done.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I yield to  the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), my good friend, to say something.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King),  for the things he stands for. He is just a true patriot who loves  America.   The gentleman brought up a great point. The current system allows  people to use the Social Security number. So you can come into the  country. You get issued a Social Security, or people will eventually,  as they come in, gravitate and get on an I-9 form.   They will use a fraudulent or a fake ID number, Social Security  number. They are a dime a dozen out there. There are people,  counterfeiters, out there doing that.   What happens is it gums up the system. It is like an accounting  nightmare, and it creates confusion for the people who are supposed to  regulate this. So it gets to a point where they can't even track the  people because there are so many fraudulent numbers.   Where there is confusion, there is inertia, and that is why nothing  gets done. And I think you look at the current system, because it is  not workable.   The H-2A was designed for seasonal agriculture workers, but we do not  use it that way because it is not enforced. They are supposed to come  in for 10 months, and then they go home. But the current system is you  can get a waiver, and that waiver can go on for 3 years. And if it is  not enforced, they forget about the waiver and they just kind of fall  into the society, and nobody knows where they are at.   The beauty of this system is there is an identification number. We  are proposing 15 digits in length, with the designation of ``AG'' in  there, agriculture, plus the smart chip in there that has the  biometrics.   So we separate guest workers from the rest of the population. So we  have a database of just guest workers that will be a lot easier to  track. It will be a lot easier to know where people are.   As people have to check into the system, the onus is on the worker.  They can check in at their place of employment. They can check in at a  post office. They can check in at a Federal courthouse. And so it is  going to be easy for people to stay compliant.   If they are not in compliance with checking in, they will have a  grace period. They have to become compliant. If they are not compliant  after a period of time, they are subject to deportation.   One of the things we talked about is what happens if somebody creates  a deportable felony, and that would be something like, maybe, vehicular  homicide from a DUI, which we have seen too many of those in the news.  They would be subject to deportation.   If they are here with a family that they came in illegally, they got  accepted into this program, if that were to happen, they have put their  family at risk of deportation.   I don't like that part, but it is also that we need to look at the  other side of that.   We have allowed people to come into this country to be a guest  worker.   I have had the experience of being a veterinarian, practicing for 30  years, in large animals. We dealt with cattle farms, dairy farms, horse  farms, people who did row crops, fruits and vegetables. Just name a  crop, and we have pretty much dealt with it.   I have gotten to a point where I talked to a lot of people who were  here as migrant workers, and I sympathize with them. Heck, I was still  working on the farm. That was one of my ambitions of going to vet  school. I wanted to be outstanding in my field, and I wound up being  outstanding in everybody else's field.   But we got to know the immigrant, and we got to a point where we  could ask them: Are you here legally or illegally?   They were so honest. They say: I came in illegally.   And I even asked them: Did you pay a price to come in?   They said: Yeah, $2,000, $5,000, $8,000. And it shocked me that  people were paying.   And this was probably 12 years ago, 11 years ago.   And I would ask them: Do you want to become a citizen?   And it would amaze me how many of these people said: No. I just want  the opportunity to come here, make a living, and go home.   So one of the impetuses behind this was let's create a system where  people can come, fulfill the need we have, and fulfill the need they  have.   I have stayed in touch with some of these people. They have made  enough money to go back home, create a farm of their own, and they  don't have to come back. But they will refer people into the system.   So if we can streamline that and make it easier for people to come in  when we have border security, they can come in the legal way. There is  no need to sneak in.   If we can take that group that came in illegally and they move into  this, the ones that know they probably don't have a bad record, they  have moved into the system.   So we can start cleaning up this mess.   And the gentleman and I just shared the analogy of working cattle.  When we have all of our calves, we sort out the ones over here: the  males over here; the females over here.   So it is a way to sift through the problem we have. If we do nothing,  the problem is going to grow.   The H-2A system right now, one of the flaws with that, as I said, it  was supposed to be a 10-month program. People come in. Our producers  are paying $1,200 to $2,000 to get a person into the country for the  permit, to get them the transportation and all that. When they come  into the country, about 25 percent of the people that come in on an H- 2A abscond. They go off the grid, and the producer can't get people to  come back that they have hired to work and they have made that  commitment.   With this system, that person will have that ``AG'' designation. The  H-2A program will have the ``AG'' designation, and with the H-2A  program, the goal is to make it a 10-month seasonal program. After 10  months, you go home. You have agreed to that. If you only want to work  16 weeks, you work the 16 weeks and go home.   So it gives flexibility to the worker. It gives flexibility to the  producer. It creates food security for us because this is something we  need. And we get rid of the adverse wage effect and we go to the  prevailing wage, which usually is about 115 percent above minimum wage.   But as you and I know, people who work in agriculture, and if they  are picking crops or shipping stuff, they are making $250 to $300 a  day. They work their tails off because they are appreciative of the  opportunity they have, as you said, because they want to live their  dream. And they may become a citizen down the road.   There is no citizenship with this. It is a way for people to come in  and work. We get rid of the touchback provision of Bob Goodlatte's bill  last year, and that comes from feedback from our dairy folks and other  industries: I need year-round workers.   A touchback does not work, because we have had these people who have  been in here illegally for 5, 10, 15 years.   Let's work together as Americans to solve a problem so that we can  sift through this and end people coming in illegally.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman if he has any other thoughts  that he would like to add, he can feel free.    The gentleman is exactly right. I have had producers call  me. When I was in the district, they brought that up, the no-match  letters. They are in a tizzy.   If we go back prior to President Obama, there were no-match letters.  This is what is wrong when you have bad policy. When you get rid of a  program or a requirement that is working, people get complacent. They  are like: Hey, I don't have to match up to Social Security, so there is  no reason for me even to apply legally.   Then, when you try to reinstate it, you get angry people, and it gums  up the system again.   That is why, if we have a good system in place, there is no reason to  back away from it because this will be a policy that will live beyond  you and me.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I think that is a great thing. That is something we do need  to go into. Then, we need to have the alternative.   The gentleman brought up a good point that I have experienced, too,  talking to our producers. If you get an I-9, which is the form to apply  for a job, if there is a Social Security number, if you question that  and don't hire that person because you think it is not legal, he has  the right to sue you, and he will win. If you don't question that and  hire that person, the Department of Labor or ICE shows up. They are  going to fine you for hiring a person that you didn't verify.   It is a mess. How did we become the great country we are with such  a--I was going to say messed up system, or something like that.   This is not rocket science. This is a simple program, and there is a  commonsense reform.   One of the things I didn't bring up, and I think the gentleman had  asked me about this, is that the ID number is also a tax number. Taxes  will be taken out of that.   That is why I don't want Social Security associated with it, because  Social Security denotes benefits, that if I am paying this, I get  benefits. Those are not tied here. Money that goes in will go to other  resources.   What we are proposing is that we are going to make a requirement that  each person who comes in as a guest worker has to have a catastrophic  health insurance policy. If you come in here and drive a car, you have  to have insurance. This will be something that we are sitting down with  the insurance companies about. We have a pool of about a million people  who are going to need some form of catastrophic health insurance.   The other thing we are proposing is, if they are here legally, and  they have a guest permit to work here, we go to direct primary care.  These are companies around the country--it was amazing. I went and  visited one. If you are between the ages of 18 and, I think, 25 or 30,  your monthly cost for your health insurance is $25 a month--$25 a  month. If you want blood work, it is $40 a month in my town. If you  want an MRI, it is $250. That is affordable healthcare.   The beauty of this is the employer can bring in a group of people. He  can get direct primary care for a small amount of money. We will allow  him to deduct that cost. Then, there is catastrophic health insurance.   We have covered health insurance. We have covered driving insurance.  We have covered a way for people to come in. We have given them a  number so that we know where they are. They are not gummed up in our  Social Security system.   We have started to separate into different silos or categories and  envelopes where they should be so that there is rational thought to  this.   The gentleman brought up rationalizing. I shouldn't have used that  word. Rationalizing is to make rationale a lie. That is used too often  up here.    We want to make commonsense reforms to have a program that works for  the immigrants, works for our employers, and works for our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    We have. That is the beauty of the system. We get rid of  all that. It is not a Social Security withholding. It is going to be a  tax. It will be a guest worker tax, and money will be taken out.   As I said, as I have shared this with Members in a bipartisan manner,  they get excited about it. Our producers get excited about it. Industry  gets excited about it.  [[Page H7457]]    Let's work to finally be the Congress that says that we fixed this  problem, and let's make the American people proud and make our Nation  safer.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
