 Mr. Speaker, time and again, President Biden and  congressional Democrats have made the choice to blatantly disregard the  dire state of our country's finances.   Even when a few Members of his own party joined Republicans and voted  in favor of H.J. Res. 45, which would have rescinded his unilateral  student loan forgiveness executive action, the President vetoed it.  Now, when given the chance to override the President's veto, radical  House Democrats doubled down on their decision to force this taxpayer- funded bailout of student loan borrowers down the throats of  hardworking, blue-collar workers who will never see a penny of the $400  billion in forgiveness.   Mr. Speaker, it is truly a shame, and I express my regret for the  millions of Americans who never went to college or responsibly chose to  pay off their loans. I stand with them in calling out this ridiculous,  unconstitutional taxpayer-funded bailout.                            ____________________
