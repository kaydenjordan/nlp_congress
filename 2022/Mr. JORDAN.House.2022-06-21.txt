 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the NDO Fairness Act is a significant step in  addressing the government's overreach and abuse of nondisclosure  orders, also known as gag orders.   All too often, the government obtains a court order to secretly  demand the communications of American citizens from third-party tech  companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Verizon. Through these  orders, the government blocks these companies from alerting their  customers or users that the government is looking through their emails  and phone records. In other words, you don't get to know.   The frequency with which the government uses these orders to demand  information is shocking. One company received 2,400 to 3,500 orders  every year between 2016 and 2021. That is 7 to 10 orders every day-- every single day. Some of those orders do not contain an expiration.  That means the government is authorized to spy on Americans' private  information indefinitely.   Think about that, Madam Speaker. You may never know that the  government accessed and snooped on your most intimate information.   More astoundingly, these nondisclosure orders are often approved by a  rubberstamp process for routine investigations without any real showing  of the need for secrecy.   This bipartisan bill ensures that our rights enshrined in the  Constitution are protected from government overreach. The bill requires  courts to issue written decisions as to why orders are necessary. It  sets a 60-day limit for such orders and allows providers to challenge  unjustified orders in a court of law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the bill is simple. Under current law, it is a crime  to issue threats against former Presidents' immediate family and  certain other persons.   Specifically, this bill replaces the words ``wife'' and ``widow''  with ``spouse'' and ``surviving spouse.'' Both major parties have had  women run for President, and this change makes sense.   But while we are dedicating floor time to consider this minor  technical change, President Biden's inflation has hit a 40-year high;  his border crisis has left our Nation woefully unsecure; and leftwing  defund the police actions have  [[Page H5701]]  contributed to a crime wave that is plaguing our cities.   Of course, this bill makes sense. It should be a crime to threaten  the President or First Family. No one disagrees with that. But this  body needs to get its priorities straight. Where is the legislation to  address the crisis at the border, or address the crime wave, or to do  anything meaningful about inflation or the price at the pump?   The bill is fine, but I hope that House Democrats will spend some  time addressing the real issues that face the American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Active Shooter Alert Act is unnecessary. It gives more authority  to the Biden Justice Department, the most political Justice Department  in history.   States already utilize emergency alert systems to warn the public  about natural and human-made disasters, extreme weather events, active  shooter situations, and other emergencies. Federal, State, and local  officials already use the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System to  send emergency alerts to mobile devices and to alert media platforms.    According to a 2020 report from the Government Accountability Office,  every State has at least one alerting authority, and there are more  than 1,400 alerting authorities across the country.   If the States are already using an alerting system to notify the  public about imminent threats, what is this bill really doing? What is  this bill really about? This bill is creating a new Federal job at the  Biden DOJ to encourage State and local governments to issue public  alerts any time a firearm is used to threaten anyone anywhere.   Don't take my word for it. During the markup, Congressman Jones  admitted that:         This bill would be most effective at reminding us that the       threat of gun violence exists all around us, but it does       little to actually protect us from it.    That is right. This bill is about Democrat fear-mongering that guns  are ever-present threats, and we cannot be safe until Big Government  rounds up every last gun.   In fact, Congressman Jones went further and called on the committee  to consider another bill that would ban assault weapons. The Democrat  chair of the committee followed up by voicing his support for that very  concept.   No wonder the Democrats want to push forward a bill that will create  a reminder that ``the threat of gun violence exists all around us.''  They want to create a culture of fear so they can achieve their  ultimate goal, which is getting rid of the Second Amendment.                                time  1530    If they really wanted to improve emergency alerts for active  shooters, we would be moving a bill to improve the IPAWS wireless  emergency alerts that are sent to mobile devices.   In a recent report, GAO stated that local alerting officials had  expressed concerns about the inability to target WEA alerts with  accuracy, which made local officials reluctant to even use the system  at all.   They have got a system out there. Let's improve the system and alert  people to emergencies, not have legislation that is about ultimately  undermining the Second Amendment.   We could have had hearings. We could have received expert testimony.  We could have been able to fully vet this initiative. This legislation  is simply another failed attempt by Democrats to ``do something'' about  the surge in violence and crime across the country.   If we need to do something, we should start by supporting law  enforcement and the rule of law instead of demonizing our police and  actively encouraging illegal entry into this country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would point out, we are not trying to  hide behind the Second Amendment--we are trying to defend it. We are  defending it.   It is an important part of our Bill of Rights, an important part of  our Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Massie), no better defender of the Second Amendment, and the co-chair  of the Second Amendment Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Madam Speaker, such irony. Democrats lecturing  Republicans on law enforcement and respect for law enforcement. This  from the party who spent an entire summer talking about defunding the  police, who had elected officials in this body, Democrats in this body,  raise money to bail out the rioters and looters who they called  peaceful protesters who were attacking police, and now he is going to  lecture Republicans on respect for law enforcement. I mean, you can't  make it up. This is how the Democrats operate today.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Upton).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Carolina.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   First, as the gentleman from North Carolina said, this bill is  redundant. There are 1,400 alerting authorities across the country that  already alert citizens in those communities to an active shooter, so it  is redundant.   Second, it does seek to undermine the Second Amendment. Don't take my  word for it. Take one of the Democrat supporters of the legislation on  the Judiciary Committee. Here is what he said:         This bill would be most effective at reminding us that the       threat of gun violence exists all around us, but it does       little to actually protect us.    You have to view it in context. Remember, the last 4 weeks, all  Democrats have talked about is taking away people's Second Amendment  liberties.   We have this huge debate going on in the Senate right now, red flag  laws where you have no due process. Someone who doesn't like you comes  and says, ``We are going to take away so-and-so's firearm,'' and goes  to a judge or law enforcement to take away their firearm. There is a  hearing you are not allowed to be at. They take it away, and then you  have to go get it back. Your fundamental liberty, taking your property,  your rights from you, this is the context with which they bring this  legislation.   The third reason, I don't know who in their right mind would want to  give the Department of Justice more authority in light of what we have  seen from this Department of Justice. Frankly, I don't know why  you would give any Democrat-run Department of Justice more authority  after what we have seen from the Obama Justice Department and now what  we see from the Biden Justice Department.    The Obama Justice Department spied on Presidential campaigns. The  Biden Department of Justice is treating moms and dads as terrorists,  using domestic terrorism, counterterrorism measures, the PATRIOT Act,  against parents, for goodness sakes.   We know that because we have had multiple FBI agents come forward as  whistleblowers and tell us about the  [[Page H5707]]  over two dozen investigations into parents. One of those parents was  investigated simply because they owned a firearm. That is the context  and why we have concerns with this legislation.   I hope we vote ``no'' on this. More importantly, I hope the Senate  doesn't pass this package they are talking about, which would certainly  undermine liberties of law-abiding American citizens.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
