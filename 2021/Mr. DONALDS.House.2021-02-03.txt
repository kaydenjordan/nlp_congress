 Mr. Speaker, as I walked onto the House floor today, I  heard the talk from the other side, talking about wanting to share in  good ideas. But what is interesting is, as this budget resolution has  come forth, there has been no sharing of ideas.   We have seen a general framework coming from the Biden administration  calling for $1.9 trillion, but that completely flies in the face of the  fact that there is $1 trillion that this very body, the last Congress,  appropriated last year that is still unspent. That money has not gone  out the door. Yet, we are talking about solutions to help our country  through COVID-19.   Now, my career before politics was actually in finance and economics.  I spent 17 years in that field. If you are going to talk about  stimulating an economy, the first thing you want to do is actually  study the current state of your economy. One of the metrics we always  like to use in financial services is the unemployment rate. It is a  pretty popular statistic.   Let's take a look at the unemployment rates going on around the  country. In my State of Florida, it is 6.1 percent. In Alabama, it is  3.9 percent. In South Carolina, it is 4.6 percent. In Texas, it is 7.2  percent.                                time  1400    Compare that to blue States in our country, New York and California,  where they soar over 8 percent.   Why is that happening?   Because their governors and their mayors have refused to reopen their  economies.   If you want to stimulate something, actually let the American people  get back to work. Let them run their businesses, and you would be  surprised at what actually would happen in our economy.   Let's talk about the $15 minimum wage, which is in the Biden plan. I  don't know how a $15 minimum wage is going to help struggling small  businesses continue to thrive in the current environment. Furthermore,  what we have already seen with the $15 minimum wage is that it has led  to workers actually getting less hours, less hours at the jobs that  they have. I don't see how that is actually helping anybody stimulate  an economy.  [[Page H294]]    Let's talk about education. In this plan, right now there is $170  billion, give or take, to go to local school districts to reopen.   But guess what? If they are picketing outside of the school  district's school board in Chicago to not go back into the classroom,  what is this additional money actually doing?   In Florida, we have been open in our schools. We have done this.  There are tens of billions of dollars already available to help school  districts reopen. All they need is leadership. They don't need more  money.   The last thing I want to add is with respect to State and local  governments. Every State government and every local government either  gets their money from income taxes, sales taxes; like in the great  State of Florida, property taxes on the local level. This is typically  how you get your revenue. If you want to help State and local  governments take care of their revenue problems, they should open up.  They should not come back to this Capitol and get money.   Why should Florida pay for New York?   Except for the fact that the only thing New York has done is help the  real estate markets in Florida because New Yorkers are fleeing New York  to come to the great State of Florida.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. This budget resolution is not about  economics. It is not about COVID-19. It is not about helping our  schools reopen. This budget resolution is purely politics. It is an  opportunity to push through an agenda through budget reconciliation  where, if you actually studied our economy and studied the fact that  now close to 40 million Americans have been vaccinated with the vaccine  from the previous administration, we are on track to getting reopened.  We should study this. We should be more targeted. We should not be  putting forward a massive spending bill where no study has ever been  given.
