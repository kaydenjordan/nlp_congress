 Madam Speaker, last week, our community in Collierville,  Tennessee, experienced a horrific tragedy.   On Thursday, September 23, last week, a gunman opened fire at the  Kroger on Byhalia Road. Fifteen people were shot, and one woman, Olivia  King, a mother and grandmother, died as a result of her injuries in the  hospital later that day.   Roberta and I are praying for Olivia King's children, her family, and  her friends at this difficult time.   As Collierville Alderman Maureen Fraser said: ``Everybody needs to be  more like Olivia King. She was very kind, very generous, very  Christian, and a rule-follower.''   Our hearts go out to all the victims, their loved ones, and everyone  in the entire community who has been impacted.   I want to quote Collierville Police Chief Dale Lane, who said that  Collierville is ``one of the most resilient communities in America.'' I  believe that this is an absolutely true statement.   On that tragic day, we witnessed our brave heroes--law enforcement  officers, Federal agents, firefighters, EMTs, doctors, nurses, and  other local officials--spring into action. Not a single person  hesitated to act or tend to a person in need.   Their training and selfless actions helped save people's lives that  day. There is no doubt about it. I cannot thank enough everyone for  their incredible bravery and courage that day.   The collaboration and cooperation between all the law enforcement  agencies and all the first responders was tremendous. These agencies  included: the Collierville Police Department; the Collierville Fire  Department; the Shelby County Sheriff's Office; the Germantown Police  Department; the Germantown Fire Department; the Memphis Police  Department; the Memphis Fire Department; the Bartlett Fire Department;  the Bartlett Police Department; the Fayette County Sheriff's Office;  the DeSoto County, Mississippi, Sheriff's Office; the Tennessee Highway  Patrol; the FBI; and other Federal law enforcement agencies. They  worked flawlessly together to address and handle the situation in a  timely and professional manner.   I also commend Collierville Police Chief Dale Lane's strong and  effective leadership, and I thank his entire staff for their heroism.  Special commendation also goes to Collierville Fire Chief Buddy  Billings and his men and women for their swift action that prevented  the additional loss of life.   Further, I want to recognize all the first responders, the doctors,  the surgeons, the nurses, and their staff for delivering the necessary  and immediate care to these victims.   Lastly, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to  Collierville Mayor Stan Joyner, Town Administrator James Lewellen, and  Collierville Municipal School Board Chairman Wright Cox for their  continued and strong leadership.   Mayor Joyner issued a proclamation declaring tomorrow, September 30,  2021, at 1:30 p.m., as a day of prayer and meditation for the town of  Collierville and her victims.   The people of Collierville are strong and resilient. They will always  remain Collierville Strong.                            ____________________
