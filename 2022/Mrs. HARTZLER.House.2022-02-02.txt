 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the so-called  America COMPETES Act.   Let's be clear: China is one of the largest national security threats  our  [[Page H818]]  Nation faces. Addressing this threat will require a whole-of-nation  approach with policies to enable the United States to not only compete  but to beat China.   This legislation fails to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, the  Democrats have, once again, rushed through a massive package riddled  with partisan and unvetted policies that enrich China rather than  constrain them.   Amazingly, the Democrats blocked consideration of all of my  commonsense amendments, which would have prevented known Chinese spies  from entering our Nation, stopped CCP officials from taking advantage  of our higher education system, and sanctioned those responsible for  forced abortions and forced sterilizations of Uyghur women.   If Democrats were serious about protecting America, they should have  welcomed these commonsense measures.   This legislation fails to address the threat of China.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and  instead work on legislation that will actually empower the United  States to beat China.
