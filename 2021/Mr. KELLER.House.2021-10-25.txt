 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that each Member  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, my distinguished colleagues and I stand  here on behalf of America's veterans. The last thing our veterans  should be burdened with is any delay, let alone a prolonged wait time  to access the benefits and programs they have earned through their  service.   The National Personnel Records Center is responsible for processing  these records, and at this moment, there is a backlog of more than half  a million requests, some dating back to February of 2020. Consequently,  some veterans have been waiting for over a year and a half for copies  of their service records which are needed to access VA benefits,  adjudicate disability claims, request campaign service medals, and much  more.   We in the United States of America honor the service and sacrifice of  our veterans and Active Duty military personnel, and any delay for them  is unacceptable.   That is why we introduced the RECORDS Act, legislation that would  compel the National Personnel Records Center to take the necessary  actions to eliminate the growing backlog of veterans' record requests.   Dating back more than a year, there has been a broad, bipartisan push  to deliver for our veterans and work toward addressing the National  Personnel Records Center's unacceptable backlog. The RECORDS Act is an  opportunity to achieve this.   Our veterans fought for us. We must always fight for them. I  appreciate my colleagues joining me this evening together in support of  this goal.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for joining us this  evening and so very well put about making sure that we help our  veterans and the fact that the records center had the resources in  previous legislation. We just need to make sure that they get the job  done. I thank the gentleman for joining us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cammack).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those remarks.  What an outstanding lady that the gentlewoman represents.   The gentlewoman mentioned something that really makes me think of  something when you talk about excuses. I was raised by my grandmother,  and I can remember her telling me one time, my brother and I, she  looked at us and said: Boys, people that make excuses are weak.   It is time that we show strength, and we make them do their job.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), my  good colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Clyde for his  remarks and recognizing that there are veterans across our Nation in  every district we have the privilege to represent.   The gentleman mentioned the records center not wanting to--worried  about danger. Well, our veterans didn't worry about danger when they  went to protect our freedom and our way of life.   I am glad to be joined by my great friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania, Representative Kelly.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for making a very  valid point, that the rest of America is going back to work and doing  what they need to do at full capacity, working at 100 percent. To have  a government agency working at 45 percent, as the gentleman pointed  out, for those who have done so much for us is unacceptable. I  appreciate his help with this.   I also look forward to hearing what my great colleague and friend  from Wisconsin has to say.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, so  very well put, that we have people for which we work that are veterans  that go to work every day, that maybe aren't veterans but taxpayers  that go to work every day and expect our government to work. That is  all we are asking for.   People every day in America go to work, and they produce goods, they  provide services. The Americans that have served, our veterans, and  those that are serving deserve a government that is responsive to the  needs that they have because of what they have earned.   They are not asking for anything special. They are saying: Look, we  have earned these benefits, and to gain access to them, we need you to  do your job.   Who would have thought it would have taken an act of Congress to try  and get them to do their work. It is time that we make sure that the  National Personnel Records Center does its job for our veterans and to  make sure that they have a plan that this never happens again.   We cannot let down our veterans because of some bureaucracy, because  somebody doesn't want to make sure that it runs efficiently and  effectively.                                time  2150    It needs to be done. It needs to be done now.   Madam Speaker, just let me say, we must first and always remember our  veterans and Active Duty military personnel.   Also, I would like to thank my colleagues for their participation  this evening. This is an important issue. It is widespread, and it  transcends party lines.   These are veterans. They are Americans. They are not Republicans;  they are not Democrats. They are Americans, and they are an outstanding  group of Americans.   I notice I was just joined here by a colleague of mine. So before I  close, I will recognize a gentleman I have known for quite some time,  actually a member of the military. When I knew him, he was still a  member of the military, so a veteran then, a good friend of mine, a  great American from Pennsylvania.  [[Page H5870]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Perry, who  said it so very well. These people earned their benefits. Our veterans  earned these benefits. They protected our freedom and way of life. They  didn't question was it too dangerous to go do that job. They went and  did it. They have earned benefits.   What we need to do is we need to make sure that the bureaucrats that  are running this--as he said, it is not the people that get the work  done every day, but it is the managers of the National Personnel  Records Center that need to make sure they do their job and put  together a plan to address the issues, to get our veterans the  necessary records, in a timely fashion, that they need to gain access  to the benefits they have earned.   As I mentioned before, this is an issue that is not a Republican or  Democrat issue. It is an American issue, and it is about helping  Americans. It is about helping Americans who have helped humanity from  around the globe, stood up for freedom, stood on that wall and made  sure we were safe. Now, it is our time to stand up for them and make  sure they get the benefits they have earned.   We all urge the National Archives and Records Administration to  immediately take all steps to address this problem and prevent it from  ever happening again.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
