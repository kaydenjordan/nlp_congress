 Mr. President, is it appropriate to give a speech at this  time?    Mr. President, I wish to begin on the topic of sports  betting.   In May, the Supreme Court cleared the way for any State to legalize  sports betting, which had been prohibited in all but a handful of  States since 1992.   I would like to say upfront, I am not a fan of sports betting. I have  grave concerns about gambling in general and sports betting in  particular. There is no question that sports betting, like other types  of gambling and addictive behavior, has ruined far too many lives. Add  to those deleterious social effects the threat sports betting poses to  the integrity of the game, and we can see why the prohibition on sports  wagering in the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act passed  the Senate 88 to 5. I authored this legislation--and fought tooth and  nail to get it passed--because I knew that without it, sports gambling  would corrupt the integrity of the game.   Despite these views, I am also a realist. With the nearly $5 billion  annually in legal sports wagers in Nevada, plus an estimated $150  billion a year in illegal sports wagers in the United States, we can't  put the genie back in the bottle. Prohibition is not a possibility or a  prudent path forward.   Instead, now that States are free to legalize sports betting, our  goal should be to bring that illegal wagering activity into well- regulated, legal markets that can better protect consumers and the  integrity of sports. As I wrote in Sports Illustrated earlier this  year, ``Sports Betting is Inevitable--Let's Make Sure It's Done  Right.''   To do it right, we need to ensure that State regulatory frameworks  are not a race to the bottom. I firmly believe we need a set of  fundamental Federal standards that will protect the integrity of the  game, that will protect consumers and the sports wagering market.   Since the Supreme Court decision in May, sports betting has been  conspicuously absent from the public dialogue on Capitol Hill. A  hearing on the issue was scheduled by the House Judiciary Committee but  then postponed, and I hope it will be rescheduled so Congress can  explore what a post-PASPA world would look like.   Sports betting implicates a whole host of complex issues, and I have  been diving into those issues as I work toward draft legislation that  will establish some much needed guardrails to protect the integrity of  the game. I am grateful for all the guidance and insight many  stakeholders have provided, and I invite others who are interested to  do the same.   Let me pause for a moment to discuss integrity--a word frequently  used in the sports betting debate but often left undefined. In the  context of sports, integrity is used to describe events that are  recognized as honest and genuine competition. There is a reason  predetermined outcomes in professional wrestling attract a small  fraction of the following enjoyed by baseball, football, basketball,  and other sports. The integrity of sport--the sense that the game is a  real competition free from outside influence--is what attracts fans and  keeps them coming back.   Integrity can be compromised in various ways. Take, for example, the  doping scandals in cycling that took down Lance Armstrong and led fans  to question whether races were won by the best athlete or the rider on  the best drug regimen, but there is no greater threat to sports  integrity than match fixing. There is no question a big payoff in the  sports betting market is the leading reason criminals and cheaters get  involved with match fixing.   This relationship between sports integrity and sports betting,  including match fixing, cannot be ignored. In the world of gambling,  sports betting is a unique product with unique risks. When a casino  patron pulls the handle on a slot machine or rolls the dice at a crap  table, money may change hands, but there is little connection to the  outside world. When a patron places a sports bet, however, there is the  potential--and in far too many cases it has been the reality--that the  sports wagering market is being used to profit off match fixing. There  is a connection, and not always a positive one, between the bets placed  in a casino and the outcome on the field.   The integrity concerns related to sports wagering are nothing new.  For years, billions of dollars in bets have been placed on sports each  year, presenting these very concerns, but the offshore books where the  vast majority of these wagers have been placed are under no obligation  to take steps to mitigate the threats to integrity. As States move to  legalize sports betting and bring that offshore activity into the  regulated market, they should be taking reasonable steps to protect the  integrity of sports and the marketplace. We can, and should, expect  more from the legal operators than those in the illicit market, and  those legal operators are quickly getting in the game. It would be a  mistake to think that seeming disinterest in the issue at the Federal  level has carried over to the States. States, understandably so, seek  legalized sports betting as a way to bring in much needed tax revenue.  It is amazing how quickly things get done when money is a motivator.   At the beginning of May, full-scale sports betting was available only  in Nevada. Today you can also place sports wagers in Delaware, New  Jersey, and Mississippi. Sports betting in West Virginia will  officially launch on September 1. Pennsylvania and Rhode Island may  have sports betting by the end of the year, and more than a dozen other  States have taken steps to move toward legalization. All of this is  progress in just the past 3 months.   Watching this flurry of activity in the States has only underscored  for me the need for some consistent, minimum standards to protect the  integrity of sports and the sports wagering market.   Let's look at a specific example. Who should be allowed to place a  sports wager? Imagine if players or referees were able to place wagers  on games in which they were participating. They certainly have the  ability to influence the outcome, and if players or referees were  betting on the game, there could be reason to question their actions on  the field. How could fans have faith that the outcome is the result of  honest competition and not an intentional effort to get the biggest  payout?   I suspect there is a fairly broad consensus that certain categories  of folks should not be able to place bets on certain events. For  instance, players should not be allowed to place bets, and certainly  not referees. But the  [[Page S5908]]  West Virginia sports-betting regulations approved in June don't say  that. In fact, they leave it to each sports book to decide whose  participation in sports betting might undermine the integrity of a  sports event.   It is odd that this decision would be left to the sports books, such  that an individual may be prohibited from placing the bet at one sports  book in the State but would be permitted to do so at another. The  decision to leave this integrity decision to the sports books is even  more concerning when you consider the potential conflict in the duties  and motivation of the sports books.   Operators certainly want to protect integrity so that they are not  accepting wagers on fixed games, but the West Virginia sports-betting  law also requires sports book operators to ``assist the commission in  maximizing sports wagering revenues.'' How many folks will they really  be turning away to protect the integrity of the game if they are also  under a statutory mandate to maximize the amount of money coming in the  door?   Other States have been more specific on this point but still leave  open questions. Mississippi prohibits only coaches or participants from  betting on a particular event. What is a participant? Does it include  referees? Maybe they are a participant because they are on the field.  But what about an athletic trainer or league executives? While  Mississippi law does not answer that question, New Jersey put in place  robust laws that specifically prohibit athletic trainers and members of  a sport's governing body from placing wagers.   There is nothing wrong with there being differences among the States.  That is the beauty of our Federal system. But it does seem that when it  comes to protecting the integrity of the game and sports-betting  market, there should be some consensus--at least some minimum  standards--about who can place a wager. If States are allowed to fall  behind, those looking to illegally profit off sports betting will  simply migrate to where there are the fewest restrictions.   Protecting the integrity of sports from the dark side of sports  betting is not a theoretical exercise. We are all familiar with the  fixing of the 1919 World Series, Pete Rose's expulsion from baseball,  and points shaving at Boston college. More recently, NBA referee Tim  Donaghy both bet on games that he officiated and passed along tips to  bookies. The qualifying match for this year's World Cup had to be  replayed after the referee was found to have fixed the match. Just last  month, there were signs of possible match fixing in a men's doubles  match at Wimbledon.   As States move to legalize sports wagering, we must seize the  opportunity to put in place world-class measures to protect the  integrity of our sporting events and the sports-betting market. To that  end, an important part of the legislation I will be proposing is  improvements to monitoring and enforcement that will benefit all of the  stakeholders--sports books, regulators, governing bodies, and  consumers.   These are complex issues, but I am happy to announce that much  progress is being made. I look forward to continuing engagement with  stakeholders and in the coming weeks releasing a legislative proposal  to kick-start the much needed sports-betting discussion on Capitol  Hill.                            ____________________     Now I would like to pivot to what would ordinarily be a  subject unrelated to sports--the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to  be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court--but this is no  ordinary nomination. Not only is Judge Kavanaugh an avid sports fan, he  also moonlighted as a sports reporter for the Yale Daily News.   For Democrats looking to evaluate Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of  documents other than his judicial record, his writings about college  sports are apparently a gold mine. Take, for example, Kavanaugh's  account of a midseason game between Yale and Cornell: ``In basketball,  as in few other team sports, it is possible for one person to  completely dominate a game.''   Prominent legal scholar Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor and  adviser to Barack Obama--a friend of mine, actually--strained to make a  connection between this casual observation and Judge Kavanaugh's  judicial philosophy. He noted: ``Kavanaugh's seeming fascination with  single-player domination might be a muscular view of executive power.''  I had a good laugh at this. The idea that Judge Kavanaugh's  observations about basketball somehow reveal his views about Executive  power is beyond absurd.   What is next? What other hidden insights into the nominee's character  can we glean from the most obscure sources? Should we do a deep dive on  Judge Kavanaugh's zodiac sign to see what it might say about his  judicial temperament? He is an Aquarius, by the way, and Mars is in  retrograde. So we all know what that means: Judge Kavanaugh is going to  destroy America. He is going to burn down the Capitol, coronate himself  King, and make confetti of the Constitution. The stars are literally  aligned for this man to usher in Armageddon. The real question is, How  am I the only one seeing this? Why hasn't The New Yorker written a  think piece about it already?   It should go without saying that if you really want to understand  Judge Kavanaugh's view on the constitutional separation of powers, you  won't find it by reading sports articles from a college newspaper, and  you won't find it by reading his wife's work emails; you will find it  by reading Judge Kavanaugh's actual opinions as a Federal judge. Of  course, Democrats know this, but like a kid procrastinating his  homework--playing video games and microwaving Bagel Bites--they are  looking for any distraction at all to avoid actually analyzing Judge  Kavanaugh's judicial record. That is because Democrats know what they  will find when they do: a nominee who is indisputably qualified for the  Supreme Court.   When my friends on the other side of the aisle decide they are done  procrastinating and actually want to examine his judicial record on  separation of powers issues, I would point them to Judge Kavanaugh's  opinions in three cases I highlighted here on the Senate floor earlier  this month: Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Oversight Board,  Loving v. Internal Revenue Service, and PHH Corporation v. CFPB.   Once you have gone through Judge Kavanaugh's highly regarded opinions  and sterling record and concluded, as I have, that he is eminently  qualified and possesses the judicial temperament and ability to be a  great Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, you will by all means turn to  his college sports writing for a little light reading. You are sure to  walk away with insight into the championship prospect of Yale's  basketball and football teams in the 1980s; I just wouldn't hold out  for any insight into his judicial philosophy.   While we are on the subject of documents outside his judicial record,  I am surprised Democrats have yet to mention Professor Kavanaugh's  student evaluations. The evaluations may not predict how Judge  Kavanaugh would rule on hot-button issues, but they do add actual  substance to the mountain of evidence that Judge Kavanaugh is, as 80 of  his former students described him, ``a rigorous thinker, a devoted  teacher, and a gracious person.'' Notably, the evaluations reveal that  Judge Kavanaugh was fair and balanced in the classroom--the opposite of  the partisan hack some are now trying to make him out to be. One  student wrote that ``Judge Kavanaugh's presentation seemed very  evenhanded.'' Another said that he ``presented the other side quite  well, even though he likely shared most of those conservative views,''  adding that ``many of the Harvard Law School professors could learn  from his acceptance of views across the political spectrum.''   I am looking forward to Judge Kavanaugh's public confirmation  hearings--now just 12 days away--where his judicial record on  substantive legal issues will take center stage. That is what matters.  But those things that are not front and center, be they his student  evaluations or college sports reports, remind us that there is more to  Judge Kavanaugh than his professional record and accomplishments, and  they remind us that he is exactly the kind of standup person we should  want on the Supreme Court.  [[Page S5909]]    Of course, you wouldn't guess that judging by the way Democrats and  the media have treated him over the past few weeks. For example,  earlier this week, one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  said she would cancel her meeting with the nominee, which, of course,  she is free to do. What media reports ignored was that this same  Senator had announced her resolute opposition before any nominee was  even announced. Talk about jumping the gun.   In an effort to stir up social media controversy, another colleague  of mine suggested in dark and gloomy terms that the Judiciary  chairman's use of committee confidentiality was some nefarious tool to  hide salacious details about the nominee. In doing so, he neglected to  inform the tens of thousands who retweeted his misleading message that  committee confidentiality is, in fact, a common practice that has been  used by past chairmen from both parties.   Before our friends in the media report these disingenuous claims,  they should apply rigorous fact-checking to see if Democrats are  telling the truth or simply crying wolf to whip up their base.                            ____________________     Finally, I would like to say just a few words about  criminal justice reform. We have been at an impasse since the Judiciary  Committee took up the issue earlier this year, but recent reports  suggest that negotiations with the White House may soon lead to a  compromise. I have not been a part of those negotiations, and I  understand that they are still ongoing and there is no final proposal  on the table, but I am concerned that there is no mention of mens rea  reform being included in that deal.   Sentencing and prison reform can do only so much if we continue to  allow individuals to be sent to prison for conduct they did not know  was unlawful, even when Congress does not specify that their crimes  should be strict liability offenses.   Sentencing and prison reform must be paired with a solution that  addresses the root problem of criminalization, which includes the lack  of clear mens rea requirements in much of our criminal law. My Mens Rea  Reform Act of 2018, which I introduced earlier this summer with Senate  Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, provides that solution. It is  supported by a broad range of groups from across the ideological  spectrum, from the American Conservative Union to the National  Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.   To be honest, I am troubled that the bill is not part of the current  negotiations. I am likewise troubled that we have not heard any  discussion of a legislative fix for the Armed Career Criminal Act to  ensure that dangerous, repeat offenders receive appropriately long  prison sentences. Real criminal justice reform should be about getting  the policy right. That means we cannot be looking just to ratchet back  prison sentences, but we must also be looking to close loopholes that  prematurely let armed, dangerous criminals back on the streets.   Comprehensive criminal justice reform is long overdue, and I am  pleased to hear that negotiations are continuing. I look forward to  working with my colleagues to address those concerns.   I apologize to the leader for taking so long on these remarks.   I yield the floor.
