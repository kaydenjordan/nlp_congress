 Mr. Speaker, NASA is known for hiring the brightest  and most adept people in the world to execute the functions of space  exploration and research. I am proud to recognize some of their  youngest employees, who work not out of Houston, Texas, but from  Council Rock High School South in Pennsylvania.   Council Rock South is one of 125 schools in the Nation, and the only  school in Pennsylvania, that participate in a unique program that  enables students to develop projects that ultimately could be used by  NASA itself. Indeed, NASA is currently working on one of the projects  that originated from Council Rock South several years prior: a  vibration isolation chamber that would protect fertilized eggs.   I applaud these students for their contributions and would like to  thank the technology education teacher, Fred Bauer, for the guidance  and direction he provides these impressive young women and men.                            ____________________
