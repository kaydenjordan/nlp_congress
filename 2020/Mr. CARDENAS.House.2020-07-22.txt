 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this hour to honor one of the  most beautiful human beings that ever walked this Earth. Many of us  believe in God, and many of us try to be the best that we can be, but  few of us are capable and able to live a life of true love and of  tremendous dignity and respect for every single person who comes our  way.   I wish I could learn how to turn my cheek the way John Lewis proved  he could and did.   I mourn his passing, but I celebrate the honor of knowing that he  lived and also knowing that I could go to him on the floor of this  House or in the hallways of Congress and speak with him, learn from  him, and then say ``I love you, brother,'' and then to have him tell  me--and I selfishly relished the opportunity to hear him say it--``I  love you too, brother,'' as I gave him a hug and he hugged me back.   I am unfortunate that I grew up in a very strict household where my  mother and father only said ``I love you'' to the big boys and girls  and adults very few times. Once we got off their knee, it just didn't  happen very often. But John Lewis reminded me how much I missed that,  and in a selfish way, that is one of the reasons why I always rushed to  him and asked him, by saying ``I love you,'' to know that he would say  ``I love you'' and with all his heart mean it.   I am going to miss him. Some of my family members were fortunate to  meet him and to know him, and I feel blessed to know that he was my  friend as well.   May he rest in peace.
