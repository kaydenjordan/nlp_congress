The sense of Congress is the following:        (1) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund       (the ``CDFI Fund'') is an agency of the Department of the       Treasury, and was established by the Riegle Community       Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The       mission of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity       for underserved people and communities by supporting the       growth and capacity of a national network of community       development lenders, investors, and financial service       providers''. A community development financial institution (a       ``CDFI'') is a specialized financial institution serving low-      income communities and a Community Development Entity (a       ``CDE'') is a domestic corporation or partnership that is an       intermediary vehicle for the provision of loans, investments,       or financial counseling in low-income communities. The CDFI       Fund certifies CDFIs and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or       CDE allows organizations to participate in various CDFI Fund       programs as follows:        (A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, which provides FDIC-      insured depository institutions awards for a demonstrated       increase in lending and investments in distressed communities       and CDFIs.        (B) The CDFI Program, which provides Financial and       Technical Assistance awards to CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI,       and to build the capacity of the CDFI, including financing       product development and loan loss reserves.        (C) The Native American CDFI Assistance Program, which       provides CDFIs and sponsoring entities Financial and       Technical Assistance awards to increase lending and grow the       number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to help build       capacity of such CDFIs.        (D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, which provides tax       credits for making equity investments in CDEs that stimulate       capital investments in low-income communities.        (E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides awards to CDFIs       and nonprofit affordable housing organizations to finance       affordable housing solutions and related economic development       activities.        (F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of long-term,       patient capital for CDFIs to expand lending and investment       capacity for community and economic development purposes.        (2) The Department of the Treasury is authorized to create       multi-year grant programs designed to encourage low-to-      moderate income individuals to establish accounts at       federally insured banks, and to improve low-to-moderate       income individuals' access to such accounts on reasonable       terms.        (3) Under this authority, grants to participants in CDFI       Fund programs may be used for loan-loss reserves and to       establish small-dollar loan programs by subsidizing related       losses. These grants also allow for the providing recipients       with the financial counseling and education necessary to       conduct transactions and manage their accounts. These loans       provide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other       nontraditional forms of financing that often impose excessive       interest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead millions of       Americans to fall into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can       only be made pursuant to terms, conditions, and practices       that are reasonable for the individual consumer obtaining the       loan.        (4) Program participation is restricted to eligible       institutions, which are limited to organizations listed in       section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and exempt       from tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured       depository institutions, community development financial       institutions and State, local, or Tribal government entities.        (5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has awarded over       $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, allocated $54,000,000,000       in tax credits,  [[Page H4598]]       and $1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. According to the CDFI       Fund, some programs attract as much as $10 in private capital       for every $1 invested by the CDFI Fund. The Administration       and the Congress should prioritize appropriation of funds for       the loan loss reserve fund and technical assistance programs       administered by the Community Development Financial       Institution Fund.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 5322, the Ensuring Diversity in  Community Banking Act of 2019. I would like to thank Mr. Meeks, the  chairman of the Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions  Subcommittee for his leadership on this important issue.   For over 22 years I have worked and watched Mr. Meeks as he has  devoted prodigious quantities of his time and his considerable talents  to the matters of the Financial Services Committee, and H.R. 5322  reflects that kind of skill and effort.   The Financial Services Committee under the chairmanship of Ms. Waters  and Chairman Meeks of the subcommittee have prioritized examining the  important role of minority depository institutions, MDIs, and the role  they play in our financial system, and we have worked on developing  policies to support their efforts.   Over the course of a series of hearings in this Congress, the  committee has engaged with bank and credit union CEOs, with consumer  groups, with experts and regulators all about how Congress can help or  reverse the decline in our Nation's minority depository institutions,  MDIs, particularly Black-owned banks.   This is important because the data shows that MDIs serve the credit  needs of low-income areas and serve them well and that these areas have  a high percentage of the unbanked and underbanked.   Unfortunately, these institutions have shrunk in numbers in recent  years. The number peaked in 2008 at 215 MDI banks. Now that number is  at just 143 MDI banks as of the second quarter of 2020, representing  less than 3 percent of all FDIC-insured institutions.   In 2008 we had 41 Black-owned banks, and today we have 18. This calls  for congressional action.   Furthermore, during this pandemic, low-income and minority  communities have been hit the hardest. MDIs along with community  development financial institutions, CDFIs, have delivered relief to  these low-income communities during this pandemic. After Chairwoman  Waters and the other members of this committee fought hard to ensure  that MDIs and CDFIs could participate in the Paycheck Protection  Program, MDIs and CDFIs were able to provide some $16 billion of loans  to over 220,000 small businesses and minority-owned businesses across  the country.   But Congress must do more to support these institutions. Toward that  end, H.R. 5322 provides a series of reforms that will preserve, grow,  and encourage the chartering of new MDIs, as well as promote the  effective engagement between MDIs and prudential regulators.   This bill will encourage investments in MDIs, in part by  strengthening a minority bank deposit program so that Treasury deposits  Federal funds, funds which it manages in MDIs, thus providing MDIs with  more funds that they can then lend.   Furthermore, the bill encourages more partnerships between MDIs and  large banks through the Department of Treasury's mentor-protege  program, which should promote information sharing and more investments  in MDIs.   The bill also creates a new category of small banks called ``impact  banks'' that provide most of their lending to  [[Page H4601]]  low-income borrowers and would also benefit from some of the bill's  provisions to ensure that we can do all we can to support low-income  and minority communities.   We also appreciate the collaboration demonstrated by ranking member  of the full committee Mr. McHenry and other committee Republicans, as  this bill was voted out of the committee in December by a unanimous  vote of 52-0.   This bill has broad support, including from the National Bankers  Association, the Independent Community Bankers of America, the American  Bankers Association, the Credit Union National Association, and the  National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 5322, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   MDIs face several challenges, including the ability to raise capital  despite overall strong financial performance. They face challenges  experienced as a result of servicing communities that are often first  and hardest hit by economic downcycles. This decline is contributing to  a growing incidence of banking deserts in minority communities.   This bill will help turn this dangerous tide so that individuals in  more ZIP Codes will have access to safe banking.   I again thank Mr. Meeks for authoring this legislation and for all of  his dedication to the Financial Services Committee. I also thank  Chairwoman  [[Page H4602]]  Waters and Ranking Member McHenry and the other members of the  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 5322, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6934) to amend the CARES Act to require the uniform  treatment of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  under certain programs carried out in response to the COVID-19  emergency, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6934         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Uniform Treatment of NRSROs       Act''.       SEC. 2. UNIFORM TREATMENT OF NRSROS.         (a) In General.--Section 4003 of the CARES Act (15 U.S.C.       9042), as amended by section 902, is further amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(m) Uniform Treatment of NRSROs.--        ``(1) In general.--If, in carrying out this section or any       other program making use of a facility established under       section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act in response to the       COVID-19 emergency, the Secretary of the Treasury or the       Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System establishes       a requirement for an entity, security, or other instrument to       carry a minimum credit rating, the Secretary or the Board of       Governors shall accept credit ratings provided by any       nationally recognized statistical rating organization with       respect to such entity, security, or other instrument, if the       nationally recognized statistical rating organization is       registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to       issue credit ratings with respect to the applicable asset       class of the entity, security, or other instrument.        ``(2) Exception.--        ``(A) In general.--The Secretary or the Board of Governors       may exclude a nationally recognized statistical rating       organization from the application of paragraph (1) if, in       consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the       Secretary or Board of Governors, as applicable, determines       that the nationally recognized statistical rating       organization is unable to provide reliable and accurate       ratings for a particular asset class and that such exclusion       is in the public interest.        ``(B) Report.--If the Secretary or the Board of Governors       excludes a nationally recognized statistical rating       organization from the application of paragraph (1) pursuant       to subparagraph (A), the Secretary or Board of Governors, as       applicable, shall, as soon as practicable after such       exclusion, disclose to the public the reasoning for such       exclusion.        ``(3) Nationally recognized statistical rating       organization.--In this subsection, the term `nationally       recognized statistical rating organization' has the meaning       given that term under section 3 of the Securities Exchange       Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c).''.        (b) GAO Study.--        (1) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States       shall carry out a study on--        (A) the quality of credit ratings across nationally       recognized statistical ratings organizations (as defined       under section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934),       including during the 2008 economic crisis;        (B) the effect of competition on the quality of credit       ratings and on the ability of small- and mid-size companies       and financial institutions to access the capital markets; and        (C) the implementation of the amendment made by subsection       (a).        (2) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall issue a       report to the Congress containing all finding and       determinations made in carrying out the study required under       paragraph (1).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6934, the Uniform Treatment of  NRSROs, which is sponsored by Congresswoman Dean from Pennsylvania.   This important legislation from Congresswoman Dean will ensure that  qualified issuers have fair access to lending facilities, and it will  ensure that these facilities are granted on clear terms.   This is not a time where agencies such as the Federal Reserve should  just make it up as they go along, especially when these policies  disproportionately harm small and mid-sized companies. Thus, my  colleague, Ms. Dean, introduced, and I was pleased to cosponsor,  legislation to provide clarity in the lending process by ensuring that  nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, also referred  to as NRSROs, are treated uniformly.   More specifically, the Federal Reserve and Treasury often require a  credit rating to apply for participation in a lending facility. When  there is such a requirement, the Federal Reserve has, at times,  required that the rating be issued by a specific credit rating agency  or has required that the rating be from a specific category of NRSROs,  such as the so-called major NRSROs.   Often, these categories are self-created by the Federal Reserve and  have been undefined and unclear to issuers. These requirements act as  an obstacle between issuers and these lending facilities. This clearly  was not Congress' intent, as it goes against Dodd-Frank, which mandates  that we foster competition among NRSROs rather than trying to make sure  that companies rely only on an oligarchy of three NRSROs.   As chair of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets, I am quite familiar with the  work that has been done in the last decade to end overreliance on the  big three credit agencies, which led us into the 2008 crisis. It is  those big three that gave AAA ratings to Alt-A lendings, which I  believe is what caused the 2008 crisis.   Decisions by the Fed and Treasury with respect to many lending  facilities have threatened to undo our work to try to diversify the  availability of different NRSROs.   H.R. 6934, which is limited to facilities which have been stood up in  response to the COVID-19 pandemic, will set clear credit rating  standards for both the Federal Reserve and its issuers. It also  clarifies Congress' intent and will ensure that its legislative  objectives are carried out at the agency level.   Most importantly, however, the legislation will result in more  issuers having access to these lending facilities, an important  objective during this pandemic and economic downturn, while it will  still ensure that there are standards in effect that will adequately  protect the facility and the interests of the taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate Congresswoman Dean's leadership in  bringing forth this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again would like to thank my colleague from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) for introducing, supporting, and, in effect,  passing this legislation here today. It will help qualified issuers  have access to lending facilities; it will ensure that that access to  facilities is granted on terms that are clear; and it will ensure that  Congress' legislative intent is carried out and is consistent with the  policy of Congress that we have focused on in the Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee to make sure that we  are not overly reliant on just three credit rating agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7592) to require the Comptroller General of the United  States to carry out a study on trafficking, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7592         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Trafficking,       Illicit Flows, Laundering, and Exploitation Act of 2020'' or       the ``STIFLE Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Trafficking is a national-security threat and an       economic drain of our resources.        (2) As the U.S. Department of the Treasury's recently       released ``2020 National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and       Other Illicit Financing'' concludes, ``While money       laundering, terrorism financing, and WMD proliferation       financing differ qualitatively and quantitatively, the       illicit actors engaging in these activities can exploit the       same vulnerabilities and financial channels.''.        (3) Among those are bad actors engaged in trafficking,       whether they trade in drugs, arms, cultural property,       wildlife, natural resources, counterfeit goods, organs, or,       even, other humans.        (4) Their illegal (or ``dark'') markets use similar and       sometimes related or overlapping methods and means to       acquire, move, and profit from their crimes.        (5) In a March 2017, report from Global Financial       Integrity, ``Transnational Crime and the Developing World'',       the global business of transnational crime was valued at $1.6       trillion to $2.2 trillion annually, resulting in crime,       violence, terrorism, instability, corruption, and lost tax       revenues worldwide.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.         (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States       shall carry out a study on--        (1) the major trafficking routes used by transnational       criminal organizations, terrorists, and others, and to what       extent the trafficking routes for people (including       children), drugs, weapons, cash, child sexual exploitation       materials, or other illicit goods are similar, related, or       cooperative;        (2) commonly used methods to launder and move the proceeds       of trafficking;        (3) the types of suspicious financial activity that are       associated with illicit trafficking networks, and how       financial institutions identify and report such activity;        (4) the nexus between the identities and finances of       trafficked persons and fraud;        (5) the tools, guidance, training, partnerships,       supervision, or other mechanisms that Federal agencies,       including the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes       Enforcement Network, the Federal financial regulators, and       law enforcement, provide to help financial institutions       identify techniques and patterns of transactions that may       involve the proceeds of trafficking;        (6) what steps financial institutions are taking to detect       and prevent bad actors who are laundering the proceeds of       illicit trafficking, including data analysis, policies,       training procedures, rules, and guidance;        (7) what role gatekeepers, such as lawyers, notaries,       accountants, investment advisors, logistics agents, and trust       and company service providers, play in facilitating       trafficking networks and the laundering of illicit proceeds;       and        (8) the role that emerging technologies, including       artificial intelligence, digital identity technologies,       blockchain technologies, virtual assets, and related       exchanges and online marketplaces, and other innovative       technologies, can play in both assisting with and potentially       enabling the laundering of proceeds from trafficking.        (b) Consultation.--In carrying out the study required under       subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall solicit       feedback and perspectives to the extent practicable from       survivor and victim advocacy organizations, law enforcement,       research organizations, private-sector organizations       (including financial institutions and data and technology       companies), and any other organization or entity that the       Comptroller General determines appropriate.        (c) Report.--The Comptroller General shall issue one or       more reports to the Congress containing the results of the       study required under subsection (a). The first report shall       be issued not later than the end of the 15-month period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. The       reports shall contain--  [[Page H4604]]         (1) all findings and determinations made in carrying out       the study required under subsection (a); and        (2) recommendations for any legislative or regulatory       changes necessary to combat trafficking or the laundering of       proceeds from trafficking.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7592, the Stopping  Trafficking, Illicit Flows, Laundering, and Exploitation Act of 2020,  the STIFLE Act, introduced by Representatives McAdams and Gonzalez.   This bill would commission the Government Accountability Office to  study and analyze the converging attributes of transnational  trafficking networks. These shared or overlapping characteristics and  methods, such as supply chains, facilitators, or gatekeepers, and the  movement of finances make it possible for traffickers in a host of  different areas to move their illicit proceeds and evade detection.   By better understanding the ``business models'' that underlie these  networks, we can better combat their terrible acts in a host of  different areas, ranging from selling illicit drugs to trafficking in  modern slavery. We have focused on illicit trafficking--human  trafficking, drug trafficking, et cetera--in the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the members of the Financial Services  Committee for focusing on this issue, since the linchpin, the Achilles  heel, of many of these trafficking networks is their financial  movements, their access to the financial system, and this may be the  way to accomplish an awful lot to stop this illicit trafficking.   The STIFLE Act is part of the House Financial Services Committee's  bipartisan Counter-Trafficking Initiative, introduced in March to  address this pervasive issue that is a threat to all of our  constituents and communities.   Human trafficking, drug trafficking, wildlife trafficking, and the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are just a few examples of  the illicit markets that generate an estimated $2.2 trillion, annually.  The resulting proceeds and instability benefit bad actors, while  threatening the environment, civil society, individuals on our streets,  our economy, our national security, and, of course, the human rights of  so many thousands of people who are trafficked around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McAdams and Mr. Gonzalez for introducing  this bill to help identify concrete opportunities for action to combat  these criminals and terrorists who engage in this illicit trade by  focusing on our financial system. For these reasons, I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 7592.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. McAdams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, understanding the business of trafficking--  [[Page H4605]]  whether it be illicit drugs, whether it be human trafficking, whether  it be terrorism, et cetera--is fundamental to stopping transnational  crime, and the harm that it causes and the victims it creates in  communities worldwide.   The House Financial Services Committee's bipartisan Counter- Trafficking Initiative is a comprehensive approach to this challenge  and is a very important adjunct to the Foreign Affairs Committee's work  to stop illicit trafficking, particularly human trafficking.   We need to examine these illicit networks as a whole, whether they  engage in narcotics, timber, endangered species, rare earths, or,  tragically, human trafficking of men and women--modern slavery.   So I look forward to all of the committees of this Congress focusing  on these criminal traffickers. H.R. 7592, the STIFLE Act, is a  significant piece of that effort, tapping into the knowledge from  survivor and victim advocacy organizations, law enforcement,  regulators, research organizations, and the private sector to be able  to focus on the financial system and make sure that we keep these  traffickers at bay and out of the financial system as much as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which  is an important step to protecting our citizens, our economy, and our  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6735) to establish the Consumer and Investor Fraud Working  Group to help protect consumers and investors from fraud during the  COVID-19 pandemic, to assist consumers and investors affected by such  fraud, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6735         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Fraud Prevention       Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSUMER AND INVESTOR FRAUD WORKING GROUP.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than the end of the 30-day       period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the       Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and       the Securities and Exchange Commission shall, jointly,       establish a working group to be known as the ``Consumer and       Investor Fraud Working Group'' (the ``Working Group'').        (b) Duties.--The Working Group shall facilitate       collaboration between the Bureau of Consumer Financial       Protection and the Securities and Exchange Commission on--        (1) providing resources to consumers and investors to avoid       fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic;        (2) providing resources, including information on the       availability of legal aid resources, to consumers and       investors who have been adversely impacted by such fraud; and        (3) such other topics as the Working Group determines       appropriate.        (c) Coordination With Other Agencies.--In carrying out the       duties described under subsection (b), the Working Group       shall coordinate and collaborate with other Federal and State       government agencies, as appropriate.        (d) Quarterly Report.--The Working Group shall issue a       quarterly report to the Committee on Financial Services of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on the progress of       the Working Group and summarizing--        (1) the resources made publicly available to consumers by       the Working Group;        (2) any public enforcement action taken jointly or       individually by any member of the Working Group;        (3) the number and description of consumer complaints       received by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and       the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding fraud       related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and        (4) any other actions of the Working Group.        (e) Sunset.--This section shall cease to have any force or       effect on and after December 31, 2021.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the gentleman from Utah on the passage  of his bill, and I rise to support H.R. 6735, the COVID-19 Fraud  Prevention Act, which is authored and put forward by Congresswoman  Cindy Axne.   I support this legislation and I thank my colleague from Iowa for her  leadership in bringing it forward. Congresswoman Axne's legislation  will mark a major step in improving efforts to protect consumers and  investors alike by requiring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  the CFPB, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, to  establish a joint working group with the purpose of addressing and  preventing predatory and deceptive financial practices during this  COVID-19 crisis.   Under this bill, this joint CFPB-SEC working group will be required  to consult and collaborate with other Federal and State agencies, where  appropriate, to ensure fraud does not slip through the cracks during  this COVID-19 pandemic and appropriately report their efforts to  Congress.   As we know, unfortunately, in times of uncertainty like the one we  face today, predatory actors can and have sought to take advantage of  confusion and financial vulnerability, and to take advantage even of  desperation from struggling consumers and struggling homeowners who  need help. These actors cause even further damage to communities that  are already hit by the crisis of the pandemic and the economic  downturn.   The 2008 crisis is an example of how much financial devastation that  predatory and deceitful actors can wreak on our communities, especially  when Federal regulators don't have the tools to cooperate and put a  stop to it. Families that are still impacted by that phase of  unchecked, toxic lending now have yet another crisis to contend to as  we must deal with the COVID crisis.   As chair of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets, I note that investors, too, are  at risk of being defrauded and mislead by fraudulent investment  schemes.   As during other times of crises, investors are at risk of being  defrauded and mislead by so-called investment opportunities claiming to  have some novel information, cures, or vaccines, but are really part of  a pump-and-dump scheme where fraudsters intentionally use false and  misleading information to boost the price of a stock or other  investment and then sell the shares when the stock rises but before the  manipulation is detected.   Congresswoman Axne's legislation will help ensure that the CFPB and  the SEC, as well as other Federal and State agencies they work with,  will work collaboratively to identify problematic patterns and work to  prevent future schemes where consumers and investors get ripped off.   I commend Mrs. Axne for her work in drafting this legislation, and if  I may be a little premature, I also commend the gentlewoman on getting  this legislation passed through the House today.   I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.  [[Page H4606]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his work  on all of these bills and his work here today.   In closing, Congress must do more to ensure that communities are  protected from deceitful actors during the COVID-19 period. As we have  seen in our immediate past, bad actors often try to take advantage of  people in crisis and the consequences can be significant unless the  Federal Government, working with the States, actively monitors and  prevents such deceitful practices.   H.R. 6735 will encourage key regulators to share information and work  together to identify scams while keeping Congress informed as to how  these agencies are addressing fraud during the pandemic.   This bill has the support of consumer and investor advocate  organizations including: Americans for Financial Reform, Center for  Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of America, National Consumer  Law Center, and Public Citizen.   I would like to thank the author of this bill, Representative Axne,  for her efforts. I urge all Members to support H.R. 6735, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5698) to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct  the United States Executive Directors at the international financial  institutions on United States policy regarding international financial  institution assistance with respect to advanced wireless technologies.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5698         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Secure 5G Act of       2020''.       SEC. 2. UNITED STATES POLICY REGARDING INTERNATIONAL                     FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ASSISTANCE WITH RESPECT                     TO ADVANCED WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury (in this       section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall instruct the       United States Executive Director at each international       financial institution (as defined in section 1701(c)(2) of       the International Financial Institutions Act) that it is the       policy of the United States to--        (1) support assistance by the institution with respect to       advanced wireless technologies (such as 5th generation       wireless technology for digital cellular networks and related       technologies) only if the technologies provide appropriate       security for users;        (2) proactively encourage assistance with respect to       infrastructure or policy reforms that facilitate the use of       secure advanced wireless technologies; and        (3) cooperate, to the maximum extent practicable, with       member states of the institution, particularly with United       States allies and partners, in order to strengthen       international support for such technologies.        (b) Waiver Authority.--The Secretary may waive subsection       (a) on a case-by-case basis, on reporting to the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the       waiver--        (1) will allow the United States to effectively promote the       objectives of the policy described in subsection (a); or        (2) is in the national interest of the United States, with       an explanation of the reasons therefor.        (c) Progress Report.--The Chairman of the National Advisory       Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies       shall include in the annual report required by section 1701       of the International Financial Institutions Act a description       of progress made toward advancing the policy described in       subsection (a) of this section.        (d) Sunset.--The preceding provisions of this section shall       have no force or effect after the earlier of--        (1) the date that is 7 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act; or        (2) the date that the Secretary reports to the committees       specified in subsection (b) that terminating the       effectiveness of the provisions is important to the national       interest of the United States, with a detailed explanation of       the reasons therefor.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous materials thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5698, the Promoting Secure 5G  Act of 2020, which establishes that at the international financial  institutions, known as IFIs, such as the World Bank, it will be U.S.  policy that supports the financing for advanced wireless communication  technologies, including next-generation 5G networks only if the  technologies to be financed provide adequate security for users.   Cybersecurity has been an important concern of this House, and it is  an important concern of this country. We see that in the recent action  taken with regard to TikTok, we see that in the steps that this House  is taking with regard to cybersecurity, and it makes sense that our  voice and vote at the international financial institutions be used to  ensure that the world moves forward with secure 5G networks.   This legislation establishes a U.S. position at the IFIs in support  of infrastructure or policy reforms that facilitate the use of secure  advanced wireless technologies, and it encourages U.S. cooperation with  our allies and partners to strengthen international support for such  secure technologies.   I support this legislation because I think it reflects a good policy  goal and a good example of how central international cooperation is for  our own economic and national security goals.   This legislation seeks to use our voice at the IFIs to counter  China's efforts to expands its 5G influence internationally and to  expand the use of Chinese technology with back doors and other devices  that can be used by the Chinese Communist Party. This is especially  important with regard to developing countries. By placing an important  strategic U.S. policy goal within the system of the international  financial institutions, this legislation recognizes that sustained  international  [[Page H4607]]  cooperation is important for advancing a range of U.S. economic  security and foreign policy interest, and I welcome that recognition.   5G is the next generation of wireless communications networks. It may  very well be the most extraordinary remaking of the system, controls,  and use of the airwaves that make up today's internet since the  internet first came into existence. 5G networks, we are told, will  transform the way we live.   In the global race for 5G, where the U.S. and China are among the  main contenders, the competition is fierce, and from that frame  certainly the core of this bill's proposal--to have the international  financial institutions support 5G infrastructure only if it is from  trusted vendors--makes sense. We would not want to see this kind of  policy cause problems for the missions of the IFIs if they get further  caught up in any rivalry between the United States and China. But if  our money is involved in these international financial institutions,  then it needs to be American policy that those funds be used only to  finance secure 5G networks.   That said, the success of such a U.S. policy at the IFIs will depend  in large part on the state of U.S. leadership worldwide not only in  those institutions but around the world. Let's face it. Over the last 3  years America has squandered its role as a world leader, and we have  stretched almost to the breaking point our alliances with our  traditional allies.   I look forward to working with everyone in Congress over the next few  years to recement our international alliances and put us in a position  so that when we speak at the international financial institutions that  we are listened to as a world leader and not mocked as a nation that  has one tweet one day and another tweet another day.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the passage of this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5798.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from South Carolina for  authoring this legislation. Also, again, I commend him for spending  time this afternoon to pass all the legislation that is here before us.   Mr. Speaker, the United States has often looked to the international  financial institutions to meet strategic objectives at critical  moments, and this legislation is a good example of that.   The World Bank and others are currently focused on helping developing  nations deal with the coronavirus, but soon, they will return to other  development goals. The basic principle of this legislation is important  because it establishes not only what U.S. policy is going to be in a  particular area, but it also directs the administration to pursue that  policy. It provides flexibility in the implementation of that policy  and keeps Congress informed.   It is important to keep in mind that our ability to influence the  direction of the IFIs, the international financial institutions, and to  prioritize global objectives in the areas that we think are critically  important depend in large part on the degree to which the United States  maintains and exercises strong leadership in these international  financial institutions and in the world writ large.   We on the Foreign Affairs Committee have focused on the importance of  rebuilding our relationships and rebuilding America's status and  leadership in the world, and we will only be as effective in carrying  out the intent of this legislation as we are in rehabilitating  America's image.   For U.S. policy to be effectively advanced in the international  financial institutions, other member states at these institutions need  to believe that the policies we pursue are not based exclusively out of  a narrow self-interest but are policies that will help the entire world  move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6294) to require data sharing regarding protecting the  homeless from coronavirus, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6294         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Emergency Disease       Response via Housing Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. DATA SHARING BETWEEN HUD AND HHS.         (a) In General.--For the purpose of increasing the ability       of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to target       outreach to populations vulnerable to contracting       coronavirus, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development       shall share with the Secretary of Health and Human Services       information regarding the location of projects for supportive       housing for the elderly assisted under section 202 of the       Housing  [[Page H4608]]       Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. 1701q) and the location of Continuums       of Care with high concentration of unsheltered homelessness.        (b) Removal of Personally Identifiable Information.--In       sharing the information required under subsection (a), the       Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall ensure that       appropriate administrative and physical safeguards are in       place to remove all personally identifiable information.        (c) Consultation.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban       Development shall consult with the Secretary of Health and       Human Services promptly after the date of the enactment of       this Act to provide for the sharing of the information       required under subsection (a).        (d) Limitation.--Information shared pursuant to this Act       shall not be shared beyond the Department of Health and Human       Services or used for purposes beyond those intended in the       Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6294, the Improving Emergency  Disease Response via Housing Act, which will help the Federal  Government better identify and serve populations particularly at risk  from COVID-19.   This bill will require the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, HUD, to share with the Department of Health and Human  Services the locations of HUD senior housing properties and local  continuums of care with high concentrations of people experiencing  unsheltered homelessness. The bill also includes important protections  to ensure people's privacy and to prevent the misuse of this  information.   Early in this pandemic, we learned the devastating impact COVID-19  has on seniors. Seniors often have underlying health conditions, which  make them particularly vulnerable to the virus. Making matters worse,  many seniors live in large multifamily buildings, including HUD- subsidized properties, where the risk of contagion is particularly  high.   This constellation of factors--close living quarters, advanced age,  higher prevalence of underlying health conditions--puts this population  at substantial risk for contracting and at a higher risk for dying from  COVID-19.   According to The New York Times, as of last month, 40 percent of  COVID-19-related deaths have occurred in senior communities, not just  to those who have reached senior age but that subset of seniors who  live in these senior communities.   People experiencing homelessness are also particularly vulnerable to  COVID-19 because they are disproportionately likely to have underlying  conditions and because they often do not have the means to follow CDC  guidelines around handwashing, social distancing, mask-wearing, et  cetera.   People experiencing homelessness who contract COVID-19 are twice as  likely to be hospitalized, two to four times as likely to require  critical care, and two to three times as likely to die as others in the  general public.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tipton for introducing this bill to help  us better protect some of this country's most vulnerable people, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank my colleague, Mr. Tipton, for  introducing this bill to help us better protect seniors and people  experiencing homelessness from COVID-19.   We have lost too many people to this terrible virus. While it is  important that we ensure the safety of those who are particularly  vulnerable to the coronavirus, I hope that we can all work together  this month to provide a comprehensive response to this public crisis,  modeled after the HEROES Act, which this House passed in May of this  year.   Our constituents want us to act on major legislation, but in the  meantime, it is good to pass this bill to help those who are  particularly impacted by COVID.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
