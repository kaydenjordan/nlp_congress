 Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 111.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we are having a very interesting and,  obviously, intense debate tonight about arbitration clauses in  financial contracts. Those who oppose the resolution that is on the  floor tonight would have you think that the battle is over whether or  not to stop what they call forced arbitration clauses in contracts.   The real issue is whether we will try to force the resolution of  disputes in financial resolution into class action lawsuits. This is a  question about whether we should force dispute resolution mechanisms  into class actions. In fact, let me read the actual language of the  rule that we are debating. It doesn't say anything about forced  arbitration clauses. In fact, the rule doesn't stop arbitration clauses  in contracts. It stops protections in arbitration clauses against class  action litigation. Let's read what the actual rule says: The CFPB rule  prohibits a company from relying in any way on a predispute arbitration  agreement with respect to any aspect of a class action that concerns  any consumer financial product or service.   In other words, the entire purpose of this rule is to promote class  action litigation and to stop arbitration resolution when there is a  dispute. Specifically, the rule requires any predispute arbitration  agreement to include this specific language. In other words, people and  companies are required to put this language into their agreements. This  tells you what the dispute is about.   The language mandated by this rule is this: We agree that neither we  nor anyone else will rely on this agreement to stop you from being part  of a class action case in a court. You may file a class action in court  or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else.   It is about as clear as it could be. The issue here is this: Do we  force the resolution of disagreements or disputes in financial  transactions into class action litigation?   This is a rule to benefit the plaintiff's bar.   The rule also requires that companies that go through arbitration  must submit records of arbitration cases to the CFPB within 60 days of  those records.   Some have raised the argument that arbitration agreements gag  consumers, including, as was suggested, saying that, were it not for  arbitration agreements, the Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal would  have been discovered earlier. The only thing confidential in  arbitration is what is brought as specific evidence in that arbitration  proceeding. The clauses in the law permit people to discuss the claims  they are bringing and the company and the individual, if they choose to  discuss them.   Nothing stopped anyone from talking publically about what was going  on at Wells Fargo. Arbitration keeps evidence confidential for the  protection of consumers, but it does not keep them from speaking out  about it.   Further, if judges believe that clauses do that, they often find them  unconstitutional, as they stop consumers from speaking out. In fact, if  you think about it, what generated the public understanding of the  Wells Fargo circumstance, if I recall correctly, was a Los Angeles  Times news article. It was the CFPB itself that failed, apparently, to  read the news and understand what was going on at Wells Fargo. That was  the reason that we saw it take so long for any action to take place-- not an arbitration agreement.   In addition, those who are attacking arbitration agreements seem to  make the case that arbitration agreements stop consumers from having  options. The CFPB's own study said: The clear majority of arbitration  clauses within our review specifically recognize and allow access to  small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.   Let's just be clear. Arbitration clauses don't gag consumers. They  don't stop them from speaking out about what they see going wrong. They  don't force them out of the courts if they want to go into a small  claims court. The only thing they do that is being objected to here is  that they try to force them to not agree to go into a class action  lawsuit. It is literally that question that is the biggest issue that  we are dealing with here.   Mr. MERKLEY addressed the Chair.    I haven't finished yet.    I am looking for more pages.    I will yield for a question.    I am familiar that they would still have the option of  arbitration.   That is why, when those who criticize our effort to reject this rule  say we are trying to stop forced arbitration, the rule itself still  allows arbitration agreements. What it stops is allowing the company to  reach an agreement with the consumer to avoid class action litigation.    That is not true.    Let me reclaim my time, and the Senator can respond on his  own time.   Let me clarify. As I indicated, even the CFPB, in its own study, said  that most of the contracts--not all companies use the same contract-- already allow two actions: No. 1, to go to small claims court or, No.  2, to go to arbitration. What the agreements don't allow is class  action litigation. The specific and only restriction of the rule we are  debating tonight is about whether class action litigation should be  incentivized by taking out the ability of companies to insist that not  be an alternative.   There is one restriction that we are debating here, and that is  whether it is appropriate to allow companies to negotiate away class  action litigation.   On July 10, the CFPB finalized its rule, as I have said, specifically  prohibiting the use of predispute arbitration agreements that prevent  consumers from participating in class action lawsuits.   The Dodd-Frank Act--the statute under which the CFPB was created-- also set forth when the CFPB was authorized to prohibit, impose  conditions upon, or limit the use of such agreements; namely, if the  CFPB finds--and this is what they are required by law to find--that any  such action was, No. 1, in the public interest and for the protection  of consumers and, No. 2, consistent with the CFPB study's findings.   It is clear that the CFPB failed the legal requirements on both  counts. In 2015 the CFPB released its final study and report on  predispute arbitration to Congress. To say that the study was flawed is  an understatement. It was panned for its questionable analysis,  [[Page S6741]]  data, and conclusions by the public, by academics, by consumers, by  businesses, by Federal regulators, and by Members of Congress who noted  that it could make consumers worse off by removing access to an  important dispute resolution tool.   I will spend a few minutes delineating some of the valid criticisms,  since the study was the basis and the legal requirement for the final  rule. First, the study only compared class action settlements with  arbitration awards. By only looking at arbitration awards and not  consumer recovery in arbitration settlements that occur before awards,  the CFPB ignored substantial evidence of arbitration agreements  benefiting consumers.   The analogy that comes to mind is thinking about how much money you  have in the bank by looking at your checking account, while ignoring  what is in your savings account. Given this methodological flaw, it is  difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons about class action  versus arbitration, but the Wall Street Journal's editorial board made  a helpful observation: ``Of the 562 class actions the CFPB studied,  none went to trial.'' Let me read that again: ``None went to trial.''  Most were dismissed by a judge or withdrawn by the plaintiffs or  settled out of class.         The putative class victims received benefits in fewer than       20 percent of the cases, and the average cash recovery was--      wait for it--$32. Lawyers took an average 24 percent cut of       the cash payments, about $424 million in cases that settled.        Meanwhile, consumers were awarded relief in 32 of the 158       arbitration disputes the bureau examined--    These are arbitration results now--       and rewards averaged $5,389--or about 57 percent of every       dollar claimed. Consumers who used arbitration received       relief on average in two months after filing their claim.       Class-action members had to wait two years.    Clearly, the CFPB cherry-picked the information it liked and omitted  what it did not like. The CFPB and its advocates of the rule also argue  that the rule restores a consumer's day in court. But, again, the  CFPB's study explicitly states that no class actions filed during the  time period that the CFPB studied from 2010 to 2012 even went to trial.   The study added that most arbitration agreements in consumer  financial contracts contain a ``small claims court carve-out,'' which  provides the parties with a contractual right to pursue a claim in  small claims court.   The CFPB claims that the rule will deter companies from bad behavior  in the face of an increase in class action lawsuits. Yet there is no  evidence to that effect.   A report released by the Treasury Department this week notes that  ``after years of study, the Bureau has identified no evidence  indicating that firms that do not use arbitration clauses treat their  customers better or have higher levels of compliance with the law.''   The truth is, rather than deterring companies from bad behavior, this  rule will encourage frivolous lawsuits that companies feel compelled to  settle, shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses to  plaintiff attorneys.   Many Members of Congress have weighed in on both the CFPB's  arbitration study and how the final rule was developed. In 2015, 86  Members of the House and Senate wrote to Director Cordray asking that  he reopen the arbitration study due to concerns about the Bureau's  process. In 2016, 140 Members of the House and Senate again wrote to  Director Cordray, raising concerns about the CFPB's proposed rule and  asking the Bureau to reexamine their approach to arbitration.  Unfortunately, the final rule was still issued without addressing any  of the concerns identified.   Federal financial regulators have raised a number of concerns with  the assumptions used in the development of the rule and the lack of  consideration for alternative approaches. Recently, the Treasury  Department issued an analysis that concluded that the CFPB did not  sufficiently substantiate with any quantitative assessment its  assumption that the current level of compliance in consumer financial  markets is ``generally sub-optimal,'' which means that the CFPB has not  adequately demonstrated the rule will solve the assumed problem it set  out to fix.   Treasury also noted the CFPB could have considered less costly  alternatives, including more effectively informing consumers, clearer  disclosure, or more targeted regulation. However, it failed to do so,  opting instead for an all-or-nothing approach, which, again, is  specifically designed to generate a phenomenal increase in class action  litigation.   The Acting Comptroller of the Currency has also raised serious  concerns with the rule and asked for the opportunity to review the  CFPB's data and analysis to determine the potential impact of the rule.  According to a recent letter by the Acting Comptroller of the Currency:         Eliminating the use of this tool could result in less       effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply       enriching class-action lawyers.        At the same time, the proposal may potentially decrease the       products and services offered to their consumers, while       increasing their costs.    The CFPB attempted to estimate the increase in costs, albeit  incompletely, that are associated with this final rule and that could  be passed onto consumers. The CFPB estimates in its final rule that the  companies will incur $2.6 billion of additional fees and settlements  over the next 5 years, $330 million of which will go directly to  plaintiff lawyers. As astounding as these numbers are, the estimate  includes only Federal court cases and fails to include State court  cases.   Treasury's analysis also notes that the CFPB appears to understate  the share of class actions dismissed by the courts, thus failing to  adequately consider the costs of meritless cases. According to  Treasury, assuming that just 10 percent of class action cases are  meritless, ``the Rule would have to reduce harm to consumers by $500  million per year to demonstrate any net benefit to society. The Rule  does not come close to making that showing.''   The OCC recently shed more light on how the CFPB's final rule could  impact the cost of consumer credit. While the CFPB said that it could  not identify any evidence to that effect, it did concede that ``this  does not mean that no pass-through [to consumers] occurred; it only  means that the analysis did not provide evidence of it'' and that  ``most providers will pass through at least portions of some of the  costs.''   Using the same data, the OCC conducted its own analysis and found ``a  strong probability of a significant increase in the cost of credit  cards as a result of eliminating arbitration clauses.''   In fact, the OCC found an 88-percent chance that the total cost of  credit will increase and a 56-percent chance that costs will increase  by at least 3 percent.   As Acting Comptroller Noreika noted, that means that a consumer,  living week to week, could see credit card rates jump from an average  of 12.5 percent to nearly 16 percent. He correctly added that ``to the  extent the CFPB's arbitration rule is being undermined, it is  undermined by the CFPB's own data and the working paper on which the  CFPB relied.''   Community banks and credit unions across this Nation are raising  concerns with the rule. The Independent Community Bankers Association  opposes the arbitration rule because:         Community banks are relationship lenders, many of which       have served their communities for multiple generations.       A reputation for fair dealing is essential for their       success, and abusive consumer practices have absolutely no       place in their business model. Community banks invest       heavily in resolving customer complaints amicably and on a       timely basis.    In addition, the Credit Union National Administration, or CUNA,  opposes the arbitration rule because ``[a]mong the many consumer  protections associated with the mission of credit unions is the high- quality service they provide to their members, which has prompted a  successful system for quickly and amicably resolving disputes in the  limited instances where they arise.''   While the CFPB claims that many community banks and credit unions do  not even have these clauses, I have heard from many small financial  institutions that this rule would have a significant impact on their  operations.   On July 25, by a vote of 231 to 190, the House voted to overturn this  rule. The administration weighed in on the House's efforts, saying:  ``This legislation would protect consumer choices  [[Page S6742]]  by eliminating a costly and burdensome regulation and reining in the  bureaucracy and inadvisable regulatory actions of the CFPB.''   It is alarming that the CFPB moved forward with a final rule in this  manner, especially in light of the numerous concerns expressed. The  CFPB could have made recommendations to improve the arbitration process  or arbitration clauses if it identified concerns.   Aside from the substantive concerns about this specific rule, it  brings the CFPB's own structure and accountability into focus. The CFPB  is unlike any other Federal agency. Since its creation, we have argued  that far too much power is invested in the CFPB Director without any  effective checks or balances.   Last year, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CFPB, as it  is currently structured, is unconstitutional. The ruling stated that  Congress erred in creating a far-reaching agency that is led by a  single Director. In particular, the ruling noted that ``the CFPB's  concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable,  unchecked Director not only departs from subtle historical practice,  but also poses a far greater risk to arbitrary decision-making and  abuse of power.''   The Director is further insulated by being able to automatically  withdraw funds from the Federal Reserve, rather than being required to  justify the CFPB's annual funding needs to Congress.   The court's decision mirrored arguments from Members of Congress that  the Director has wide-ranging power with little oversight and is a  gross departure from the settled historical practice of having  multimember commissions at agencies to keep them in check. In fact, the  Senate repeatedly urged the prior administration to impose checks on  the CFPB.   In 2011, 44 Senators wrote to the administration expressing concern  about the lack of accountability in the structure of the CFPB. In 2013,  43 Senators wrote to the administration once again. In each instance,  we advocated for the establishment of proper checks and balances for  the agency, which, had they been imposed, almost certainly would have  avoided this crisis rule that we see coming out.   Some of the specific checks and balances for which we advocated  included replacing the single Director with a bipartisan commission to  run the CFPB, subjecting the CFPB to congressional appropriations, and  establishing safety-and-soundness checks for prudential regulators.  Nevertheless, despite our efforts, this agency remains just as powerful  and unaccountable today, and this rule is just the most recent  demonstration of its continued lack of accountability.   Now the Senate has the opportunity to take another step toward  holding this agency accountable. The CFPB failed to demonstrate that  consumers will fare better in light of its arbitration rule. In fact,  they may be worse off.   I urge my colleagues to help ensure that consumers maintain access to  quick, inexpensive, and efficient mechanisms of dispute resolution by  overturning this rule.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, while we have a little bit of open time in  between speakers, I thought I might respond to some of the things that  have been said.   Those who are opposing this resolution tonight continue to put it as  though this were a case of trying to stop consumers from having an  adequate way to access dispute resolution and make it look like it is  the big guys against the little guys. First of all, this rule we are  talking about only applies to financial institutions. It doesn't apply  in all the other kinds of cases that have been thrown out here tonight.  If you want to look at the financial institutions that are the most  concerned about this rule, it is the little guys. It is the credit  unions. It is the local community banks that are pleading with us to  stop this abusive rule. I just think that part of the record needs to  be set straight.    Again, I am going to lay out what this debate is really about. This  debate is not about trying to help facilitate banks and credit card  companies and others in cramming down some solution on consumers. It is  about trying to facilitate pushing dispute resolution into class action  litigation. This is a very clear move to drive our dispute resolution  in this country into class litigation.   I am going to give a little bit of history, but before I do that, I  want to again read to the folks who are listening in on this debate  what this rule exactly does. You would think from all of the debate  that it stops consumers from going to court or that it forces consumers  to use an abusive arbitration process. It is very clear. This rule  [[Page S6746]]  prohibits a company from relying in any way on a predispute arbitration  agreement with respect to any aspect of a class action that concerns  any consumer financial product or service.   The rule goes further. Remember that the ones that are the most  worried about this are the credit unions and the small banks. Every  agreement they enter into has to contain this language. This tells you  what the fight is about.   We agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on this agreement  to stop you from being part of a class action case in court.   That is the rule we are talking about. You may file a class action in  court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else.  Are we fighting against a mandate--basically, a rule that is going to  drive decisions and dispute resolutions into class action litigation?  Yes, we are. We are fighting to protect the current system, which is  one that has worked for years and years. I am going to get into that  system. In fact, I will get into it right now. Let's compare class  action litigation with arbitration as one of the alternatives.   In fact, before I make that comparison, let me point out that the  CFPB's own study shows that the clear majority of arbitration clauses  they studied allow access to small claims court as an alternative to  arbitration. There is no effort to say to the consumer, if you want to,  you can go to small claims court. In the United States, the limit in  small claims is different in each State. It ranges from $3,000 to  $15,000, but I would say the most common level is about $10,000 of a  claim. So a consumer who has any kind of a claim up to about $10,000  can go to a small claims court.   Let's compare arbitration with class action litigation.   How much does the consumer recover? In a class action, the average is  $32 per person. In arbitration, the average is $5,389 per person.   How long does it take to get the recovery? In a class action, it is  23 months, on average. In arbitration, it is 5 months, on average.   How many of them actually go to trial? Now, this is interesting  because you think of a class action as your day in court. Remember that  those who argued earlier tonight were telling consumers they were not  going to get their day in court. The number of class action lawsuits  that went to court were zero. Class action litigation is a mechanism to  drive settlements. As for the number of arbitration suits that went to  court, 32 percent reached a decision on the merits. That was not an  actual court case, but it was a resolution by a decision maker. With  regard to settlements, 12 percent classwide are made. In arbitration,  57 achieve settlement.   Here is one of the striking ones. How much is paid in attorneys'  fees? In a class action, according to this study, which is the CFPB's  study, $424 million goes to attorneys' fees. There were no attorneys'  fees under the arbitration. There were some arbitration fees, and I  will get to that in a minute, but they were nowhere close. By the way,  this number, the $424 million that went into attorneys' fees, is the  reason we are having our debate tonight. This rule seeks to drive this  decision-making model into this zone.   As for estimated additional class action costs for covered companies,  it is $2.6 billion for class actions and none for arbitration.   Some have said this is just an example of the Republicans trying to  help Wells Fargo out. First of all, I am the chairman of the Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. We have held hearings on the  Wells Fargo situation and continue to look at it very closely. Senators  from both parties take it very seriously and are working to find a  resolution, but when it comes to the question of whether Wells Fargo  used arbitration agreements to avoid liability, these are the facts.   Wells Fargo, which was found to have opened millions of unauthorized  accounts in the names of its consumers, agreed to settle this for $142  million--twice as much as the projected consumer loss. They made that  agreement because arbitrating them in individual disputes would have  cost much more. The argument that Wells Fargo is the example of what we  are working to try to facilitate here is just not true.   As I said, let's talk a little bit about arbitration. On the floor  tonight, arbitration has been characterized as this terrible, devilish  idea that has been designed by Big Business in America to try to push  the little guy out of a fair chance at recovery in a dispute. The  Acting Comptroller of the Currency, who heads the independent Bureau of  the Treasury, which is in charge of supervising and regulating national  banks, has raised serious concerns.   In his recent letter, he indicates that arbitration can be an  effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism that can provide  better outcomes for consumers and financial service providers without  the high costs associated with litigation.   That is key. In fact, if you look at history, nearly a century ago,  Congress made private agreements to resolve disputes through  arbitration valid, irrevocable, and enforceable under a Federal law,  which is called the Federal Arbitration Act. This was a decision by  this Congress nearly 100 years ago that said we have to find a way that  is fair to resolve disputes that is not so expensive as the current  dispute resolution models we have, namely, litigation. This  longstanding Federal policy in favor of private dispute resolution  serves the twin purposes of economic efficiency and freedom of  contract.   Some have said this just lets banks get away with cheating their  customers, but the opposite is true. Eliminating the use of this tool  could result in less effective consumer protection and fewer remedies  while simply enriching class action lawyers. At the same time, the  proposal may potentially decrease the products and services offered to  consumers while increasing their costs.   The Wall Street Journal's editorial board similarly noted that  arbitration has allowed consumers to easily resolve disputes by phone  or online without their having an attorney.   As I have said, virtually every consumer who does not like this  solution has the alternative to go to small claims court. The question  here is whether we will facilitate pushing consumers out of the choice  of arbitration. If the law is changed, which is what this rule seeks to  do, then the disincentive for financial institutions to rely on  arbitration will be seriously injured. The worry we have--and the  intent of this rule--is that it will drive dispute resolution into  class action litigation. That is what this whole dispute here tonight  is about.   One of my colleagues tried to characterize arbitration as this system  in which this company hires these decision makers, these arbitration  judges, and that the judges are going to be biased because the judges  are bought by the companies that use them for the arbitration. That is  not an accurate description of what arbitration is.   There is actually a Federal law, which I have already referenced,  which sets up the parameters in which arbitration operates, and there  is an American Arbitration Association that administers it. When a  person chooses to go into arbitration, what happens is that the whole  system that takes over is administered not by the company but by the  AAA, and under the American Arbitration Association's procedures, it  appoints an arbitrator. The implication made earlier was that the  arbitrator always rules for the company because that is the company  that hires him.   Here is the truth. In the appointments of 1,847 disputes that the  CFPB studied, arbitrators were appointed in 975 that involved 477  different arbitrators. In 704 of those disputes, the AAA appointed  arbitrators who had also been in other financial disputes. Some of  these arbitrators get picked a couple of times, but they are not picked  by the company, and they are not beholden to the company. That is one  of the reasons we set up the Federal arbitration system the way it is.   My point is, the effort to try to characterize this as some devious  system that has been created to try to stop consumers from having  access to fairness is simply false. We have a very fair system that has  been working for over 100 years in this country. It has been litigated  and litigated because those who want litigation to be the norm hate it.  They do not want arbitration to work, but the reality is, it has worked  wonderfully, and it has survived the litigation assaults.   Now those who want to drive decision making more into the courts and  more  [[Page S6747]]  into class action litigation have been able to get a willing, listening  ear in the Director of the CFPB, who, as I have said earlier, has no  accountability to Congress, who does not even look to Congress for his  budget, and is obviously on the side of the litigation bar, which wants  to, once again, drive our decision-making system into a litigation  mode.   That is the debate we are having. That is the argument tonight.  Anyone who tries to say this is an effort by your local credit union,  your local community bank, or your large credit card company to try to  stop consumers from having adequate access to dispute resolution is  mischaracterizing what the debate tonight is about.   I encourage all of my colleagues to reject this inappropriate and,  frankly, expensive and dangerous rule.    Mr. President, just for everybody's information, I am  going to speak for just 2 or 3 minutes and then yield back our time,  and then Senator Brown will do the same, and then we will proceed to a  vote.   I just want to make clear what we are talking about here. You have  heard a lot of talk tonight about how this is trying to stop the forced  arbitration. You have heard that word a lot. Let's make it really clear  what the debate is about.   Using the CFPB's own study--I am quoting the CFPB now--``the clear  majority of the arbitration clauses within our review specifically  recognize--and allow--access to small claims courts as an alternative  to arbitration.'' So this notion that we are here fighting tonight  about whether people who have small claims don't have any outlet except  arbitration is simply false. That is a false orchestration of what the  argument is.   What is the argument? Well, why don't we look at the rule and see  what the rule says again? And now I am quoting specifically from the  CFPB rule. It prohibits a company from relying ``in any way''--it  doesn't say forced arbitration--from relying ``in any way on a pre- dispute arbitration agreement . . . with respect to any aspect of a  class action.''   It goes on, and the rule actually states specific language that  people  [[Page S6760]]  have to put in their contracts. What is that language? This rule  requires people to ``agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on  this agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in  court.''   So the issue here, Mr. President, is not forced arbitration. Even  existing arbitration clauses allow alternatives. The issue here is the  CFPB's effort to force dispute resolution into class action litigation.   Some have talked here tonight about how we are trying to stop access  to the courtroom. Well, first of all, I think that argument is belied  again by the CFPB's own study that explicitly states that no class  actions filed during the time period that the CFPB studied even went to  trial. So this argument falls on its own face.   Meanwhile, let's look again at what the difference between  arbitration and forced class actions does. In arbitration, a decision  on the merits was reached in 32 percent of the disputes filed, where,  as I indicated, zero of the class action cases even went to trial. In  addition, according to the CFPB's own study, most arbitration  agreements and consumer financial contracts contain a small claims  court carve-out.   Given the methodological flaws in the CFPB's study, it is difficult  to make apples-to-apples comparisons about class action versus  arbitration, but the Wall Street Journal's editorial board made this  observation:         Of the 562 class actions the CFPB studied, none went to       trial. Most were dismissed by a judge, withdrawn by the       plaintiffs or settled out of class.    I will conclude with just the numbers that we have already talked  about many times tonight.   What is the comparison between arbitration and class action  litigation? That is the issue tonight. What is the comparison? The  average recovery for the consumer in a class action case is $32. The  average recovery in an arbitration is $5,389. It takes 2 years for the  class action to take place; 5 months for the arbitration. In 12 percent  of the class action matters did they even reach settlements. In 60  percent, they reached them in arbitration. Attorneys' fees: $424  million in class action cases; virtually no attorneys' fees in  arbitration cases.   The point here is exactly this: The debate tonight is not, as many  would have you believe, over whether we are forcing arbitration. Even  the arbitration clause in the current system creates options for  consumers to go into small claims courts. The vote here tonight is  whether to force dispute resolution into class action litigation, and  that is what we need to decide with tonight's vote.    Mr. President, I also yield back our time.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 2017 Idaho  Hometown Hero Medalists.   Members of Idaho communities nominate their fellow community members  for the Idaho Hometown Hero Medal. The medal honors individuals who are  extraordinarily dedicated to hard work, self-improvement, and community  service. Drs. Fahim and Naeem Rahim established the Idaho Hometown Hero  Medal in 2011 to recognize outstanding Idahoans working for the  betterment of our communities.   Ten Idahoans working in various fields are 2017 Hometown Hero Medal  recipients, and I understand that this year special emphasis is being  placed on those who ``Overcome Adversity'' as the 2017 theme of the  awards. Century High School principal Sheryl Brockett, of Pocatello, is  being honored for her two decades of dedicated service to educating  youth in which she also led her school to excel in providing  educational opportunities. Dr. Jacob DeLaRosa, a cardiothoracic surgeon  from Pocatello, overcame significant injuries from a car accident to  walk again, continue providing surgical care, and significantly  contribute to the community by expanding area surgical operations. Lee  Hammett, president of the board of directors for the Community Dinner  Table, is being recognized for his extensive work to reduce hunger and  loneliness and helping to bridge cultural and religious differences in  Bingham County. Owner of Barrie's Ski and Sports Store Barrie Bennett  Hunt, of Pocatello, received the medal for helping to provide others  with quality access to the outdoors, inspiring active lifestyles, and  giving considerably to his community, while also overcoming serious  health challenges.   Executive director of the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic  Violence Kelly Miller, of Boise, is a statewide leader in ending  violence and has made a considerable difference in assisting Idaho  families. Manager of Morgan Construction Matt Morgan, of Idaho Falls,  is honored for his courageous voice in helping advance awareness of the  sexual abuse of children and his support of others who have faced child  abuse, such as he did. His efforts include founding ``Building Hope  Today.'' World War II veteran Anton Newman served in the U.S. Army,  assisting with recovery after the Hiroshima bombing, has farmed in  Cambridge, and continues to be actively involved in the community  encouraging and inspiring others while overcoming considerable health  challenges.

Nickisch, of Chubbuck,  served our Nation with distinction in Central America, Europe, and  Southeast Asia and continues to serve others in various roles locally  and internationally. Shoshone-Bannock Tribe member and the Tribe's  public affairs manager Randy'L Teton overcame adversity to reach  educational goals and has encouraged Native American education, helping  educate others about the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe's history, culture,  government, and economic projects. Eric Thomas, of Fremont County, has  not let his disability and multiple health concerns stand in the way of  him assisting others as an active member of Fremont County Search and  Rescue for the past nearly 30 years.   These 10 remarkable Idahoans are now counted among the 66 Idahoans  recognized through the Hometown Hero Award since its inception and the  countless service-focused Idahoans who have not yet been honored but  give immeasurably every day. I thank the Rahims, the award's committee  members, the cosponsors, volunteers, and other organizations supporting  this honor for their work to shine a spotlight on exceptionalism in our  communities.   Joining in recognizing the good works of Idaho's Hometown Heroes is  an honor. I also thank the award recipients for leading by example in  our communities. You may never know how many others you inspire to go  above and beyond in assisting others and improving our communities, but  there is no doubt you are leaving a lasting, positive mark in many  lives. Congratulations to the 2017 Hometown Hero Award recipients on  your achievements, and thank you for your efforts to better our  communities.                            ____________________
