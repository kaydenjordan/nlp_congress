 Mr. Speaker, the American people spoke loudly  and clearly last November. In fact, they have been speaking loudly and  clearly ever since this fatally flawed bill called ObamaCare was signed  into law. And now we are hours away from the vote that the American  people have been waiting years for.   This vote can be distilled down to simply this, and each Member of  this body must ask themselves this simple question: Are they willing to  allow ObamaCare to remain the law of the land? Or are we going to begin  to restore healthcare decisions to the American people and their  doctors?   Those who choose to vote against the American Health Care Act,  regardless of how they attempt to justify it, will be voting to keep  ObamaCare in place. This is an inescapable fact that will remain long  after the smoke and spin and handwringing from political pundits  following this vote has gone and disappeared, regardless of how the  votes go.   There is no such thing as perfect legislation in a body of 435 men  and women representing 435 different parts of the Nation.   There is consensus among the American people that this law should be  repealed and replaced, and today the people's House will either  acknowledge the will of the people or we will defy it.
