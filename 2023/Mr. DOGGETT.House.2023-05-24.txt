 Mr. Speaker, within this very week, the World  Meteorological Association has indicated that for the first time in  human history, we will hit a critical high temperature level by 2027.   It reported that in just 2 recent years, there were 22,000 deaths  from extreme weather events.   Recognizing that we already face a grave climate crisis, the American  people need a true winning strategy to escape the addiction to fossil  fuels.   More and more Americans are turning to clean energy, daring to go  green. A growing solar industry plays an instrumental role in helping  them in seeking lower global temperatures, in saving our planet.   Disregarding the extreme heat, extreme Republicans only seem to get  hot, to get warmed up, when they see the slightest opportunity to  impede progress.   Their answer today to those who are trying to help solve this  problem?   Punish American companies that are out there actually doing something  about this problem. Punish them with a $1 billion retroactive tax that  they will have to pay.   I believe that there is an opportunity to continue to resolve the  problems that we face with climate change. We responded to it last year  with a climate incentives law. Our Republican colleagues are also  seeking to repeal that law.   The pause that is involved in these tariffs ends in a mere 12 months,  and Republicans will not ultimately be successful today in blocking the  President.   What happens with this, as with their challenge to our climate  incentives law, is an indication of the many obstacles that we face  that we must overcome if we are to address the climate crisis.   I am yielding my time now, but we must not yield in the determination  to protect the only planet that we call home.
