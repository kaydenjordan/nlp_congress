 Madam Speaker, it seems like it was just yesterday when  I sat down in my family living room with my dad to watch Super Bowl IV.  It was an exciting game, watching Hank Stram strut up and down the  sideline, Lenny Dawson completing long passes to Otis Taylor.   This weekend, after 50 years in the desert, the Chiefs are back at  the Super Bowl. On behalf of the entire delegation, I want to wish  Coach Reid and MVP Patrick Mahomes a great day, a great game, wishing  that they all do their very best and bring back home that Lombardi  Trophy.                            ____________________
