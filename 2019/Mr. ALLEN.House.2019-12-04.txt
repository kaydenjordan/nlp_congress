 Mr. Speaker, for too long, unwanted callers have  circumvented the law in order to deliberately mislead Americans through  robocalls and spoofing. In fact, this is the number one issue at every  townhall that I hold in my district.   Unfortunately, the number of robocall scams are ever increasing.  Robocalls should not be a part of our everyday lives, and we must take  action to stop it.   This malicious practice has led to fraud and theft, exploiting  vulnerable consumers, including our Nation's seniors. That is why I was  a proud cosponsor of H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, which  passed the House in July.   The House and Senate took parts of this bill and were able to come  together and agree on the TRACED Act. This bill allows the Federal  Communications Commission to seek financial penalties against those  making calls with misleading caller identification information. Most  importantly, this legislation allows robocalls to be blocked  transparently at no extra cost to Americans.   We must stop this practice once and for all by identifying and taking  action against these violators. I urge my colleagues to overwhelmingly  support this bill.
