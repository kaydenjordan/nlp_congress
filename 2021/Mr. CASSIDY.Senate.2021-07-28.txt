 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks  may conclude shortly after 1:10 p.m.    Mr. President, I have good news for the people of  Louisiana and good news for the American people: We have an agreement  on an infrastructure package.   Now, OK, an ``infrastructure package''; what does that mean? Let's  just talk.   There will be $110 billion for roads and bridges nationwide--$40  billion for bridges. By the way, Louisiana has the third most bridges  in poor condition. So, if you are stuck right now in traffic trying to  get over the Sabine River or the Calcasieu River or the Mississippi  River or any of our other rivers which have bridges in poor condition,  there is relief for you. There is $47 billion for resiliency.   Now, my State is flooded more than other States, but every State, it  seems, has had an issue with flooding. There is $47 billion; a  significant portion of it is for flooding issues, for coastal  restoration, and other things regarding resiliency.   There is permitting reform. Right now, we know it can take 6 to 10  years for a bridge project--an Army Corps of Engineers project--to be  permitted. Sometimes it takes so long to permit that the facts on the  ground have actually changed, and the permit almost is inaccurate. In  building upon pilot projects which have shown that permitting can be  shortened from 6 years to 2 years, this infrastructure package has that  permitting reform. There will be less money for bureaucrats and  attorneys, and there will be more money for construction--what a major  advance.   By the way, some people have confused this bill with the $3.5  trillion Democratic tax-and-spend extravaganza. They are two different  bills. This bill is for roads and bridges and broadband and resiliency  and flood control and coastal restoration. The other is for who knows  what.   This bill, the infrastructure bill, has been judged by economists as  to not contribute to inflation. The $3.5 trillion bill, obviously, is  going to make the inflation we have now worse. The bill we have does  not raise taxes. The $3.5 trillion bill is estimated to raise hundreds  of billions of dollars in taxes.   One bill I love; the other bill I hate. The infrastructure bill that  is going to shorten someone's commute time across a bridge, to make  their home less likely to flood, to extend broadband to areas of our  country which are not served at all or are poorly served is the bill I  love, and I think that it is the bill that the American people  desperately need.   Let me conclude by saying, again, if you are stuck in bridge traffic  in my State or in any other State right now, wondering why this bridge  in poor condition can't get fixed, help is on its way. If you are in a  place in our country, but particularly in my State, which has either  flooded or is at risk of flooding or if you live near a coastline, and  that beachfront, which 30 years ago when you bought that home was  hundreds of feet out and now waves are lapping up on the road in front  of your house and coastal erosion has endangered your property and your  life savings, help is on its way. If you have seen an initiative to  build a bridge but have been so frustrated that it has taken so long to  get the permits, that is about to change. This is legislation-- bipartisan, paid for--that will address all of those issues.   I conclude the way I started.   We have good news. There is a bipartisan infrastructure bill that  begins to address the needs of the American people--to create jobs, to  take away frustrations, and to provide more security--that all  Americans should support.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following interns in my office be granted floor privileges today, July  28, 2021: Bryce Billiot and Will Sirmon.
