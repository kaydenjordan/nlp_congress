 Mr. Speaker, during this Women's History Month, I rise to  recognize the life of Madeleine Jana Korbel Albright, the first female  U.S. Secretary of State, serving from 1997 to 2001, who has dedicated  the best years of her life to defending liberty.   Concurrently, it is my honor to commemorate the 70th anniversary of  NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This historic alliance  emerged out of the ashes of the bloodiest conflict humankind has ever  known: World War II.   It is thanks to NATO that the free world defeated Soviet Russia's  tyrannical grip over Europe and expanded democracy eastward. Seventy  years later, NATO remains as vital as ever to national security.   Today, Russia seeks to undermine democratic values enshrined by NATO  and its member nations as Russia leads a deadly war against the  freedom-loving people of Ukraine, seeks to spread corruption across  Europe, and undermines democratic institutions around the world,  including in our own elections.   For this reason, Congress welcomes Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary  General of NATO, to address a joint meeting here on April 3 to invoke  the importance of America's commitment to this abiding relationship.   On the 70th anniversary, on behalf of grateful millions of Ohioans  and Americans, we send a message of reassurance to our European allies:  We stand together in liberty's cause.   Onward, NATO.                            ____________________
