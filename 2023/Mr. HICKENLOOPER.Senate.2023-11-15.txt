 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great  American and a U.S. Air Force civil servant, Ms. Charli Kiley.   Charli distinguished herself through her outstanding service as the  office manager and scheduler for the U.S. Air Force's Senate  Legislative Liaison office. For the last 13 years, Charli delivered  exceptional service through her professionalism, attention to detail,  and continued commitment to serving this Nation as a civil servant.  Total service included, Charli honorably served a combined 38 years in  the U.S. Air Force and civil service.   Throughout her career, Charli demonstrated exceptional work ethic. As  a bipartisan volunteer, Charli was responsible for escorting guests for  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to two Presidential  inaugurations. In 2022, Charli directly supported a bicameral  congressional delegation in support of the Reagan National Defense  Forum, as well as the unveiling of the Department of Defense's newest  bomber aircraft, the B-21 Raider.   As the manager and scheduler for the Air Force Senate Legislative  Liaison office from April 2010 to June 2023, Charli performed her  duties well and without reservation supporting the 111th Congress  through the 118th Congress. Her subject matter expertise, professional  relationships, and in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of Capitol  Hill directly strengthened and improved our national security. Charli  was singularly responsible for scheduling thousands of engagements  between Congress and the Department of the Air Force. These engagements  helped U.S. Senators and staffers understand defense equities and their  impact on national security. Due to her direct input and stewardship,  Members of Congress were able to make informed decisions and ensured  the Department of the Air Force was properly resourced and funded.  Additionally, Charli's efforts helped establish the U.S. Space Force,  she assisted with the confirmation of eight Air Force Secretaries,  three Air Force Chiefs of Staff, two Chiefs of Space Operations, and  gained the Department of the Air Force support for multiple National  Defense Strategies. Last, Charli helped train nine incoming Senate  Legislative Liaison division chiefs, nine deputy division chiefs, and  dozens of action officers, ensuring seamless transitions, office  continuity, and efficient performance.   After serving in this crucial role for the past 13 years and becoming  a fixture on Capitol Hill, Ms. Charli Kiley will be retiring and moving  to the great State of Colorado. Charli has given her all in service to  our Nation. I am thankful for her service, her work with my office, and  her work with the Senate on issues of vital importance to this great  Nation. I salute this American patriot whose selfless service has kept  our country safe and strong.                            ____________________
