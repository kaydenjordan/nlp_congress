 Madam Speaker, I rise today in tribute to the life  and legacy of Mrs. Barbara Flaumenbaum, the late mother-in-law of a  member of our team, Mr. Peter Chong.   Born in West Oak Lane, Philadelphia, Barbara worked tirelessly as a  lab technician for many years and had a spirit that warmed and welcomed  all lucky enough to cross her path. You didn't have to know her well to  see and understand how deeply she valued generosity and compassion. Not  a day went by when Barbara did not exemplify these traits. She  instilled these qualities and so much more in her family and the many  lives she touched, including her son-in-law, Peter.   Barbara and her husband of over 45 years, Steven, raised two  incredible daughters, Alisha and Lindsay. Family was everything to  Barbara, and what Barbara loved most about life was being a mother and,  most recently, a grandmother to her two grandsons, Ethan and Benjamin.   They say the best measure of a life well-lived has less to do with  the number of our accomplishments, but more to do the with the number  of lives we have touched.   Madam Speaker, it is clear that Barbara's was a life well-lived and  one that will be greatly missed by all.                                time  1045             Recognizing Council Rock South High School Students     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  tremendous work and ingenuity of a group of students at Council Rock  South High School in Pennsylvania's First Congressional District.   At the height of the pandemic, Daniel Krauss, Noah Necowitz, Dean  DiDomenico, and Dylan Weselovs, along with the guidance of their  teacher, Fred Bauer, saw a need in our community and heeded the call to  help. This innovative, impressive group of young men worked tirelessly  to design, manufacture, and deliver 3,000 lifesaving PPE face shields  that were certified by the Bucks County Emergency Operations Center to  medical facilities, nursing homes, and our frontline heroes in Bucks  County.   I want to applaud this very special group of students for taking what  they learned in the classroom and using that to serve our community. I  know the future of both our community and country is bright with young  men like Daniel, Noah, Dean, and Dylan at the helm. I stand here today  on the floor to express our community's utmost pride and gratitude for  them. We are excited to see all that they will accomplish and know  that, wherever their paths may lead, their futures will be very bright.                            ____________________
