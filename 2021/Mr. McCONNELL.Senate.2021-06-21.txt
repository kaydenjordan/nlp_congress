 Madam President, later this week, President Biden will  meet with leaders of the Afghanistan civilian democratic government. It  doesn't take an administrative leak to know what will be on the agenda.   President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah Abdullah will arrive in  Washington as a grave situation in their country rapidly deteriorates.   The strategic and moral consequences of President Biden's decision to  abandon Afghanistan are already coming painfully into focus. Without  air cover and with reduced support from the U.S.-led coalition, our  Afghan partners are struggling to hold back the Taliban onslaught.   In just the 2 months since the President's announcement, extremist  militants have retaken control of at least 30--30--of Afghanistan's  administrative districts. Reports from the ground indicate that their  heavy-handed, medieval rule is already creating new nightmares,  especially for Afghan women and girls. And just last week, more than 20  of the elite, U.S.-trained special forces, who represent the country's  best hope of resistance, were literally slaughtered in a Taliban raid.  So it is getting harder and harder to believe that ``over-the-horizon''  support will be enough to help our Afghan partners sustain the fight  against these terrorist threats. It is already clear it would intensify  challenges to our own national security.   This spring, the intelligence community warned that the Taliban was  ``likely to make gains on the battlefield.'' As the Director of the CIA  put it, ``ability to collect and act on threats will diminish.'' Now  senior defense officials are portraying follow-on threats like the  resurgence of al-Qaida as not a matter of if but when.   Last week, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs acknowledged that al-Qaida still seeks to directly threaten the  United States and that it could have the necessary capabilities to do  so in 2 years--or even less in the case of a Taliban victory in Kabul.   They want to know how we plan to support their defensive campaign  without the air support that literally saves soldiers' lives. They want  to know how we plan to contribute to urgent counterterrorism missions  without a robust system for collecting intelligence on the ground. And  if President Biden is unwilling to reverse course, they want to know  who will help protect their fellow citizens forced to flee by the  Taliban's conquest.   The State Department is not prepared to efficiently process visa  claims from the many Afghans who have worked closely with our  personnel, let alone the massive flows of refugees already on the move.  Where are the friends of America to turn? Where will they turn?   It is time for President Biden to acknowledge the consequences of his  decision: that a refugee crisis in Afghanistan will mean senseless  suffering; that the collapse of the Afghan state will mean a security  and economic crisis across the region, a crisis America and its  partners will simply be unable to ignore; that the fallout of our  retreat will draw attention and resources away from even greater  strategic threats from Russia and China; and that every bit of it would  have been avoidable, totally avoidable.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on another matter, as I have  noted before, Senate Democrats entered June with an agenda that was  designed to fail. Our Democratic leader planned votes on a host of the  left's most radical priorities. None of it was ever intended to clear  the Senate's appropriately high bar for advancing legislation. Instead,  the failure of their partisan agenda was meant to show somehow-- somehow--that the Senate itself was failing.   For months, our colleagues built anticipation for the failure. They  even started previewing the latest argument they have made when it  happened. Apparently, the same Senate rule a Democratic minority had  used with abandon was now somehow a racist relic to be abandoned by a  Democratic majority.   In the end, one particular radical proposal took priority. S. 1 is  the same bad bill it has been since the House introduced its version  back in 2019 with the same nakedly partisan motives. But ever since  Democrats got the election outcome they wanted last fall, we have  watched our colleagues actually update the rationale for their latest  partisan power grab: States must be stopped from exercising control  over their own election laws.   The arguments here have one big thing in common with the ones our  colleagues have deployed against the filibuster: debunked claims of  racism.   Remember, the last Presidential election saw the highest voter  turnout in decades, even amidst a once-in-a-century pandemic, and  African-American turnout was twice as high in Mississippi as it was in  Massachusetts. But when Georgia passed targeted updates to its election  laws based on lessons learned during the pandemic-era elections,  Democrats trashed the bill as a ``redux of Jim Crow.'' They  misrepresented its contents so wildly that even left-leaning ``fact- checks'' repeatedly debunked these claims. But by then, the train of  disinformation had left the station. Pretty soon, any State that dared  to deviate from unique, pandemic-era procedures faced summary judgment  in the court of liberal outrage. It hasn't seemed to matter that the  facts tell a different story.   The bill that led Texas Democrats to exercise the rights of a  legislative minority last month requires more counties to adhere to new  minimum hours for early voting. The Oklahoma bill that expanded early  voting for general elections was passed by a Republican legislature and  signed by a Republican Governor. In my State of Kentucky, the expansion  of both online registration and early voting this spring passed  [[Page S4641]]  on a bipartisan basis, and a Democratic Governor signed it.   Democrats have continued to insist that S. 1 is a response to these  State laws, but we know it actually predates them. And we are starting  to see that our colleagues' latest rationale for S. 1 can be flexible  when needed. Prominent Democrats have railed against voter ID  requirements for years, but now that voter ID is among the sticking  points keeping the Democratic caucus from uniting behind S. 1, some  Democrats have started indicating, well, they have had a change of  heart. Now, I would commend them for coming around to commonsense  positions on that issue that 80 percent of Americans already support.  But one supposed compromise, among some Democrats, bears more than a  passing resemblance to the partisan power grab their party has touted  for years. It even introduces its own disastrous new liabilities, like  a proposal to automate redistricting that is certainly constitutionally  dubious.    At the end of the day, Madam President, which concocted crisis  Democrats choose as justification for their top legislative priority  actually doesn't make much difference. They have made abundantly clear  that the real driving force behind S. 1 is a desire to rig the rules of  American elections permanently--permanently--in the Democrats' favor.  That is why the Senate will give this disastrous proposal no quarter.                            ____________________
