 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the  100th birthday of Wilbur Dumas, a veteran and a well-accomplished  Georgian.   Wilbur was born in McRae, Georgia, in 1922 to James and Effie Dumas.  In 1943, he married the love of his life, Pollie Snow, in Morven,  Georgia.   Following his marriage, he was drafted into the Army in 1944 during  World War II and served in the Pacific. Wilbur was in the Tokyo Bay on  September 2, 1945, when the official instrument of surrender was signed  by the Japanese on the USS Missouri.   After the war, he and Pollie moved to Port Wentworth where they  raised a daughter and two sons. They bought a house on Commonwealth  Avenue in 1951 where Wilbur still resides to this day. Wilbur retired  from Kaiser Agricultural Chemical Plant in Port Wentworth in 1984.   Unlike many, Wilbur lived to see his 100th birthday this past May,  and it was an honor and a privilege to celebrate his birthday with him  at our home church at Port Wentworth United Methodist Church.   I wish Mr. Dumas a happy 100th birthday.   What an amazing achievement.                            ____________________
