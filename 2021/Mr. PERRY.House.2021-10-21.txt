 Madam Speaker, I am here today to talk about something  that apparently the person whose representative serves in this Congress  refuses to talk about, and that is the horrific events that occurred  last Wednesday on a SEPTA train.   ``SEPTA'' stands for Southeast Public Transit Authority. It is the  transit system that runs around Philadelphia.   Now, I don't know whether folks in the House know it, but for nearly  40 minutes, a woman on the train was harassed and groped before an  illegal alien forcibly ripped off her clothes and raped her right there  on the train, while up to 10 riders watched without intervening. They  didn't even bother to call the police.   Imagine this. It actually gets worse. This hellacious experience  continued as the train passed 20 train stations. Instead of taking  action, other passengers watched and some actually are reported to have  filmed the attack.   It actually gets worse. The perpetrator of this horrific crime is  here in our country illegally. Despite previous convictions of sexual  abuse and drug crimes, he is another one that was released from  immigration detention rather than being deported.   Now, the severe emotional and physical trauma experienced by the  victim could and should have been prevented by our elected officials,  who often advocate for open borders and defunding the police. They have  failed her, they have failed us, and they have created an environment  where she was victimized in front of others by a man who should have  been deported years ago.   While the man should have been deported years ago, the man should not  have been in our country in the first place. We have laws for these  things, and we should enforce those laws so that this lady could live  safely in her American city.   This horrific crime raises questions and concerns about where we are  as a Nation and how we got here.   When my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decide they want to  speak on this floor and attack law enforcement and denigrate our  immigration officials, like the ones that were down at the border on  horseback trying to enforce the laws that are passed in this very  Chamber, and they actively seek to release dangerous criminals into  society, I wish they would realize that there are real human victims of  their reckless, irresponsible, and absolutely dangerous policies and  rhetoric.   I hope the majority keeps this in mind as they continue to work on  their $3.5 trillion spending bill that promises amnesty to dangerous  criminals and puts Americans citizens in danger. That is what it does;  Amnesty, letting criminals stay here without consequence, without  accountability.   But there is accountability for this poor lady, I guarantee you that.   Open borders, abolish ICE, no bail, and defund the police are not  merely harmless catchphrases that Big-Government, socialist politicians  can spew without consequence. That rhetoric results in horrific crimes  against citizens that are someone's constituent, someone who took an  oath to the Constitution to defend this country and the citizens of  this country. They are someone's family member. This was someone's  daughter, someone's little girl.   I want to commend the off-duty SEPTA employee for having the courage  to step up and do the right thing, calling the police and ending the  most horrific event of this young woman's life.   I also want to thank the SEPTA police officer--law enforcement. Yes,  I want to thank law enforcement who intervened and brought this  nightmare to an end.   But I do want to take a moment and ask my colleagues: How much more  must we endure?   There are so many others, so many other victims, from this side of  the country to the other side: Kate Stienle  [[Page H5731]]  in California, killed by an illegal alien; Derek Kichline in  Pennsylvania, far from the border, killed by the head of the Latin  Kings in town; Mollie Tibbetts, in the heartland of the country, killed  by an illegal alien. Read the story about Nilsa Padilla, whose three  little girls watched an illegal alien beat her to death, chop up her  body, dispose of it, and then went on to kill their youngest sister, a  little toddler. Then he left the country and was never brought to  justice, as far as we know.   How much longer? How many more? We have seen record numbers this year  alone at the border of illegal aliens coming into our country and  imperiling and endangering our citizens. It is our job. We take an oath  to defend them. I think you get the point, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Since January, we haven't witnessed migration, Mr. Speaker, we have  witnessed an invasion; a 200 percent increase over FY 2020, hundreds of  thousands of people coming across our border in July and August.   You would think that amid what is definitively an open border crisis,  replete with numerous cases of sexual assault, rape, human and drug  trafficking, proliferation of gang and cartel activity, that the United  States would be working to stop criminal activity and protect its  citizens. Not this President, not this administration, not the  Democratic Party in this House. They can't be bothered. They keep on  incentivizing this illegal invasion.   You can check the tape. You can watch the film. It was then-Vice  President Biden in 2015 who actually said it. He went on film and said  he wants unbridled, unstopping immigration into this country. Now, I  guess maybe people thought he meant legal, but it is obviously illegal.   It is crystal clear that no number of sexual assault victims, rape  victims, drug overdose deaths, no number of human traffickers, can ever  compare to the value of achieving the highest political objective of  the left, which is creating legions of new voters.   At the beginning of this reconciliation process, we saw Democrats try  to provide amnesty for literally millions of illegal aliens. What that  means is saying it doesn't matter if you break the law; we are just  going to let it go. We are not going to prosecute that. Go ahead and  break the law; the law doesn't matter. We are going to forgive all of  your crimes.   When the Parliamentarian wouldn't let them, they went to plan B. Yet  more, millions of illegal immigrants, just by moving a date. Now, they  are on plan C, amnesty, again, telling them to break our laws, to  millions of illegal aliens, millions of people in our country  illegally.   And who is paying for it? American citizens are, every single day.   Let me talk to you about the payment quickly.   Jared Vargas, killed by an illegal immigrant in Mexico. Vargas' body  was then stuffed into a closet and left there for days.   Ron Dasilva, murdered by a known gang member and an illegal  immigrant.   Two brothers, Daniel and Alfonso Mendez-Lopez, stabbed and killed by  an illegal alien.   In August of this year, a 43-year-old illegal alien was charged in  Fredrick, Maryland, just a couple miles up from the street from here,  for having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old.   In August, also, a drunk driver and illegal alien struck and killed a  3-year-old in Flat Rock, North Carolina, as she was riding her  tricycle.   Those are American citizens, ladies and gentlemen.   The people in this building take an oath to uphold and defend the  Constitution of American citizens, not illegal aliens.   Yet, on September 11, an Ecuadorian national, also here illegally,  stabbed his wife to death and left behind their 4-year-old child.   And last Wednesday, a woman was harassed and groped for nearly 40  minutes before an illegal alien forcibly tore off her clothes and raped  her on a train in Philadelphia. They went through 20 stops as up to 10  people watched and did absolutely nothing.   Continuing to incentivize people to break the law by forgiving them  for breaking all of our laws is going to continue to incentivize more  people to break our laws and to come here in doing so.   The American people deserve a government committed to their security.  We must defeat this behemoth bill and this move towards amnesty.
