Mr. Chairman, I rise for the opportunity to speak about my  amendment to the State and Foreign Operations division of H.R. 3354.   Mr. Chairman, we are facing some tough choices. Our Nation is nearly  $20 trillion in debt. We are going to debate lifting the debt ceiling  in the coming days. Simply put, we cannot afford to continue recklessly  spending on duplicative and wasteful programs.   The United States Institute of Peace is a perfect example of a  duplicative program that must be reexamined. The Institute's charter  states that the organization was established to promote international  peace and the resolution of conflict among the nations and peoples of  the world without recourse to violence.   These are laudable and worthy goals, but it sounds a lot like the  mission statement of another taxpayer-backed diplomatic organization,  the United States Department of State.   The State Department's operational mission is to create a more  secure, democratic, and prosperous world for the benefit of the  American people and the international community. Why is Congress  funding an independent think tank that supports the same mission as  another Federal Government agency?   The U.S. Institute of Peace is far from the only organization on the  ground working to foster peace across the globe. Since its inception,  the U.S. Institute of Peace has awarded thousands of grants to other  peace organizations. There are also more than 150 colleges and  universities offering peace studies programs across the United States.   Why are we earmarking an additional $35.3 million in public funds to  support a think tank that duplicates the State Department's mission,  uses its public funds to support other peace-promoting organizations,  and can raise millions of dollars in private funds to promote its own  work?   For this reason, Members on both sides of the aisle have supported  ending this program. In fact, this same amendment was offered by a  Democratic member from New York to an appropriations bill in 2011. The  amendment passed with a strong bipartisan vote.   The White House recently proposed eliminating Federal funding to the  Institute noting that it duplicates not only other Federal programs but  also nonprofit and private sector organizations.   In addition to the duplicative nature of its work, the Institute's  authorization has expired. The underlying funding contained in the bill  is not even allowed under House rules.   The authorization process is vital to ensuring that the American  taxpayer is protected from waste. At the very least, we should withhold  funding until the Institute is reauthorized.   Our kids and grandkids are relying on us to find a solution to this  problem rather than continuing to dig the hole deeper. I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 95 Offered by Mr. Engel    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 95  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available under this Act       may be used to enter into a cooperative agreement with or       make any grant or loan to an entity to establish in any of       Baca, Bent, Crowley, Huerfano, Kiowa, Las Animas, Otero,       Prowers, and Pueblo counties, Colorado, a national heritage       area, national heritage corridor, national heritage canal       way, national heritage tour route, national historic       district, cultural heritage corridor, or other heritage       partnership program.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to protect  private property rights in Colorado.   This amendment would prevent the creation and expansion of a National  Heritage Area in southeast Colorado. Heritage Areas open the door to  new land use restrictions on privately held land that are strongly  opposed in this part of my district.   I recently held multiple townhalls in southeast Colorado to hear the  unique concerns of these rural communities. At the top of their list  was a need to cut burdensome government red tape that hurts their  businesses and threatens their way of life.   These small family farms and ranches should not be forced to follow  new regulations that give control of their private lands to Washington,  D.C. That is why this amendment is so important. It allows Coloradans  to keep control of their land.   My amendment would only affect nine counties in Colorado and protect  them from new, unwanted land use restrictions. This amendment passed  last year by voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to again support the  private property rights of these farmers and ranchers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment stops the Department of  the Interior from entering into cooperative agreements and providing  financial assistance for the purpose of protecting natural, cultural,  and historic resources in several counties in southeast Colorado.   This amendment restricts the expansion of Natural Heritage Areas,  Natural Heritage Corridors, Natural Heritage canalways, national  heritage tour routes, and national historic districts and cultural  heritage corridors.   All of these preservation partnerships are important tools that  enable the Federal Government to work with private partners to preserve  and protect our Nation's shared heritage. Unfortunately, this amendment  takes those options off the table for the people in southeastern  Colorado.   It is my understanding that the sponsor aims to preemptively prevent  expansion of a Federal footprint in his district, but I would like, Mr.  Chairman, to remind us that the sponsor of the Preserve America  Executive Order was issued by President George W. Bush, a Republican,  and it emphasizes public-private partnerships that limit, not expand,  Federal ownership.  [[Page H7155]]    I have worked on some of these corridors. We always make sure that it  is a partnership and it is not the Federal Government coming in and  taking over land. It is a partnership that the community comes to the  Federal Government and asks for.   So, if there are specific concerns that you have about the Federal  management in this region, I believe the sponsor should work with the  authorizing committee to make sure that they are addressed and not use  the appropriations process to wall off a section of the country from  partnering with the Federal Government to preserve its historical and  cultural natural resources.   These discussions that take place at a local level with sometimes the  business community, sometimes it is schools, sometimes it is churches,  that come together to talk about what can we do to preserve our  cultural history or what can we do to preserve something is driven by  local control.   I have never attended a meeting, once, where it was driven by Federal  control. The Federal Government has asked to come in to be a partner.   I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the subcommittee chair.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will protect private property  rights in southeast Colorado. These families have worked for  generations to maintain their land. They should not lose their  livelihoods because of land use restrictions from Washington, D.C.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 42  printed in House Report 115-297.                                time  1945               Amendment No. 43 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska    The Acting CHAIR.
