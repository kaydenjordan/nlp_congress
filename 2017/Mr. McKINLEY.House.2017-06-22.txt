 Mr. Speaker, the Strengthening Career and Technical  Education for the 21st Century Act is a long overdue reform and  [[Page H5082]]  reauthorization of the federal career and technical education (CTE)  program. Unfortunately, I remain concerned that the bill included  changes to the funding formula for states that would result in  significant cuts to CTE funding for West Virginia and several other  states beginning in 2021.   The removal of a hold harmless provision will result in a direct loss  of $4.07 million to West Virginia, a cut of nearly 20 percent over a  three-year period. Given West Virginia's economic struggles in recent  years, we can ill afford drastic cuts to workforce training programs.  As the legislative process continues, I urge the U.S. Senate to find an  equitable solution and consider states that will be disadvantaged by  the removal of the hold harmless provision.   Without additional changes to the funding formula, in its current  form I will oppose the bill.
