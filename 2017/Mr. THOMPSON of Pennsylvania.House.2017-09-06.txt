 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge the outstanding performance of Pennsylvania's critical  access hospitals.   Before I was elected to serve in the House of Representatives, I  spent nearly 30 years in the healthcare field. I am most proud to see  Pennsylvania recognized in the top 10 States by the Health Resources  and Services Administration for quality performance.   With the help of funding from the Federal Office of Rural Health  Policy, Pennsylvania's critical access hospitals are able to invest in  quality improvement projects and new technical assistance resources to  better care for their patients.   Pennsylvania is home to 15 critical access hospitals that provide  service to the most rural areas in our State. Since 1991, the  Pennsylvania Office of Rural Health has dedicated its efforts to ensure  that these hospitals constantly improve the quality of care they  provide to their patients.   Rural hospitals are critically important to our communities. They may  be limited in resources, but they are committed to providing the best  care possible to patients.   I am proud of our Pennsylvania critical access hospitals, and I  congratulate them on this national recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment  No. 49.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment  No. 49 to the underlying bill, H.R. 3354, Make America Secure and  Prosperous Appropriations Act.   Mr. Chairman, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, over a 5-year period,  has failed three attempts to place tolls on Interstate 80.  Pennsylvania's failed plan has cost millions of dollars, led actually  to the indictments of several political insiders, and abetted in  diminishing the average citizen's faith in their public institutions.   Unfortunately, Pennsylvania still has authorizing language for tolls  of Interstate 80 in State law. Any move by Pennsylvania to dust off the  plans to toll one of its interstates must be met with scrutiny and open  public debate, and this amendment will ensure that that happens.   The amendment I have offered with Mr. Kelly will simply limit funds  from this bill for the purpose of placing tolls on Interstate 80 in  Pennsylvania during the fiscal year 2018.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am not sure. I  appreciate the gentleman's opinion, but I don't see where Congress does  not have input into a Federal highway, and that is what Interstate 80  is. It is approximately 311 miles. It is more than well-maintained. The  cost of it, with significant gas taxes levied today, pays for not just  the maintenance, but the construction and the improvements that are  necessary.  [[Page H7055]]    Again, we are talking Federal gas tax, again, a nexus to this body  that the gentleman doesn't seem to realize. What this amendment does is  just call on and require an open debate with scrutiny, and so I, quite  frankly, continue to just ask the support for this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I made my arguments  clear, and I yield back the balance of my time.
