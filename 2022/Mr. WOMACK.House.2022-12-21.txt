 Madam Speaker, it is with profound sorrow and endless  appreciation I rise today to honor the life of Detective Paul Newell of  the Benton County Sheriff's Office in Arkansas.   He was one of Arkansas' finest law enforcement officers, a man who  lived his life driven by a call to serve.   For more than two decades, he donned the badge. More importantly, he  embodied the integrity and principled character the shield demands. He  wore the uniform knowing it brought risk, but it also brought the  reward of keeping Arkansans safe.   Detective Newell was one of the brave. He didn't pursue a career of  comfort but one where he faced danger, helped those in need, and upheld  the rule of law. He was devoted to being a guardian of the community he  so loved.   It was in that spirit of service, Madam Speaker, while escorting the  Wreaths Across America procession in northwest Arkansas, that Detective  Newell was tragically killed in an accident involving his motorcycle in  the line of duty 4 days ago.   He served in the military and was a veteran, patrol deputy, patrol  sergeant, training sergeant, lieutenant, detective, and volunteer  member of the Gravette, Arkansas, Fire Department. Wearing the uniform  was fundamental to his life.   Those roles are only second to the titles he cherished most: proud  son, husband, father, and grandfather. Our heartfelt sympathies are  with his parents, his wife, his daughters, and his grandchildren.   I end with a sentiment that epitomizes the many accolades that have  been shared by his fellow brothers and sisters in blue from Benton  County Sheriff Shawn Holloway. ``We are beyond saddened at the loss of  our fallen brother and friend. Detective Paul Newell was one of the  most respected deputies at our agency. His presence can never be  replaced, but his legacy will remain through the hundreds of people he  has trained. I ask that everyone continue to keep his family and fellow  deputies in their prayers.''   Madam Speaker, God bless Detective Paul Newell. His memory is a  blessing, and the Third District of Arkansas is forever thankful to  have had such a dedicated hero keeping us safe.                            ____________________
