 Madam President, I would like to offer my deepest  sympathies to the family of Kelly M. Roseberry and Noah Ryan Roseberry,  who tragically passed away on October 28, 2023.   Born and raised in a military family, Kelly touched countless lives  with her bright, infectious personality and appreciation for service  and sacrifice. After earning her doctorate of physical therapy, Kelly  underwent training at Quantico Officers Candidate School, Landstuhl  Hospital in Germany, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,  where she specialized in care for injured servicemembers, often  providing care within 24 hours of their lifechanging injuries.   Kelly then worked for 7 years as a physical therapist and amputee  specialist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Walter Reed National  Medical Center. She accompanied a countless number of people through  devastating injury and helped them to walk, run, and pick up their  children again. Kelly devoted her life to helping those who needed it  most. We need more people like Kelly. I know that her memory will live  on in the colleagues she worked alongside, the patients whose lives she  changed, and in people she has never met that are inspired by her  selfless years of service.   Kelly leaves behind her husband Chris, and their beautiful daughter  Emma Grace. Their second child Noah Ryan passed on with Kelly.   I once again offer my sincerest sympathies to the Roseberry and  McGaughey families.                            ____________________
