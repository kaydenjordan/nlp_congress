 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night, we saw the President of the  United States, who has spent years maligning America, continue to  malign Americans. The President once again whipped up a toxic brew of  racism, xenophobia, and nativism, with his crowd chanting ``send her  back'' about a duly elected Member of Congress and a U.S. citizen--one  of the oldest and ugliest racist attacks against Americans of color.   The way the President appeals to the worst instincts of people and  what was shouted and chanted at the rally last night without the  President's upbraiding them was despicable and eerily familiar to what  happens in dictatorships.   We all know that the only way President Trump will stop this is for  Republicans--his own party--to demand it. The only way President Trump  will stop is when Republicans on the other side have the honor, the  decency, and the courage to tell him to stop. All we hear is silence  and diversions from Leader McConnell.   So, America, if you don't like what the President says, if it gets  you upset and makes your hairs stand on end, say: This is not the  America I know and love. Whatever your political views, call your  Senators and tell them to tell President Trump to stop this.   Argue the merits, argue the issues, but stop this appeal to the worst  instincts--the worst instincts. And our Republican friends are silent.   History will show this. This is a moment. There is no John McCain  anymore. When this kind of bitter racism emerged in his townhall  meeting, he rejected it publicly when somebody used it against then- Candidate Obama. It went down in history as one of his finest moments.  Where are the fine moments of my colleagues? There are 53 of them on  the Republican side, and not one has spoken out strongly enough--not  one.   They are quiet on everything else, too--things that matter to average  Americans to help make their lives better. Where are our Republican  friends on the substantive issues that can help Americans of all colors  and creeds--all colors and creeds--help Americans whether their  families have been in this country for 11 generations, as some of my  friends have been, or are new immigrants, as some of my friends are? In  New York, we have everybody.   Here are some of the things our Republican friends can do. The House  has passed legislation to improve our healthcare system and intervene  in the lawsuit against eliminating protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions, but Leader McConnell--once again silent--sent  the bill to his legislative graveyard. The House has passed legislation  to close loopholes in our gun background check system. This is no  longer controversial. Ninety percent of Americans are for it--90  percent. Leader McConnell has sent that bill, too, to the legislative  graveyard. Climate change, voting rights, paycheck fairness for women-- all are in the legislative graveyard.   Where are my Republican friends on those issues? Why aren't they  standing up and saying that we should at least debate them here in the  Senate? Democrats have had to petition for weeks to even be allowed  amendment votes on issues of importance to the American people.   It is a sorry state of affairs here in the Senate. I believe it has  frustrated many of my Republican friends--I hear it from them  privately--as well as us Democrats, because while we may not always  agree on legislative solutions to a problem--we are not all supposed to  agree; this is not a dictatorship--we want to debate the issues. We  want to make forward progress.   My Republican colleagues know that they didn't come here just to  rubberstamp an assembly line of the President's nominees, judicial and  executive, and neither did we, but under Leader McConnell, legislative  progress is the lowest and often last priority.                                  H.R. 1327    Madam President, for example, yesterday, my colleague Senator  Gillibrand asked unanimous consent to reauthorize the Victim  Compensation Fund for the brave first responders who got sick after  working on the pile after 9/11. It is as unobjectionable a piece of  legislation as you can imagine. These are the people who rushed to the  towers after 9/11. They got all kinds of gunk in their lungs and in  their gastrointestinal systems and later developed cancer. Many of them  are now gone, some of them are people I became friends with, like Ray  Pfeifer and Detective Alvarez. And all we want to do is what we do with  our soldiers when they are on the battlefield and get illnesses and  wounds. We want to help them. That is all. Nothing more. Yet, over the  course of the last several years, again, our Republican friends, aided  and abetted by Leader McConnell, have either blocked this legislation  or diluted it. But now it seems there is a breakthrough.   In the House, this bill passed with I think only 12 Republicans  objecting. Conservative Members like Mark Meadows, who is head of the  Freedom Caucus, Leader McCarthy, and Whip Scalise all voted for it. Why  can't we just bring it to the floor and vote on it here? We should.   My colleague from Kentucky, Rand Paul, objected. Bring it to the  floor. Bring it to the floor. Give him an amendment, but let's not just  have this one lay in the legislative graveyard as well. I am hopeful it  will not because as soon as it passes the Senate--and we don't want to  amend it because that will send it back to the House, and who knows  what will happen in the back-and-forth--if we just pass the bill as is  and defeat an amendment that is not intended to help or improve it, it  will go to the President's desk, and he will sign it. Even if he  doesn't, there are veto-proof majorities in both Chambers to overcome  it.   Senator Gillibrand, my friend and colleague who has done so much on  this issue, will try again today to get this Chamber's consent to pass  the bill. If the junior Senator from Kentucky again blocks the bill, I  strongly urge the senior Senator from Kentucky, Leader McConnell, to  put the bill on the floor. It is unacceptable that once again we are  dealing with delays on legislation to help our brave 9/11 first  responders, some of whom are gone, many of whom are ill, and many more  of whom will get ill in the future from the diseases they acquired  because of their bravery and selflessness on 9/11.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I will not object. First, I just want to  thank both my colleagues from New York and Utah for working out this  agreement with the leader and me.   What this does is it paves the way, finally, for what we have been  waiting on for a very, very long time--an up-or-down vote on H.R. 1327.  There will be two amendments offered. We will oppose them. I don't  think they have much of a chance of winning, but there is a right to  offer them.   I want to thank my colleague from Utah for moving forward here, as  well as, of course, my colleague from New York for the great work.  Right now, for the first time, we can not only see the light at the end  of the tunnel, we are getting very close to getting out of the tunnel.  I expect that by Wednesday, we will be out of that tunnel, the bill  will head to the President's desk, having already passed the House, he  will sign it, and our first responders can go do the job they have been  intending to do all along, which is to take care of themselves, take  care of their loved ones, and take care of their brothers and sisters  who have these injuries or who will get these injuries.   It has been a long, long and hard, hard struggle for over a decade,  but now, finally--finally--it looks quite certain that this bill will  pass the Senate, go to the President's desk, and at long last become  law, and those first responders who made this happen more than anybody  else will not--will not--have to come back again.   I do not object to the offer by my colleague from Utah.   I yield the floor.
