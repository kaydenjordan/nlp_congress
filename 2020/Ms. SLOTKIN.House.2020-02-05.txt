 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the PAWS for Veterans  Therapy Act. I am incredibly proud to be coleading this bipartisan bill  to connect veterans with service dogs in their communities and improve  outcomes for veterans' mental health and well-being.   There are two amazing organizations in Livingston County in my  district that train dogs and place them with veterans in need: Veteran  Service Dogs in Howell, Michigan, and Blue Star Service Dogs in  Pinckney.   In December, I had the chance to visit Blue Star Service Dogs for  myself. It was incredible to see these dogs in action and hear directly  from veterans about how service dogs are helping them heal from  depression, PTSD, and so many other invisible service-related wounds.   Both organizations are doing amazing work for veterans in our  community, and I want to salute them.   This bill before us today sets up a pilot program through the VA to  partner with local nonprofits, just like the ones in my district, to  create work-therapy programs for veterans to help expand the number of  veterans who can access the benefits of training and adopting a service  dog.   This issue is particularly personal to me. I am an Army wife. I am  married to a 30-year Army officer, an Apache pilot. I have a step- daughter currently on Active Duty, a son-in-law on Active Duty, and my  other step-daughter is a physician at the VA.   While we make the decision to send men and women to fight for our  country, we make the decision to support them for the rest of their  lives. That is a nonpartisan responsibility, and it couldn't be more  clear or more urgent, especially as we recognize the staggering rate of  suicide in the veteran community.                                time  1245    Every day, an average of 17 veterans are victims of suicide. Think  about that. Within the community of veterans that served in Iraq and  Afghanistan, more veterans have been lost to suicide than to combat,  which is both devastating and unacceptable.   The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act will have a real impact on  improving the well-being of our veterans. All you need to do is talk to  a veteran suffering from depression or PTSD to understand what adopting  a dog does for their lives.   I am incredibly proud of what this bill represents: a group of  Democrats and Republicans finding an area of strong common ground and  pushing legislation to a vote that could have significant impact.
