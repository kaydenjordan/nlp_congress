 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President.    Madam President, I oppose the amendment because one of the  fundamental aspects of the military is the ability of a senior officer  to issue an order and the willingness of a subordinate to accept that  order. What we are dealing with here are individuals, without  appropriate justification, refusing to carry out a lawful order.   Now, the vaccination policies of the military are rather robust. I  think there are more than a dozen required vaccinations, and someone  who just cavalierly dismisses that requirement and then claims that  they should not somehow be held accountable, I think is wrong. But this  goes to the fabric of the military. You must obey lawful orders, and  all of these were lawful orders.   Mandatory vaccination, again, is not a new, novel technique.   Another aspect of this is, this went right to the heart of readiness.  We can all recall when an aircraft carrier in the Pacific had to be  evacuated because of COVID aboard the ship, and the ship was actually  out of commission for several months. That is a readiness issue that is  pretty obvious.   There are procedures to be reinstated in the military. They have been  in effect for many, many years. There is a board procedure. You can  bring forth evidence that your dismissal was not appropriate, and that  is being pursued now, I presume, by many people--or at least some.   So this would really, I think, basically signal that you don't have  to obey legal orders from your commander if you are accepting popular  notions about what is right and what is not right. And I think we  should reject this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 421     Mr. President, I rise tonight to discuss once again the  routine promotions of our military's general and flag officers.   During this Congress, due to the dangerous and extreme position of  one Republican Senator, not a single general or flag officer has been  confirmed--not one--all because that Senator disagrees with a policy  that is designed to ensure safe and reasonable access for all  servicemembers to reproductive healthcare regardless of where the  military chooses to assign them.   Last week, the Defense Department's legal advisers and subject-matter  experts came before the Armed Services Committee to brief us on the  policy and to answer our Members' questions. They laid out clear, plain  facts that explained the legality and appropriateness of the policy. As  I stated publicly after the briefing concluded, no one with an ounce of  intellectual honesty can deny that the Department's policy is legal and  is, in fact, rooted in decades of precedent through administrations of  both parties.   I respect my colleagues on the other side who feel strongly about  this issue, but until Congress passes a law to overturn 40 years of  legal precedence, the Department of Defense has a responsibility to  manage the health, welfare, and readiness of the force within the legal  authorities available to it.   The Department's legal experts also outlined in detail the long- existing statutory authorities that allow the Department to provide  these travel and leave benefits. That is all they are, travel and leave  policies--policies, I would note, that have been on the books in  various fashions for decades.   Even Senator Ernst, the sponsor of a bill that would rescind the  policy, recognized publicly after the briefing that the policy is  legal. I will note my respect for Senator Ernst. Unlike most of her  colleagues, she stayed to the end of the briefing and listened to  everything the Department had to say and formed her opinion  accordingly. Senator Ernst and I have very different views on this  issue, but we share a common respect for our military women and men and  an understanding of how Congress should treat them.   Our colleague from Alabama, however, has chosen to take a profoundly  disrespectful approach. The nominations he is blocking have had no  objections raised against them, and they have all been confirmed by  unanimous approval in the committee, including by the Senator from  Alabama. These are not controversial nominations.   For many decades, military promotions have been a bipartisan, routine  piece of Senate business. Now they have been turned into a political  sideshow by the Senator from Alabama. He is getting a lot of personal  benefit out of this and I suppose a bit of fundraising success as well.  To seek to profit in any way on the backs of servicemembers is, in my  view, a disgrace.   To avoid accountability, the Senator likes to say that we should  ``just vote'' on these nominations, but he knows this is a ludicrous  idea. Let me explain it again. It is virtually impossible for the  Senate to process this volume of nominations through floor procedures.  As the majority leader and I have explained before, it would literally  take the rest of this Congress to move through the nominations we have  now, not even accounting for the hundreds still to come.   The Senator from Alabama knows this. So he does not really want to  ``just vote''; he wants to grind the Senate to a halt on a series of  nonstop 99-to-1 rollcall votes. That means no other Senate business,  such as the annual Defense bill we are debating right now or the  appropriations bills, which are being considered by the Appropriations  Committee; no legislation of any kind, which may, in fact, be his  motive.   The Senator from Alabama has moved his goalposts many times, never  offering a viable or reasonable compromise. Originally, he just wanted  a call from the Secretary of Defense. Once he got it, he changed his  demand again. When he asked for a vote to repeal the policy, we did so  during the National Defense Authorization Act markup, but of course he  changed his demands again, and he is now calling for the complete  capitulation of the Department. At this point, one has to wonder if he  actually wants to achieve his demands or if he just wants to stay in  the spotlight.   We will soon enter the seventh month of this nonsense, and the  effects are building. This doesn't just affect the 273 officers stuck  on the Senate floor; it affects thousands of military spouses and  children, whom I will discuss in a moment, and it affects the officers  coming up behind them, some of whom could be assigned but for the fact  that an officer sits ahead of them, awaiting Senate confirmation before  they can move.   According to the Department of Defense, 45 officers are unable to  assume new positions, including 35 who cannot move because their  assigned rank goes with the position for which they have been nominated  and another 10 officers who are projected to be assigned to a position  now held by one of those 35. Twenty-two officers who have been selected  for their first star will have to assume the duties of the higher grade  while serving as a field grade officer, not a flag officer. Those  officers are losing about $2,600 per month through no fault of their  own. Similarly, 20 officers selected to the grade of 0-8, or two stars,  will assume duties of the higher grade while remaining in their current  grade. These officers are losing nearly $2,000 per month while this  blockade continues.    Contrary to the misinformation from the Senator from Alabama, there  will absolutely be no back pay for these officers, no back pay at all.  Their pay is tied to their rank, which is tied to their appointment to  that rank, which cannot occur until the Senate provides its consent.  While the Senator is trying to enhance his notoriety, these officers  are losing pay.   Twenty-one three- and four-star officers have had their retirements  deferred to ensure continuity of command. After 30 or 40 years of  uniformed service, numerous combat deployments, countless missed  birthdays and anniversaries, and countless missed sports games and  musical recitals, these officers have been told that their lives are  less important than one Senator's ego.   The most heartbreaking effects are on the families that have been  impacted by these holds. I will describe just a few of these stories.   Because of the Senator from Alabama's hold, the Marine Corps was  forced to cancel a coast-to-coast move for a general and his family.  The family's household goods had already been shipped and are now  waiting in storage at their future duty station while the general  covers the duties of a three-star at a temporary station.   Two Air Force officers who sold their homes in anticipation of moves  are living in temporary housing and paying their storage costs out of  their own  [[Page S3590]]  pockets. They have no clarity about the length of time their  nominations will remain on hold, as they are forced to continue their  service in their current assignments to ensure continuity.   A naval officer awaiting orders for an overseas assignment has been  caught in the Senator's hold. This officer's spouse was a teacher with  a public school district in Virginia. Anticipating an overseas  assignment with her spouse, this teacher ended her contract with her  previous employer, but she has been unable to either accept a new  contract at the overseas location or recommit to returning to the  school district due to the uncertainty from the hold. She is stuck in  limbo.   Two children of affected officers were disenrolled from their current  schools due to an expected change-of-station move, but now they cannot  enroll in a new school because the Senator from Alabama has blocked  their move.   Three officers have chosen to move their families at their own  expense, with no option to be reimbursed, to ensure that their children  will be enrolled in school, in the hope that they will be reunited with  their families after the Senator from Alabama has come to his senses.   Finally, yesterday, it was reported by the largest statewide news  organization in Alabama that a petition signed by more than 550  military spouses was delivered to the Senator, calling on him to end  his blockade and the harm it is doing to military families. The  petition, organized by the Secure Families Initiative, called on Senate  leadership to ``reiterate to Senator Tuberville the dangers and  ramifications of this political grandstanding; work together to resolve  political and ideological disagreements outside the military space; and  expeditiously confirm all blocked promotions and fill existing  vacancies.''   These are but a few of the tragic family costs being inflicted. These  stories will increase significantly as we go into August, traditionally  a month that many military families move to new duty stations and start  new schools.   All of these effects are but the tip of the iceberg, snapshots and  stories of those willing to share. The true impact of the Senator's  actions may not be known for years. The destabilizing effect this has  on the apolitical nature of military service is what keeps me up at  night. The broader impact on our national security is incalculable.   In the U.S. military, there is a total of 852 general and flag  officers. By the end of this year, we expect that 650 of them will need  to pass through the Senate for promotion or reassignment. An additional  110 officers will be forced to perform two jobs simultaneously or will  be assigned to a temporary position as a result of the Senator's holds.  Thus, nearly 90 percent of our general and flag officers--our most  senior military leaders--will be affected by the Senator from Alabama's  holds.   Right now, our Nation faces an unparalleled threat from China, and  violent, unstable Russia threatening all of our NATO allies. To not  have our military leaders ready to command at a moment's notice is to  flirt with disaster. The Senator from Alabama has achieved something  that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin can only have dreamed of. I am sure  they would have paid good money to achieve it, but they don't have to.   What disappoints me the most is the silence from my colleagues across  the aisle. For 6 months, they have hardly said a word about the Senator  from Alabama's antics. Do they not care? I know many of them do, and  many of them disagree with what he is doing. So why are they not down  here right now? I call on my colleagues across the aisle who support  our military and American families to stand with us to help repair this  affront to Senate tradition.   Tonight, my colleagues and I will discuss every military nomination  on the Executive Calendar. We will read the names of each officer whose  nomination has been blocked by the Senator from Alabama, along with a  little bit about their backgrounds. Each of these officers has served  decades in uniform, something the Senator from Alabama knows nothing  about.    Their lives have not been easy. I know firsthand that the nature of  military life, even in the best of times, is difficult, punctuated with  frequent moves, time away from family, and duties that are as demanding  physically as they are mentally and spiritually.   This generation of general and flag officers has had it even harder  than many. Most of these nominees have served the majority of their  careers during a state of war. For 20 years, they fought in the Global  War on Terror, and many of them fought in wars before that. They went  where we asked them to go. They fought so other Americans--including  most of us in this Chamber--wouldn't have to. We have never had a  generation of military leadership whose entire professional development  occurred during a period of constant conflict.   As I went through each of these officers' biographies, I was struck  by the recognition and manifestation of their service. As you will  hear, the Senator from Alabama is blocking the promotion of officers  who have been awarded the Purple Heart, the Silver Star, the Bronze  Star, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and every  other significant award or recognition the Defense Department bestows.   He is blocking the promotion of officers with numerous combat tours  of duty, including those who have been injured in combat.   He is blocking the nomination of a career Air Force officer who is an  astronaut for NASA.   He is blocking the promotion of pilots who, collectively, have tens  of thousands of flying hours and combat flying time. And with pilots,  as we know all too well on the Armed Services Committee, they also have  the option of flying commercially for the airlines. We can't compete  with airlines on pay, but we have always competed on opportunity and  mission. If opportunity and mission are compromised, patriotism will  only carry one so far, particularly as the Senate's inaction is  literally impacting the direct earnings of many of these nominees.   He is blocking the promotion of healthcare professionals who, like  pilots, have lucrative private sector options that will look even more  attractive as the thrill and satisfaction of a military career recedes.   He is blocking the promotions of combat commanders at all levels who  have risen through the ranks with the expectation and hope of leading  and mentoring the next generation of combat leaders to ensure the  highest standards of military expertise and ethical conduct are passed  on.   He is now blocking the confirmation of three members of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff: Gen. C.Q. Brown, the nominee to be the next Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. Eric Smith, the next Commandant of  the Marine Corps; and GEN Randy George, the next Chief of Staff of the  Army.   On top of this, we have just received a historic nomination, the  first female officer to be the Chief of Naval Operations, and we just  received today the nomination for the next Chief of Staff of the Air  Force.   He is blocking the nominations of a critical combatant commander, the  commander of Cyber Command, who also serves as the Director of the  National Security Agency. It strikes me that cyber and intelligence is  not a place the Nation should accept any additional risk.   He is blocking the nomination of the next commander of the Navy's 7th  Fleet, the largest of the Navy's forward-deployed fleets and which has  responsibilities in the Indo-Pacific area of operation.   He is blocking the nomination of the next commander of the Navy's 5th  Fleet, responsible for the naval and combined maritime forces in the  Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf, and Arabian Sea, under the overall command  of U.S. Central Command.   He is blocking the nomination of the next U.S. military  representative to NATO, who is the senior uniformed representative to  NATO, during a time when NATO continues to provide critical support to  Ukraine in its war against Russia and as NATO itself is expanding to  counter the threat posed by Russia to our European allies.   He is blocking the next Superintendent of the Naval Academy during  the summer months, when new service academy Superintendents need to be  installed to ensure continuity from one academic year to the next.  Traditionally, the Senate ensures this nominee  [[Page S3591]]  is approved and in place in time for the next class of midshipmen to  arrive and begin their Academy training, which started 4 weeks ago.   Now, even future officers who will be commissioned in 2027 are  feeling the negative impact of one Senator's action. If we don't break  this blockade soon, the Senator from Alabama will have tried his hand  at decapitating the entire senior military leadership of the U.S. Armed  Forces.   Finally, one last thing, none of the officers whose names we will  read today played any part in promulgating the Department's policy with  which the Senator from Alabama disagrees--a policy that, like it or  not, is perfectly legal and is backed by 40 years of practice through  the administrations of both parties. It is a policy aimed at taking  care of our servicemembers, a large percentage of whom are women. This  policy simply acknowledges that women's healthcare is important for  military readiness too.   From President Reagan, whose Justice Department interpreted the newly  enacted Hyde Amendment, through the first Bush administration, the  Clinton administration, the second Bush administration, the Obama  administration, the Trump administration, and now the Biden  administration, the interpretation has been the same: This policy is  legal.   Maybe my Republican colleagues were caught napping on this. Maybe  they didn't bother to read the legal precedents. Maybe they didn't care  to. Fine, I have no problem with my colleagues expressing disagreement  with the Department's policy or pursuing legislative solutions to their  problems. But do not take it out on the professional men and women of  the Armed Forces and their families.   As the military spouses who petitioned the Senator from Alabama this  week to lift his hold urged, we should engage and address these policy  and ideological differences outside of the military space. We are  debating the Defense bill right now. And as the majority leader has  said publicly, we are not stopping the Republicans from voting on their  bill to rescind DOD's policy. Let's have that vote.   Instead, the Senator has chosen to inflict as much financial and  emotional pain as possible on the men and women of the Armed Forces in  the hopes the Department will cave. If the Senator from Alabama  actually cared about the military, he would find another way to  demonstrate his political positions.   Release the hostages, Senator. It is time.    Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Virginia  for his articulate and passionate and compelling comments this  evening--and all of my colleagues. All of them have made the point that  these holds have cascading effects.   It is not just the individual nominee; it is the person waiting to  take his or her position. It is not just someone in uniform; it is a  family. We are talking  [[Page S3601]]  about hundreds of people on the list for nominations. We are talking  about thousands of people whose lives will be changed--extraordinarily  changed.   The particular effects are on the family. No one serves in the  military alone. Families serve. And when you see the disruption that is  going to take place--young people not being able to get into schools,  teachers who give up their teaching jobs and can't get another--those  are real, real costs, in addition, obviously, to every day wondering  whether that servicemember who is your spouse or your father will  return, or whether mother will return, and, particularly, when they are  committed overseas in areas of combat or confrontation.   Now, what Senator Tuberville has said is, ``Well, let's just vote on  them.'' That is ridiculous. We know it would take months and months of  exclusive voting on these nominations to clear this list, while another  list is building up.   And also, there has been some suggestion that we simply--well, we  have to get a Chief of Staff of the Marine Corps or the Commandant.  Let's vote on a commandant.   But there is an ethic in the military: Leave no one behind.   We cannot turn our backs on the hundreds of relatively young  professionals, those colonels who are being promoted to O-7. All of  them contribute significantly to the protection of this country, to the  stability of our Armed Forces, and they can't be ignored.   What I would like to do is to indicate who would be left behind, who  at this point are being ignored--in fact, more than that. What I am  going to call off is a roll of honor of men and women who serve and are  being dishonored by Senator Tuberville's hold upon their nominations.   I am going to proceed in approximately chronological order from the  nomination going forward.   The President nominated Col. Leigh A. Swanson to be brigadier general  in the U.S. Air Force. She is a senior flight surgeon in the Air Force.  Colonel Swanson has 29 years of service, amassing 545 flight hours and  55 combat flight hours. She carries her medical license in the State of  Alabama.   Col. David J. Berkland is nominated to brigadier general of the U.S.  Air Force. He is a command-rated pilot with over 3,400 flying hours,  including 900 combat hours.   Col. Amy S. Bumgarner is in the U.S. Air Force and is nominated to  brigadier general.

She has now served 28 years in uniform, spanning 17 different  assignments, including in Afghanistan.   Col. Ivory D. Carter, nominated to brigadier general, is currently  serving as Director, Legislative Liaison, U.S. Cyber Command, Fort  Meade. He began his Air Force career as an enlisted information manager  in 1990. He has now served 33 years in uniform, spanning 15 different  assignments.   Col. Raja Chari is nominated for brigadier general. He is currently  serving as an astronaut with NASA. Yes, we are blocking someone who is  going to be one of our astronauts.   Col. Jason E. Corrothers is nominated to brigadier general. He is a  1999 graduate of the Air Force Academy. He served 24 years in uniform,  spanning 14 different assignments.   Col. John ``Bryan'' Creel is nominated to brigadier general. He  amassed over 35 years of uniform service. He is now graded as a command  pilot and has more than 7,500 flight hours.

He  has over 2,700 flying hours in the F-15E, T-38, and T-37, and has 905  combat hours over Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.   I think all of these gentlemen and ladies who have flown hundreds of  hours in combat don't deserve to be disrespected as they are now and  wonder if they will get promoted.   Col. Abraham L. Jackson, to be brigadier general, has 25 years in  uniform as a career intelligence officer, spanning 15 different  assignments.   Col. Benjamin R. Jonsson to be promoted as brigadier general. Colonel  Jonsson was assigned to Charleston Air Force Base, where he flew some  of the initial C-17A combat missions of Operations Enduring Freedom and  Iraqi Freedom, from 2006 to 2008.   Colonel Jonsson and his family lived in Amman, Jordan, where he  graduated from the University of Jordan as an Olmsted Scholar. He later  served as the Desk Officer for Egypt and Jordan on the Joint Staff J-5  during the Arab Spring. He is a superbly qualified individual, both as  an Air Force officer and as someone who knows a great deal about the  Middle East.   Col. Joy M. Kaczor, nominated to brigadier general, is currently  serving as Commander, White House Communications Agency, Joint Base  Anacostia-Bolling.   Col. Christopher J.

Mr. President, those are the nominees before us. I think what we have  demonstrated tonight is the range of assignments and organizations that  are affected by these holds, spanning every service, every theater of  operations, every sector of operations--from space to cyber, to  submarines.   This is an undermining of our military readiness which is unseen  before. These individuals deserve promotion. When the Presiding Officer  heard Senator Kaine and I talk about their qualifications, there is no  doubt they deserve promotion. And the men and women who serve beneath  them--who will serve beneath them--deserve their leadership, which has  been tested over time and in many cases--many cases--through combat.  They should not be political pawns.   Now, before Senator Tuberville, we would be talking about our  nominees. They are not nominees; they are hostages.   We can't tolerate that. That is a disservice to these men and women,  to our Armed Forces, to the men and women they lead. We have to do our  duty.   And as Senator Kaine said, there are appropriate ways to deal with  policy decisions you don't like. You can take a vote. You can't hold  all of these men and women, disrupt their family lives, send a signal  to the military that: So what--29 years of service, a couple Purple  Hearts; I don't care.   I would hope that Senator Tuberville would immediately lift these  holds. And we can't do it in a piecemeal fashion. The depth, the range  of the responsibilities we have talked about this evening can't be  cured by: Oh, we will confirm the Commandant.   We can't leave anyone behind. And if this precedent continues and is  established, it will be used again and again and again, to the  detriment of the Nation.   This is the time for us to stand up--stand up for what we always say  about our devotion to the military, our respect for the military; that  they shouldn't be demeaned; they shouldn't be used as political tokens.  It is time to stop the speeches on the Fourth of July and fill them  unanimously, as we typically do, by voice on these matters.                            ____________________     Mr. President, with that, I believe we have to conclude  this evening.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes  its business today, it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res.  316 until 10 a.m. on Thursday, July 27; that following the prayer and  pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon  the conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume the consideration  of Calendar No. 119, S. 2226; further, that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate  vote on the remaining amendments under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, as a further mark of respect to the late  Lowell Weicker, Jr., former Senator from Connecticut, the Senate, at  12:40 a.m., adjourned until Thursday, July 27, 2023, at 10 a.m.                                NOMINATIONS    Executive nominations received by the Senate:                        SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION          MARTIN O'MALLEY, OF MARYLAND, TO BE COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL       SECURITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM EXPIRING JANUARY 19,       2025, VICE ANDREW
