 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 165,  S. 1519.    Mr. President, Congress is standing at the doorstep of  a historic opportunity. Today the House will vote on the conference  report on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the most significant overhaul of  our Nation's Tax Code in more than 30 years. This major tax reform  legislation will provide much needed relief to middle-class families  and small businesses and will set America on a trajectory toward more  opportunity and greater prosperity.   After the House votes this afternoon, the Senate will begin debate  and will proceed to a vote on passage later this evening. The final  text of this bill is the product of extensive open debate. It is a  result of dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years and an open  amendment process. Then, the House and the Senate joined together in a  conference committee that carefully reconciled the two Chambers' bills.   Now the time has come to vote. When Senators vote for the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, they will be voting for a bill that substantially cuts  taxes for middle-class families. By reducing rates, it will let working  Americans keep more of their paychecks and send less of their hard- earned money to Washington.   In addition to lower rates, middle-class families will benefit from a  standard deduction that is almost double its present level and from a  doubling of the child tax credit. They will benefit from the ability to  deduct more of their medical expenses, increasing their tax savings  during difficult times.   Despite what opponents of the bill have claimed, the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act achieves all this while preserving charitable deductions and  the adoption tax credit. It protects the exemption for university  tuition benefits. A mortgage interest deduction remains, as does a  deduction for State and local taxes.   The result is a comprehensive tax reform bill that does what we set  out to do: take money out of Washington's pocket and put it back into  the pockets of middle-class Americans who earned it. Consider a typical  family of four who earns the median family income. A vote for the  conference report is a vote to cut their tax bill by more than $2,000  next year.   After a disappointing decade of stagnant wages and shrinking  opportunity under the Obama administration, middle-class families are  counting on Congress to keep our promise and give them that much needed  relief.   In addition to directly cutting taxes for American families, this  landmark bill will also set America on a trajectory toward higher wages  and better job opportunities by making our country a better place to do  business. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a number of provisions  that will make it easier to run and grow a small business, to create  jobs, and to invest right here in the United States.   The bill creates new tax relief for Main Street businesses. It makes  it easier for American companies to bring their earnings back home  instead of parking that money elsewhere. It eliminates incentives to  shift jobs and manufacturing overseas and replaces them with new  incentives to invest and expand operations here at home.  [[Page S8074]]    To make America more competitive in the global economy, the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act cuts our corporate tax rate from 35 percent--one of the  highest rates in the developed world--to 21 percent. This is good news  for workers. As more than 100 economists agreed in a recent open  letter, ``the question isn't whether American workers are hurt by our  country's corporate tax rate--it's how badly.''   Another expert put it this way in a recent op-ed: It is ``the  consensus view of professional economists'' that ``lowering corporate  income taxes would increase the wages of workers.'' Perhaps that is why  reforming the corporate tax rate used to be a bipartisan goal. During  the previous administration, prominent Democrats said they supported  bringing our rate in line with our competitors overseas.   There may be a new occupant of the White House, but the need for  reform has not changed. I hope our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will support this pro-growth, pro-worker policy.   It is no wonder that job creators are enthusiastic about what they  will be able to accomplish when tax reform becomes law. I recently  received a letter from the chief operating officer of a construction  equipment dealer in my hometown of Louisville. This is a direct quote:  ``We'll hire more employees and plan investments in our company that we  weren't considering prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.''   This bill will also help Americans by repealing a punitive tax at the  very heart of ObamaCare. For low- and middle-income families who are  suffering under the individual mandate tax--including many in my home  State of Kentucky--repeal means relief. If the health insurance plans  available under ObamaCare are not affordable or not desirable, the  blame lies with that failing law, not with Americans who are already  struggling to make ends meet. It is unfair and illogical to penalize  them further because ObamaCare is failing to meet their needs. By  erasing this individual mandate tax, we will give Americans both tax  relief and healthcare flexibility--two things that ObamaCare failed to  provide.   There is one more element of this bill that deserves special  attention. It provides the Nation, and particularly the people of  Alaska, with a tremendous opportunity to develop the State's bountiful  natural resources. In 1980 Congress set aside a particular  nonwilderness area within Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge for  potential development of its oil and gas resources. This bill is our  chance to finally make good on that promise, enhancing our country's  energy security and creating good-paying jobs in the process.   Unlocking the resources of this area will provide a boon to Alaska's  economy, but more broadly, it will also advance America's standing as  an energy superpower, helping to cut Americans' energy costs and  strengthening our national security.   For too long, special interests have stood in the way of responsible  development. The people of Alaska have shown time and again that  resource development can go hand in hand with environmental protection,  and surface development will be limited to just one ten-thousandth of  the total land in the reserve. It is long past time to finish what  Congress started almost 40 years ago and to begin reaping the benefits  of responsible development.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will deliver historic tax relief to  American families. It will help put our country on a trajectory toward  more innovation and better paying jobs. It will repeal an unfair tax at  the center of ObamaCare and will help America achieve greater energy  security.   So this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. I want to commend the  work of Chairman Hatch, Chairman Enzi, and Chairman Murkowski to bring  it within reach. I urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting to  approve the conference report and complete this victory for the  American people.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to the conference  report to accompany H.R. 1.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Madam President, today I wish to congratulate Mr. Bill  Daugherty of Lexington, KY, who was recently honored by Berea College  with its distinguished alumnus award. Each year, the school recognizes  notable alumni who have achieved success in their profession,  contributed to the community, and have faithfully upheld Berea's  mission. The college, founded in 1855 by abolitionists, fosters an  educational institution that cultivates Christian values and challenges  students to carry them into action in their community.   Raised on a cattle farm in Jackson County, KY, Bill graduated from  Berea in 1976, and he used his degree in agriculture to succeed in the  natural resource industry. Less than 10 years later, he founded his own  small petroleum business. His company evolved and grew to focus on  natural gas in the Appalachian region. After years of success, Bill and  his business partner founded an independent oil exploration and  production company.   Bill has served his community on the board of the Kentucky Energy  Council, Kentucky Oil and Gas Association, and the Independent  Petroleum Association of America. He currently serves as the vice  chairman of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, which is  tasked with helping States find environment-friendly ways to increase  the supply of American energy.   Finally, Bill and his business partner founded a successful horse  racing and breeding enterprise. His success in the natural gas industry  was matched in the thoroughbred racing industry. In fact, Bill's own  horse, California Chrome, won the Kentucky Derby in 2014.   The distinguished alumnus award is not only a recognition of  significant accomplishment in the recipient's chosen profession, but it  also serves as an inspiration to the current students at Berea College  who are eager to make their own positive impact in the community. Bill  and his wife, Zella, play active roles in the community by hosting  events in support of the New Opportunity School for Women, an intensive  3-week program that offers coursework in job search skills, creative  writing, and Appalachian literature. I want to ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Bill for receiving this award and commending  him on a successful career.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I would like to recognize the  efforts of Clarence Floyd, a proud Korean war veteran, from Pulaski  County, KY. At the age of 84, Clarence still works to serve his  community, taking up a campaign to erect reserved-parking spaces for  area veterans. These signs are a salute to the men and women who served  our Nation in uniform.   As the honor guard commander of Somerset's American Legion Post 38,  Clarence cares deeply about America's veterans. To arrange reserved- parking spaces for veterans, Clarence works with local businesses and  the city of Somerset's street department. Then, he and his wife, Nancy,  install the signs themselves. He says, ``It takes me about 20 minutes  to put up two signs.''   To date, there are 10 locations with veterans-only parking throughout  Pulaski County. Clarence is also working with other local businesses to  install more in the near future. I would like to thank Clarence for his  service to our country and to his fellow veterans, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in doing so.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to remember the life of  Lohren Martin, of Corbin, KY, who passed away on November 21, 2017, at  the age of 87. A man of many talents, Lohren will be remembered most by  those who loved him as a caring friend.   A veteran of the Korean war, Lohren worked in his community as an  attorney, a businessman, an entrepreneur, and a developer. Lohren's  siblings and friends think of his humor, patriotism, and constant  friendship.   Elaine and I would like to extend our condolences to Lohren's wife,  Arvilla, his children Eddie and Cindy, and all who knew and loved him.  His life left a lasting impression on all of those around him, and I  hope that their fond memories of Lohren will bring comfort in this time  of grief.   The Corbin Times-Tribune recently published an article on Lohren's  life. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Corbin Times-Tribune, Dec. 5, 2017]                Lohren Martin Remembered as `a Great Friend'                             (By Angela Turner)         ``The biggest thing I can tell you about Lohren Martin is       how much he valued every individual,'' Shirley Chandler said       about her brother.        Siblings often share a special bond and it was no different       in the case of Shirley Chandler and her brother Lohren       Martin. Martin, who was a local attorney, businessman,       entrepreneur, developer, and Korean War Veteran (just to name       a few), died on Nov. 21.        Growing up, Martin was the salutatorian of this high school       class. He attended several colleges and universities       including Sue Bennett College, Union College and the       University of Kentucky.        According to Chandler, Martin's education was interrupted       when he was drafted into the Korean War. After basic training       he was selected to go into army intelligence. After training       in army intelligence, he was sent to Korea to interpret       aerial photographs. Chandler said while in Korea, Martin       lived in a tent and was dedicated and focused on the task at       hand.        ``He was an awesome brother,'' Chandler said. ``He was a       great mentor, a great friend and confidant.''        Martin's friends shared similar thoughts.        ``He was a friend that would stick with you in good times       and bad times,'' said Martin's friend and business partner       Dave Huff. ``He was very patriotic.''                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to James  Ritchie, of Somerset, KY, a brave Kentuckian who was honored by his  community on Veterans Day. He was the feature of a newspaper story in  the Commonwealth Journal, which detailed his life and his honorable  career in the military. The article was a community's effort to thank  him for his service to our country.   In 1947, James decided to join our Nation's military. Seeking to  enlist in the Navy, James walked in the wrong door and was convinced  instead to join the marines. After his training, James was deployed to  join the 1st Marine Division Air Wing in Pusan, Korea. However, the  trip to Korea by way of San Diego proved treacherous when James'  transport collided with a steamliner.   Once he made it to Korea, James was responsible for providing  protection for  [[Page S8143]]  the Marine air base. Against North Korean and Chinese guerillas, he  bravely faced the harsh realities of war. After his enlistment and am  honorable discharge, he returned home. The same month, however, James  felt the call to serve once again, this time in the Air Force.  Eventually returning to Korea, he helped in the U.S. effort to transfer  responsibilities to the South Koreans.   In 1961, James chose to retire from military and answered another  call, this time to serve as a minister. With his wife, Wilma, James  raised five children. I would like to take this opportunity to thank  James for his military service to our country, and I urge my colleagues  to join me.   Earlier this year the Commonwealth Journal published an article  detailing Mr. Ritchie's service to our Nation. I ask unanimous consent  that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From the Commonwealth Journal, November 11, 2017]                    The Heroic Life of a Nomadic Soldier                             (By Cline Calhoun)         During a somewhat nomadic life with his divorced mother,       James Ritchie, born in Ellington, S.C., made it through high       school in Alexandria, Va., as he jokingly says: "In the front       door straight through the back door."        After three years in the seventh grade, he found himself       turning 17 years old in the ninth grade. One day his       basketball coach made him mad, so in 1947 he found himself in       Washington D.C., looking for a military recruiter. He had his       mind set on the Navy, but when he found the recruitment       center, he stuck his head in the door of the Marine       recruiter's office to ask direction to the Navy. The Marine       recruiter said; ``Come in here boy, I want to talk to you.''       He went in the door asking directions and came out the door a       marine.        After eight weeks of basic training at Paris Island, S.C.,       he was off to Camp Lejeune, N.C. With its 14 miles of sea       shore, it is perfect for training in unloading the troops and       equipment of shore landing military units during invasions.       That was the job of the unit James was assigned to: The       Pioneer Battalion.        In 1948 James was reassigned to the 1st 90 mm AAA (Anti-      Aircraft Artillery) Battalion USMC on the Pacific Island of       Guam. No training here; OJT (on the job training) as a       gunner. Near the end of his enlistment he was transferred       back to Camp Lejeune. With an honorable discharge he was       given inactive reserve status, subject to recall in case of       war. Guess what? War. North Korea with help from China,       invaded South Korea.        James says he hardly had time to get out of uniform before       he found himself back in it. Discharged in February, called       back in June. The entire reserve unit was called up and       trained for duty in Korea, being attached to the 1st Marine       Division Air Wing in Pusan, Korea. But first you have to get       there. One Marine didn't, and several were seriously injured.        James' unit was on a troop train going from Camp Legume,       N.C. to a port in San Diego, CA. for transport to Korea.       Following are excerpts from Associated Press and United       Press:--``Lettsworth, La. (AP)-(UP) Aug. 1951--A New Orleans-      bound streamliner and a troop train carrying 288 marines       toward the Pacific collided head-on in a Louisiana swamp       Friday and the Kansas City Southern railway reported at least       eight dead and one missing. The crash happened about 7 a.m.       (CST) on a double bend some miles northeast of Baton Rouge.-       Marines piled out of the wreckage and gave first aid to       injured passengers of the New Orleans bound Southern Belle,       as well as to their own. Rescue workers had to hack a road       through the swamp to the wreck--most of the marines escaped       because they were eating breakfast at the back of the       train.''        At that time, troop movements were classified, so when the       news hit the wires, Camp Lejeune was swamped with concerned       family members wanting to know the status of their sons,       husbands, fathers and brothers. The uninjured marines finally       boarded undamaged railcars and went on to port in San Diego       to a troop ship taking them on to Korea. Because of the       delay, the troop train was given priority clearance to       California.        Upon arrival in Pusan, S. Korea, it was the job of the 1st       90 mm AAA Battalion to provide protection for the Marine Air       Base located there. Their four artillery batteries with       twelve 90 mm guns were stationed on the mountains       approximately 40-50 miles from Pusan. Transport vehicles       carrying ammunition, generator fuel and supplies were       constantly subjected to sniper fire.        James said the primary concern for the troops were the       constant attempts by North Korean and Chinese guerillas to       invade their air defense locations. He said one of his       scariest times was when off duty and the alarm goes off. He       grabbed his rifle and ran to his fox hole, only to realize he       forgot his ammunition. Fortunately, his comrades prevented a       breach of the compound or he would have really found out what       hand to hand combat was really like, because he wasn't about       to run back to retrieve the ammunition!        After 5 months, the Marines wanted him to reenlist and he       would get some quality time, maybe in Hawaii. Upon learning       he would probably come right back to Korea, visions of home       took front and center and James decided to go home.        He was honorably discharged in June of 1952 but found he       still had the desire to serve his country, so in the same       month, June 1952, he found himself at the Air Force recruiter       in Alexandria, VA. But this time he didn't ask for directions       from the Marine recruiter. The Air Force sent him to 6 months       of training as a Petroleum Specialist and he was off to Ladd,       AF Base, Alaska, fueling jets in 55 degrees below zero       weather for two years.        In 1955 he was transferred to Kirkland AF Base in New       Mexico, where, one year later guess what? Back to Korea. He       served at Osan and Kunson Air Bases because the protection of       South Korea was being turned over to the South Korean       military and the P51 Mustang were being replaced by the F86       fighter jets.        James said that promotion through the ranks in the Air       Force seemed to be more political than proficiency driven.       So, in 1961 he decided against a military future, said       goodbye to the Air Force, and once again headed home.       Besides, he felt he had a greater calling as an independent       minister of the gospel.        James met his wife Wilma in Albuquerque, New Mexica in       1955. After a whirlwind romance, they were married after only       7 days. Love at first sight does work--they were married for       60 years. James lost Wilma to cancer in 2014. They raised 3       boys and 2 girls. James is enjoying his golden years in his       home just outside Somerset, KY.        For every infantry combat soldier, there are at least 10       others in the background supporting him with food,       ammunition, fuel, air-artillery, communications, intelligence       and armor cover. These are the unsung heroes we seldom hear       about.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S.
