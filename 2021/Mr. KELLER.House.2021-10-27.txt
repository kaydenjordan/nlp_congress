 Madam Speaker, with executive order after executive  order, President Biden dismantled America's energy dominance. In the  first days of his administration, President Biden killed the Keystone  pipeline, paused new oil and gas production on U.S. lands, and  destroyed thousands of good-paying jobs.   My Republican colleagues and I sounded the alarm knowing that this  type of short-sighted policy would have a devastating impact on our  economy and national security. Now energy prices are rising with winter  quickly approaching, and hidden deep in the Democrats' reconciliation  plan is a tax on heating your home, Madam Speaker, that could leave  Americans paying 50 percent more to keep warm this winter.   That is absurd. To make it worse, President Biden said he doesn't  have a near-term answer for America's energy crisis. Well, we  Republicans do. We have an answer. It starts with reversing Biden's  harmful energy policies and investing in American energy.                            ____________________
