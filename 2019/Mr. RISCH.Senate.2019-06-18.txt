 Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator  Mike Crapo and Representative Mike Simpson, I congratulate the American  Legion Post 7 in Twin Falls, ID, on its 100th anniversary.   On March 15, 1919, the first American Legion caucus was held in  Paris, France, in the wake of World War I. Just a few months later, in  June of 1919, the American Legion Post 7 in Twin Falls, ID, was  chartered. On September 16, 1919, Congress established the American  Legion as a federally charted corporation. As you can tell, those men  in Twin Falls wasted no time answering the call in peacetime as they  had in time of war, as veterans so often do. The low post number, post  No. 7, shows the veterans of Twin Falls were one of the earliest to  request and receive a charter in the Idaho Department.   The Twin Falls American Legion Post 7 has been around to help  veterans from WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other  U.S. engagements and activities. A remarkable record of accomplishment  of service and support to our troops and veterans.   In addition, you will see post 7 members serving on Memorial Day,  Veterans Day, veteran funerals, and many other community events as the  color guard, providing 21-gun salutes, or playing taps on the bugle.  They quietly provide support to grieving military families, injured  veterans, and patriotic citizens.   Twin Falls American Legion Post 7 is part of the fabric and spirit of  Twin Falls and the surrounding communities. They provide assistance and  service to veterans by helping them to understand and apply for  benefits, find jobs, and healthcare services. In addition, they are  involved in many programs and community activities such as American  Legion Baseball, Boys State, Oratorical Contests, and scholarship  awards. Post 7 also has a women's auxiliary that sponsors the Girls  State Program and serves in many capacities in the community.   The Preamble of the American Legion Constitution speaks volumes about  the quality and patriotism of American Legion members. The first few  lines of the preamble make evident these values: ``For God and Country  we Associate Ourselves together for the following purposes: To uphold  and defend the Constitution of the United  [[Page S3651]]  States of America; To maintain law and order; To foster and perpetuate  a one hundred percent Americanism . . .''   We thank Twin Falls American Legion Post 7 and its membership for  their outstanding service to community, country, and America's  veterans. Congratulations on 100 years of achievements. We commit to  ensure veterans have access to the highest quality services worthy of  their remarkable dedication to our Nation.                            ____________________
