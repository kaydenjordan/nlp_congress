 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for having this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, it is my great honor to stand in this sacred Chamber  each year during National Bible Week to express the importance of a  book that has influenced my life more than any other. Without a doubt  and without fault, the Bible has been my comfort in sorrow, my counsel  in decisionmaking, and my unwavering companion in day-to-day life.   From running my dental practice to raising my family to serving the  good people of Texas' 36th Congressional District, God's Word has  always been the central hub that everything else revolves around, and  it continues to mold and shape my life for the better each day.   But the Scripture's reach is much further than the life of one Texas  Congressman. If you take a single glance at a U.S. history book, you  will see its footprint immediately. During our Nation's birth, the  Bible was perhaps the most accessible book to our Founding Fathers, and  in its pages, they learned valuable insights about human nature, civic  virtue, and the rights of our citizens.   Biblical influence can also be seen in our founding documents,  including the Declaration of Independence, which states that ``all men  are created equal, that they are all endowed by their creator with  certain unalienable rights.''   We are living in uncertain and perilous times, and I pray daily that  we as a country find our way back to the teachings of the Scripture.  May we never forget that it was God's divine providence and written  word that provided the fortitude to those responsible for creating this  grand experiment of America.   Keeping His hand in all we do is the only way that we can preserve  it. I will close with one of my favorite passages of encouragement and  hope and life everlasting from the Bible, Job 19:25-27:         For I know that my redeemer lives, and He shall stand at       last on the Earth. And after my skin is destroyed, this I       know, that in my flesh, I shall see God whom I shall see for       myself. And my eyes shall behold Him and not another. How my       heart yearns within me.
