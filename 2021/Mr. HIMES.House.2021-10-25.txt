 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I am delighted as chairman of the Select  Committee on Economic Disparity to welcome the ranking member and the  Republican appointees to this very important committee for this Special  Order where I think the members of our committee are going to try to  highlight some of the early and initial thoughts that we have on how we  might address this issue of economic disparity.   I will note that in our first hearing one of our witnesses called  this committee ``a committee of historic potential.'' It is based on  the National Economic Committee of 1938, and that committee operated in  a moment of economic crisis worse than any of us have seen in our  lifetimes really since the Great Depression.   The Great Depression showed America that far too many citizens of the  richest and most powerful country in the world could be impoverished by  unpredictable forces beyond their control.   It showed that free market capitalism was both an unparalleled engine  of economic growth, and if left unregulated, subject to manipulation,  indifferent to fairness, and prone to collapse as it did in the early  1930s.   In most respects, the American economy is more stable and the safety  net is more robust than it was 80 years ago, but today our economy  demonstrates more income and wealth disparity and less mobility than it  ever has. And, Madam Speaker, that is not a red problem or a blue  problem. It is not a northern or a western or an eastern problem. It  affects every single one of our communities, every single one of our  districts.   It is not a trivial problem. Market economies don't work if they are  perceived as fundamentally unfair. Our Democratic political system  rests now uneasily on the premise that every American counts equally.  Economic mobility, the idea that hard work and playing by the rules  allows one to climb the ladder has always been essential to our  understanding of ourselves. It defines the American Dream, and yet,  when my parents were born, more than 90 percent of American children  could expect to make more money than their parents. Today, fewer than  half the children will outearn their parents.    Madam Speaker, I see this every day at home. Some of the towns I  represent in Connecticut's so-called ``Gold Coast'' include some of the  wealthiest people on the planet, but a 15-minute drive from their  neighborhoods will take them into cities with horrendous poverty and  neighborhoods where opportunity is scarce at best.   Addressing that issue in a thoughtful way, in a bipartisan way is the  remit of this committee.   Having made that point, before we enter into a colloquy, I yield to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), my friend and the ranking  member of the Select Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness in  Growth to make any comments he wishes to make.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member. We will be  engaging in a colloquy, just so all the Members know. We will be having  an informal chat without having recognition from the Chair.   I know that we are both anxious to get to our members and their  affirmative but early ideas on what we might do here, but the ranking  member and I were in Lorain, Ohio, last week, courtesy of the  gentlewoman from Ohio, who we will hear from later. I think we were  both struck by a couple of things.   I came away from that visit impressed by the optimism of people in a  town that had suffered badly, associated with the closing of a steel  mill. I came away remarkably impressed by the potential role for  education. One of the best things I heard there was the amazing work  that the community college of Lorain was doing, training people who had  both lost jobs but also training young people.   I personally hope--and I know there is a conversation to be had about  this--that training and education won't start at the community college  level but will start as early as possible. I would hope that maybe  education and training might be one of those areas in which we might  find bipartisan agreement.    Madam Speaker, that is right, I say to my friend from  Wisconsin. I was startled by that sign as well. Here we are in a  depressed, if optimistic, town, with a big, closed steel mill with  ``Help Wanted'' signs on the outside of that steel mill.   Now, there are probably lots of reasons for the current disconnect.  Nationally, I think it is in the millions of jobs that are going  begging, even as some people are having a hard time getting those good- paying jobs. But I was really impressed by the fact that you had in a  town where there were certainly surplus workers a steel plant looking  for more employees.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member and look forward  to working with him and his members. I know both of us feel strongly  about making sure that the members of the committee have an opportunity  to offer up their ideas, so I will begin. Again, the Chair won't be  yielding. I will just give a wave when I think maybe time is running  low.   Let me begin by inviting the gentlewoman from California, who really  has already made a dramatic contribution to the committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California. I  take real pleasure in welcoming the gentlewoman from Oklahoma to the  committee and invite her to make any remarks she would like to make.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Oklahoma.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig).                                time  2120     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota.   Madam Speaker, I am just going to note to the ranking member, I have  four members, a good, enthusiastic turnout, so we are going to need to  be a little disciplined with time, about roughly 2 minutes each.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his  generous comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore  of Wisconsin), another one of our stalwart midwesterners, who was with  us in Lorain, Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack)  for her remarks this evening.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida. We  may not totally agree on the role of government, but I am grateful to  her for really highlighting the importance of education which has been  the theme that we have heard a lot here tonight.   Batting cleanup, our last Member to hear from is our hostess from  Lorain, Ohio.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5868]]                                ____________________
