 Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   I would note that the underlying bill that we are considering today  includes a $2 million increase for a total funding level of $45 million  for colorectal cancer prevention activities at the CDC. Given the  increasing rate of colorectal cancer among younger adults, I am pleased  to support further expansion of CDC's efforts.   As a survivor of ovarian cancer, I thank the gentlewoman for raising  the issue of colorectal cancer and the importance of cancer screenings.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   I know we will have a discussion here, Madam Chair, about where the  dollars are coming from, but I would like to remind the gentleman from  Maryland that, last evening, the minority voted overwhelmingly for a 14  percent cut across the board, which, in fact, would have cut the  general departmental management by 14 percent, so I find this line of  opposition to be somewhat disingenuous.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in support of his amendment.   I commend the gentleman's efforts to highlight Lyme disease, which,  unfortunately, has spread to many States due to climate change. The  geographic area in which ticks can survive is increasing as milder  winters result in fewer disease-carrying ticks dying during the winter.   I am proud that our bill includes a $1 million increase, for a total  funding level of $13 million for the CDC to intensify efforts to  develop better diagnostics and to bolster critical prevention and  surveillance networks. This amendment would provide an additional $1  million increase.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   I might also add that, last evening, the fiscal year 2020 House bill  we spoke about provides $193 million for the Secretary of HHS'  administrative budget. Yet, last night, Republicans, including my  colleague, voted to cut that budget by 14 percent, which would have cut  the Secretary's budget by $27 million.   So the argument that is being made is a fantasy and really somewhat  disingenuous.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in support of this amendment and the Project School Emergency  Response to Violence, Project SERV, program.   The program provides counseling and referral to mental health  services, as well as other education-related services, to school  districts, colleges, and universities in which the learning environment  has been disrupted by a violent or traumatic crisis.   To strengthen this critical program, the underlying bill increases  the set-aside within the School Safety National Activities program by  $5 million over the 2019 enacted level.   I appreciate that the amendment is drawing attention to this  important program, and I am happy to support it.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in support of this amendment and of Comprehensive Literacy  Development grants, which help States and school districts provide  evidence-based literacy instruction for disadvantaged students from  birth through grade 12.   Literacy is a mark of a civilized society, and it is one of the most  important predictors of a student's success. To further advance  literacy skills for students across the country, the underlying bill  provides $195 million for Comprehensive Literacy Development grants, a  $5 million increase over the fiscal year 2019 enacted level.   I might add that the Trump administration cut this program, literacy,  and they also cut the innovative approaches to literacy, again, which  we have increased by $2 million. It may mean that they don't understand  that literacy is a mark of a civilized society. I appreciate that the  amendment is drawing attention to the importance of this program, and I  am happy to support it.    Madam Chair, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Pascrell) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Fletcher, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of Congressman  Pocan's amendment.   The administration's decision to forgo promising research to develop  treatments and cures for diseases such as HIV, ALS, and Parkinson's,  once again, is putting extreme personal ideology ahead of public  health.   Researchers have used fetal tissue in research for decades to develop  vaccines and cures for diseases such as polio and measles. The research  has saved millions of lives. That is what we are about, saving lives.   Research involving fetal tissue today is conducted subject to strict  guidelines that have lasted through both Democratic and Republican  administrations. This antiscience decision will stall medical research  in its tracks, reduce hope for those suffering from debilitating  diseases, and harm the ability of American scientists to continue to  lead global efforts on biomedical research.   The Trump administration has said that the Department of Health and  Human Services conducted an audit and scientific review of fetal tissue  research that led to this decision. Quite frankly, they refuse to make  the results of that review available to the Congress.   There is simply no scientific or ethical basis for the proposed  restrictions on this vital research. It is misguided. It is a dangerous  policy. It should be reversed.   Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Paterson with  one T.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment, and let  me reiterate ``bipartisan amendment.''   This amendment provides $10 million for a new program at the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for a newly  authorized demonstration program for hospitals and emergency  departments to develop, implement, or study alternatives to opioids for  pain management.   As our Nation continues to combat the opioid epidemic, this effort  would provide the opportunity to study and develop best practice pain  management strategies that involve nonaddictive medical products and  other types of treatments provided in our emergency rooms.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  amendment.  [[Page H4640]]         Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.
