 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, today, we are dealing with legislation that didn't  make sense on January 9, it didn't make sense on January 30, and it  doesn't make sense today.   Today marks the third time the House has considered a version of this  legislation in just 3 months. I am back to remind my colleagues that  our conflict is not with the Iranian people, but with their tyrannical  and murderous regime.   The Iranian Government, using agents like General Soleimani and the  IRGC, has been arming Shia militias, including Hezbollah and others  across the Middle East for decades. General Soleimani's organization  was responsible for the deaths of nearly 600 Americans.   This resolution offers safe harbor to those killers.   It offers safe harbor to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a  designated foreign terrorist organization.   It offers safe harbor to terrorist groups receiving advanced weapons  directly from the Iranian Government.   These forces are critical to the Ayatollah's clear goal of complete  influence over the entire Middle East.   But the American people know the regime's legacy. They know the  Ayatollah doesn't care about the bloody cost of its terrorism. The  legislation before the House today only paves the way for new Iranian  aggression.   Halting military operations and putting red tape on the Commander in  [[Page H1622]]  Chief does nothing to fix the problems in the Middle East.   I believe this resolution makes America less safe. It makes a mockery  of years of dedicated counterterrorism efforts.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' for the third time in 3 months on  coddling Iranian terrorists.
