 Mr. Speaker, America is stronger with  Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House.   Matthew Continetti, the founding editor of the Washington Free  Beacon, wrote in the Friday edition: ``Since becoming Speaker in  January, McCarthy has faced a test. Could he strike a fiscal bargain  with President Biden that would earn Republican support and avoid a  breach of the debt ceiling and a government shutdown? Well, the grade  is in. He aced the exam. . . . Kevin McCarthy is shaping up to be the  most effective House GOP leader in decades. . . . Kevin McCarthy is the  rare Republican who both understands and is satisfied by the role that  he has been given and the responsibilities it entails. He wants nothing  more nor less, and he is winning.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
