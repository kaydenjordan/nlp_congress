 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, community members came  together to celebrate the life of Lila Cabbil, affectionately known as  Mama Lila, or Ms. Cabbil, a dedicated and well-known activist and a  member of our community.   With genuine respect for her legacy, we join with the community in  celebrating Ms. Cabbil, remembering the impact she continues to have on  so many people and hold her tight to her family. She will be sincerely  missed and long remembered. Mama Lila lived to serve and advocate for a  better quality of life for her community.   Born in North Carolina and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Mama Lila  possessed a strong sense of justice and willingness to stand against  injustices. She became involved with the civil rights movement and was  a close friend of Rosa Parks.   Mama Lila soon became a prominent leader in the movement, becoming  the president of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self  Development. She has been a tireless advocate for economic and social  justice, as well as for food and water justice in the city of Detroit.   In addition, Mama Lila has served as an educator for younger  generations, advocating for greater social awareness and sensitivity.  She facilitated dialogue across cultures and built relationships in  order to address systematic oppression and combat racism.   We offer our words of praise as a memorial for Mama Lila. May her  family find comfort in their faith and their memories of this fine  person and her distinguished life.                            ____________________
