 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that the  cities of north Texas are frequently named some of the best places to  live in the whole country. Of course, this is no surprise to the folks  who live there.   There are many reasons that north Texas continues to draw people and  businesses to the area. These reasons include good schools and low  taxes, but people are also attracted to our business-friendly  environment. In fact, just last week, the Plano Chamber of Commerce was  nationally recognized as the  [[Page H7094]]  2018 Chamber of the Year. Now, that has to be outstanding.   I want to congratulate Jamee Jolly, the president of the Plano  Chamber, as well as the entire Plano Chamber of Commerce team, for all  your hard work to make our business community such a thriving success.   God bless you, and I salute you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good  friends, Representative Bishop, and Ranking Member Larson, for their  work on this commonsense bill.   I have heard firsthand how hard it can be for victims of identity  theft to work with the Social Security Administration.                                time  1530    Recently, a man told me about his experience of someone trying to  claim his benefit. First, he got a letter from Social Security telling  him to call them about his claim. He hadn't made a claim, so he called  Social Security at the number they gave him, and he never heard back.  Later, when he tried to file a claim of his own, he ended up having to  make four separate calls. Then, Social Security told him they couldn't  help him over the phone. Because of the fraudulent claim, they said he  had to go to a field office. As a result of all this hassling, he  decided to just put off filing his claim.   If this bill had been in place, he would have had someone in Social  Security to help him. Instead, he got the runaround. Having a single  point of contact at Social Security for victims of identity theft just  makes sense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Reichert,  Ms. DelBene, Mr. Cole, and Mr. Kilmer for introducing this commonsense  bill.   As chairman of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, I  held a hearing last year on Social Security coverage for some State and  local governments. During the hearing, we discussed how State and local  governments were initially excluded from Social Security. But over  time, the law was changed to provide State and local governments the  choice to extend Social Security coverage to their employees.   However, Tribal councils don't have this same option. The IRS and  Social Security have a rule that Tribal council members are not  eligible for Social Security coverage. That isn't right. Tribal  councils should be able to participate in Social Security if they want  to. The bill on the floor today fixes this by giving Tribal councils  the choice.   I also want to be clear that this bill does not mandate Social  Security coverage. Tribes will still have the ability to make their own  decision.   This bill treats Tribal council members fairly when it comes to  Social Security benefits and is the result of a request from several  Tribal councils. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. It is  a bipartisan bill.
