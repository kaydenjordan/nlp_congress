 Mr. Speaker, to Chairman Scott and the entire  Committee on Education and Labor, I thank you for the time and for your  hard work.   Mr. Speaker, as the former labor secretary from the State of  Delaware, I am proud to support the National Apprenticeship Act and  have my amendment to H.R. 447 before the House today.   My amendment would make improvements to the bill to expand pathways  for Americans to obtain good-paying jobs and ensure a diverse and  highly skilled workforce, which we need today more than ever.   This amendment will make certain that we engage schools which accept  Federal funds for students to promote apprenticeships for low-income  students, specifically title I schools.   It will coordinate with HHS to better support healthcare and  childcare jobs. It would ensure that nontraditional populations, such  as the Latino community, are represented in apprenticeship programs  and, finally, ensure that apprenticeship websites are user-friendly and  accessible to those with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is vital. As we, in America, are in the midst  of a pandemic, we know more than ever that jobs are important and that  our economic viability is paramount. This bill is also about  opportunity and improving the lives of Americans.   I stand in support of this bill, and I ask for your support on these  amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Third Way.                                                      Third Way,                                                   February 1, 2021.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: We are pleased to see that the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 is receiving a vote this       week on the House floor. With millions of Americans out of       work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is vital that       policymakers work toward an inclusive economic recovery.       That's why we encourage House lawmakers to pass the National       Apprenticeship Act of 2021, which would provide a much-needed       revamp of the nation's registered apprenticeship system.       Apprenticeships can play a key role in our economic recovery       and help people regain their footing in the job market.        Through your leadership, the National Apprenticeship Act of       2021 would take important steps to bolster apprenticeships       across the country. It would broaden economic opportunity by       expanding apprenticeships to women, people of color, and       people facing barriers to employment. The legislation would       help small and medium-sized businesses create apprenticeship       programs. Further, it would modernize our nation's       apprenticeship system by expanding apprenticeships in growing       fields like information technology, advanced manufacturing,       and health care.        The bill would also expand apprenticeships in part by       relying on intermediaries, or apprenticeship hubs, which       would bring together employers, education providers, unions,       and other organizations in each state that will work in       concert to expand apprenticeships. This is an approach Third       Way has long advocated for, and we're thrilled that it's a       key part of this legislation.        Through the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, this       country can promote apprenticeships as a key tool in our       economic recovery and ensure everyone has pathways to in-      demand, good-paying careers. We thank you and the House       Education and Labor Committee for your leadership on this       legislation and urge Members to support it.            Sincerely,                                                Gabriel Horwitz,                                              Senior Vice President,                                                         Third Way.
