 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, the Senate Judiciary  Committee, which I chair, held its hearing on the nomination of Judge  Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme  Court.   It was an opportunity to learn a lot about her: her qualifications,  her experience, her approach to cases, her judicial temperament, and  her temperament before the committee.   She proved to the public what many of us suspected and some knew: She  is, without a doubt, ready to serve on the Supreme Court.   I have spoken before about Judge Jackson's background and  qualifications, but some of it bears repeating because this is the  critical week before we consider her nomination next week on the floor  of the Senate.   She is the daughter of two school teachers, public school teachers.  Judge Jackson discovered her passion for the law at the age of 4. See,  her dad decided to give up teaching. He had another profession in mind;  he was going to become a lawyer. And so he would sit at the kitchen  table with his law books all stacked up, and Judge Jackson, at the age  of 4, would gather her coloring books and sit next to her daddy. She  was going to study too.   She believes that might have been the first time that she thought  seriously about becoming a lawyer.   After graduating from public high school in Miami--she had  distinguished herself as president of the student body and as the lead  on the high school speech and debate team. She competed nationally  successfully and visited the campus of Harvard University. She loved  it. She decided that she was going to apply to go to school there.   When she went back to her high school in Florida, she sat down with  her counselor to talk about that option. The counselor discouraged her;  she was aiming too high. But she did it anyway, and she was accepted  and then went on to Harvard Law School.   She has clerked at every level of the Federal judiciary. If you are  not a lawyer, that may not mean much; but if you are a lawyer, it is a  big deal. To think that she started off at the lowest Federal district  court level clerking for a judge, then was accepted to move up a level  to the circuit judge position to serve as a clerk as well, and then to  finally grab the gold ring of being a Supreme Court clerk to none other  than Justice Stephen Breyer whose vacancy she is hoping to fill.   She worked in private practice as a lawyer, and she proved that she  was a consensus builder all the way along. On the bench, she served as  a district court judge and now circuit court in the DC Circuit.   It is no surprise that she has won the admiration and friendship of  so many people throughout her career. In fact, she has come before the  same Senate Judiciary Committee on three separate occasions with her  background carefully reviewed and emerged with the approval of the  committee with bipartisan support.   In fact, when you look at it, if you watched last week's hearing  before the Judiciary Committee, no one questioned her qualifications,  her knowledge, her experience. She really has a platinum resume when it  comes to that.   On the final day of the hearing, the committee heard from Anne  Williams. Anne Williams is well-known to the Presiding Officer as well  as to myself. She served as a district court judge in the Northern  District of Illinois and then as a circuit judge on the Seventh  Circuit. I believe she was the first African-American woman to do so.   She is retired at this point, but she has volunteered with the  American Bar Association to do the careful review of Judge Jackson to  make certain that we know every comment that has been made by  professionals who have been familiar with her work experience.   Judge Williams is an anomaly politically. Those who are looking for  evidence as to whether she is Democrat or Republican, she was initially  appointed to the district court by President Reagan and then to the  circuit court by President Clinton--a bipartisan nominee all the way.   She came to report to the committee that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson,  who had been reviewed with careful personal interviews of 250 separate  individuals in her legal career, had emerged unanimously well-qualified  to serve on the Supreme Court.  [[Page S1791]]    Judge Williams said that in interviewing these lawyers and judges,  they asked the hard questions--the ones that you can ask in confidence  and in private--and the answers were all the same.   Judge Jackson has a career that has distinguished her as outstanding,  excellent, superior, superb, the list of accolades went on and on. The  ABA found that Judge Jackson has a sterling reputation for  thoughtfulness and collegiality and exceptional competence.   I also asked Judge Williams, serving as the spokesperson for the ABA,  to comment on the allegations that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is  somehow soft on crime. It is a common mantra coming from the other side  of the aisle. And I said, in the course of asking 250 different judges,  prosecutors, defense lawyers, and all the people who worked with and  around her, Was there any evidence that she was soft on crime? No.  None. None. That is amazing when you think that is the No. 1 talking  point against her from the Republican side of the aisle. ``None  whatsoever'' is exactly what Judge Williams said. Another ABA witness,  Jean Veta, said that the ABA ``heard consistently from not only defense  counsel, but [from] prosecutors'' of how unbiased Judge Jackson was  throughout her career.   And just as impressive as her qualifications was her performance and  candor before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If you ask her a question  about stare decisis, she will start responding by defining it in plain  English, just to make sure everybody at home, lawyer or nonlawyer, can  follow along. She expresses her thinking with surgeon-like precision,  which I am sure her husband, Dr. Patrick Johnson, who is an actual  surgeon at Georgetown University Hospital, deeply admires. Clarity and  impartiality, that is Judge Jackson.   During the hearing, several of my colleagues asked her to describe  her judicial philosophy. Pick a label: Are you an originalist; are you  a textualist; are you a liberal; are you a conservative? Previous  Supreme Court nominees like Chief Justice Roberts have said that they  do not have an ``overarching judicial philosophy'' that they bring to a  case.   That was a good enough answer for many Republicans if it was given by  Chief Justice Roberts or Justice Amy Coney Barrett, but they have  complained now that she just won't come up and admit to a label.   She did us one better. She gave a thorough, step-by-step explanation  of how she decided a case--every case--and she has some 580 separate  written opinions. You don't need an electron microscope to find this  judge's judicial philosophy. She has written it down and published it  over and over and over again.    She established her independence, she says, by ``clearing [her] mind  of any preconceived notions'' when she gets a case, sets aside her  personal views, evaluates the facts, listens to the arguments, and then  she interprets and applies the law, keeping in mind the limits of  judicial authority.   What I have just described is what she told the committee, and it is  exactly what we look for and should look for in every judge. I can't  recall ever hearing a nominee give such a clear and thorough  explanation of their approach to deciding a case. And Judge Jackson's  evenhanded record on so many different issues--criminal law, labor  relations, executive power--shows that it works.   Finally, the Judiciary Committee hearing allowed the public to  observe Judge Jackson's incredible judicial temperament. We spend a lot  of time as Senators with the authority under the Constitution to advise  and consent, interviewing nominees for courts, trying to determine just  what kind of a judge they will be. What will their temperament be? Will  they be all swollen and big-headed over this black robe and lifetime  appointment, or will they remember the real-life experiences that many  people in their courtroom have lived through?   Well, I can tell you, Judge Jackson's temperament has shown through.  Frankly, she was tested time and time again. You see, I might just go  out on a limb and tell you: There are some Senators that don't show a  very good temperament themselves under these circumstances. And they  tested her over and over and over again with baseless, wild charges,  some of which were just offensive on their face.   I listened to those, and I would look up and think, if she stands up  at this point and says, ``That's enough. I am taking my family, and I'm  going home,'' nobody would have faulted her for it--some of the  questioning was just that bad--but she didn't.   My Republican colleagues promised a fair and respectful hearing. The  majority of them, starting with Senator Grassley, did just that; and I  commended them for it today in the committee. They set an example of a  minority party with a Supreme Court nominee and how the questioning  should come down. Unfortunately, others, however, on that side of the  table did not.   But in the face of the constant badgering and interruptions,  offensive insinuations by a select few Republicans, Judge Jackson never  lost her composure--never. She was patient, calm, and dignified.   Many times, the questions were so mean-spirited. And I thought, there  sits her husband and her daughter listening to these charges on how she  is soft on crime and doesn't care about the plight of children. And  when you think about that, what they must think of to hear those things  said about the doctor's wife and the kid's mother. It is just hard to  take.   She was patient and kind. She didn't lose her temper at one time.  Some of my colleagues attended the committee's hearing intent on  tearing her down. It didn't work. Instead, she showed America that she  can rise to any challenge as a Justice on the Supreme Court.   And despite some of my colleagues' behavior in the committee  hearings, last week was an inspiration for so many people across this  country. I invited law students from Howard University and my alma  mater Georgetown Law to come over and sit through the hearing. We  invited interns from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. They  wanted to be there at this history-making moment.   They watched her prove that through hard work, a commitment to the  law, and in the words of Senator Booker, her grit and grace, she has  earned a seat on the highest Court in the land.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a  look at this woman and what she will bring to the Court.   It is time, America, after all these years, never having had an  African-American woman serve on the Court. It has got to be a challenge  to find somebody who is ready to take on the job and take on the  challenge. She can meet that challenge and will successfully. She is  the best and deserves our support.                        Remembering Madeleine Albright    On another topic, Madam President, last week, America and the world  lost another trailblazing woman and defender of justice and democracy-- and a friend.   Madeleine Korbel Albright came to the United States at age 11 as a  refugee. Her family had been driven out of their native Czechoslovakia  twice by murderous regimes, in 1938 by the Nazis and 10 years later by  the communists.   Those searing childhood upheavals helped to produce in this young  woman a lifelong vigilance against dictators and a fierce commitment to  democracy.   Her father had been a diplomat who received political asylum in  America. Like nearly all immigrants and refugees who come to this  country fleeing the tyranny of autocracy, he was keenly aware that this  was a land of freedom. He told his daughter many times, ``Americans  don't know how fragile their democracy is--and how resilient it is.''    She also knew persistent autocracy. It can rise at any age in any  nation. We see it today in the leadership of Russia. That is why we  must protect the rule of law, the most potent defense against  dictators.   In 1997, she made history. She became America's first woman Secretary  of State under President Clinton, previously serving as our Nation's  Ambassador to the United Nations. She was a hardline critic of tyrants  and despots who advocated the policy of assertive multilateralism, and  she called the United States ``the indispensable nation.''  [[Page S1792]]    She believed that the best hope for a free and peaceful world lay in  America, exercising leadership and working with the family of  Democratic nations to protect democracy, just as we are today in  Ukraine.   She was deeply committed to NATO. As Secretary of State, she  supported NATO expansion to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech  Republic--three nations that lived under the boot heel of Soviet  oppression. Today, all three nations are providing a haven for  Ukrainian civilians, mostly women and children, who are fleeing Putin's  unprovoked and barbaric war on that young democracy.   Madeleine Albright understood that any democracy could fall victim to  the siren song of autocracy if its citizens were not vigilant. After  her historic career in public service, she was chair of an organization  called the National Democratic Institute, helping young democracies  build independent court systems and a vibrant civil society.   She spoke to me about this important work and understood that for  democracies to endure, they must offer more than promises. In one of  her last interviews, Madeleine Albright offered a warning that we in  this Senate should be wise to remember. She said:         What is important is that democracy has to deliver. People       want to vote and eat. And therefore it is very important for       democracies, and certainly for the world's oldest, to       understand the rule of law--because corruption is the cancer       of democracy . . . The people need to be the beneficiaries of       [democracy].    Likely because of her family's own experience with fleeing tyranny,  Madeleine Albright was quicker than many at recognizing dictators when  she saw them. She first met Vladimir Putin in the year 2000, 1 year  after his meteoric rise from a mid-level, mediocre KGB apparatchik to  President of the Russian Federation. She recorded her first impressions  of Vladimir Putin over 20 years ago. She wrote:         Putin is small and pale, so cold as to be almost reptilian.    She went on to note presciently that Putin was ``embarrassed about  what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness.''   The violence and destruction that Vladimir Putin is willing to wage  in pursuit of this delusion to make Russia great again is now  horrifyingly obvious to the entire world.   Let me say at the outset: I have no quarrel with the people of  Russia. They are good people and have a great history. There were  chapters in there that were oppressive and terrible to their neighbors  and the countries that suffered under Stalin and the reach of the  Soviet Union. But at their heart, I believe the Russians are good  people. Sadly, I cannot say the same about their leader.   The brutal assault on Ukraine is now in its second month. Yesterday,  at the water tower in downtown Chicago, we had a rally for Ukrainians.  It was cold. This time of year, it is cold in Chicago. It was probably  30 degrees, and the wind was blowing. But what a crowd showed up-- several hundred people--many bearing Ukrainian flags and, of course,  proud of their Ukrainian heritage, but from so many other places as  well. Groups of people were there who were Indian Americans who wanted  to show support.   I was proud that the Baltic Americans--Lithuanians, Latvians,  Estonians--once again were there in force. I was also proud that the  Polish people came, because they have a special kinship to Ukraine at  this moment in history.   Poland is accepting more refugees from Ukraine than any other nation  and is making great personal sacrifice to do it.   As the Polish Ambassador told us 2 weeks ago, when people get off  that train for the first stop in Poland, finally, they are on safe  soil, out of Ukraine. They don't look for people--soldiers and police-- to guide them. What they find is that people are in their cars,  waiting, with the doors open, to bring them in even if they are total  strangers.   The Polish Ambassador said: You don't see any refugee camps in  Poland.   No. People are going into the homes of other Polish families and are  being welcomed into those homes.   He said: The reason we are feeling this way about our neighbors is  that, when it happened to us many years ago, no one would take us in.  We remember those days.   What a reminder to us in the United States.   You know, when the President said last week that he wants to accept  100,000 refugees from Ukraine, I applauded it, as did others, but just  for a point of reference, a nation of 5 million, known as Ireland, has  also agreed to accept 100,000 refugees. So the United States is showing  some charity, but we can do more. We shouldn't limit it just to  refugees from Ukraine. There are refugees from wars and calamities  around the world who also need an opportunity to be in a safe place.  The United States has enjoyed that reputation for almost 80 years, and  we did it after World War II. We should return to those days.   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees calculates that 10 million  Ukrainians--almost a fourth of the population--have been driven from  their homes and displaced--1 out of 4. Another 3.5 million Ukrainians  have fled to neighboring nations, especially to Poland. The city of  Warsaw alone is admitting 1,000 Ukrainian children to its schools every  day--1,000 Ukrainian kids a day into Poland.   Joe Biden, our President, understands the same truth that Madeleine  Albright saw--that the struggle between dictatorships and democracy did  not end with the defeat of Nazism or the fall of the Berlin Wall. It  continues in this century, and Ukraine is now the new frontline in this  old battle.   Critics of the President's will no doubt fixate on one unscripted  line of his speech in Poland. I say to those critics: Who among you has  not uttered the same thought? Who doubts for one second this world  would be more secure without the likes of such a tyrant?   The Russian people have to make that decision, and if they are given  the truth, I am sure they will make the right decision. That is why  Vladimir Putin is trying to control the media. The Russian people will  decide for themselves whether Putin stays or goes.   The duty of democracy is to make sure that people have the final word  as to their own destinies within their own borders. President Biden is  leading a historic effort of the NATO alliance on behalf of the people  of Ukraine. I salute him for his leadership.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader     Mr. President, last fall, Robert Juliano passed away at  the age of 80 after a lifetime of fighting on behalf of the restaurant  workers of America. For decades, he shaped and shepherded nearly every  piece of legislation that helped restaurant workers in the United  States. Along the way, he made extraordinary friendships with Members  of congress of both parties, Capitol Police, congressional staff, and  many of the people who make things work around here. Bob was to some  Bobby, others Cool Bobby J, and even Uncle Bobby, but most of all, I,  like so many others, called him our friend. In April, his union that  represents 300,000 hotel, restaurant, and other service workers across  the United States--known as UNITE HERE--will gather to celebrate the  man who, even with so many powerful friends, never stopped thinking of  himself as ``a kid from Taylor Street in Chicago.''   Bob was born in the City of Big Shoulders--Chicago--on the West Side,  to Emil and Mary Salvaria Juliano. He attended Saint Ignatius College  Preparatory, on Roosevelt Road, and Loyola University in Chicago. Both  are Catholic Jesuit institutions that taught him the importance of  service to one's community.   As a young man, he got his start as an elevator operator, eventually  working his way up to become the personnel manager of the legendary  Palmer House Hilton Hotel in downtown Chicago. Through his work at the  Palmer House, Bob met labor leaders and union members. This included  Edward Hanley, the leader in Chicago of HERE, which later became UNITE  HERE, representing the workers of the Palmer House. In 1973, Hanley  became the International President of HERE.   It was around this time that Bob met then-Mayor Richard J. Daley  through then-Chicago Alderman Vito Marzullo. These were the days when  Mayor Daley was a true political force. Mayor Daley immediately learned  a lesson we all have in the decades since. You could not help but like  Bob. The mayor called then-House Majority Leader Tip O'Neill and  endorsed Bob going to Washington, DC. With the support of Daley and  O'Neill, one of then-President Hanley's first acts was to name Bob as  HERE's first full-time legislative representative. He had no lobbying  experience, but Daley told him, ``Go to Washington. Everything's going  to be fine. You're in your mother's arms.''   It was the beginning of four decades of Bob's work on nearly every  major piece of labor legislation. He was proud to help guide the  passage of the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 that ensured coal miners  had access to the same health plan as Federal employees. Bob received  numerous honors throughout his life, and he was especially proud of his  honoree status with the Sons of Italy Foundation.   Bob was one of a kind; he was friends with such different people as  Senators Bob Dole, Ted Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, Sam Brownback, and myself.  We disagreed on a lot, but we could always agree on Bob. What made Bob  special was that he knew everyone--everyone from the chiefs of staff,  to the front desk assistants, to the food service workers, the Capitol  Police, and everyone in between. Bob cared about them, and he was known  to talk their ear off for an hour from time to time. From his days at  the Palmer House to his days in the Capitol, his hospitality was a  feature of who he was. Bob directly connected with people. He never  learned how to use a computer, but he was successful because of how he  treated people.   The late Cardinal Joseph Bernadin of Chicago called Bob his lobbyist.  All kidding aside, Bob's love of people is a great representation of  faith. Bringing people from all walks of life together with kindness is  something we all should work toward.   I will miss the kid from Taylor Street in Chicago. They do not make  them like Bob anymore, and we are lesser for it.   Robert E. Juliano is survived by his son, Robert E. Juliano, Jr.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
