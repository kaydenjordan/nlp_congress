 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for six  additional full floor access passes to be equally divided between the  majority and minority during the consideration of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act legislation, for the following staffers: from the majority  on the Finance Committee: Randy Herndon, Zach Rudisill, and Shay  Hawkins; from the minority on the Finance Committee: Ryan Abraham, Adam  Carasso, and Sarah Schneider.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, tonight I want to talk about the  opportunity we have before us in the Senate, and that is for tax reform  that can truly help our economy and help the middle-class families we  represent. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.   The last time we reformed our Tax Code in any substantial way was 31  years ago. Ronald Reagan was President and Pete Rose was still playing  for the Cincinnati Reds. That is how long ago it was. In 1986, tax  reform gave our economy a much needed shot in the arm, and it led to  more jobs and higher wages in the 1980s and 1990s. Now, 31 years later,  after a decade of disappointing growth and flat wages, we need that  shot in the arm again.   We need a tax code that better reflects the needs of today's workers,  today's families, and our 21st century economy. There is bipartisan  agreement that the Tax Code is broken--hopelessly broken--and it is up  to Congress to fix it. No one else can.   Through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act now before us, we have a chance in  the Congress to create a better economy and a better future. We have to  get this done for the people we represent. It starts with tax cuts for  the middle class. While the economy has seen some improvement recently,  and I saw some good numbers today for last quarter's growth, the people  I represent, hard-working Ohioans, and people across the country are  not feeling these benefits of a growing economy. For more than a decade  now, expenses have increased, including healthcare costs, which have  increased the highest, at a time when wages have been flat. When you  take inflation into account, wages have stayed relatively flat for  almost two decades. That increase in expenses and flat wages is the  middle-class squeeze, and people are feeling it.   For years, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been calling  for middle-class tax cuts to help ease this burden. The Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act will actually deliver. The proposal helps us in a lot of ways  but three main ways.   First, there is a doubling of the standard deduction. This is a  doubling  [[Page S7500]]  for families from $12,000 to $24,000. That means, for a lot of families  in America, the first $24,000 is a zero tax bracket. Two-thirds of  Ohioans already, by the way, use the standard deduction. The estimate  is, now that we are doubling it, over 90 percent of Ohioans will use  that standard deduction. That helps to keep the tax bill down but also  is a tremendous simplification of our Tax Code.   Second is the doubling of the child tax credit. That is in this  legislation. The American dream starts with the American family, and  parents shouldn't have to reconsider starting a family because of the  financial burden that comes with it. This doubling of the child tax  credit will help working families afford childcare and will help  strengthen middle-class family budgets all across the country. By the  way, it includes increasing the refundability of that tax credit for  taxpayers who don't have any income tax liability.   Third, of course, is lowering tax rates. There are tax rates that are  lowered all across the board for middle-class families. The independent  Tax Foundation estimates that the tax cuts in this proposal will save  an Ohio family at the median income level 2,375 bucks a year. That  almost $2,400 a year is a big deal. A lot of the people I represent and  others represent here in this Chamber are living paycheck to paycheck,  and this matters. More money staying in the pockets of working families  to make that car payment, to pay for healthcare, maybe put a little  money aside for retirement, is a big deal.    We also know from the Tax Foundation that the lower rates in this  plan will benefit families across middle-class income brackets. For  example, a family with two kids making $50,000 a year will see a 36- percent tax break, a 36-percent reduction in their tax liability. For a  family with two kids making about $85,000 a year, there is a 20-percent  reduction in their tax liability. And for a family with two kids making  about $165,000 a year, there is an 8-percent reduction in their tax  liability. So there is tax relief across the board, but the biggest  proportional tax cut goes to the folks who need it the most.   This chart shows this. For people who are in these income  categories--$20,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $100,00, $100,000 and  above--right now paying 4.3 percent in taxes from $20,000 to $50,000,  under this proposal, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and  the Tax Foundation, it goes down to 4.1 percent. So the burden is  reduced for people at the lower end. From $50,000 to $100,000, the  burden is also lower, from 16.9 percent to 16.7 percent. For those  people with $100,000 and above, the burden right now is about 78.7  percent. The top 10 percent of wage earners pay about 70 percent of the  taxes. That actually goes up from 78.7 to 78.9.   So this notion that we have heard today that somehow these middle- class tax cuts are not proportionally helping those at the lower end is  simply not true. This is the data. Go on jct.gov--Joint Committee on  Taxation--and look for yourself. Go on the Tax Foundation site, and you  can look at your family income, look at your situation, and determine  how doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, and  reducing tax rates will benefit you. The biggest proportional tax cuts,  again, go to people who need it the most.   In total, by the way, when these tax cuts are implemented, it is  estimated that approximately 3 million Americans who are currently  paying taxes will no longer be paying income taxes. They will be off  the rolls altogether. That is tax cuts for middle-class families, for  families who need it the most.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested  that our plan will hurt families with incomes below $30,000 because  there is a Joint Committee on Taxation report that, because of arcane  budget rules, counts repealing the individual mandate as a tax hike.  This is an interesting perspective, but I reject it because I don't  think stopping the ObamaCare individual mandate and people choosing not  to buy health insurance and therefore not having both the cost of the  Affordable Care Act and the ObamaCare tax credits that come with that  healthcare is a tax hike. In other words, what they are saying is that  because somebody doesn't choose to buy healthcare partly because it is  too expensive and therefore doesn't get the tax credits that come with  that, that somehow that is a tax hike. That doesn't make sense to me,  and I don't think it makes sense to most Americans.   What the Joint Committee on Taxation did say repeatedly at our  committee markup 2 weeks ago is that when you don't consider this  issue--again, choosing not to buy healthcare insurance a hike--that our  plan does give every single income group, including those under  $30,000, a tax cut. As noted earlier, the biggest percentage tax cuts  goes to those with lower incomes, and that is appropriate. Those are  the folks who need it the most.   What we do know is that right now the individual mandate is an  onerous tax by itself. The Supreme Court has called it a tax. It is a  tax on people that disproportionately affects lower to middle-class  Americans. In fact, 80 percent of the individual mandate falls on folks  making less than $50,000 a year and their families. In Ohio, by the  way, that figure is about 83 percent. Eighty-three percent of that  individual mandate tax falls on people in households that make less  than $50,000 a year.   Getting rid of this penalty removes the financial burden unfairly  affecting those working families, and then we use the savings from  that, that the Congressional Budget Office says we get from this, to  increase the child tax credit and to reduce tax rates on the middle  class. That is one reason we have better middle-class tax cuts in our  bill.   Providing immediate relief to the family budget is incredibly  important, but beyond that, the tax reforms on the business side will  make American workers and companies more competitive, create more jobs  and better wages, and that, to me, is just as important in terms of  helping middle-class families in my home State of Ohio. Why? Because  when you reform the business tax code to make it competitive, the  benefit goes to workers and working-class families all over this  country.   The United States now has the highest corporate tax rate in the  industrialized world. One study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office estimates that workers bear 70 percent of the burden of our  corporate tax rate being so high. Others say it is less than that, and  others say it is more than that, but all say that workers benefit. If  we lower that rate below the average of the other industrialized  countries, our workers will benefit through higher wages and better  benefits. And by the way, that benefits middle-class families well  beyond these direct tax cuts we were talking about earlier.   A recent study by Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, said that if we  had had the tax rate that we have in this proposal--a 20-percent tax  rate--on these businesses, if we had had that in place since 2004,  there would be 4,700 more U.S. companies today. Let me repeat that.  They are saying that 4,700 companies that were American companies have  become foreign companies because of our Tax Code, and if we had put in  place these changes back 13 years ago, those companies would still be  American companies, hiring more American workers, and investing more  money here.   We did some research on this, some investigation in the Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations over the past few years, and we  determined that, in fact, when companies are taken over by a foreign  company because of our Tax Code or when U.S. companies choose to go  overseas and invert because of our Tax Code, what happens? We lose  jobs, and we lose investment here in this country. It matters, and it  matters a lot to the communities where those employees are lost and  where those businesses have left. The 20-percent tax rate is going to  mean more jobs and more investment coming right here to this country  instead of going overseas.   It is also true that there will be more foreign investment here.  Companies are now trying to decide whether they are going to invest in  America or whether they are going to invest in some other country with  a lower tax rate, and with the expensing we have in this bill, to be  able to write down new investments they are making, it is going to  encourage them to make an investment here in the United States  [[Page S7501]]  rather than in other countries. That will increase jobs too.   By the way, the Tax Foundation estimates that because of the new  investment and the higher productivity that comes with it because of  this tax reform proposal, we will create nearly 1 million new Americans  jobs and more than 35,000 jobs alone in my home State of Ohio.   In addition to providing relief for middle-class families and making  business rates more competitive for American companies and workers,  this tax reform does a lot to level the playing field internationally.  This is very important. Right now, American workers are forced to  compete with one hand tied behind their back because of our Tax Code. A  broken tax code is something that must be fixed because it is  irresponsible to tell the American people: You have to get out there  and compete, but guess what--your foreign competitor has a big  advantage over you.   It is crazy that Congress has allowed this opportunity to go by for  so many years. The situation where companies are actually encouraged to  move overseas and keep their profits overseas makes no sense. Right  now, it is estimated there is between $2.5 trillion and $3 trillion of  earnings trapped overseas because of this outdated Tax Code. Think  about that. That money can come back here and be invested here in  plants and jobs and equipment. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act says to those  companies: We want your money back here. We want you to invest in  America. The result will lift the economic condition of our entire  country.   This week, 137 of the country's leading economists wrote an open  letter to Congress in support of this tax reform bill. These former  heads of government agencies, leaders of economic policy groups, and  leading academics said, quite simply:         Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs       Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better       standard of living for the American people.    That is by 137 economists in an open letter. I encourage you to take  a look at it online. These are people who understand what the impact of  the policy we make here is going to be on decisions that are being made  all around the country.   We can debate the exact growth amount that will result from this  bill, and we will have a spirited debate on that this week, but we all  have to agree that this will help to grow the economy if we are  following basic economic theory.   By the way, their letter also states that ``$1 trillion in new tax  revenue for the federal government can be generated by four-tenths of a  percentage in GDP growth.'' In other words, what they are saying is  that if there is just a slight increase in economic growth because of  this tax reform bill, compared to the number we have to use here, that  this will result in actual new revenue coming in to the government to  pay down the debt. I am convinced that is going to happen for a very  simple reason. We have to use a very low number on economic growth.  Under our rules, we have to use a CBO--Congressional Budget Office-- number of 1.9 percent economic growth over the next 10 years. By the  way, the average over the past 30 years has been 2.5 percent. We just  learned today that the average last quarter was 3.3 percent. The  average the quarter before that, the second quarter, was 3.1 percent.   This tax reform proposal will help to actually increase economic  growth, but even if you don't believe that, 1.9 percent economic growth  is unacceptable. We cannot accept that as a country. We can and must do  better than that. We will do better than that, and this tax reform  proposal will be one reason. So I am convinced that the four-tenth's  increase--up to 2.3 percent--is still very conservative and that we  will be able to do better than that, as we have over the past 30 years,  as we have traditionally in this country.   When you hear my colleagues on the other side talk about this bill  being bad for the deficit, I think you ought to think about that. This  means that they are resigning themselves to 1.9 percent economic  growth. That, to me, is not acceptable for our country, and I don't  think that is what we will see.   Of the $44 trillion in new revenue estimated to be coming in over the  next 10 years, yes, out of that amount, we are suggesting $1.5 trillion  be a tax cut relative to that, again, very low economic growth of 1.9  percent.   About a third of that, by the way, is by simply using what we should  use, which is the right policy baseline, so you end up with about $1  trillion in tax relief. And again, over 10 years, with $44 trillion  coming in and with what the economists are saying about it generating  more revenue through economic growth, I am convinced we are going to do  better than that 1.9 percent.   I believe the pro-growth changes in this bill will help drive  economic growth in ways that help every American family. We are in a  position now, if we pass this bill, to be able to help all the people  who are now looking at a tough time making ends meet--it is difficult  for a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck--but it will also help  to grow the economy generally.   Businesses and organizations all around the country are supporting  this legislation because they believe it is going to help American  families. We have about 120 groups already as of yesterday who are  supporting us: the National Federation of Independent Business, which  is the group that represents most of the small businesses in America;  the Family Business Council, which represents a lot of small businesses  that will benefit greatly from the changes we have not just with the  corporation rate but also with how we deal with companies that are  considered to be passthrough companies, the smaller companies. The  National Retail Federation is strongly in support of this bill. The  Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council supports this reform plan  and the opportunities it has to create more economic growth for small  businesses, to let them be more competitive.   You can look at some of the groups here, some of the roughly 120  groups that are supporting this legislation. Why? Because they know it  is going to help. Big businesses will benefit and be more competitive;  therefore their workers can compete. Through these pro-growth policies,  small businesses are going to be able to grow and be more  entrepreneurial, to come up with more innovations and expand  employment.   We can estimate the savings for the middle-class family in every tax  bracket, as I said, but what can't be measured as easily is the  economic boost this is going to have for everybody. We are giving  families freedom to spend more of their own money the way they see fit.  We are putting faith in the American entrepreneurs and businesses to  compete in a global market. We are bringing back some of that money  that is locked up overseas. We are creating a fairer tax system that  encourages jobs and investment here in this country rather than  overseas. That is all good stuff.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is made in America and it is made for  America. We need to come together now as a Congress--and I hope we will  get support from the other side of the aisle as well--to pass this  once-in-a-generation legislation to benefit our country.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Massachusetts.
