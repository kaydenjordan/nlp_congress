 Madam President, I have conducted further oversight into  the treatment of military families in privatized housing at Fort  Gordon, GA. The report summarizing the findings and conclusions of my  oversight can be found at http://Ossoff.senate.gov/ MilitaryHousingOversight.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to commend Nichole  Campbell, a leader in the Augusta community working to empower women in  business and give back to others.   In 2018, Ms. Campbell founded The Sisters Social, Inc., a nonprofit  organization that aims to unite women of different backgrounds and  provide entrepreneurial education, professional networking, and  community outreach. After seeking out an organization of women business  owners and failing to find one in her community, Ms. Campbell stepped  up to found The Sisters Social, Inc., for women in Augusta and the  Central Savannah River Area, CSRA. During the pandemic, the group  provided countless business owners with invaluable advice during a  challenging time for many.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend and recognize Nichole Campbell  on her leadership and great successes empowering women business owners  and giving back to her community.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to commend Reverend  Dr. J. H. ``Johnny'' Flakes III for his mentorship and leadership in  the Chattahoochee River Valley.   Like his father before him, Pastor Flakes III has become a mainstay  at Fourth Street Missionary Baptist Church and in the greater Columbus  faith community. As a student, Pastor Flakes III earned the distinction  of being one of 21 students chosen by the Interdenominational  Theological Center at Morehouse School of Religion for inclusion in  ``Who's Who Among Students in American Universities'' across the United  States. Alongside his work as a local spiritual mentor, Pastor Flakes'  work has also made an impact nationally and internationally, delivering  the keynote address at the American Baptist College convocation in  Nashville and speaking at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security  Cooperation's event on Black health and wellness, where he celebrated  the legacy of Black scholars and medical practitioners in Western  medicine with other leaders from the faith and medical communities.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Pastor J.H. Flakes  III for his mentorship, leadership, and enduring commitment to the  people of Columbus.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to commend Sister  Theresa Sullivan of Macon, GA, and her entire team for their dedication  and commitment to serve those in need across Middle Georgia.   As Director of Daybreak Day Resource Center Macon, Sister Sullivan  oversees the organization's mission to ensure that everyone has a place  to call home and a stake in their community. Growing up on the North  Side of Chicago, Sister Sullivan found a passion for volunteering as a  member of the Daughters of Charity, dedicating her time to helping  people experiencing mental illnesses. From housing placement, to food  and transportation assistance and a free health clinic, Sister Sullivan  brings members of the community together to help those experiencing  homelessness receive vital services to help them overcome their current  situation. Their partnerships with religious organizations, businesses,  and  [[Page S1133]]  community leaders keep the mission alive to support people experiencing  homelessness.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Sister Theresa  Sullivan and her team for their dedication and service to the Macon  community.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to commend Ms.  Evelyn ``Mimi'' Woodson for her lifetime of public service on behalf of  her beloved Latino community and her constituents in Columbus, GA.   A native of Puerto Rico, Councilor Woodson became the first Latina  elected to office in Georgia and went on to serve on the Columbus  Council for over 28 years. Councilor Woodson's public service career  extends beyond her remarkable leadership on the Columbus City Council.  For 15 years, she served our country honorably in the U.S. Army and was  one of the last members of the Women's Army Corps.   The contributions of Georgia's Latino community have brought people  across Georgia together to address some of the greatest challenges  facing our State, and Councilor Woodson's career is a testament that  positive change is possible if you believe in yourself and open doors  of opportunity for others.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Councilor Evelyn  ``Mimi'' Woodson for her dedication to Georgia and the Columbus  community.                            ____________________
