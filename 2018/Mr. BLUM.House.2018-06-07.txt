 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 1869) to reauthorize and rename the  position of Whistleblower Ombudsman to be the Whistleblower Protection  Coordinator, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
