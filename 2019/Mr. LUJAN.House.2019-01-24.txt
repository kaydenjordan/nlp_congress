 Madam Speaker, the pain from this Trump shutdown is being  felt deeply in every corner of my district in New Mexico and across  America.   We have farmers and ranchers that are unable to plan for their  production. Tribal communities are facing disruptions in their  healthcare services. People are not getting urgent questions answered  by the IRS, and some families are worried that there are going to be  liens put on their homes.   A local health clinic in my district, the Pecos Valley Medical Center  had their Federal loan halted, even though the project has been  approved, which means they can't draw down on funds. This means they  will have to pause their efforts to expand access to mental healthcare  and it could jeopardize the project.   Over 800,000 families, individuals across America are not being paid.  Over 150,000 veterans that are furloughed, some of them are working  without being paid. Chef Jose Andres is feeding thousands of people who  are lining up just down the street between here and the White House.   Madam Speaker, I say to the President, come outside and go see what  Chef Andres is doing. These families are hurting. End this shutdown. It  can end today.                            ____________________
