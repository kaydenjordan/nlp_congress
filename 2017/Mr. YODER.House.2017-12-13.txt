 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  helping children who, through no fault of their own, have no health  insurance. These are children who are ineligible for Medicaid, and  their family cannot afford private insurance. CHIP, or Children's  Health Insurance Program, helps these children receive coverage.   In Kansas, more than 79,000 vulnerable children are enrolled in CHIP.  That is why I have worked to preserve and strengthen it during my time  in Congress.   Last month, I voted for reauthorizing CHIP for 5 more years, through  2022. This invaluable benefit to kids in Kansas and across the country  was included as part of a bipartisan bill called the CHAMPIONING  HEALTHY KIDS Act, which passed the House last month and now awaits  further action in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass  this bill and reauthorize the important CHIP program to ensure that  families and children who rely on this program remain covered.                            ____________________
