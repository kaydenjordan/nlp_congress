 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment today is simple. It clarifies that  projects to address harmful algal blooms are eligible for priority  funding under the climate change adaptation, preparedness, and response  program created by the underlying bill.                                time  1615    Last year, the State of Florida was ravaged by simultaneous outbreaks  of red tide and blue-green algae. Floridians across the State were  forced to endure threats to their health. Dead fish, dolphins, and  Florida's iconic manatees washed up on our beaches in droves, and an  awful and inescapable stench drifted inland for miles.   In Florida, our waterways and natural resources are our livelihoods,  but these harmful algae blooms threaten that. According to a damage  assessment from the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, businesses in  the 12 most impacted counties lost over $130 million in 4 short months,  and at least 300 hardworking Floridians lost their jobs as a direct  result of these outbreaks.   This is not just a seasonal nuisance. These outbreaks are a threat to  Florida's environment and to our very way of life. As our State still  struggles to recover from last year's disaster, another red tide  outbreak is happening right now.   The reality is that these outbreaks will only get worse as our  climate changes and our oceans warm. It is imperative that any program  to help prepare our communities for the impacts of climate change also  includes initiatives to address harmful algae blooms such as red tides.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the bipartisan sponsors of my  amendment: the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rooney); the gentlewoman  from Oregon, Chairwoman Bonamici; the gentlewoman from Ohio, Chairwoman  Kaptur; and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings). I would also  like to thank the Rules Committee for making my amendment in order.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment  as well as the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
