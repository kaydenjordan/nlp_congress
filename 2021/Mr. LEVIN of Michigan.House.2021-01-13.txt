 Madam Speaker, for 2 months, Donald Trump used  the biggest megaphone in the world to organize a campaign of outright  lies to overturn a free and fair election. On January 6, he summoned  and incited a mob of domestic terrorists to fight like hell and sent  them to ransack this Capitol in order to prevent us from formalizing  his election loss. It was a grotesque orgy of deadly white supremacism,  anti-Semitism, and strongman rule.   Today, we will do our duty and vote to remove the author of this  horrifying chapter and banish him from public service.                                time  1430
