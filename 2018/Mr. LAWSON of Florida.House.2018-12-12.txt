 Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 years, serving on  the Agriculture Committee, we worked on the farm bill. But also, in my  district, which is so important and critical, we have had two  hurricanes. The resources that we have had from previous farm bills  were very significant. We just got over Hurricane Michael, which has  caused a lot of damage throughout my district.   But the most important issue, even the other things that we are doing  for farmers in this, is about food insecurity. When I talk about food  insecurity, I talk about going into my area where 100 percent of  students are on free and reduced lunch, and the farm bill takes care of  that.   I congratulate my leader and my chairman over here for their work and  the hard work they put in to make this a reality.   Also in this farm bill is money for HBCUs, historically African  American universities, to do more research and to get more involved so  that we can feed America.   I am so proud and ask all of my colleagues to vote positively for  this farm bill, because one great President said: ``The world will  little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never  forget what they did here.''   I can tell you that when we vote for this bill, people in need-- farmers, all those people in this bill, the Forest Service and  everything--will never forget what we did here, and I encourage you.
