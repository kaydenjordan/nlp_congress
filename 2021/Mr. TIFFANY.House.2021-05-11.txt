 Mr. Speaker:       I do not like the cancel mob.      I do not like the groupthink blob.      We should not censor our own speech.      That's not a habit we should teach.      This isn't China or Iran.      Free speech belongs to every man.      This right belongs to women, too.      To teachers, students, me and you.      Don't let them tell you what to say.      Or what to think or how to pray.      America's for you and me.      For Dr. Seuss--not Jack Dorsey.      I thank the Speaker for the time.      And hope you liked my free speech rhyme.
