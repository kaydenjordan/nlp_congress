Transmittal No. 22-37       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Paveway II (PWII) is a maneuverable, free-fall Laser       Guided Bomb (LGB) that guides to a spot of laser energy       reflected off the target. The LGB is delivered like a normal       General Purpose (GP) warhead and the semi-active guidance       corrects for many of the normal errors inherent in any       delivery system. Laser designation can be provided by a       variety of laser target markers or designators. A LGB       consists of a non-warhead specific MAU-209 or MAU-169       Computer Control Group (CCG) and a warhead specific Air Foil       Group (AFG) that attaches to the nose and tail of the GP bomb       body respectively.        a. The GBU-12 is a 500LB GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-      650 AFG to guide to its laser designated target.        b. The GBU-10 is a 2000LB GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-      651 AFG to guide to its laser designated target. The inert       GBU-12 uses a BDU-50 inert bomb body and MAU-169 CCG for       training purposes.        2. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) is a guidance       set which converts unguided bombs into an accurate, adverse       weather ``smart'' munition. The Guidance Set consists of a       Tail Kit, which contains the Inertial Navigation System (INS)       and a Global Positioning System (GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces       and an umbilical cover, which allows the JDAM to improve the       accuracy of unguided, general purpose bombs. The JDAM weapon       can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at high or low       altitudes against a variety of land and surface targets       during the day or night. The JDAM is capable of receiving       target coordinates via preplanned mission data from the       delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR,       Radar, etc.) during captive carry, or from a third-party       source via manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry. The       Guidance Set, when combined with a warhead and appropriate       fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU).        a. The GBU-38 is a 500LB bomb body fitted with a KMU-572       guidance kit.        b. The GBU-31 is a 2000LB bomb body fitted with a KMU-556       guidance kit.        3. The Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) is a JDAM       that incorporates all the capabilities of the JDAM guidance       tail kit and adds a precision laser guidance set (DSU-38 or       DSU-40). The LJDAM gives the weapon system an optional semi-      active laser guidance in addition to the INS/GPS guidance.       This provides the optional capability to strike moving       targets. The GBU-54 is a 500LB bomb body fitted with a laser       guidance set and KMU-572 guidance kit.        4. The KGV-135A is a high-speed, general purpose encryptor/      decryptor module used for wide-band data encryption.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. I. a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Singapore can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        8.

It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist Japan in developing and maintaining a       strong and effective self-defense capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Eagle Passive Active       Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) is an advanced all-      digital EW suite which provides the F-15 with fully       integrated radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness,       and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface       and airborne legacy, current, and future threats in highly       contested, dense signal environments. EPAWSS is equipped with       advanced Radio Frequency (RF) Electronic Countermeasures       (ECM), enabling deeper penetration against modern integrated       air defense systems and providing rapid response capabilities       designed to protect the aircrew.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       UNCLASSIFIED.
