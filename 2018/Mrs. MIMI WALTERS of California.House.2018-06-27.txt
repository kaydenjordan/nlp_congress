 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share  the heartbreaking story of an Orange County father named Randy Collins.  On March 3, 2003, Randy and his wife welcomed their son, Keisuke, to  the world.   Following their divorce, Randy became concerned that his ex-wife  would flee with their son to her home country, Japan. The California  court system agreed and granted a temporary retraining order on foreign  travel for their son. Unfortunately, this did not prevent the abduction  from taking place.   I first met Randy during my time in the California State Senate when  we worked together on legislation to prevent future international  parental child abductions. I am proud the bill, named Keisuke's Law in  honor of Randy's son, passed the State legislature unanimously and was  signed into law on September 7, 2012.   This month marks 12 years since Randy, a loving and devoted father,  last saw his son. Japan continues to have one of the worst records in  returning abducted children like Keisuke to the United States.    Mr. Speaker, as the mother of four, I can only imagine the pain that  Randy must feel missing each passing milestone of his son's life. This  is a grave injustice, and I will continue to support Randy and all  families whose children have been wrongfully abducted.                         Remembering Duncan Gigerich     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory  of Duncan Gigerich whose life was tragically cut short on June 9, 2018.   Duncan was only 19 years old at the time he passed away, yet he  demonstrated maturity well beyond his years. As a high school football  player, Duncan demonstrated leadership skills both on and off the  field. Duncan just returned from a semester abroad in New Zealand where  he studied the country's natural history and culture while learning  invaluable outdoor leadership and survival skills. He was undoubtedly  full of life and eager to embark on each new adventure before him.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincerest condolences to the Gigerich and  Dirk families and to all those who were fortunate enough to know  Duncan. His memory will live on through the many friends, family, and  places that experienced Duncan's loving spirit and immense appreciation  for the outdoors.   May he rest in peace.            Congratulating Deputy Chief Garaven on his Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor  of Paul Garaven on his retirement from the Tustin Police Department.   Deputy Chief Garaven has served over 30 years at the Tustin Police  Department beginning in 1987 as a part-time volunteer reservist. Since  then, he has held numerous positions within the department, including  time spent undercover with the special investigations unit.   No matter the title Deputy Chief Garaven held, he devoted every day  of his career to making the city of Tustin  [[Page H5754]]  a safer and better place for all. On July 3, Deputy Chief Garaven will  end his long and impressive career at the Tustin Police Department.   Thankfully, the image of a young undercover officer will remain to  inspire the next generation of officers at the police department to  strive for greatness in everything they do.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Deputy Chief Garaven on  an outstanding 30-year career serving the city of Tustin. I wish him  the absolute best as he begins the next great chapter of his life.                            ____________________
