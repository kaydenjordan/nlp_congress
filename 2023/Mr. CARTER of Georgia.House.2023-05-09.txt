 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Mary Jean Greco. Jeannie was born in 1955 in Hazelton, Pennsylvania.   As the daughter of two medical professionals, she always knew she  wanted to devote her life to the service of others. Her professional  career consisted  [[Page H2143]]  of many healthcare roles, including being a tech in her father's  surgical suite and selling medical equipment for some of the top  manufacturers in the country.   Outside of her professional career, she was always involved in local  issues and advocacy. A devout Catholic, she would pray the rosary every  morning before beginning her day.   A stranger to no one, Jeannie was well known for her ability to work  a room and make friends with ease.   Spending time with her family was her favorite activity. She traveled  often, especially to visit her sister, who lives in Hawaii. The two of  them went around the world, including stops in Russia and Cuba.   My thoughts and prayers are with the entire Greco family and anyone  who had the joy of knowing Jeannie.             Celebrating the Life of James Alexander Atwood, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of  James Alexander Atwood, Sr., a great husband, loving father, and proud  American.   James was born in December 1925 in Sumrall, Mississippi. In 1942, at  the age of 17, he enlisted in the Navy and served with honor and  distinction through World War II and the Korean war.   He retired from the Navy in 1965 with the rank of chief hospital  corpsman. James was rewarded the Good Conduct Medal with four stars,  the WWII Victory Medal, and the United Nations Service Medal.   After his career with the Navy, James went on to be a successful  pharmaceutical sales rep in Winston, Georgia.   An avid traveler, he visited 43 countries and even had tea with the  future King of England, Prince Charles III. In 2004, James and his wife  of 49 years, Louise, relocated to the Golden Isles.   He is survived by his wife, son, three grandchildren, and three  great-grandchildren.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the Atwood family during this  difficult time.                  Celebrating the Achievements of Ken Griner     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of Ken Griner as he is inducted into the Greater Savannah  Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2023.   Ken is a Savannah native, playing football and baseball for Savannah  Christian before going off to Brewton-Parker Junior College and then to  the University of Georgia, where he was a standout baseball player.   On the gridiron, Ken went 24-4 as the starting quarterback at  Savannah Christian, and on the diamond, he was the most valuable player  and team captain. At the University of Georgia, his batting average was  .317, and he was a stellar defensive player.   After graduating from the University of Georgia, Ken began a  distinguished 35-year career in TV broadcasting, working for three  different Savannah stations. For the last decade, he has been in  various roles at the local Savannah CBS affiliate, WTOC, including  anchor, cohost, and sports reporter.   On top of his on-the-air duties at WTOC, Ken is also the director of  broadcasting at Calvary Day School.   Congratulations to Ken and to all the inductees for this year's  Greater Savannah Athletic Hall of Fame.                     Celebrating the Life of Walter Dumas     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Walter Dumas, a great husband, loving father, and proud  American.   I had the privilege of knowing Mr. Dumas, and I last saw him 2 days  before his passing at the Stand Up for America Day parade in Port  Wentworth.   Mr. Dumas was born in May 1922 in McRae, Georgia. He served his  country with honor and distinction during World War II as a proud  member of the United States Army. At the end of the war, he was in  Tokyo Harbor when the Paris Peace Treaties were signed.   Mr. Dumas was an avid outdoorsman, gardener, and fan of the Atlanta  Braves. He was a faithful member of my home church, the Port Wentworth  United Methodist Church, and he remained a member of the Frank F. Baker  Masonic Lodge for 70 years.   He was preceded in death by his loving wife of 66 years, Pollie, my  school bus driver. Survived by his three children, five grandchildren,  nine great-grandchildren, and one great-great-granddaughter, Mr. Dumas  is certain to be dearly missed.   My sincerest condolences are with the Dumas family during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Larry ``Gator'' Rivers, a great man, fantastic athlete, and public  servant.   Gator was born on May 6, 1949, in Savannah, Georgia. During his  sophomore year at Alfred Beach High School, Gator was part of the  first-ever all-African-American team to win the Georgia high school  basketball State championship.   The team went on to win two more State titles, bringing Gator's total  to three State titles. After his dominating high school career at  Alfred Beach High School, Larry went on to play at Mobley Junior  College and Missouri Western State University.   After college, he tried out and impressed the scouts for the Harlem  Globetrotters. For 15 years, Gator toured with the Globetrotters as a  dribbler for the team.   After his career with the Globetrotters, Larry went on to coach at  the high school level and created his own training program, Gatorball  Academy.   In 2008, Gator moved back to Savannah and continued to run Gatorball  Academy in conjunction with volunteering at the Frank Callen Boys and  Girls Club.   In 2020, he decided to run for a seat on the Chatham County  Commission. He was well known for trying to bring more professional  sports to Savannah.   Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the Rivers family.   To my friend, we will miss you. You will always be with us.                            ____________________
