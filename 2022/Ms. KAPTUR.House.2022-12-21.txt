 Madam Speaker, I rise for two reasons.   First, as founding cochair of the Ukraine Caucus, I rise to express  gratitude to our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, for extending the invitation to  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address our Congress in this  beloved House tonight. What a consequential moment in world history his  remarks will elucidate.   Our Ukraine Caucus, which is bipartisan, will warmly welcome him as a  brother in the cause of liberty.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the names of Members of our  bipartisan caucus.                     Congressional Ukraine Caucus Members       Ami Bera (CA-07)      Gus Bilirakis (FL-12)      Jamaal Bowman (NY-16)      Brendan Boyle (PA-02)      Julia Brownley (CA-26)      Vern Buchanan (FL-16)      Michael Burgess (TX-26)      Kat Cammack (FL-03)      Andre Carson (IN-07)      Matt Cartwright (PA-08)      Sean Casten (IL-06)      David Cicilline (RI-01)      Steve Cohen (TN-09)      Gerry Connolly (VA-11)      Jim Costa (CA-16)      Joe Courtney (CT-02)      Jason Crow (CO-06)      Danny K.

The Great Lakes watershed is the only region in our Nation without an  economic instrumentality helping it to adjust to changing economic  conditions--the only place in this country. The Great Lakes Authority  will unlock the economic heartland's full potential for the century  ahead.   The Midwest communities that I represent are home to the people who  make, build, and grow what makes, builds, and grows America.   For decades, however, our region has borne the brunt of job losses,  largely the direct result of disastrous trade policies,  underinvestment, and deindustrialization.   Since the passage of NAFTA in 1993, then China's entrance into the  World Trade Organization in 2001, and CAFTA's passage in 2005, over  91,000 factories have closed across America--most in the region that I  represent. Millions of good-paying jobs have been snuffed out.                                time  1230    Middle-class workers and families in the Great Lakes region,  including Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota,  Illinois, and New York, have suffered as good-paying jobs disappeared.  Too many communities have been shattered.   The tragedy does not end there. Local governments have been left  scrambling as declining revenues led to the collapse of budgets and the  accumulation of crushing bonded indebtedness.   The size and scope of these accumulated economic challenges are too  much for any one city or State to overcome alone. Places like Toledo,  Lorain, Detroit, Buffalo, Flint, places with hardworking people  throughout the region, have been scarred and struggle still to recover  from the outsourcing of manufacturing and shipping jobs, including in  agriculture, to penny-wage countries.   Meanwhile, impacted towns like Chicago, Erie, Pennsylvania, and  Cleveland, Ohio, are limited in their ability to halt climate change  and reverse its effects on their shorelines and natural habitats.   The Great Lakes region, the largest body of freshwater on Earth,  needs accelerated investments and strategic support to get back on  track.   Last year, in a bipartisan manner, this Congress accomplished what  many had tried but failed to do: pass a historic investment in jobs and  infrastructure. Billions of dollars are already on their way to some  places, but we need to accelerate them to this region.   These dollars will empower our communities to rebuild roads and  bridges; improve ports, rail lines, and airports; modernize energy and  water infrastructure; and protect Lake Erie and the adjoining Great  Lakes, which is the freshwater kingdom of the world and our continent.   All of this funding, every penny, is an investment in good-paying  jobs. But to maximize the impact and turbocharge revitalization, our  region needs a strategic plan to marshal these resources, work  together, and invest for the future.   The Great Lakes region is the largest region in America that lacks  such a Federal entity, and we can see where the West's water is served  by the Bureau of Reclamation. The Delta Regional Authority helps 10  million people in the Delta region, and more than 400 counties from  Mississippi to West Virginia are served by the Appalachian Regional  Commission. Our region has long needed such an entity.   The Great Lakes authority will be a Federal-State mechanism created  by us, the Congress, to spur creation of jobs and establish world-class  worker education, training, and adjustment institutions in communities  left behind.   Our goals for the Great Lakes authority are to foster innovation and  expand the core U.S. manufacturing, industrial, and agricultural bases.  We intend for it to promote new advances in renewable energy  technologies, like solar, wind, and hydrogen, while helping us conserve  and steward our environmental assets. It should also convene various  agencies to help us produce this plan for the future. Finally, the  Great Lakes authority provides a new opportunity for American progress,  and I look forward to the true possibilities this authority will  unleash.   I include in the Record a proposal from various members to President  Biden.                     Proposal: A Great Lakes Authority                         For the Consideration of:          Joseph R. Biden, Jr. President, United States of America       Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH),      Co-Chair, Great Lakes Task Force.      Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY),      Chair, Environment & Climate Change Subcommittee.      Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI),      Co-Chair, House Manufacturing Task Force.      Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI),      Co-Chair, Great Lakes Task Force.      Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL),      Chair, Energy Subcommittee.        Summary. The eight states that comprise the U.S. portion of       the Great Lakes watershed contain the core of America's       commercial and defense industrial base.        The Department of Homeland Security defines these       industries as ``America's Critical Manufacturing Sector''.       Failure or disruption within these industries would result in       cascading disruptions in other critical sectors of the       economy, in multiple regions, and have significant national       economic impact.        This existing industrial base contains the nation's largest       pool of skilled and experienced production workers. The       Region has an almost inexhaustible supply of fresh water.       These 8 States do 25 percent of all U.S. trade with Canada,       which is this nation's largest export market. In 2020, Canada       imported more than $255 billion of U.S. goods and services.        This base provides a solid foundation for creating a unique       21st Century regional development strategy--one that can       enable the United States to (1) build back its manufacturing       base, (2) create millions of new and better jobs within the       Region, and (3) restore an assured, U.S. defense industrial       sector and a resilient energy platform sufficient to power       U.S.-based production.        Franklin D. Roosevelt created the model for such a strategy       in 1933 with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)--a unique       institution brought into being to control the raging waters       of the Tennessee River, provide low-cost electricity, and       advance the economic development of the under-invested seven       states in that Basin.        Our times require a 21st Century version of such an       Authority in the Great Lakes Region--one that can protect and       wisely use the fresh waters of the Great Lakes, build back       better the Region's economy and be a necessary exemplar for       climate change remediation.        The GLA's mission would be to:        Restore and protect America's principal source of fresh       water.        Foster innovation, commercialize it, and by that create       more and better jobs.        Strengthen and expand the core U.S. manufacturing and       defense industrial base, and the required energy systems to       sustain/power production.        Create world-class worker education, training and       adjustment institutions.        Work with the Government and Provinces of Canada on our       mutual Great Lakes challenges including the Great Lakes--      Saint Lawrence Seaway Corporation.        The Chair of the Great Lakes Authority would be a Cabinet       level official appointed by the President and confirmed by       the U.S. Senate. The Chair would represent the U.S.       Government. A five person board lead by the Chair would be       joined by four bipartisan board members appointed by the U.S.       House and Senate leadership.        The GLA would be governed by a five-person, bipartisan       Board, each of whom serves for a five-year term. The Chair       would be a Cabinet level official appointed by the President,       confirmed by the U.S. Senate and be a full-time position. The       other four members of the Board would be appointed by the       Majority and Minority Leaders of the U.S. House of       Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Each would be confirmed       by the U.S. Senate. Eligible appointees would be limited to       residents of the Region who are currently active as a       corporate manufacturing CEO, head of a major financial       institution, President of a Land Grant University, or CEO of       a major distribution company. These four positions would be       part-time and compensated as is normal with private       corporations.        The Great Lakes Authority would be funded by the same ways       and means as was, and is now, the Tennessee Valley Authority       (TVA) and include both federally appropriated funds and       revenues generated by GLA projects, with the same annual       financing similar to that of the Bureau of Reclamation.        The Great Lakes Authority would be authorized and funded       to:        Create and administer a regional infrastructure bank that       could finance domestic civil works that have a dedicated       revenue stream such as water and wastewater systems,        Create and finance other domestic civil works from       appropriated funds,        Create and operate a business development fund to assist in       the establishment and expansion of regional-based       manufacturers,        Create university-based research, development, and       technical consortiums,        Create the 18th National Laboratory, with satellites as       necessary in GLA states, and dedicate it to advancing applied       science, the  [[Page H9918]]       manufacturing arts, and the commercialization of advanced       technology products,        Create a patent hub that will aggressively invest and       develop new clean energy inventions, technologies and       industries, and        Create and fund world-class remedial, transition and       advanced education and training institutions and programs       that invest in the workers of the Region.        The United States has long dealt with regional challenges       with regional solutions. The TV A is an example. The purpose       of this proposal is to outline why a Great Lakes Authority is       needed and identify how it can make a major contribution to       building back better this vital region of the United States.       Today, alone of the U.S.'s major economic regions, the Great       Lakes states do not have such a vital development       institution.        The Challenge. Manufacturing and Job Losses--The United       States has closed 91,000 factories and lost 5 million       manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was enacted in 1993 and China       joined the World Trade Organization in 2000. The 8-state       Great Lakes Region lost 1.5 millions of those jobs--that is,       30 percent. Many of the Region's people were unable to adapt       and have responded with addiction, suicide, conspiracy       fantasies, and political radicalization. Manufacturing Jobs       Lost Since NAFTA and China Entered the WTO (lQ 1993-lQ 2018).        Weakened Finances--These losses of factories and jobs, in       turn, have greatly weakened the fiscal capacity of the       Region's state and local governments.        A measure of this fiscal crisis is found in the high       municipal indebtedness of the Region's cities. Detroit and       Cleveland each have a municipal bonded indebtedness of more       than two billion dollars. Toledo owes $1.6 billion and       Milwaukee almost $1.4 billion. Faced with the high costs of       operation, repairs, rehabilitation and replacement, coupled       with unavoidable federal mandates that come with only 50       percent funding, these municipalities are forced to increase       utility rates on customers who are already in economic       trouble.        The On-Going, Great Lakes Ecological Catastrophe--The       Region's five Great Lakes--Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario,       and Superior--are the source of 21% of the world's surface       freshwater and 84% of North America's. These Lakes undergird       life, work and recreation for tens of millions of people.       Yet, before our eyes they are succumbing to an ecological       disaster of epic proportions. Dan Egan in The Death and Life       of the Great Lakes writes:        The Great Lakes are now home to 186 non-native species.       None has been more devastating than the Junior Mint-sized       zebra and quagga mussels . . . leaving trillions upon       trillions of filter-feeding quagga mussels sucking the life       out of the lake itself . . . native fish populations have       been decimated. Bird-killing botulism outbreaks plague       lakeshores. Poisonous algae slick capable of shutting down       public water supplies have become a routine summertime       threat. A virus that causes deadly hemorrhaging in dozens of       species of fish, dubbed by some scientists the `fish Ebola'       has become endemic in the lakes and threatens to spread       across the continent.        Yet, invasive species are only one of many threats to what       in fact is the largest inland sea in the world. Researchers       at the Universities of Wisconsin and Michigan have created a       ``threat map'' that analyzes 34 distinct threats that affect       these five lakes. The composite stresses include not only       invasive species but also toxic algae, erosion, development,       waste plastics and toxic pollutants among other sources.        Cumulative Stress in the Great Lakes. Today, the state and       local governments of the region are themselves so       economically strapped that they are fiscally incapable of       making the remediations that the Lakes require. Major fiscal       help and institutional leadership from the Federal Government       is essential if this ecological catastrophe is to be stopped       and then reversed.        Innovation--Regarding innovation in the Great Lakes region,       a telling measure of the region's innovation decline is found       by comparing whether these eight states have kept pace with       the rest of the United States in devising inventions that are       sufficiently new, non-obvious and useful that inventors and       companies file and receive a patent from the United States       Patent Office (USPTO). The Great Lakes states have not kept       pace with innovation. Specifically, in 1990, 51,000 U.S.       patents were issued and in 2020 the USPTO granted 188,000--an       increase of 265 percent.        In 2020, California residents were granted 571 percent more       patents than they were in 1990. Oregon residents got 553       percent more. Washington State residents were awarded a       whopping 901 percent more. Not a single Great Lake State even       reached the national average by 2020. All fell behind the       pace of U.S. invention.        The Nuclear Power Issue--Heavy power demands across the       region require a dependable baseload energy supply with a       highly skilled workforce. Today, the Region has 17 nuclear       reactors at 15 sites in operation. Nuclear power provides 15%       of the electricity for Ohio and Wisconsin, 23% for Minnesota,       29% for Michigan, 33% for New York, 41% for Pennsylvania, and       53% for Illinois.        Competition pressures from massive, new natural gas       supplies have created financial pressures that make nuclear       power more expensive. These zero net carbon nuclear plants       have become financially uncompetitive. Yet, thousands of       companies and hundreds of thousands of workers depend on       this nuclear base load. For the foreseeable future,       nuclear energy must be a key segment of electricity       generation or neither economic development nor climate       change goals can be attained. Ways are means are required       to extend the operation of these nuclear facilities and,       working with all stakeholders, increase electric       production beyond what private enterprise appears to be       able to facilitate in a quickly changing and uncertain       market.        The Brookings Study--A decade ago, the Great Recession and       the collapse of the U.S. auto industry highlighted the       manufacturing decline in the Region. Regional leaders engaged       the Brookings Institute to help identify a consensus among       private-sector and public stakeholders as to what to do to       create the next economy. The result was a report: ``The Next       Economy: Economic Recovery and Transformation in the Great       Lakes Region.'' The report called for the federal, state,       metropolitan leaders to join with the private and       philanthropic sectors to:        Invest in the assets that matter--innovation,       infrastructure and human capital, Devise new public-private       institutions that are market-oriented and performance-driven,       Reimagine metros' form and governance structures to set the       right conditions for economic growth.        The report was issued in September 2010. The unstated       expectation was that the report and leadership consensus       would guide the Obama Administration's second round of       recovery actions post-2010. It never happened. In November       2010, control of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives       changed. What happened next is that the U.S. devolved into       ten years of national political gridlock.        Neither the state, nor local governments, nor the       industries, nor the companies, nor the people of the region       could meet the magnitude of this challenge alone. Nor could       they form a joint regional strategy because there was no       regional institution through which the leaders of the Region       could define, advocate and create such a truly regional       strategy.        What the Great Lakes Region needed then, and needs even       more now, is a 21st Century Great Lakes Authority--an       institution that can help the Region innovate, create jobs       and confront the compounding environmental and climate       challenges.        This proposed Great Lakes Authority can be that       Institution. By its structure, focus, coherence, funding and       leadership it can help the Region and nation envision,       implement and sustain an aggressive Great Lakes strategic       development agenda. This proposed Authority can be an       institutional anchor to aid the Region to sustain a long-term       effort through the storms, calms and vagaries of national       policy making.        A Great Lakes Authority. The United States has always       supported regional solutions to regional development and       regional challenges. The principal of these efforts is       managed by the Bureau of Land Management, which traces its       roots to 1812 and was formed, in part, to serve arid parts of       the nation with regional water resources and power       generation.        Then, in 1933 during the economic depression, FDR created       the 7-state TVA. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson created       the 13-state Appalachian Regional Commission. Their       successors have created regional commissions in other parts       of the U.S.        These regional instrumentalities were created to strengthen       the economies of these Regions and help those states achieve       economic equality with the rest of the Nation. Additional       regional efforts have been proposed in other states.        Two of these Regional Commissions (Delta and Northern       Border) have been provided minuscule funding. The Southeast       Crescent Region and Southwest Border Regional Commissions       have not been activated.        Strikingly, the Great Lakes Region has neither a Regional       Authority, such as TVA, nor even a lesser-funded regional       commission. Simply put, building back better the Great Lakes       Region is a challenge that requires an empowered and well-      financed Great Lakes Authority.        Lessons from the TVA--Now, almost nine decades after its       founding, some lessons from TVA's experiences provide clear       guidance for this proposed Great Lakes Authority. Many       environmental and economic problems are not bound by state       boundaries. Regional approaches are required to solve       regional challenges.        The development institutions and capacities of any Region       are so atomized as to be ineffectual when dealing with       broader issues of mutual concern. The 2010 Brookings report       highlighted that: ``The metropolitan areas of the Great Lakes       are ruled by a byzantine network of cities, counties, towns,       townships, villages, school boards, fire districts, library       districts, workforce boards, industrial development       authorities, water and sewer districts and a host of other       entities.'' The Brookings scholars concluded that the       metropolitan areas of the Great Lakes need to begin speaking       with a unified voice on economic development and design and       implement a unified strategy. A Regional Authority can       facilitate such coherence.        The TVA has a 200-person unit devoted to the economic       development of the 7-state TVA region. It is far larger,       better funded and more effective than any of the 7 state       efforts in the Region. The TVA provides; (a) an international       capacity to identify and source private capital investment,       (b) secure domestic finance through state, municipal, banking       and venture funds, as well as (c) the guidance required to       select sites and coordinate  [[Page H9919]]       infrastructure and agreements at low, long-term interest       rates. With these capacities, TVA has created a powerful       supplement to state and local efforts to attract capital       investment and jobs into the Tennessee Valley. It works well.       The Great Lakes basin would benefit from this TVA approach.        Conclusion. When conceiving the TVA, President Franklin D.       Roosevelt focused on equity. What FDR challenged was an       inequality that was out of control between capital and labor       and also between the regions of the United States,       particularly the Southern and Appalachian regions. FDR closed       much of this inequality--both between people and between       regions. Since the early 1980s, the inequalities between the       few and the many, the coasts and the interior, and the       developed and underdeveloped regions of the U.S. have       widened.        Now, it appears that a new era has opened with the       Administration of President Joseph Biden. The new balance       between economic efficiency and economic equity now appears       to be once again emphasizing a more equitable distribution of       economic growth and opportunities for both people and       regions. The Great Lakes region has been falling behind by       almost every measure and needs substantial attention to       reverse economic and environmental challenges. A Great Lakes       Authority is as vital a development tool for the Biden-Harris       Era of today as TVA was for the Roosevelt Era of the 1930s.                                   ____________________
