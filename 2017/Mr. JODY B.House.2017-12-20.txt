 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject  of my Special Order.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on an  issue that is just now beginning to gain momentum and traction.  Already, this issue of great importance is bringing great alarm and  concern, as well as focus. I speak specifically in regard to the Obama  administration's apparent decision to sacrifice the opportunity to take  down Hezbollah and bring terrorists to justice.   What most Americans know about Hezbollah is that it is an Iran-backed  proxy militia based in Lebanon, which was responsible for a string of  terrorist attacks against Americans in the 1980s, including the attack  in 1983 of the Beirut barracks, which killed 241 American  servicemembers.   Since that time, Hezbollah has openly attacked Israel. They have  propped up regimes supported by Iran, like Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  They are defined by their violence and human rights abuses.   But what most Americans are not aware of, Mr. Speaker, is that over  the last 30 years, Hezbollah has evolved beyond its origins as Iran's  attack dog in the Middle East and they now run one of the world's most  expansive and dangerous multinational criminal networks in the world.   Hezbollah works directly with corrupt governments, like Venezuela and  others, to create criminal networks across Latin America, Africa,  Europe, and the Middle East. They have literally moved tons--metric  tons--of cocaine across the world, laundered money, and trafficked  weapons and individuals. They are a critical part of a network  responsible for the use of IEDs in the Middle East, which have killed  literally thousands of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Hezbollah, Mr. Speaker, is a scourge not only in the Middle East, but  throughout the entire world. The reason we know this--which has just,  in recent days, started to become public--is because, in 2008, the DEA  launched a campaign known as Project Cassandra, which amassed evidence  over 8 years of investigation regarding Hezbollah's criminal  activities. They used wiretaps, undercover operations, informants, and  so forth to map Hezbollah's illicit networks with the help of some 30  different U.S. and foreign security agencies. These DEA agents traced  the activities all the way to the inner circles of Hezbollah and its  state sponsors in Iran.   But--and here is where all of this starts coming into play--when the  time came to extradite and prosecute these terrorists, the Obama  administration's Department of Justice and Department of State refused  to move forward.   That is unthinkable to me. It is unthinkable to many people in our  country.   The Justice Department refused to file criminal charges against  suspects that were already in custody in Europe. The State Department  refused to put meaningful pressure on allied countries to extradite  Hezbollah leaders to the United States.   Why? Why did they refuse to get involved?   According to an Obama administration Treasury official, in her  written testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee,  investigations to Hezbollah were tapped down for fear of rocking the  boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.                                time  1930    The nuclear deal is already deeply, deeply flawed in so many ways.  The Iran nuclear deal apparently took precedence over crippling a  foreign terrorist organization directly responsible for the deaths of  American citizens and one of the world's largest drug and weapons  trafficking networks.   Hezbollah is responsible for procuring parts for Iran's nuclear and  ballistic missile program, the very program that the nuclear deal was  supposed to curtail. Hezbollah is supplying parts to them.   Instead of prosecuting the leadership of Hezbollah and shutting down  Iran's weapons pipeline, the Obama administration legitimized Iran's  nuclear program and let Hezbollah leadership slip through the cracks  and let them totally off the hook.   After the conclusion of the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama  administration shut down Project Cassandra. We lost all that we had  gained in 8 years of investigations--all the information. We had them  in our grasp, Mr. Speaker, after 8 years of investigation. We lost  unprecedented insight into these global criminal networks.   Mr. Speaker, this is morally reprehensible. It is stunning that we  had our previous administration and that administration's Justice  Department and State Department evidently involved, engaged, and  deliberately letting these criminals off the hook.   How in the world can our allies in the global war on terror trust us  when we won't prosecute terrorists when we have the chance to do so?   How can our allies in Latin America trust us when we refuse to  prosecute leaders of one of the world's largest drug trafficking  networks?   I have a few colleagues here tonight who are going to address this  issue as well. Before I introduce the first one, I want to bring up one  more point.   Ali Fayad is a suspected leader in Hezbollah. He is an operative and  a major weapons supplier. He has been indicted on charges of planning  the murders of U.S. citizens, attempting to provide materiel support to  a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer, and use  antiaircraft missiles.   For nearly 2 years, this terrorist was held in custody in the Czech  Republic. For 2 years, the Obama administration failed to provide  enough pressure to the Czech Republic, our NATO ally. The Obama  administration refused to put pressure to extradite that terrorist to  the United States.   Ali Fayad now, as we speak here tonight, is a free man and alleged to  be back in the business of arming militants in Syria. This is  inexcusable.   Mr. Speaker, I want to personally thank those who served on Project  Cassandra for their service to our Nation and for the work they did. I  want them to know that what they did mattered.   I am appalled that the Obama administration did virtually nothing to  stop Hezbollah's criminal activities. I think this warrants an  investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives, and that is what  this Special Order tonight is all about: getting to the bottom of what  is yet another example of a swamp that stinks to high heaven that needs  to be cleaned up and drained out.   We need an investigation into what happened in the Obama  administration, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State  in allowing these  [[Page H10336]]  terrorists and this terrorist network to get off the hook.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), a  good friend. He has been a leader in issues such as this, bringing to  our attention both the highlighting of dangerous, harmful activity such  as this tonight. He has been a great champion.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this highlights the  importance of the issue that we are dealing with and the need for an  investigation.   Hundreds, even thousands, of lives have been put in danger, not to  mention our own Nation's national security interests.   Next up is a tremendous leader, not only here in Congress, but in our  military. He is a general who has done an outstanding job. I don't know  that anyone understands the importance of the issue any more than my  good friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).  I am honored to have him here addressing this issue.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  so much. I just think it is critically important that in a Special  Order such as this we have someone who has been there, on the front  line, who knows exactly from the perspective of a soldier defending our  country what has been taking place. I appreciate his expertise and his  willingness to talk about it here this evening.   Another colleague who is going to address the seriousness of the  issue this evening is Ken Buck from Colorado, a good friend and another  leader on this issue and many others like this. The American people  deserve to know what happened. The dots are coming into play. The dots  are being connected. We need to finish connecting those dots to find  out what went on and let the American people know.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Buck  in his leadership on this, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, not only to Mr. Buck, but to all of  the participants in our discussion this evening, a big thank you for  coming and being a part of this.   As more information is beginning to come to light, I am convinced  that we are just at the tip of the iceberg of gaining information as to  what has taken place here that has jeopardized our national security. I  believe it is incumbent upon Congress at this time to fulfill the  obligation that we have to exercise oversight over the executive branch  and follow through with a thorough investigation of the Obama  administration's refusal--absolute refusal--to follow through on the  work that was done by the DEA.                                time  2000    We had these terrorists in our grasp, Mr. Speaker, and we let them  go. How could this happen? The American people deserve to know why, and  we need to get to the bottom of this.   That is why tonight we are calling for an investigation into all  aspects of this Hezbollah scandal, regardless of where it leads us: to  the very top of the Obama administration, the Secretary of State, the  previous Department of Justice, wherever it may lead. We need to get to  the bottom of this, and we are calling for an investigation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
