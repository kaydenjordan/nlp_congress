 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Sandra Myers of  Laurel Springs, North Carolina. This remarkable and talented woman is  retiring after spending her entire 40-year career with the Social  Security Administration.   Since the age of 18, Sandra has worked in the Wilkesboro field office  where she started in an entry-level position and currently serves as  branch manager. My district staff and I have had the pleasure of  working with her for many years now, and we have always found her to be  a kind, caring person who is dedicated to serving others.   Sandra and her husband, John, are nearly lifelong members of their  church. Upon her retirement, she plans to continue to assist the  community by helping elderly members at her church complete errands,  remain active, and attend services.   Sandra Myers is a perfect example of servant leadership, as well as  the incredible work ethic that so many of my constituents in the Fifth  District share. Alleghany County is fortunate to call this hardworking  citizen one of its own.                            ____________________
