 Mr. President, to begin with, all of our thoughts this  afternoon are with the victims of this morning's tragic train  derailment in Washington State and with their families as well. Our  gratitude is with the first responders who answered the call and rushed  to the scene.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different matter entirely, the  Senate has a number of important tasks to complete this week for the  American people. On Friday we took another significant step toward  delivering major tax relief for middle-class families and small  businesses when the House and Senate conference committee released the  final text of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are closer than ever to  seizing this once-in-a-generation opportunity to update our Tax Code,  to make America stronger, and to help middle-class families keep more  of their hard-earned money.   The last decade has not been easy for middle-class Americans.  Families, like many I represent in Kentucky, were hit hard by the great  recession. Many continue to feel its effects. But too often, instead of  helping people get back on their feet, Washington has been an obstacle.  Our broken and outdated Tax Code lets the government take too much  money out of Americans' paychecks. The Obama administration's runaway  regulations slowed job growth and destroyed opportunities just when  people needed them most.   Help is on the way. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a major step toward  a stronger, more prosperous America with higher wages, higher take-home  pay, more jobs, and better opportunities for middle-class Americans.  First and foremost, the bill provides immediate relief by letting  Americans keep more of their paychecks. A typical family of four  earning the median family income will get a tax cut of more than  $2,000. We are taking that money out of Washington's pocket and putting  it right back into theirs. By modernizing the way we tax businesses, we  will make America a better place to invest, start small businesses, and  create middle-class jobs.   Our tax bill will make it less attractive for American businesses to  send jobs and investments overseas and more attractive to expand and  invest here at home. That is why American manufacturers say they are  excited about this bill and plan to hire new workers, while Chinese  officials say it has them worried.   The conference report will also repeal the punitive individual  mandate tax at the heart of ObamaCare. Under ObamaCare, Americans must  either buy the kind of health insurance that Washington thinks they  should buy or pay a heavy tax penalty. By repealing this unfair  penalty, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will give low- and middle-class  families even more tax relief, along with the flexibility to make their  own healthcare decisions. The bill will also strengthen America's  future by enhancing our energy independence.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides for further responsible  development of Alaska's oil and gas potential. Unleashing more of our  own natural resources will create good jobs and improve America's  energy security. The historic accomplishments in the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act will bring immediate relief to struggling families and set America  on a trajectory toward greater strength and prosperity.   I commend the conferees--especially Chairman Hatch, Chairman  Murkowski, and Chairman Enzi--for their work to help finalize the  conference report. I look forward to voting for its passage, and I urge  all of our colleagues to join me in voting to give the American  families the relief they need and richly deserve.

In this process, it  is vital that we ensure that our men and women in uniform have the  resources they need to protect Americans and face the challenges of a  dangerous world.   During the Obama administration, the readiness of our all-volunteer  Armed Forces was hurt by irresponsible cuts to the Department of  Defense, which have damaged combat readiness. The military suffered a  disproportionate burden under the Budget Control Act. The arbitrary  demand that increases in defense spending must be equally matched by  increases in nondefense spending should not stand in the way of  delivering the resources needed to restore near-term and long-term  readiness. Earlier this year, we rightly set aside that misguided  standard and took steps to fully meet the needs of our warfighters.  This week, we need to do so one more time.   If Congress fails to reach agreement on government funding, our  military will suffer intolerable budget cuts that would jeopardize the  tools and the training our servicemembers need to fulfill their  missions. Our responsibilities run deeper than keeping the government  open and ensuring our warfighters have the resources they need.   Before the year ends, we must also deliver results in several  additional areas of vital importance to the American people. We must  renew funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program so the  parents of 9 million children who are covered by CHIP can know that  their children's healthcare is secure. We must reauthorize a critical  foreign intelligence program that the men and women of American law  enforcement need to keep our Nation safe from those who wish to harm  us. We must renew the popular Veterans Choice Program, which aims to  cut wait times for VA healthcare and to give our veterans flexibility  to access care outside of the system. We must approve supplemental  disaster funding for States and Territories that are still struggling  to rebuild after a year of devastating disasters. We must pass a  routine waiver to avoid unacceptable cuts of Medicare funding and other  vital programs.   Since the enactment of the pay-go law in 2010, Congress has never  allowed a sequester to take effect, especially for tax bills, and we  must act again this week to ensure that vulnerable Americans are not  harmed.   Of particular importance, faced with the continued failure of  ObamaCare to keep health insurance affordable for working Americans, we  must take this opportunity to pass bipartisan solutions that will help  stabilize collapsing health insurance markets and lower premiums for  individuals and families across the country.   Across all these critical areas, Congress must do what is right for  the American people and take action this week. I urge each Member of  this body to come together and help pass a funding agreement that  fulfills our responsibilities to the Nation. I look forward to working  with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that  happens.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  December 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a period  of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  [[Page S8072]]  therein for up to 10 minutes each until 12 noon; and that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the Newstead nomination, under the previous  order; finally, that following the disposition of the Newstead  nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:33 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, December 19, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
