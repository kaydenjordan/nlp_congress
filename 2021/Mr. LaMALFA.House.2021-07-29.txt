 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Westerman for his work on the  Natural Resources Committee where I was for several years, as well as  working with the Western Caucus on this, as well.   Obviously, it has been underlined during this time tonight that we  are in a severe drought situation. The darker the color on the map the  more severe that area is. So my part of California is the portion right  here at the border here. Oregon is in that corner. So you see the dark  brown is the Klamath Basin. My colleague, Cliff Bentz, spoke about that  a little bit also on how dire that situation is.   You see all over the map here that the whole West, much of it is in  that brown color, called exceptional drought, and the orange area is  called extreme drought.   So what do we do about these situations? We must be proactive.   In California--and I will talk a lot about California--but also that  is of interest to the whole country because so much of the crops that  so many of the people in this country use come from California.   We have had leadership in the past that produced the Federal water  project known as the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project  that California did. Two of the biggest dams there are 4\1/2\-million  and 3\1/2\-million acre feet by themselves. Now, an acre foot is  326,000 gallons. An acre foot is enough to take care of two households  or approximately 10 people for a year.   And so we used to build these projects because we were forward  thinkers then. And that water benefited so many of us. But when we talk  about the drought situation, it also affects not just people and food  supply and the water supply, but also as my colleague and I, Mr. Bentz,  we share that area on the Oregon border where is the Klamath Basin is.   So what does that mean for wildlife when we don't keep track of our  water supply, we don't put it where it is the most beneficial? You get  a situation like this. This is a refuge for ducks and other waterfowl  that is going to be dry this year.   Last year I was up there on a trip and during the year they had the  deaths of 60,000 ducks and other waterfowl due to botulism because the  water is so low, and it gets that disease in there and wipes out the  flock which affects the whole Pacific Flyway.   So this isn't just about farms and food and money and this and that.  This is also about habitat. But the only habitat you hear about in  California is such that might help the fish, the salmon or the sucker  fish in Klamath Lake. The sucker fish do not sustain themselves by a  full lake on that lake; indeed, it needs to be lower. And they have  been trying to run water down the Klamath River in order to wipe out a  virus--it is kind of a mold--by keeping it wet in order to help the  salmon.   And we see this also in the delta that flows through the bay area  from those great watering sources that come through the Sacramento  Valley and the San Joaquin Valley. They are wasting so much water  running it through there trying to help the delta smelt. So much water  is gone, and the smelt, when they do a trawl, a survey, they can't even  find any more with the extra water that has been run through there for  30 years.  [[Page H4277]]    So what are we going to do? Why does this matter to all Americans?  Well, certain crops, 99 percent, come from California, such as almonds,  artichokes, celery, figs, garlic, raisins, kiwi, honeydew, nectarines,  olives, cling peaches, pistachios, plums, sweet rice, and walnuts. You  are not going find those easily imported from somewhere else--or at  least of the quality that Americans are used to--if we don't fix our  water situation in the State of California, either due to environmental  and regulatory concerns or building more storage. We should be doing  both. We need to be fixing the regulatory problems because the  Endangered Species Act has been weaponized against things that work for  people.    We need to pause for a minute and see if these things that we are  doing are even helping environmentally, even helping the fish  populations, and they are not.   This year the lakes will finally run out. In 2022, all bets are off  because Lake Oroville is so low. Lake Shasta is pretty low. We won't  have the water supply. You can forget agriculture. We know that they  will. Agriculture seems to be the last in line for anything in  California. But the urban areas are going run out before too long.   Can you imagine trucking water into the urban areas? Can you imagine  trying to set up temporary desal plants along L.A.? They have been  trying to build a desal plant in Huntington Beach for 20 years, and the  environmental groups put the brakes on that all the time. It is  amazing. They are cutting their own throat.   So when are we going to get focused on what works for people and  their food supply and the domestic wells? Thousands of domestic wells  are going dry around California, and we haven't even seen the full  effect of this year when many thousands more will go dry.   What do you do for those folks? Hey, forget agriculture, it isn't  important. We will just import the food. Like imported oil was so great  and imported electricity. No. We have to be thinking a lot more because  the environmental movement has decimated this.   Let's talk about forestry for a moment, all those overcrowded forests  create their own drought, and they also don't let the water supply that  would normally come down through the system and hit our lakes, it  doesn't get there anymore because we have an inventory of 10 to one  what we should be having in our forests   So we have got a lot of work to do. We have to reform the Endangered  Species Act. We have to reform the NEPA process to be able to get  projects done and still take into account what we can do positively for  the environment. We will still do that.   Fish benefit from dams, yet all you hear about is tear the dams out.  Whether it is up in Washington for Mr. Newhouse or my district and Mr.  Bentz's district, that seems to be the big push.   Where are we going to get this water supply? How are we going to have  water for fish in order to have it go down the streams to the fish each  year when you don't have the dam there because it is all gone in a  short amount of time after the rain stops?                                time  1845    We have to get our heads back together on how things really work. We  are not going to have a food supply. We are not going to have a timber  supply--because it is all burning right now--until we get past having  the Endangered Species Act and the environmental organizations rule  what we do in this country.   Madam Speaker, we have to get serious.
