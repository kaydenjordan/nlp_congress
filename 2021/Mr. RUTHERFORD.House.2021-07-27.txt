 Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand for the sanctity  of life and believe strongly in our responsibility to protect the  unborn.   While I understand that the issue of abortion is one that divides  many here in Congress, H.R. 18 does not universally ban all abortions.  It would simply reinstate and make permanent the bipartisan Hyde  amendment on a government-wide basis, which only prevents taxpayers  from paying for the killing of unborn children.   It is what the majority of Americans want. In fact, a recent Marist  Poll found that nearly 60 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funded  abortion. It is shocking and heartbreaking the Democrats would remove  this critical protection from law after supporting it for over 40  years.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
