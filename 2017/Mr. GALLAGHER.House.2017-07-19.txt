 Mr. Speaker, the liberation of Mosul from the Islamic  State the other week was a major victory for the Iraqi people and for  the United States, which supported the operation.   But to achieve victory in our broader mission of destroying radical  Islamic terrorism and keeping the American people safe, we must  confront some tough questions about the road ahead.   As chairman of the Task Force on Denying Terrorists Entry into the  United States, I am concerned about the degree to which jihadists and  foreign fighters threaten our homeland and our ability to meet these  threats.                                time  1030    We know that Iraqi fighters are concealing their identities and  fleeing with groups of refugees, many to Europe. These returning  fighters have learned to make dangerous weapons, have gotten  battlefield experience, and are successfully training young people  susceptible to radicalization. We know our visa waiver program, which  allows many European citizens to travel to the U.S. without a visa,  provides a window of opportunity for these determined terrorists to  exploit.   Confronting these threats lies in our ability to quickly and  effectively vet and screen travelers, share sufficient intelligence  with our allies, and act on credible threats when identified. And the  threats are real.   Between 100 and 250 ideologically driven foreigners are thought to  have been smuggled into Europe between 2014 and 2016. These foreign  fighters pose a greater threat to the West than ever before; and for  the sake of our national security, it is a threat we cannot overlook,  and it is a threat we must work together to confront. Nothing can be  put ahead of the safety and security of the homeland.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.             The Role of Congress in Pushing Back Against Russia     Mr. Speaker, I rise today not as a Republican or a  Democrat, but as an American. If we can really find a way to cut  through the media circus surrounding the debate about Russia in the  past few weeks, I think it would reinforce for all of us that whatever  our political differences, our country must always come first.   Those who would destroy our way of life do not wear the jersey of one  political party or another. The only laundry  [[Page H5985]]  they wear is the flag of their nation, whose interests they will  advance regardless of domestic American politics.   And make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: Russia, under Vladimir Putin, is  not our friend. He is on no one's team but his own.   There are concrete steps that we in Congress can take to push back  against Russian aggression both here at home and overseas. To start  with, we must pass sanctions on Russia and Iran. The Senate passed a  sanctions bill 98-2 just 1 month ago. We need to do the same. No more  excuses. We need to vote immediately.   Most of all, Congress must reclaim its long-neglected role in foreign  policy. Russia is not and will never be a partner in Syria. It has  supported and enabled the Assad regime's genocidal war while focusing  much of its military campaign against U.S.-supported rebels.   At the same time, the growth of Iranian power has deepened the  sectarian atmosphere off which ISIS thrives. ISIS and Iran are two  sides of the same coin of religious fundamentalism.   To advance our long-term interests in Syria and in the Middle East,  we must cease outsourcing our foreign policy to our adversaries, and we  can no longer cede a sphere of influence to the Russians and the  Iranians.   We here in Congress have a constitutionally mandated role to play.  True, we have been derelict in this duty for decades, but we now have  an opportunity to reclaim our authority.   As part of a congressionally led campaign to push back against our  adversaries, we should revisit the underlying authorities that are  allowing us to conduct lethal activities around the world. We need to  pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force to put our efforts  against ISIS, against al-Qaida, against all of their affiliates and  anyone else who would seek to challenge our interests on the strongest  legal footing possible. We can't just sit on the sidelines. The part of  passive spectator is unworthy of this great body.   We must lead when it comes to both enhancing our defenses against  attacks and pushing back against Russian or Iranian aggression abroad.  To do otherwise would be to abdicate our responsibility to our  constituents, to our Nation, and to the oath we all took to protect  this country.                            ____________________
