 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the  recent opening of the Aiken Scholars Academy, an academic school of  excellence that offers students an engaging educational experience. It  is the result of a partnership between the University of South Carolina  Aiken and Aiken County Public School District.   Aiken Scholars Academy, led by Principal Martha Messick, is one of  only 1,500 schools worldwide to implement the Advanced Placement  Capstone diploma program. This is an innovative program that provides  students the opportunity to develop skills for college success,  including research, collaboration, and communication.   The curriculum was developed with feedback from higher education  faculty and college admission officers. At the Aiken Scholars Academy,  teachers have the flexibility to cover local, regional, national, and  global topics relevant to their students, with a wide variety of  themes. This provides for effective collaboration and innovation  welcomed by Chancellor Sandra Jordan.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
