 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Concealed Carry  Reciprocity Act. This bill would not protect us from gun violence, but  it would make us far less safe.   Under current law, each State makes its own determination about who  may carry a concealed firearm in public, including deciding which other  States' concealed carry permits to recognize. This bill would  eviscerate the core public safety determinations that each State makes  concerning the concealed carrying of guns in public based on the unique  circumstances of each State and the desires of its citizens. In fact,  the standards and requirements adopted in the States vary dramatically:   Thirty-one States and D.C. require gun safety training to carry  concealed guns in public, and 21 of those States require live-fire  training; 27 States and the District of Columbia prohibit individuals  convicted of misdemeanor crimes of violence from concealed carry; 28  States and D.C. prohibit convicted stalkers from carrying concealed  guns; 34 States and D.C. prohibit those under 21 years of age from  carrying concealed guns. Many States prohibit gun possession and  concealed carry by abusive dating partners, exceeding Federal  protections against abusive spouses.   All of these States would have their carefully considered laws  governing concealed carry overridden by this bill.   The obvious solution to the varying State laws is to continue to do  what is currently done by many States, which is to choose which other  State permits they will recognize. Some States, including my State of  New York, have chosen not to recognize permits issued by any other  State. Most States, however, have chosen to recognize permits from at  least some other States, basing the choice on the strength and  standards employed by the other States.                                time  1445    We should not disregard these determinations, which is what this bill  would do. Instead, this bill would say that every State must honor the  concealed carry permit of every other State. About 10 States don't have  any requirements and issue a concealed carry permit upon request to  anyone.   What this bill would do, in effect, is to say that if New York or  Illinois have strict requirements for concealed carry, if someone comes  in from a State that doesn't, they have to let that person have  concealed carry in their State. In effect, it uses the power of the  Federal Government to import the laws of one State and make them  enforceable in the other State.   In addition, I am deeply disappointed that the version of this bill  before us today includes the bipartisan Fix NICS Act, a measure that  should be enacted as a stand-alone bill without delay, and that was  reported as a separate bill by the Judiciary Committee.   That bill would take steps to address shortcomings with the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System, or what we often call the  NICS.   As the recent mass shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs,  Texas, illustrates, we must do more to ensure all relevant prohibiting  records are submitted to the databases that comprise the NICS. No one  should pass a firearm background check that he or she should have  failed simply because their record of a felony conviction, or domestic  violence record, or some other prohibition under Federal law was not  included in the system.   There is broad bipartisan support for the Fix NICS bill here in the  House and in the Senate. That proposal, which would actually save  lives, should not be tethered to the forced concealed carry reciprocity  provisions of this bill, which would only serve to endanger our  citizens.   The answer to our national problem of gun violence is not that we  need more people carrying concealed firearms on our streets. More than  33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every year, while, in  some other countries, this figure barely exceeds 100. In 2011, the  United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71;  Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, over 30,000.   A study in The American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to  22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the  United States is 25 times higher. The common factor in all of these  other countries is the lack of such easy availability of guns. Our  country, however, is awash in guns, and we have the shameful death toll  to show for it. Sadly, this bill will only increase it.   We must change our approach to gun violence and adopt meaningful  legislation that strengthens our gun laws instead of weakening them;  and we must not undermine the efforts of States to defend their  citizens against these arms.   Unfortunately, the dangers posed by the concealed carry reciprocity  portion of this bill greatly outweigh the benefits of the NICS  improvements; therefore, I oppose H.R. 38, and urge my colleagues to  reject it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. JACKSON Lee asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Crowley), the distinguished chairman of the Democratic  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), who is the chairman of the  Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is advanced I am not sure in the name of what,  but what it is going to do is make us less safe and to overrule all our  States.   Under this bill, someone who lives in New York could go to another  State--doesn't even have to go to another State; just apply to the  other State, get a concealed carry permit from that State, never set  foot in that State, and then use it in New York; thus, overriding New  York's laws.   We have heard it said that this bill is necessary to protect the  Second Amendment constitutional rights of gun owners. But the fact is,  there is no Second Amendment constitutional right for concealed carry.   In the District of Columbia v. Heller case in which the Supreme Court  said that the Second Amendment established a personal right, Justice  Scalia's  [[Page H9701]]  opinion held that the Second Amendment was not unlimited, a variety of  gun regulations were entirely consistent with the Constitution, and he  said:         The majority of American courts to consider the question       have held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons       were lawful under the Second Amendment for State analogues.    So the Second Amendment argument is simply wrong or disingenuous.   But let me say also that we are living in an epidemic of gun  violence. 33,000 Americans are killed every year, and 30,000 more every  year. No other country approaches this. No country--other than those at  war--in peacetime has more than 300 or 400, or even 100 or 72, and we  have 33,000. It is not because of mental illness. It is because of the  presence of large numbers of gun.   A 2017 Stanford University study found a direct correlation with the  most permissive concealed carry laws and violent crime. General studies  have shown a direct correlation of the presence of the number of guns  and murder rates by guns.   So this is a bill that is a death sentence for many Americans. That  is what this bill is. It is a death sentence without trial for many  Americans by increasing the danger of guns by overruling States that  fear and that we don't want concealed weapons on the New York City  subway or the Chicago metro or other places of great concentrations of  people.   But no, we, in our wisdom, are going to say the States with the least  restrictive, perhaps most rural, maybe sensible restrictions for them,  will impose those restrictions on other States.   It is wrong. It is a death sentence for many Americans. It ought not  pass.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
