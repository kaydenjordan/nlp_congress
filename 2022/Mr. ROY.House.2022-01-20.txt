 Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleagues who have been  down here on the floor of the House of Representatives for the most  part of the last hour talking about the importance of defending life,  those infamous--or famous or important words, I should say, in the  Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.   Nothing can be more important than this body focusing on defending  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and my colleagues' focus  on life, as we sit here now 49 years removed from a Supreme Court  decision taking out of the hands of the people and putting it into the  hands of unelected judges' decisions, about the beginning of life, when  life begins, the important reality of a people defending life.   What is controversial about defending life?   It is a question for this body.  [[Page H284]]    What is controversial about defending life when we talk about life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and when we talk about living on  this Earth while God gives us the precious time we have here?   What are we going to do with that time?   Are we going to live free?   Are we going to be able to pursue happiness?   Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: one might wonder here  now 1 year into the current administration, the Biden administration,  whether the average American would say that he or she is free to pursue  happiness.   Are we free?   Are we free to pursue happiness when, in fact, just a few miles  away--and, frankly, a few thousand feet--from this Chamber where we are  right now, restaurants are being chastised and pursued by the  Government of the District of Columbia representing this area that  forms our Nation's Capitol because those restaurants may not believe  that it is in their interest or the interest of the people whom they  serve to be checking papers and to be checking so-called vaccine  passports or vaccine passes?   One restaurant in particular over on H Street--which was one of the  early restaurants on H Street as it was revitalizing--has been fined,  berated, and harassed by the Government of the District of Columbia for  wanting its doors to be open and not wanting to harass its patrons.  They want them to use their own free will to make a decision about what  is in their interest. They don't want to live in a republic where you  are forced to show papers to walk about and to engage in society, to  freely move about and engage in commerce.   The very heart of the kinds of ideas that the Founders meant and what  Jefferson meant when he penned pursuit of happiness is that we not  allow a government through tyrannical policies to interfere with our  pursuit of happiness: our ability to go have a business, our ability to  go out and take care of our family, our ability to move about and to  engage in commerce, our ability to create wealth and opportunity for  our children and our grandchildren, to be able to get healthcare, and  to be able to be secure in our possessions, secure in our belongings,  and secure in our own homes.   I would ask this question: Is the United States more secure than it  was 1 year ago?   Is the United States stronger economically than it was 1 year ago?   Is the United States stronger on the world stage?   Are we safer from our enemies than we were 1 year ago?   Is our border secure?   Are we able to afford energy and have reliable energy to heat our  homes, fuel our cars, provide jobs, and keep us warm in the winter and  cool in the summer?   Are we able to do that better more than 1 year ago?   The answer very clearly to all of those questions is a resounding  ``no.''   Do you think it is an accident that I just spent 2 hours in a hearing  in the Judiciary Committee bemoaning the United States Senate for  holding the line on the filibuster which Democrats and this President  wanted to throw over the wall in the name of voting rights because  nobody can oppose something called voting rights?   They put up those words, they call it the Voting Rights Act, and they  name it after people we serve with in the Chamber to provide maximum  guilt if you dare stand up and say, Mr. Speaker, that the people in the  States ought to be able to decide how to ensure that the elections of  the people who represent them are secure; that you dare to have a voter  ID favored by 80 percent of the American people.   But yet let's go back to what I just said: I have to have an ID just  to walk in and buy a hamburger in the Nation's Capitol, but I cannot  have an ID to vote. No. No. No. That is Jim Crow 2.0 I am told by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.    I actually had colleagues on the committee today walking through the  horrors of the poll tax--the jelly bean counting and all of the  obstructions put into place for voting in the 1950s and 1960s that the  Voting Rights Act nobly pursued to correct--and then tried to compare  that to voter identification.   They tried to compare that to wanting to make sure that mail-in  ballots aren't abused by anybody in any party, even though, by the way,  those bastions of crazy conservatism, Jimmy Carter and James Baker,  came out in a report over a decade ago that The New York Times quoted  saying precisely that mail-in ballots are the area where you have the  most fraud.   Now, all of us want to have integrity and belief in our elections.  But our Democratic colleagues want to use that issue to divide us, as  President Biden literally admitted yesterday. In his 1-hour marathon  wandering, meandering press conference, he literally said that he could  not say whether the elections will be legitimate this fall unless-- unless--we embrace the legislation that he says must get passed and  that we must set aside the traditions of the Senate to jam it through.  And all of it, very clearly, is to set the stage for a lack of faith  and belief in the elections that are coming this November.   Again I ask: Is America stronger or weaker?   Is it richer or poorer? More secure or less safe?   We know the answer, and that is why my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle wish not to talk about those issues. We don't want to have  a debate about crime on the floor.   Do any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to come  down to the floor right now and have a debate about crime in the United  States?   Do they?   Do you think a 50 percent increase in crime in Austin, a 50 percent  increase in crime in San Antonio, a 19-year-old woman shot in a Burger  King in New York City, a 24-year-old student murdered walking the  streets of Los Angeles, train robberies in 21st century America with  litter all over the tracks in Los Angeles, is an accident?   Or could it be that radical leftists who are funded to take over the  district attorneys' offices in cities across America and radical city  councils like the Austin City Council and leftists in this Chamber  believe that letting criminals out on the streets and believe in not  prosecuting people is going to make our country safer?   It is empirically and obviously untrue.   The American people see it. And I promise you, Mr. Speaker, take this  bet: We will not have a debate on the floor of this body about crime  while I am here this year. It will not happen. My Democratic colleagues  would not dare have a debate about crime because they would get  absolutely decimated.   They sure as heck do not want to have a debate about the border.   Do you want to talk about 2 million apprehensions?   Do you want to talk about 1 million people released?   Do you want to talk about dead Texans?   Do you want to talk about fentanyl pouring into our communities,  100,000 dead Americans, opioid poisonings of our youth, and kids taking  Xanax and dying because cartels are flooding into our country while  China drives them right up through Mexico?   Not a person in this Chamber on the other side of the aisle wants to  come to the floor and have an adult debate about why our country is  much less secure and much more endangered at the hands of the cartels  and of people making money trafficking in human beings and undermining  our security and safety in the United States of America.   I promise you, Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden and the Nancy Pelosi Democrats  have no interest in having a debate about the border because it is an  embarrassment and it is a travesty.   Ranches are getting overrun, people are dying, bullets are being  fired across at our own Border Patrol, the National Guard is having to  fire at cars coming across the border, livestock is getting out, bodies  are stacking up in body trailers in Brooks County, Texas, and cartels  are making hundreds of millions of dollars on a daily basis driving  fentanyl into our kids' communities and schools.   No, no, no. We do not want to have a debate about the state of our  border.   Do we want to have a debate about the state of healthcare mandates?   No. No. This body has no debate but embraces rules. We must wear  masks, they say. For a year and a half we have  [[Page H285]]  been excoriated--even fined--if you don't wear a mask the floor of the  House of Representatives--masks which are very clearly proven--fabric  masks--to have no real discernible benefit over the last year and a  half of the mandates that say you must wear a face covering.   They said: Well, are we going to mandate N95s?   Are we going to have to wear N95s on the floor?   Do they want to talk about the negative effects in the study that  wearing N95s for a prolonged period of time, what that does for  people's health and well-being, breathing carbon dioxide, minimizing  your cognitive ability if you wear N95s for a long time?   Some people might joke: Would it make any difference on the floor of  the House if you minimized the cognitive ability of the Members of the  House? You could argue that it may not make any difference whatsoever.  I am looking in the mirror myself.   We do not want to have a debate on the floor of the House on  anything, by the way, much less the reality of what has been happening  with respect to this virus and our response to it; and what Anthony  Fauci engaged in with respect to the reality of the truth of funding  gain-of-function research knowing full well the dangers, working to  cover that up and hide from the American people how this virus came  about; not wanting to pursue the truth on that, not wanting to pursue  the truth or conduct studies on natural immunity.   We have study after study after study coming out right now. I could  pull out on my phone and pull up study after study now finally  demonstrating and showing how natural immunity is more powerful than  vaccinations, and people don't want to be able to have that honest  conversation.                                time  1400    An adult leadership would have done like the Nation of Japan saying:  We believe that vaccines are effective for a large group of people. We  believe that there are some risks. You are adults. We won't mandate.  You decide.   We can't do that in the supposed land of the free? We sit up here and  we stare at that American flag and we talk about the Senate being the  greatest deliberative body. They don't really debate. This being the  people's House, the people's Chamber, when was the last time the  Speaker heard a robust debate on the floor of the House with multiple  Members?   When was the last time we offered an amendment on the floor of the  House in open debate that wasn't predetermined by all of the Rules  Committee overlords who govern our lives? Democrat and Republican, I do  want to say.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 6 years since we have had an amendment  offered on the floor of the House in open debate. Do you want to know  why we can't do anything in this Chamber? Because we don't ever debate.  We don't ever actually have a discussion, throw things out there and  then vote. Maybe, just maybe, we come to some bipartisan agreement.   I am happy to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  Dean Phillips and I worked on the PPP Flexibility Act. Abigail  Spanberger and I have introduced legislation called the TRUST Act to  deal with stock trading believing that might help improve people's  faith and confidence in this body. I have introduced numerous bills and  passed numerous bills with my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. That is not what this is about.   It is about a broken body refusing to actually debate, refusing to  actually engage, refusing to offer amendments. Both sides do it. That  needs to end.   The last point that I will make on that point, if you want this body  to function again, you have to stop spending money we don't have. If  you keep writing blank checks, how on Earth is there a check against  the wisdom of the policy? You just keep writing a check to keep doing  the same thing or to do something different. You can't run a business  that way. You can't run a home that way. You can't run a church that  way. You can't run a legitimate school that way. But no, no, we just  keep writing checks to fund the expansion of government, to fund the  creation of programs no matter who is in power.   Over the last year, we have seen what that causes when it is then  left in the hands of an administration that literally does not care  about the rule of law.   To be very clear, this administration is ignoring the rule of law,  ignoring their oath, ignoring their duty to enforce the laws of the  United States, ignoring their duty to secure the border, ignoring their  duty to stand up in defense of the men and women in blue, to follow the  laws around the United States, ignoring their oath to stand up and  defend the United States against our foreign enemies; hold the line  against Russia; push back on Russia; sanction them; hold the line on  Nord Stream 2; stand alongside Ukraine; push back on China; stop  appeasing them.   Don't leave $85 billion sitting there in the hands of terrorists when  we walk away and abandon our duty and leave those men and women in the  field, and then have 13 dead marines to show for it.   That is the legacy of the first year of this administration. But will  President Biden, when he strolls to that podium on March 1 for his so- called State of the Union, and we are all spread out, and all wearing  masks, and doing whatever the heck we are going to do--not actually  doing the people's business--will he address any of those issues?   Will he talk about border security? Will he talk about how we are  weaker around the world? Will he talk about the crime on the streets of  Los Angeles, New York, Austin, San Antonio, and Chicago?   Will he talk about the businesses getting crippled by mask mandates  and health mandates?   Will he talk about the children who are now having mental health  issues, the people who are sick; the diseases that weren't dealt with,  all to push a vaccine mandate that goes contrary to the pursuit of  happiness and our right as Americans to live free?   Will he talk about any of those things? Will he talk about the fact  that the United States of America is sitting on one of the world's  largest reservoirs of energy and, yet, we are wondering even in Texas  whether you can have the lights on because we built no nuclear power  plants.   We slowed down our production of clean burning natural gas, all  chasing unicorn energy policies of wind and solar as if they can  possibly, possibly power the world at the level that is needed for the  proper amount of human flourishing while 3 billion people around this  planet do not have access to abundant energy and power.   Will the President of the United States come down here and talk about  that or will he get up there and just talk about: Well, we are going to  be net zero in our carbon production by 2035, or 2050, or make up some  totally arbitrary number without regard at all to what that does to the  price of energy and the availability and abundance of energy.   All of this has real-life consequences for Americans. People die.  Houses get cold. People can't get access to energy. They can't afford  energy. They lose jobs. You have stagnation and then you have the  brilliance of this administration and the brilliance of those in the  media starting to talk about energy and food price control because, of  course, that is what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  resort to.   They will sit there and bemoan markets when they don't let the  markets work. Healthcare markets never work. We haven't had a  healthcare market in decades. It is an absolute lie; and I am looking  at you Big Healthcare. I am looking at you Big Pharma. I am looking at  you hospitals. I am looking at you Big Insurance. You made out like  bandits after ObamaCare. You minted money. And probably three-quarters  of the people in this Chamber fattened their wallets and  their portfolios riding the back of all of that Big Healthcare  enrichment, all at the expense of poor Americans around this country  trying to get access to a doctor without having to call some bureaucrat  in the government, the VA, or an insurance company, or however it may  be, but it sure as heck isn't their doctor.    We don't have health freedom in this country. We have mandated Big  Healthcare, Big Government, Big Insurance, bureaucracy. And everybody  knows it. Everybody knows it because you all had to deal with it. You  have  [[Page H286]]  had to call somebody. You had to call some kid sitting in Omaha in some  phone bank telling you which doctor you can go to 2,000 miles away.  That is the truth, and we all know it. We sit in here, we roll in here  and we say: Let's spend more money and create a government program.  Let's spend more money we don't have.   Not one person in this body will come down here and truly debate any  of these truths when you are $30 trillion in debt; when you are funding  the very FBI going after parents for daring to stand up and defend  their children in a school board meeting; when you are funding the  Department of Homeland Security that is literally lying to the American  people saying our border is secure while hundreds of thousands of  people come across.   You want to know what happened in that synagogue? Because we don't  have a dang clue who is coming to the United States, and this  administration doesn't care. They don't care. They don't care what list  they are on. They don't care whether they pose a danger to the United  States of America. They don't care at all who is coming into this  country. And they sure as heck don't care what is happening to the  people of Texas, Arizona, or, frankly, everybody around this country  who is having to bear the cost, who is having to bear the burden of  what wide-open borders means to the United States of America.   Complain about Mayorkas? We should impeach him for failing to  faithfully execute the laws of the United States of America,  endangering Americans in the process, ignoring the laws of the United  States. And that is what is happening. That is what is happening.   America is poorer, sicker, and less safe a year into the Biden  administration, and that is the truth. Our enemies know it. That is why  Russia is going after Ukraine. That is why China is rattling on a daily  basis. That is why Russia, China, and Iran are talking about joint  exercises. That is why the cartels are emboldened. That is why there  are people marching through Mexico from all over the world coming to  our southern border. That is why there are people on the streets  breaking into businesses, assaulting people on the streets and killing  them, raping them. It is happening every single day in the United  States of America with reckless abandon while Democrats in district  attorney's offices, Democrats in the House of Representatives,  Democrats in this administration do nothing about it and do not care  that the American people are left holding the bag.   Then they want to talk about taking away our Second Amendment rights  and our ability to defend ourselves. Well, that crap ain't going to  happen because we are going to defend ourselves in the land of the  free. We are going to stand up and defend our communities and defend  our families. We are going to stand up in defense of the Constitution  and limited government and freedom to be able to protect our families  and protect our States when this administration is letting this country  burn.   It dares to do an hour-long press conference, lecturing the people  for wanting to make sure their elections are secure, for daring to say  that we should have voter identification when that same administration  is ordering vaccine mandates that are causing healthcare workers to  lose their jobs; causing healthcare workers in long-term health  facilities to be unable to carry out their jobs.   And then there is the talk about, oh, the burden on hospitals. Well,  you just caused 20 percent of nurses to have to leave because you were  mandating they take a jab for something that is a year old that Pfizer  is making billions of dollars on. Then we won't even have a hearing  about why on Earth we are having this virus in the first place, because  of what Anthony Fauci knew and what NIH was up to and what China was up  to.   We won't have a hearing about natural immunity. We won't have a  hearing about the dangers and levels of dangers of the vaccines, what  they may be. Again, my polio-stricken father who is 79 has been  vaccinated. I refuse to say whether I have been vaccinated. I think it  is a principle for Americans that they shouldn't have to say.   My point is, there are people for whom the vaccine makes sense. There  are people for whom the vaccine does not make sense. Mandating a jab in  a 5-year-old is irresponsible and it is dangerous. We should have that  conversation instead of blindly walking around preaching what other  people should stick in their dang arm.   But that is what we do in the people's House. I am sitting here in an  empty Chamber--with the Speaker, respectfully--and that is it. They are  all jet-fumed out, leaving town. Oh, we shut down earlier. Let's get  out of here. Or they are out at some fundraiser or something.   Let's have a debate on these issues. Let's seek the truth. I don't  know all of the truth on all of those issues. I don't know the specific  risks. I have read a lot about what is going on with the vaccines,  positive and negative. But it is becoming very, very clear that it  doesn't do squat to stop the spread. So you are left basically saying:  Well, it is better for you so that you don't die in the hospital.   Well, let's look at the data on that. But why don't we just present  the information and let the American people decide? Japan's vaccine  rate is a lot higher than ours and ours has mandates. All they did was  say: We think it is good. There are some risks. You decide. We can't do  that in America?   We can't just go down to the border and say: You know what, it is  better for migrants, better for Texans and all Americans, bad for  cartels, bad for China, if we secure our border. That is the truth.  Talk to the migrants getting abused. Talk to the people in south Texas.  Go to Laredo and Webb County. Sit down with the Brown people in Laredo  who will say: We are pretty ticked off with this administration about  how they are handling the border.    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle might be up for a rude  awakening pretty soon about their expectations of what voters are  voting for them and what voters are not because there are a lot of  people in this country that are sick and tired of the elite in this  town, immersed in the swamp, promoting Big Healthcare, promoting Big  Tech, promoting Big Government, minimizing the rights and the abilities  of Americans to live their lives the way they see fit.   That is our calling as we head to 2026, our 250th birthday of the  United States of America, which comes up in 4-and-a-half years. Will we  be able to say that we live in the land of the free? Will we be able to  say that we are pursuing happiness; that we are the country of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?   We will only be able to do that if we stand up and secure our  Nation's sovereignty, defend our streets, protect our families, stand  up to enemies around the world, and limit this body to the job that it  was given in the Constitution: limit our spending to the dollars that  we have and responsibly lead this country and represent the people so  that this country can, in fact, be great in our agreements and our  disagreements in a Federalist Republic where we are able to live free.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
