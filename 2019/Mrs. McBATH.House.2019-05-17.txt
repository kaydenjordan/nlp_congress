 Madam Speaker, Black women are three to four times more  likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, and this disparity  persists across socioeconomic and educational levels.   I recently heard the story of a constituent in my district. Her name  is Phiffer. After a failed emergency surgery, she was confined to  bedrest 20 weeks into her pregnancy, but her doctor failed to address  her mental health.   At 30 weeks, she gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. But for a year  after, she struggled with mental health.   She said: ``I know my story is unremarkable.''   Unremarkable. Unremarkable because mothers are suffering in silence.  Black mothers are suffering in silence daily.   I am proud to be a founding member of the Black Maternal Health  Caucus because we need to address this crisis. I look forward to  working with my colleagues to make sure that women like Phiffer receive  the proper care that they need and deserve.                            ____________________
