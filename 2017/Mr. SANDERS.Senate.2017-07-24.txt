 Mr. President, I do not know--and I don't know if anyone  knows--whether the Republican so-called healthcare legislation will  pass tomorrow, whether the beginning of the debate will take place or  whether it will not. I don't know that, but this I do know. The  legislation being proposed--and by the way, we still don't know what  that legislation is. In general, what we do know is that the  legislation being proposed is the cruelest, most destructive, and  irresponsible piece of legislation ever brought to the U.S. Senate in  the modern history of our country.   I know the media focuses on, do the Republicans have the votes, how  is this Senator going to vote, how is that Senator going to vote? All  of that is interesting to those of us inside the beltway. The far more  important issue--which we don't discuss enough; the media doesn't cover  enough--is what this legislation actually would do if it were  implemented.   Right now, unique among major countries on Earth, we do not guarantee  healthcare to all people as a right. The result of that is that we now  have today--before this disastrous legislation--28 million Americans  who have no health insurance and even more who have high deductibles  and high copayments, preventing them from getting to a doctor when they  should.   We have a bad situation now. It is better today than before the  Affordable Care Act was passed, when we had over  [[Page S4152]]  50 million people without insurance, but no one suggested what we have  today is where we should be. Yet we have 28 million people uninsured.  The Republican solution to this problem is to throw another 22 million  people off of the health insurance that they currently have.   I want the American people to, for one moment, put themselves in the  place of someone tonight who may be watching what we are talking about  here, who has cancer, who has heart disease, who has diabetes or some  other life-threatening illness. Millions of people are in that  position. They are struggling for their lives right now. They are under  treatment. They are thinking, what happens if this Republican bill is  passed? Will I live and continue to get the treatment that I need or  will I die?   I think there are very few Members of the Senate who have met with  their constituents on this issue, who have not seen people break into  tears, asking: What is going to happen to me or my children or my  parents?   We did a teleconference townhall a few weeks ago in Vermont. We had  some 16,000 people on the line, and a woman whose kid has a very, very  serious illness called. The cost of the prescription drugs are off the  chart. She asked: What is going to happen to my child if this bill goes  through?   Do you know what? I didn't have the guts to tell her what might  happen to her child. I don't want to be on the phone telling any person  in Vermont or in America that their child might die because of the  legislation that might proceed tomorrow.   This legislation would cut Medicaid by almost $800 billion over a 10- year period, taking healthcare away from lower income and working-class  families, including many children with special needs, kids with Down  syndrome, kids who have serious emotional problems, kids whose lives  now depend on Medicaid. When you cut Medicaid by $800 billion, many of  those children will lose coverage entirely or receive significantly  fewer benefits.   This legislation, when we cut Medicaid by $800 billion, will have a  severe and dramatic impact on nursing homes all over America. A lot of  people don't know this, but if your mom has Alzheimer's and is in a  nursing home or your dad has a terminal illness and is in a nursing  home, guess what: Medicaid pays almost two-thirds of the costs  associated with nursing home care in America. What happens to the  people in nursing homes when you slash Medicaid? How many of them will  get thrown out of the nursing homes? Where do they go? Are families in  America, working-class families, going to be forced to make the choice  of whether they take care of their parents or whether they send their  kids to college? Those are the choices that working-class families may  have to make if this horrific legislation gets passed.   This legislation would dramatically decrease funding for the opioid  and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country, including my State  of Vermont, including Kentucky, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, and  States all over the country that are struggling with the opioid  addiction problem.   The program that provides the most funding to help deal with  addiction treatment and addiction prevention happens to be Medicaid.  What happens to our efforts to try to get a handle on this terrible,  terrible epidemic sweeping our country when you make massive cuts to  Medicaid?   I found it amusing that when Donald Trump ran for President--oh, he  was a great friend of the working class. He was going to stand up for  the working class. Let me mention to workers all over this country who  are in their sixties that if this legislation passes, your premiums are  going to go up dramatically. That is one of the reasons the AARP  strongly opposes this legislation.   If you live in Baltimore, for example, where I was this morning,  speaking to the NAACP--in Baltimore, if you are 60 years of age and you  make $40,000 a year, your average health insurance premiums will go up  from about $4,000 a year now to $8,800 per year, more than double. If  you are a 62-year-old worker, making $40,000 a year--not a lot of  money--how are you going to pay that?   Remember, all that Donald Trump said about what a great friend of the  working class he was. This legislation would defund Planned Parenthood.   I get a kick out of hearing my Republican friends talk about choice,  freedom. Oh, my goodness, they love choice and freedom. They want the  American people to go to any place they want to go. It is all about  what America is about. Two and a half million women have made a choice,  and the choice they have made is that they want to get their healthcare  from Planned Parenthood. That choice, that freedom would be taken away  from them, starting tomorrow, if this legislation is passed.   When you think about insurance, you think that insurance is about  covering you in your time of need. Before the Affordable Care Act was  passed, many millions of the American people could not get the health  insurance they needed to address their particular healthcare crisis. If  you had a heart disease, if you had breast cancer, if you had diabetes,  the insurance companies would say: We are in the business of making  money. Why on God's Earth would we want to insure you if you had breast  cancer 5 years ago and it is possible it might recur? That is a losing  proposition for us.   That is what insurance companies want to do. They are not in the  business of providing healthcare. They are in the business of making  money. They denied, unbelievably--think about how crazy this is; they  actually would deny coverage to people who had preexisting conditions.   I have problems with the Affordable Care Act. It is far, far from  perfect. It did end that obscenity of allowing insurance companies not  to cover people who had preexisting conditions--something that is quite  unbelievable.   Guess what. If this legislation is passed, in all likelihood, many  people in this country with preexisting conditions will not be able to  get healthcare that they need at a price they can afford. We don't  quite know how many of them will die. Nobody can make that prediction.   I want to read for you a very interesting article that appeared from  an institution called PolitiFact. PolitiFact is an entity that tries to  keep a check on what politicians say. They look at you and you make a  statement, and they say: Is this true or is this guy not telling the  truth? I was on a TV program called ``Meet the Press'' a number of  weeks ago. I said: Well, you know, if this Republican legislation is  passed, thousands of Americans will die.    And my Republican colleagues and the rightwing media said: Bernie  Sanders is engaging in hyperbole. He is exaggerating. Who wants to see  anybody die?   I know nobody here wants to see anybody die. Of course not. No  Republican does. No Democrat does. No Independent does. But we have to  look at the consequences of what we do.   So what PolitiFact did was take a look at the studies to see whether  I was telling the truth.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the PolitiFact article be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From www.politifact.com, June 27, 2017]    Bernie Sanders' Projection of Thousands' of Deaths From Lost Health                         Coverage Is Well-Supported                            (By Louis Jacobson)         During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie       Sanders, I-VT., didn't hold back in his criticism of       Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act: He       said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly.        ``What the Republican proposal (in the House) does is throw       23 million Americans off of health insurance,'' Sanders told       host Chuck Todd. ``What a part of Harvard University--the       scientists there--determine is when you throw 23 million       people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people       with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people       will die.''        Sanders continued, ``I wish I didn't have to say it. This       is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is       common sense.''        Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would       save lives, would it be on the scale of ``thousands,'' as       Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that?                             studying the studies         When we contacted Sanders' office, spokesman Josh Miller-      Lewis cited two sources.        One is the ``Harvard study'' Sanders mentioned--published       on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American       Progress. It was  [[Page S4153]]       coauthored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology; two       medical students who graduated from Harvard's T.H. Chan       School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the       Center for American Progress.        To come up with their estimates, the authors of the       Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the       results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts       state health care law--a law that was a model for the       Affordable Care Act. The 2014 study was lead-authored by       Harvard professor Benjamin D. Sommers.        The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected       that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who       lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using Congressional       Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version       of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000       deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year.        The second piece of evidence Sanders' office cited was an       op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are       affiliated with Harvard--David Himmelstein and Steffie       Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter       College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at       Harvard Medical School.        The op-ed--published on Jan. 23, 2017, well before either       chamber's Republican health care bill was introduced--used as       its basis a different study lead-authored by Sommers. This       2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded       Medicaid.        Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in       which 20 million Americans lost coverage--which turned out to       be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill--      Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be       43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP's health policy       changes.        It's worth noting, however, that both of these projections       come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for       American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein       and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National       Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer       national health insurance--a proposal that is even further to       the left than the Affordable Care Act.        So can Sanders' assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed       literature alone?                            What prior studies say         In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at       least seven academic papers that detected a link between       securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Here's       a rundown.        In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists       convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine       estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they       were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research       associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that       sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating       the study's methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure       should be increased to 22,000.        A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded       that a lack of health insurance ``is associated with as many       as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused       by kidney disease.''        Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid       and in each case found ``significant'' improvements in       mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a       2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York,       Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study       of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban       Institute. (These were the two articles that formed the basis       of the analyses cited by Sanders' staff.)        A 2014 study published by the blog of the health policy       publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the       time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable       Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have       collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths.        A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found       improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after       securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act.        A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a       provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults       to be covered under a parent's policy. The study found a       decline in mortality among this population from diseases       amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma,       such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be       expected.)        We found two papers with results that were more equivocal.        A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services       Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family       and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San       Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the       conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from       2002. Kronick's study adjusted the data--as the IOM had not--      for a number of demographic and health factors, including       status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing       so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original       study.        A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine       coauthored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University       compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage       through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn't.       While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical       spending and lower rates of depression among those who got       coverage, key benchmarks for physical health--including blood       pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar--did not improve in       such patients.        But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies       have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that       having health insurance saves lives, and that not having       insurance can lead to additional deaths.        We asked several of the authors of these papers whether       they believe Sanders' assertion of ``thousands'' of deaths is       generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back       from three of them.        `` `Thousands' is completely fair,'' Dorn said.        Baicker agreed. ``It is of course difficult to pin down an       exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new       policy,'' she said. ``But a number like `thousands' does not       seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence.''        And Sommers--whose work formed the indirect basis of the       studies cited by Sanders--concurred.        ``I agree that it's challenging to pin down an exact number       on this,'' Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence       ``certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths       per year.''                                  Our ruling         Sanders said, ``When you throw 23 million people off of       health insurance--people with cancer, people with heart       disease, people with diabetes--thousands of people will die.       . . . This is study after study making this point.''        Sanders' statement on Meet the Press was phrased generally       enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the       academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale       of the House bill would produce ``thousands'' of additional       deaths.        That said, we can't say with any specificity how many       deaths will occur. It's important to note that the studies       provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly       different result. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly       True.    One of the studies my office cited was published on June  22, 2017, by the Center for American Progress. It was coauthored by a  Harvard professor of social epidemiology, two medical students who  graduated from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and two  policy specialists at the Center for American Progress. I won't go  through all of the details, but I will say this, quoting from  PolitiFact:         The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected       that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who       lose coverage as a result of the AHCA.    The Republican bill.         Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact       of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an       additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per       year.    That is not Bernie Sanders; that is a study done at Harvard.         The second piece of evidence Sanders' office cited was an       op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are       affiliated with Harvard--David Himmelstein and Steffie       Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter       College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at       Harvard Medical School.        Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in       which 20 million Americans lost coverage--which turned out to       be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill--    They estimated 23 million would lose coverage--         Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be       43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP's health policy       changes.    Quoting again from PolitiFact:         So can Sanders' assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed       literature alone?    Then they cite some studies.         In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists       convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine       estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in the year 2000       because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a       senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a       paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data.       Replicating the study's methodology, Dorn concluded that the       figure should be increased to 22,000.        A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded       that a lack of health insurance ``is associated with as many       as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused       by kidney disease.''    And on and on it goes. This is not Bernie Sanders talking; this is  scientific and medical study after medical study saying what is  obvious--that if you have a life-threatening disease and cannot get  healthcare, you will die.   So I would hope that my Republican colleagues, as they vote tomorrow,  understand the consequences of their vote. I know no Republican--nobody  here--wants to see anybody die, but when you take 23 million people off  of the health insurance they have, many thousands of those people will  die.   I think most Americans would think that when you are dealing with an  [[Page S4154]]  issue like healthcare, which impacts, by definition, every single  person in our country, and when you are dealing with an issue that  impacts about one-sixth of the American economy--over $3 trillion a  year--that you just might want to have some serious discussions on that  issue. You might want to ask--here is a radical idea--doctors what they  think about this legislation. What is it going to mean to their  patients? Wow, that is a pretty radical idea when dealing with  healthcare for all the American people. You might want to have one  hearing, maybe, and say to doctors: Doctors, what do you think about  this bill?   What about hospitals? How will this bill impact hospitals, especially  rural hospitals in Vermont, Virginia, and all across this country? You  might want to talk to a hospital administrator. You might want to talk  to a patient advocate, maybe somebody from the American Cancer Society  or somebody who is active in the diabetes effort. You just might want  to talk to the experts on healthcare as to how this legislation might  impact the work they do. But, amazingly, in an unprecedented way, this  legislation was written behind closed doors. I think it was 12, 13  Republican Senators who wrote this bill. Most Republican Senators don't  even know what is in this bill, let alone Democrats and let alone the  American people.   How do you write legislation that impacts every American, one-sixth  of the economy, and not have one public hearing to hear from those most  knowledgeable about healthcare in America? But that is exactly what the  Republican leadership has done. I know why they did that. It is not a  secret. If you had a horrific piece of legislation, trust me, you would  want as little public discussion as possible. You would try to hide  what this bill does. I understand that. Yet, despite all of that, it  turns out that virtually every major healthcare organization in America  opposes this bill.   I don't know how you can go forward with legislation that has had  zero public hearings, that is opposed overwhelmingly by the American  people--last poll that I saw from USA TODAY had 12 percent support for  this legislation--and go forward with legislation opposed by every  major healthcare organization in America. This bill is opposed by the  AARP, the largest senior group in America. It is opposed by the  American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the  American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American  Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals,  the Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS  society; and the American Nurses Association. In other words, virtually  every major healthcare organization does not want to see this bill  passed.   The American people overwhelmingly do not want to see this bill  passed. So how come it might pass? People don't want it. Healthcare  organizations don't want it. Who wants it? I will tell how wants it-- people who are going to get tax breaks. They think it is a great idea.  Billionaires who got $200 billion in tax breaks from the House bill  think it is an extraordinary idea. So what if 23 million people lose  their health insurance from the House bill. The top one percent will  get $200 billion in tax breaks. Large healthcare corporations like it.  The insurance companies and the drug companies are going to get a  combined hundreds of billions of dollars.   I will tell you who else likes it: those people associated with the  Koch brothers who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on  elections. They like it because their ideology, their philosophy is  that government should play no role in the concerns of the American  people. Mark my words--if this bill, which would cut Medicaid by $800  billion, passes, Medicare will be next. And in the House, they have  already passed legislation that would voucherize Medicare. Social  Security will not be far behind. That is the ideology of the Koch  brothers and the people who fund the Republican Party. Their concern is  with large campaign contributors, not the American people.   I hope very much that tomorrow when we assemble here--I gather in the  afternoon--for a vote, the Republicans will think more about people in  their own State, about their children, the elderly, the sick, and not  just about their campaign contributors.   Thank you very much, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
