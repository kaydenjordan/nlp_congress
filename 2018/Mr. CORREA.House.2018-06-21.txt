 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York,  Congressman Nadler, for this opportunity to speak on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I was hired to work across the aisle, to come to  Washington to get things done, to fix problems. Earlier this month, we  had a discharge petition that we needed two more signatures on that  would have given us the opportunity here on this floor to vote on four  immigration bills under the queen-of-the-hill rule. Essentially, that  means that whatever bill gets more votes moves ahead.   Among those four bills was Mr. Goodlatte's bill, and, of course, also  one of those bills was the Aguilar-Hurd bill that was a product of both  Democrats and Republicans coming together working on a solution.                                time  1245    Unfortunately, we weren't given the opportunity to vote on all these  four bills. And the current bill on the floor today does not offer a  pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. Of course, it does not address the  current problem of reuniting children who are separated from their  families.   Madam Speaker, I ask today, my colleagues, please reject this  legislation. And I ask the Speaker to give us the opportunity to vote  on the Aguilar-Hurd bill.
