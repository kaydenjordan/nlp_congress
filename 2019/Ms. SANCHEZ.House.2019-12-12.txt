 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   I would like to thank Chairmen Neal, Pallone, and Scott for their  tireless efforts to get this legislation passed.   Prescriptions are not recommendations, Doctors have written them for  a reason. Patients, our constituents, our friends, our family members,  need these medications. They cannot afford to skip their medications.   However, I have heard so many heartbreaking stories from individuals  in my district. Alice in Whittier has to rely on her doctors for  insulin samples because she cannot afford insulin. Adrian in Norwalk is  choosing to pay his bills rather than his eight different medications.  David in La Mirada is considering cutting his dosage because he cannot  afford to refill his full dosage as often as he should. They, and so  many others, are just making do. Frankly, that's not good enough for  me.   With H.R. 3, we are giving power back to the people in my district  and to millions of Americans. The savings from this bill will also be  given back to the public with reinvestments in innovation and the  search for new cures and treatments.   I look forward to this bill's passage today. It is time to act and  lower the cost of prescription drugs now.
