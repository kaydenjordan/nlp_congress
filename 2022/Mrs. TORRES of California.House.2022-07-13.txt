 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment to have transparency and accountability over American  taxpayer money sent abroad.   I am proud to be supported by Chairman Castro and Chairman Sires of  the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as Representatives  Escobar, Vargas, Jacobs, Malinowski, and Levin.   Support from members on both the Armed Services and the Foreign  Affairs Committees is a reminder that our national security relies on  both the State and Defense Departments.   This amendment provides additional oversight over Section 333 funding  in the Northern Triangle region of Central America. Section 333 gives  the Department of Defense authority to conduct or support programs  providing training and equipment to the national security forces of  foreign countries.                                time  1915    Unfortunately, we have seen numerous instances of abuse and misuse of  defense equipment provided to foreign governments, particularly in  Central America.   This includes using U.S.-provided equipment to repress local people  and perpetuate human rights violations. In some instances, U.S.  materials have been used against our own U.S. personnel in the area.   Let me be clear, U.S.-funded equipment in the Northern Triangle  region of Central America has been used by foreign government units  against our U.S. personnel working in the region.   Sadly, we can't brush off these disturbing instances as being far in  the past. These problems continue to happen.   This year, we have seen civil society actors, journalists, and  independent prosecutors and judges under attack in both El Salvador and  Guatemala. In just the last few months, the President of El Salvador  declared a state of exception that bypasses citizens' rights and  exempts security funding from regular oversight.   In Guatemala, we have seen a concerted effort to stamp out the  independent judiciary, with those who dare to speak truth to power  threatened, put in jail, or forced to flee in fear of their lives.   The Northern Triangle region is at a pivotal moment, and the United  States must support efforts to build stable and prosperous communities  to contribute to a more stable hemisphere and address the real causes  of migration.   To that end, this amendment would require public disclosure of our  section 333 aid to the Northern Triangle region to create greater  transparency of how and when we support these governments.   This amendment, Mr. Speaker, would also require the Secretary of  State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to certify to  Congress that the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras  are credibly investigating and prosecuting their members of the  military implicated in human rights violations before sending  additional section 333 funding to those organizations.   To my Republican colleagues, I want to clarify that this amendment  does not end section 333 assistance. It does not tell the Department  who it can partner with. It simply says the governments need to be  taking steps to investigate members of their military who have been  credibly accused of human rights violations, and Congress needs insight  into these efforts.   The American taxpayer and the communities of the Northern Triangle  deserve dignity and accountability. Many here know my strategy for  Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras: to hold the corrupt, undemocratic  actors who are working against our interests accountable; to help those  fighting for accountability, fairness, and democracy in the region; and  to ensure that our assistance reaches the people it is intended to  help.   This amendment will help us do just that, and I urge a ``yes'' vote  on this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this certification process  does not end section 333 funding to the Northern Triangle. It simply  brings accountability and transparency on how U.S. equipment is being  used in the region.   Mr. Speaker, I request a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
