 Mr. Speaker, as Black History Month comes to  an end, I rise today to honor the organizations that have served as the  training ground for many of our Nation's most extraordinary leaders.  These organizations have fostered and empowered generations of bold,  brilliant, and humane leaders, and they continue their transformational  work today.   Mr. Speaker, I am talking about the Divine Nine, the historically  Black fraternities and sororities of the National Pan-Hellenic Council.  This past year, they have played a pivotal role in helping communities  deal with the COVID crisis, and they have also registered many people  to vote and brought many people to the polls.   The Divine Nine organizations are:   Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity founded in 1906 at Cornell University.  Their brotherhood includes the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, and  includes the president of the National Urban League, Marc Morial. Also,  in Congress, we are honored to have Congressmen Emanuel Cleaver,    Danny Davis, Al Green,   Gregory Meeks,   David Scott,  Bobby Scott,    Steven Horsford, and Senator Warnock. They are led by the honorable  General President Dr. Willis L. Lonzer, III.   Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority founded in 1908 at Howard University.  Their sisterhood proudly boasts having civil rights leaders, Rosa Parks  and Coretta Scott King; and, of course, their sisterhood also includes  our very own Vice President, Kamala Harris.

Harris,  Jr.; civil rights leader, the Reverend Ralph Abernathy; and former  congressman, the late John Conyers.

Not  only are the Sigmas the fraternity of my husband, Dr. Nathaniel Horn,  they also include: The late, great Congressmen John Lewis and Elijah  Cummings, civil rights pioneer and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car  Porters, Philip Randolph, and also record-setter, Jerry Rice, and a  current congressman, Adriano Espaillat. Their honorable International  President is Michael Cristal.                                time  1115    Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, founded in 1920, just finished celebrating  their 100th year. Notable sisters include: inventor Annie Turnbo  Malone; Zora Neale Hurston; the House also was honored to have the late  Congresswoman Julia Carson and former Congresswoman Donna Edwards; and  their honorable president, Valerie Hollingsworth-Baker.   Sigma Gamma Rho, my favorite sorority, was founded in 1922 at Butler  University. The late Congresswoman Lindy Boggs and former Congresswoman  Corrine Brown honored this House. Also, they join members who are the  first African-American winner of an Academy Award, Hattie McDaniel; the  first Black woman CPA, Mary T.

Members of their crew are Spencer Christian from ``Good  Morning America''; Terrence C. Carson, known as ``Kyle'' from ``Living  Single''; and also our fellow colleague, Congressman   Bobby Rush.  Their honorable grand polaris is Andre R. Mason.   From standing up for women's suffrage, civil rights, and ending Jim  Crow to leading industries, medical advancements, and e-innovation, the  Divine Nine has been at the forefront of progress, and I am so proud to  be a member.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  LGBTQ-plus community throughout Chicagoland and Illinois in support of  the Equality Act.   While we have come a long way in the fight for equality through the  Supreme Court's decisions on recognizing the marriage of same-sex  couples in Obergefell v. Hodges, and protecting workplace rights for  the LGBTQ-plus community in Bostock v. Clayton County, it is time to  codify protections into law.   The Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and extend  existing nondiscrimination laws to ensure that LGBTQ-plus individuals  are treated equally in all facets of their life.   In 2021, it is unconscionable that LGBTQ-plus people continue to face  harassment and outright discrimination while attempting to access  healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities.   It is past time that Congress pass legislation so that all people, no  matter your race, color, creed, or sexuality, are treated equally under  the law in this country.   I rise as an ally in support of the Equality Act because no one  should be discriminated against for who they love or who they are.                            ____________________
