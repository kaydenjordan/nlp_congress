 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the  House of November 1, 2017, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 599)  expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to  United States policy towards Yemen, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 599         Whereas the United States has longstanding strategic       interests in promoting security and stability in the Arabian       Peninsula;        Whereas the United States has a strategic partnership with       the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, including       Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates;        Whereas in 2014, after years of violence and insurgency,       Iranian-supported Houthi rebels seized the Yemeni capital       city of Sana'a, deposing the legitimate, internationally       recognized Government of Yemen and further destabilizing       Yemen and the region;        Whereas the Saudi-led Arab Coalition launched a military       intervention in 2015 against the Houthi-Saleh alliance in       response to the deposition of the legitimate Government of       Yemen and Houthi-Saleh territorial gains in and around the       port of Aden;        Whereas the United States has longstanding strategic       interests in Yemen, including ensuring freedom of navigation       at the Bab al Mandab strait and countering the threats from       Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Al-Qaeda       franchises, and the Yemen affiliate of the Islamic State of       Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS);        Whereas al-Qaeda was responsible for the bombing of the USS       Cole in Aden, Yemen, in October 2000, which killed 17 United       States sailors, and for multiple successful and unsuccessful       terrorist attacks internationally;        Whereas in April 2015, the United Nations Security Council       adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 2216 by 14       affirmative votes to none against, with one abstention (by       the Russian Federation), imposing sanctions on individuals       undermining the stability of Yemen, and demanded that the       Houthis withdraw from all areas seized during the latest       conflict, relinquish arms seized from military and security       institutions, cease all actions falling exclusively within       the authority of the legitimate Government of Yemen and fully       implement previous Security Council resolutions;        Whereas Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has       transferred increasingly sophisticated weapons systems to the       Houthis, who have in turn shot missiles into Saudi Arabia       from positions in northern Yemen;        Whereas in addition to weapons, Iran is reportedly       providing Afghan and Shi'ite Arab specialists to train Houthi       units and act as logistical advisers;        Whereas the Iranian-supported Houthis have attacked       coalition or coalition-affiliated maritime targets multiple       times, an American ship twice, and other shipping, forcing       the United States to respond with a combination of diplomacy       and calibrated military strikes against three radar       facilities in Houthi-controlled territory;        Whereas the United States has participated in intelligence       cooperation since 2015 and, pursuant to a cross-servicing       agreement, has provided midair refueling services to Saudi-      led Arab Coalition warplanes conducting aerial bombings in       Yemen against the Houthi-Saleh alliance, Al Qaeda in the       Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and in support of freedom of       navigation threatened by Iranian-backed Houthi forces;        Whereas, according to the United Nations Office of the High       Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 10,000 Yemeni       civilians have been killed in this conflict since 2015;        Whereas the Saudi-led Arab Coalition has worked to improve       their targeting processes and capabilities aimed at reducing       unintended civilian casualties, and convened a Joint Incident       Assessment Team to investigate the coalition's adherence to       the laws of armed conflict;        Whereas the war in Yemen has contributed to a humanitarian       crisis in Yemen, leading to an April 2017 announcement by the       World Food Program that Yemen is on the brink of ``full-scale       famine'', with approximately 7,000,000 Yemenis, including       2,200,000 children, being classified as ``severely food       insecure'';        Whereas over 500,000 new cholera cases have been detected       in Yemen, and approximately 2,000 people have died from       cholera-related issues;        Whereas the United States remains the largest donor of       humanitarian assistance in Yemen;        Whereas parties to the conflict continue to obstruct access       by journalists and humanitarian organizations seeking to       provide assistance;        Whereas according to the Department of State's Country       Reports on Terrorism 2016, the conflict between Saudi-led       Arab Coalition and the Houthi-Saleh alliance is       counterproductive to ongoing efforts by the United States to       pursue Al Qaeda and its associated forces;        Whereas according to the intelligence community's (as such       term is defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act       of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4))) 2017 Worldwide Threat       Assessment, ``AQAP and ISIS's branch in Yemen have exploited       the conflict and the collapse of government authority to gain       new recruits and allies and expand their influence''; and        Whereas to date, Congress has not enacted specific       legislation authorizing the use of military force against       parties participating in the Yemeni civil war that are not       otherwise subject to the Authorization of Use of Military       Force (Public Law 107-40) or the Authorization of Use of       Military Force in Iraq (Public Law 107-243): Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses the urgent need for a political solution in       Yemen consistent with United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2216 (UNSCR 2216), or otherwise agreed to by the       parties;        (2) denounces the conduct of activities in Yemen and areas       affected by the conflict that are, directly or indirectly,       inconsistent with the laws of armed conflict, including the       deliberate targeting of civilian populations or the use of       civilians as human shields;        (3) calls on all parties to the conflict to increase       efforts to adopt all necessary and appropriate measures to       prevent civilian casualties and to increase humanitarian       access;        (4) supports the Saudi-led Arab Coalition's commitments to       abide by their no-strike list and restricted target list and       improve their targeting capabilities;        (5) condemns Iranian activities in Yemen in violation of       UNSCR 2216, and calls on all responsible countries to take       appropriate and necessary measures against the Government of       Iran, including the interdiction of Iranian weapons to the       Houthis, and the bilateral and multilateral application of       sanctions against Iran for its violations of UNSCR 2216;        (6) encourages other governments to join in providing the       resources necessary to address the humanitarian crisis; and        (7) calls on all parties to the conflict to allow for       unobstructed access for humanitarian organizations, human       rights investigators, medical relief personnel, and       journalists.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks, and to include extraneous material in the Record on the  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including  the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), for working in good faith  toward achieving a resolution that productively addresses a very  complex issue and a very serious issue, namely, the strategic and  humanitarian implications of the ongoing conflict being fought in  Yemen. I should also recognize the good work of our Foreign Affairs  Committee ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel of New York.   This resolution will send a strong and needed message to all involved  in this conflict that is causing so much human suffering. According to  the U.N., more than 20 million people in Yemen--that is 76 percent of  the population--are in need of humanitarian assistance. More than 2  million people are affected by either moderate or by severe  malnutrition.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 599 is a bipartisan alternative to H. Con. Res.  81. That initial proposal had claimed procedural privileges by invoking  section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution, which applies only when U.S.  forces are  [[Page H9149]]  engaged in hostilities abroad without authorization. Though we provide  logistics to our Saudi partners in the region, United States forces are  not conducting hostilities against Houthi forces in Yemen.   The initial resolution also neglected a key facet of the Yemen  crisis, and that is Iran, which has been providing increasing support-- very nefarious support--to the Houthi rebels. We must not forget that  in April of 2015, the U.N. Security Council, acting under Chapter 7 of  the U.N. Charter, condemned the violent Houthi government overthrow  ``in the strongest terms'' and obligated all U.N. member states to  comply with and enforce an embargo on arms and military assistance ``of  all types'' to the Houthi forces. This makes Iran's acts to fuel this  deadly conflict a gross violation of international law, as our  ambassador has pointed out.   I am glad that the new H. Res. 599 addresses these shortcomings, and  I rise to support it today.   Even before this latest conflict, Yemen was the poorest country in  the region. It was wracked by violence and unrest. For years, the  countries of North and South Yemen were in conflict before they became  a single state. That was in 1990. After an uprising in 2011, Yemen  embarked on a path of attempted national dialogue, of unification, and  of constitutional reform; but hopes for stability and progress were  dashed in 2014. That is the time when an Iranian-backed Houthi rebel  group in alliance with former Yemeni strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh,  forcibly deposed the internationally recognized government of President  Hadi.   In response, the United States Security Council adopted Resolution  2216, which sanctioned individuals involved in destabilizing Yemen and  demanded that the Houthis unconditionally end their use of violence,  withdraw their forces, relinquish their seized weapons, and refrain  from threats to neighboring states.   Unfortunately, the Houthi-Saleh rejection of this U.N. Security  Council resolution, with Iran's backing, has sabotaged the prospects  for peace.   Mr. Speaker, the United States has longstanding, critical national  security interests in this region. Members will recall that the deadly  bombing of the USS Cole occurred there in Yemen. Other terrorist plots  against Americans originated in Yemen, including the unsuccessful 2009  underwear bomber attack on a Northwest Airlines flight that was going  to Detroit.   We and our partners continue to conduct operations against al-Qaida  inside Yemen, and that is pursuant to the 2001 Authorization for Use of  Military Force with the permission of the internationally recognized  Government of Yemen.   Although al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula may not grab a lot of  international headlines, it still continues to threaten Western  nations, and it still maintains a significant network in South Yemen,  which we are working to disrupt.   Making matters worse, Yemen has become another front in Iran's quest  for regional dominance, which has accelerated in the wake of the  previous administration's nuclear deal.                                time  1700    Consider that Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has transferred  increasingly sophisticated weapons systems to the Houthis and  specialists to train and advise their units.   Also consider that Iran's top terror proxy, Hezbollah, is helping the  Houthis, who have launched numerous missiles and raids into Saudi  Arabia, killing innocent civilians. Just last week, a ballistic missile  was intercepted over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.   This Iranian meddling in Yemen thwarts peace by empowering the  Houthis to resist a return to political negotiations. The Iranian  regime could not care less about the human suffering it is responsible  for.   Of course, beyond our national security, the region is also vital to  the U.S. and the global economy. The southwest coast of Yemen  constitutes one side of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, a narrow, strategic  chokepoint in the flow of international goods headed to and from  Europe, Asia, and the United States.   At times, Iranian-supported Houthis have attacked international  shipping, including an American vessel. Disruptions to shipping along  the waterway mean disruptions to employment and wages.   So it is no wonder that, in response to these threats, a Saudi-led  coalition of 10 nations began military operations against Houthi-Saleh  forces in March of 2015. Its mission was to reinstate the  internationally recognized government.   However, 2\1/2\ years later, military progress remains elusive and  battle lines are hardened. The Saudi-led coalition controls the port  city of Aden and the lowland areas in the south, while the Houthis  continue to hold the capital and the highlands of northern Yemen.  Civilian casualties have been distressingly high, including from Saudi  airstrikes in the early months of the campaign.   Today, Yemen is in shambles. It is simultaneously experiencing the  world's largest food insecurity crisis and largest cholera outbreak,  with more than 900,000 suspected cases. Last week's moves by the Saudis  to further close ground, air, and seaports only threaten to make things  worse.   The United States remains committed to providing much-needed relief  to innocent men, women, and children affected by this crisis. In fact,  we remain the single largest donor of humanitarian aid to Yemen, by  far.   USAID and U.N. aid to agencies report that all parties to the  conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, have been responsible for  bureaucratic impediments and disruptions to humanitarian operations,  complicating our ability to effectively deliver lifesaving assistance.  Our resolution says this must stop, by all sides.   Mr. Speaker, this all provides for a very complex policy challenge.  Some say the United States should distance itself from longstanding  military cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other Gulf  Cooperation Council partners. But this would only strengthen Iran's  malign influence in the region and would not solve the humanitarian  crisis. Indeed, it would likely worsen it.   At the same time, others say our only focus should be neutralizing  Iran and terrorist threats. But we cannot ignore the moral and  strategic costs of civilian casualties and deteriorating humanitarian  conditions.   To this end, I believe that H. Res. 599 appropriately balances the  shared, bipartisan concerns of this body:   The urgent need for a political solution in Yemen consistent with  Security Council Resolution 2216;   A call for all parties to prevent civilian casualties;   Support for the Saudi-led coalition's commitments to improve  targeting and abide by their no-strike list; and,   Condemnation and sanctions for Iran's destabilizing activities in  Yemen in violation of Security Council Resolution 2216.   Here, we should note that this body has taken strong, bipartisan  action in recent months to challenge Iran's aggression, including by  sanctioning its ICBM program and its support for the terrorist group  Hezbollah.   Make no mistake about it: Iran is an avowed enemy and our biggest  security threat in the region; on the other hand, the Saudis are our  partners.   The resolution calls for all parties to allow unobstructed access for  humanitarian organizations, human rights investigations, medical  personnel, and journalists. In general, it brings attention to a Yemeni  conflict that deserves more international notice.   As we debate this measure, I suspect we may hear different views of  War Powers and authorizations for use of military force as they relate  to Yemen.   As I said, I don't believe our security cooperation with the Saudis  triggers War Powers. This is the type of support we provide to many  other governments. But just because it does not arise under that  particular statute does not make it immune from our scrutiny.   I share Members' concerns that Congress must be as attentive as  possible to the roles and missions of our Armed Forces overseas and  monitor the ways in which our security assistance is being used. In  this sense, Yemen does warrant closer watching. That is what I believe  this resolution does.   I again want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), the  majority leader and minority whip of the  [[Page H9150]]  House, and my good friend Ranking Member Eliot Engel for the good work  that went into this text, which I support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, and current chair of the Subcommittee on  the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this resolution is to pressure the Saudis  to take those steps to reopen access to those ports. That is what we  are doing.   We need to be talking about the other aspect of what we are also  trying to do here, and that is to try to get the Houthis to respond to  the actions taken by the U.N. and to try to get the Houthis to lift  their impediments that they have put in place. They need to respect the  neutrality of aid and stop diverting humanitarian convoys away from  those who are in need, as we know from the U.N. that this is the  problem.   The Houthis, according to the United Nations, need to accept the U.N.  plan that would allow for neutral actors to administer the port of  Hodeidah so deliveries of essential food and medicines can resume.   Part of our difficulty here is the Houthis are, or have become, under  the tutelage here of their Iranian supporters. You know, they are a  minority in Yemen, but Iran uses them to exploit divisions between  Yemeni society. This is part of the complexity of this.   The Houthis' slogan is derived from Iran's own anti-U.S. slogans.  Their slogan, if you listen to them on the broadcast, is: ``Death to  America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews.''   Now, they didn't pick that up on their own. Part of the problem here  is the leaders of the Houthi militia were indoctrinated in Qom, in  Iran, as part of an Iranian attempt to construct a Hezbollah-like proxy  in Yemen. They have done it.   What we are trying to do is figure out a way to both convince them to  reopen the port under the U.N. auspices here for these deliveries and  convince the Saudis and the other members of this coalition that they  should cooperate on this access as well. This is the attempt of this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney), vice chairman of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman  [[Page H9155]]  from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, part of the complexity here in this tragedy is that Iran  does want to turn the Houthis into a Yemeni version of Hezbollah,  thereby turning Yemen into a second Lebanon, where a militia is  constantly holding the government hostage.   We do face a challenge here in the sense that they are firing Iranian  missiles on a regular basis into Saudi Arabia, at cities across Saudi  Arabia, including firing on Riyadh, the capital.    Now, we have not committed American forces to fight against the  Houthi rebels in Yemen, and I do not believe the American people want  us to. We should not. Our main involvement has been in the form of  humanitarian assistance and our longstanding preexisting security  relationships with regional partners, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, and  Gulf Cooperation Council.   I don't disagree that we must push them to improve their operations  to better avoid civilian casualties and humanitarian harm, but it is a  dangerous delusion to think that distancing ourselves from those  security relationships would serve the cause of peace and security in  Yemen and the region. It would do the opposite.   House Resolution 599, in my opinion, is a very responsible reaction  to the ongoing crisis, but it expresses the urgent need for a political  solution in Yemen, calls on all parties to prevent civilian casualties  and promote humanitarian access, and condemns Iran for its continuing  destabilizing activities in Yemen in violation of the U.N. Security  Council.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Khanna for this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
