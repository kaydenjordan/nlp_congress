 Madam Speaker, the United States has long stood guard  against ideologies that would undermine the principles of our  democracy. Historically, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS,  movement has been regarded as inconsistent with American values and in  opposition to alliance with Israel.   Unfortunately, support for the BDS movement has been voiced in the  House of Representatives. Supporting this measure shows disregard for  the longstanding bond that the United States has developed with Israel  as a trustworthy ally in the Middle East.   The United States has never turned a blind eye to our allies, and  every Member of this legislative body should take steps to ensure that  we do not betray  [[Page H7445]]  the enduring trust we have developed with our friend, the nation of  Israel, and its people.   We, as the House of Representatives, should bring up H.R. 336, the  comprehensive legislation addressing the anti-BDS issue. I encourage my  colleagues to support additional measures to protect against the BDS  movement and uphold our friendship with the great nation of Israel.                            ____________________
