 Mr. Speaker, there is a really disturbing story in  Politico today.   Speaker Ryan was apparently afraid that he wouldn't be able to pass  the defense spending bill, including $1.6 billion for Trump's dumb wall  because conservatives wanted to block Medicare for transgender  servicemembers, so he called the President asking for help.   What did Donald Trump do to get Speaker Ryan out of this jam? Trump  decided to ban brave transgender Americans from serving. That is right,  Mr. Speaker, Trump is kicking transgender men and women out of our  Armed Services to make sure he can get money to build his stupid,  irresponsible, unnecessary wall. He is implementing one bigoted policy  in order to achieve another one.   This is hatred in the service of injustice. This is transphobia in  the service of racism. This is stupidity in the service of foolishness.   Mr. Speaker, we need to stop doing Trump's dirty work. Not only is  President Trump's border wall expensive and unnecessary, Members of  this body who care deeply about our national defense shouldn't be  forced to decide between voting for this ridiculous proposal and voting  to fund our military.   More importantly, on such a momentous issue, the American people  deserve to know where their elected representatives stand.   Mr. Speaker, let us defeat this rule. Let us stop this wall. Let us  enable every American patriot, regardless of their gender identity, to  do what I did: to fight for this country with pride, courage, and  selflessness.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.
