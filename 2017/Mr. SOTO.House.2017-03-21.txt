 Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare--a total disaster for America. Here  it is by the numbers, per our own nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office: 24 million Americans will lose coverage, with 14 million  Americans losing coverage in year one; 15 to 20 percent increases in  health insurance premiums in year one; and if you are paying $1,700,  you will be paying $14,600 in premium increases if you are a 64-year- old making $26,500 per year.   But where does the money go? $592 billion in tax cuts for the rich.  That is where it is going.   The conclusions: TrumpCare robs health care from American working  families to give tax cuts to the rich.   So vote ``no'' on TrumpCare to vote ``yes'' on health care for  America's working families.                            ____________________
