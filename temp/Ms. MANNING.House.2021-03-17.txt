 I would like to thank my colleague from my hometown for  holding this Special Order and for all she has done on behalf of women.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to celebrate Women's History Month by  highlighting the multiple and irreplaceable roles that women play in  our communities.   Generations of women have worked to balance jobs with raising  children and caring for aging loved ones. This isn't new. Women have  always disproportionately shouldered the burden of caring for family.  But for the first time, this pandemic has highlighted the toll these  various roles take on women, as so many have been forced to leave the  workforce to care for others.   Over the last year, 2.3 million women have left the workforce, a  nearly 3 percent drop in female participation in the labor force.  Several factors have contributed to this drop, but none more than the  closing of childcare facilities and schools.   The American Rescue Plan is helping women recover from this pandemic  and return to work by bolstering the childcare sector, increasing the  child tax credit, expanding paid leave, and safely reopening schools.   We must treat women with dignity and respect and put into place  systems that allow women to care for their families and excel at work.  I proudly voted to support the American Rescue Plan because it is an  important step in the right direction.
