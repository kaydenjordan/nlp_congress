 Mr. Speaker, I rise to provide enthusiastic  support of this bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Maternal, Infant,  and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, now to be named after our  late, marvelous colleague, Ms. Jackie Walorski.   This strong reauthorization for 5 years would provide additional  funding. It would double the Tribal home visiting set-aside to respond  to the needs of Tribal communities for home visiting and address  workforce shortages, among other things.   Now, home visiting is not just some feel-good policy. As my  colleagues on both sides have indicated, it has been repeatedly  evaluated and consistently proven to provide improved outcomes for  families and children, and we have good data that shows that it works.   Importantly, we have families that are stronger because they have  gotten the help that they needed when they needed it. We have new moms,  for example, who have access to help at critical points as they try to  navigate this exciting but frightening moment in life.                                time  0930    Oh, my goodness. It reminds me of when I was 18 years old some 50  years ago and had my first baby. I had a baby who had an asthma attack  4 days after birth, and I didn't even know how to change a diaper. The  home visiting program was a fail-safe for me.   I think, too, of women like Brittany who live in our community. She  benefited from Children's Wisconsin's Healthy Families Milwaukee County  Home Visiting Program 8 years ago but then reached out to the Home  Visiting Program earlier this year for help because she was now  pregnant again after a recent cancer diagnosis.   Brittany trusted her home visitor to help guide her through this  pregnancy as they had supported her in the past. They were able to set  up home visits and help Brittany advocate for her own healthcare, for  herself as well as her unborn child, and supported the entire family.   When they asked Brittany what was the most valuable thing that she  got from the program other than, of course, the plethora of help, one  of the things that struck me was that her home visitor helped her to  learn to trust her own instincts, something that you have to have if  you are a mom.
