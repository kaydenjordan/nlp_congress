 I thank Senator Hoeven and Senator Roberts for  organizing this and getting us down here to talk about a topic that is  so, so very important.   I am not going to say anything new. I am going to be saying that we  need to include reimbursement to the USDA's Commodity Credit  Corporation in the upcoming continuing resolution. The CCC is the  funding mechanism for the bulk of our Nation's agriculture and  conservation programs that are authorized with broad bipartisan support  in the farm bill.  [[Page S5687]]    In order for these programs to work as intended, the CCC must be  reimbursed by Congress on an annual basis. For decades, the CCC has  been reimbursed by Congress without fanfare, and I am hopeful this year  will be a continuation. Earlier this year, the Senate voted unanimously  to allow the USDA to use $14 billion from the CCC to prevent, prepare  for, and respond to the coronavirus. This provision was included in the  CARES Act.   As our farmers and ranchers face the most challenging year in recent  history, we have an obligation to advance this provision so the  important farm and conservation program payments are made on time and  in full to our farmers and ranchers.   Earlier this week, over 40 agricultural organizations representing  farmers and ranchers across the country sent a letter to the  Appropriations Committee, urging this provision be included in the  continuing resolution.   Preventing a CCC reimbursement would only exacerbate the tremendous  hardship and challenges facing our farmers and ranchers. So I am here  with so many other members of the Senate Ag Committee and Members who  represent rural States to urge the Senate to help farmers and ranchers  and prevent the uncertainty that would come from not including this  important provision.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in light of a  significant anniversary for a crucial organization in the state of  Arkansas. Fifty years ago, Special Olympics Arkansas was founded under  the idea of an equal and opportune Arkansas. On this special day of  celebration, I would like to recognize and thank Special Olympics  Arkansas for its dedication to a virtuous mission that has transformed  my State in more ways than one.   Special Olympics Arkansas was designed to fulfill and uphold a  specific vision to transform communities through sports and education.  To make this ambition a reality, the organization provides individuals  with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to participate in year- round sports and athletic training. Just as Special Olympics Arkansas  has a positive impact on the field, it is also a powerful and effective  catalyst for social change off the field. By offering a range of  programming efforts that encompass health, education, community  building and leadership, Special Olympics Arkansas is doing exactly  what it set out to accomplish.   Since its inception, the organization has seen increasing and  overwhelming demand. Special Olympics Arkansas has 15,000 participating  athletes and 5,000 volunteers. Additionally, it offers training in 15  different sports with 240 statewide competitions and has cultivated  participation in all 75 of the State's counties. While the  transformative power of sports is at the organization's core,  competition is merely a gateway to creating avenues for individuals,  both with and without intellectual disabilities, to experience personal  growth, find joy and gain confidence. The addition of several new  programs such as the Inclusive Health Program, Unified School Program,  and the Unified Leadership Program has proven tremendously valuable in  breaking down barriers and creating accepting and inclusive  communities. Thanks to Special Olympics Arkansas, our State has  experienced great social progress and meaningful change over the past  50 years.   I cannot thank Special Olympics Arkansas enough for its continued  dedication to creating an environment where enhanced opportunity and  acceptance take center stage. Arkansas citizens of all backgrounds,  their families, and our  [[Page S5704]]  communities are forever grateful for five decades of hard work and  dedication to a better tomorrow.                            ____________________
