 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life  of Irma Cantu Acosta, a titan in Southern Californian real estate and a  beloved wife, mother, and grandmother.   Irma grew up in Los Angeles after her parents, Tomasita Saenz Cantu  and  [[Page S1207]]  Benjamin Cantu, moved their family from Texas to California in 1950.  She graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School and attended Stockton  Bible College in Stockton, CA. But after only one semester, as her son  Gary says, Irma and her high school sweetheart Ernie ``missed each  other too much,'' and they chose to get married in 1962. Together, they  had three children--Gary, Yvette and Daliah Lynn--before Irma started  what would become a highly accomplished career in real estate.   Because of her intelligence and uncompromising drive, she quickly  became an association executive for the Montebello Board of Realtors,  where she would serve for 43 years. While there, she received numerous  awards for both her personal and professional achievements, including  Woman of the Year for her record in association management.   As a founding board member of the National Association of Hispanic  Real Estate Professionals, she helped make the dream of homeownership  possible for more Latinos. She served as a mentor to countless real  estate professionals and business owners, providing guidance and care  to the next generation of business leaders in Montebello.   Throughout our Nation's long and storied history, there have been  leaders, allies, and advocates who have chosen not just to work hard  and succeed in their chosen fields, but to turn around and help others  achieve the American dream. Irma was one of those leaders. In the  families she helped, the mentees she guided, and in her three strong,  compassionate children, Irma kept that dream alive. What better gift to  leave behind than hope for the next generation.   California's thoughts are with Irma's husband Ernie; her children  Gary, Yvette, and Daliah Lynn; and all those who knew and loved  her.                            ____________________
