 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor today expecting to support H.R.  1293, which has to do with the reporting of official time, but based on  the negative commentary we are getting generally about official time  and the knock against Federal employees we have heard here today, I am  anxious now about supporting this bill because it appears that what is  happening is our colleagues on the other side are setting the table for  bringing other legislation eventually to the floor that is actually  going to attack and undermine official time.   My colleague earlier referred to a wolf in sheep's clothing  represented by this bill. You can look at it as the camel's nose under  the tent. Whatever it is, I am worried now that the agenda here is to  undermine official time.   Let's remind ourselves of the various benefits of official time. It  helps to resolve workplace disputes, which is really important. It  helps to improve efficiency within the workplace. It is what leads to  negotiating positive agreements between labor and management. It is how  official time, when it is used wisely--and there is no evidence that it  is not used wisely; there is no evidence of abuse or misuse of official  time--and when it is used the way it has been used, it helps our  Federal agencies help the American people. It helps these agencies  function well.   I hope that we can reject whatever is coming down the pipeline. I was  cautiously optimistic when I came to support this bill that these other  efforts that seem to be underway were maybe being put to bed, but now I  am concerned that there is an agenda coming. So we will just have to  see how it goes.   I want to reiterate my strong support for the use of official time  the way it is used by our Federal employees, which is in a very  positive fashion, and I urge my colleagues on the other side to protect  official time and all of its benefits.
