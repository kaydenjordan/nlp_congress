 Madam Speaker, again and again we hear a  common refrain when a mass shooting happens, a young man, typically  under the age of 21, legally purchases a semiautomatic rifle and  murders innocent people. We saw this in Uvalde; we saw this in Buffalo;  we saw this in Indianapolis in 2021; and we saw this in Parkland in  2019. In fact, six of the nine deadliest mass shootings since 2018 were  by young men who should never have been allowed to purchase these  weapons in the first place.   Right now, you must be 21 in this country to buy a handgun but only  need to be 18 years old to buy a semiautomatic rifle capable of  committing unspeakable tragedies. I served in the military. I trained  with these weapons. I know what they can do.   These weapons of war have no place in our neighborhoods, let alone in  the hands of an untrained 18-year-old boy. The answer is simple--raise  the age needed to purchase these weapons to 21, in line with the age to  purchase handguns. We have bipartisan support for this: Democrats,  Republicans, gun safety advocates, law-abiding citizens and responsible  gun owners, teachers, and veterans, because it is common sense.   Shooting after shooting, we ask ourselves what more could we have  done. We debate whether one action could have saved the lives of those  children, those mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and neighbors. I am  done with that. It is time for action.   Raising the age to buy these weapons won't solve our Nation's gun  violence epidemic overnight, but if we can make it just a little harder  for someone to get their hands on these deadly weapons, if we can save  just one life or one community from this carnage and grief, it will be  worth it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Raise the age to buy these deadly weapons. Enough is enough.
