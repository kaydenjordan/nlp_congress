House Resolution 467 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 8.  (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Thursday, June 17, 2021, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.

(c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 473, providing for consideration of  H.R. 256, to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force against  Iraq resolution of 2002, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and one motion to  recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1187, the Corporate  Governance Improvement and Investor Protection Act, under a structured  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial  Services, makes in order 10 amendments, provides en bloc authority to  the chair of the Committee on Financial Services, and provides for one  motion to recommit.   The rule provides that the provisions of section 202 of the National  Emergencies Act shall not apply to H.J. Res. 46. The rule also deems  passage of H. Res. 467.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills  considered on June 14 or June 15. This authority lasts through June 17.                                time  1715    Madam Speaker, there are two critically important measures contained  in this rule.   H.R. 1187 will build on landmark reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act and  Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It will help hold corporations accountable, help  investors make informed decisions, and build a more sustainable and  equitable economic recovery. These improvements are badly needed,  especially at a time when we are seeing a new era of sustainable  investors.   I want to discuss one bill in particular here today, Madam Speaker, a  bill that was authored by the distinguished Chair, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee from California, because this Congress is doing something  extraordinary.   Nearly 20 years after we passed a measure to address the overthrow of  Saddam Hussein and 10 years after the conflict in Iraq officially  ended, we are reasserting our constitutional responsibility over  matters of war and peace by finally repealing the 2002 Authorization  for Use of Military Force.   This isn't an arcane legislative maneuver or simply some rhetorical  exercise. This AUMF has been used over and over again to expand the  mission and range of targets of U.S. military operations in Iraq never  imagined when it was passed.   In fact, President Trump misused it as recently as last January to  justify the strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The  impacts of that decision dramatically escalated tensions between the  United States and Iran and throughout the region, tensions that persist  to this very day.   Madam Speaker, the process that we are starting here today with H.R.  256 provides a roadmap for Congress to get off the sidelines and to  stop abdicating its constitutional responsibility to debate matters of  war and peace.   That is what our Founders intended. They knew that decisions of such  magnitude should not be made in a vacuum solely by a President. That is  why the Constitution makes the President Commander in Chief but gives  only Congress the power to declare war.   It is no secret that for a long time there were Members on both sides  of the aisle who preferred to skirt that responsibility. They left such  consequential decisions to whoever sat at 1600  [[Page H2717]]  Pennsylvania Avenue, Republican or Democrat.   But each of us was elected and sent here to do more than just make  the easy calls. We were sent here to make tough decisions, especially  when it involves sending our uniformed men and women, the people we  represent, into harm's way and shoveling billions upon billions of  taxpayer dollars overseas.   A growing number of Members, both Democrats and Republicans, have  been working together to reclaim our Article I powers. There is now a  bipartisan, bicameral consensus that we not only have to end endless  wars, but we have to reexamine the shrinking congressional authority  and the expanding executive powers that get us into global conflicts in  the first place and, like inertia, keep us there for decades.   The Rules Committee has been working with the House Foreign Affairs  Committee to do just that because everything has changed since Congress  enacted the original War Powers Resolution over President Nixon's veto  more than 50 years ago.   When we fight, how we fight, and why we fight, these are big issues  that merit our most engaged attention and resolve. We have a  responsibility to make sure that these laws and authorities work in the  modern age.   I want to thank, in particular, Ranking Member Cole on the Rules  Committee for working with me in this effort. He has been pushing to  reclaim Congress' Article I responsibilities, no matter which party  controls Congress or who sits in the White House. I know that sometimes  it has been a lonely journey, but he has never stopped fighting because  it is the right thing to do for this country and for this institution.   I also want to thank Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul for  working with us on this bipartisan effort.   Again, I want to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee for being consistent  and never giving up in her effort not only to end endless wars but to  make sure that Congress lives up to its constitutional  responsibilities.   I am grateful that we also have a President in office today who  supports reevaluating executive war powers. I have to be honest, Madam  Speaker, I never thought I would see that day. But President Biden  spent decades in the Senate grappling with the limitations of the War  Powers Resolution, and he has a record of looking for ways to change  it.   This opportunity is like lightning in a bottle. We have a coalition  in Congress trying to get this done, and now the missing piece, a  President in the Oval Office with the political will to take this on,  is hopefully now falling into place.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join us in seizing this moment.  Let's make the repeal of the 2002 AUMF the first step in not only  repealing and reforming outdated AUMFs but reimagining the War Powers  Resolution for the modern age.   President Johnson once said that it is damn easy to get into a war,  but it is awfully hard to get out of one. We are here today because of  the truth of that statement.   It should never be that Congress, and the people we represent, are  sidelined on the life-or-death questions of when to go to war and when  to come home.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record a June 1 Newsweek article titled ``Congress  Has a Chance To Reclaim Its War Powers.''                               [June 1, 2021]              Congress Has a Chance To Reclaim Its War Powers                             (By Dan Caldwell)         In response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, then-President       George W. Bush signed into law the 2001 Authorization for Use       of Military Force to provide the legal authority to pursue       and punish those responsible. The following year, the 2002       AUMF was passed to authorize the ill-conceived invasion of       Iraq and the overthrow of dictator Saddam Hussein.        Over the last 20 years, both laws have been used to justify       military actions disconnected from their original intent.       These laws--unmodified since their original passage--have       sanctioned combat operations in at least 19 countries.        Successive congresses have abdicated their constitutionally       prescribed role in foreign  [[Page H2718]]       policy, allowing four presidential administrations to exploit       the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs and stretch their Article II       authorities. Multiple military conflicts have been expanded       or initiated with minimal congressional oversight and debate.        It is past time for Congress to firmly reassert its role in       shaping U.S. foreign policy. After 20 years of endless war,       it owes its constituents--including our men and women in       uniform--a better foreign policy that prioritizes keeping       Americans safe. Rather than abdicating its solemn duties,       Congress must inquire, ``Why, at what cost, and toward what       end?'' are young American servicemembers sent to fight and       die for ill-premised objectives that are fundamentally       disconnected from vital national interests. Further evasion       of these hard questions cheapens the ``true faith and       allegiance'' they swore to uphold when elected to office.        Over 7,000 Americans have lost their lives and tens of       thousands more wounded in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and       Africa. These conflicts have cost the American taxpayer over       $6.4 trillion dollars--a number that will surely continue to       grow as wars drag on and the cost of caring for veterans of       these wars is tallied.        Congress has several ways it can help bring an end to our       endless wars while helping shape a better foreign policy.        First, in the coming months the House of Representatives       will likely have an opportunity to repeal the 2002 AUMF by       passing legislation introduced by Representative Barbara Lee       (D-Calif.)--a stalwart champion of Congress reclaiming its       powers in matters of war and peace. A similar bill has been       introduced in the Senate by Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and       Tim Kaine (D-Va.), which has been endorsed by the Biden       administration. Additional legislation repealing the outdated       1957 and 1991 AUMFs has been introduced by Representatives       Peter Meijer (R-Mich.) and Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.).       Passage of these bipartisan bills should be a no-brainer for       a Congress bitterly divided on other issues and an important       first step toward Congress reclaiming its most important       prerogative.        Congress should also consider revision--or outright       repeal--of the 2001 AUMF. More than the 2002 AUMF, this law       has been stretched to justify conflicts far afield from its       original intent of authorizing operations against Al-Qaeda       and the Taliban in Afghanistan after 9/11. It is worth       acknowledging that the underlying purpose of the 2001 AUMF       has been satisfied: Osama bin Laden is dead, Al-Qaeda has       been decimated and the Taliban severely punished. And despite       never being amended, this authorization has been cited to       account for operations against groups that didn't even exist       on 9/11 in places such as Somalia and Libya.        If Congress repeals the 2001 AUMF, the executive branch       still has the authority to authorize military operations to       repel imminent attacks and to engage in self-defense       (although Congress should take steps to ensure that this       authority isn't stretched too far, as it was by President Joe       Biden's recent airstrikes in Syria). If Congress identifies a       need to replace the 2001 AUMF, it should authorize force       against clear targets given specified objectives, geographic       boundaries and clear sunsets.        Congress should also use its power of the purse to assert       its authority in foreign policy. This is in many ways the       most effective tool Congress has and it has been used       successfully in the past to end American involvement in       conflicts, including Vietnam.        Repealing outdated AUMFs and helping end our forever wars       around the globe would enjoy broad support from the American       people. Poll after poll has shown a majority of Americans       want an end to our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, while also       supporting Congress playing a greater role in authorizing       military conflicts abroad.        I am proud to have deployed to Iraq as a U.S. Marine. Many       of those I served with are still in uniform and are still       deploying to war zones on a regular basis, even if they       harbor doubts about the necessity of those conflicts.       Congress owes it to them to step up and do its job by       reasserting itself in matters of war and peace. Failing to do       so dishonors those who have and who continue to serve       overseas in the wars that have dragged on in part due to       congressional inaction.    Madam Speaker, over the last 20 years, both the 2001  and 2002 AUMFs have been used to justify military actions disconnected  from their original intent.   I want to say to my colleague from Pennsylvania that we are grateful  for his service to our country. But the fact is that we are still  operating under an AUMF that we passed almost 20 years ago, almost two  decades ago.   When we were debating that AUMF--an AUMF that I voted against--there  is no way that we would have anticipated what the realities are now.  The notion that somehow we can't, as a body, come together and revisit  these AUMFs on a regular basis, to me, is beyond comprehension.   We owe it to the men and women who serve our country in our Armed  Forces to make sure that we are doing our due diligence.   The President has multiple authorities, by the way, to be able to  respond to any threats against individual U.S. citizens almost anywhere  in the world. But if people are trying to use this AUMF as a way to  potentially have a war with Iran, let me just say this: If that is what  anybody's goal is, you better damn well come back to Congress and have  a debate, and people ought to be able to vote yes or no on it.   Many of us are concerned that these lingering AUMFs are going to be  misconstrued and misinterpreted and misused.   I include in the Record a Statement of Administration Policy.  President Biden supports the Lee bill. He doesn't see any need to have  a continuation of the 2002 AUMF. If the President of the United States  doesn't see a need to continue it, I don't know why we feel we have to  continue something that is clearly outdated.                     Statement of Administration Policy    h.r. 256--repeal of authorization for use of military force--against        iraq resolution of 2002--rep. lee, d-ca with 134 co-sponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 256, to       repeal the Authorization for Use of of Military Force Against       Iraq Resolution of 2002 (``2002 AUMF''). This bipartisan       legislation would terminate the October 16, 2002, statutory       authorization for the use of military force against Iraq.        The Administration supports the repeal of the 2002 AUMF, as       the United States has no ongoing military activities that       rely solely on the 2002 AUMF as a domestic legal basis, and       repeal of the 2002 AUMF would likely have minimal impact on       current military operations. Furthermore, the President is       committed to working with the Congress to ensure that       outdated authorizations for the use of military force are       replaced with a narrow and specific framework appropriate to       ensure that we can continue to protect Americans from       terrorist threats.        In working with the Congress on repealing and replacing       other existing authorizations of military force, the       Administration seeks to ensure that the Congress has a clear       and thorough understanding of the effect of any such action       and of the threats facing U.S. forces, personnel, and       interests around the world. As the Administration works with       the Congress to reform AUMFs, it will be critical to maintain       the clear authority to address threats to the United States'       national interests with appropriately decisive and effective       military action.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, what a crock. I mean, it is hard to hear anybody on  the other side of the aisle talk about government shutdowns. I remember  when they lost this place 3 years ago. What did they do? They left us  with a government shutdown. First time ever in history, the Republican  majority did that.   The gentleman is saying we are not going to vote on this stuff. Maybe  he doesn't understand the legislative process. Let me remind everybody  that we have to vote on every single cent that we put forward here.   We have an appropriations process. Maybe the gentleman doesn't  understand that. But every cent that we spend has to be voted on by  people in this Chamber. So nobody is not going to vote on anything.   Let me just put this in perspective. Yes, the President's budget was  late, and given the timing of the President's budget, the  Appropriations Committee needs to get started to start doing their  work, unless my friends don't want the Appropriations Committee to do  their work. Deeming a top-line number for appropriators is a  housekeeping item that we can take care of so they can move forward,  and we can then turn our attention to a budget resolution and enacting  the transformational policies included in the President's American Jobs  Plan and American Families Plan.   Here's the thing that really gets me when I hear people have  meltdowns on the floor. This process has been used by Republicans and  Democrats alike in order to allow appropriators to get started on their  work. Ever since the first deeming resolution in fiscal year 1999, when  Republicans were in charge, overall House Republican majorities used  deemers nine times, including for fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015,  and 2019. Boy, how convenient it is to forget about all of that. But,  then, again, facts don't seem to matter.    Just one other thing. When the gentleman used the term ``big lie,'' I  don't want to be lectured by anybody about a big lie, especially by  individuals who voted deliberately to overturn the will of the American  people, to undermine our democracy. I will not be lectured to by  anybody on that matter.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon),  a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I don't even know what to say. The response to the situation at our  border and to the people who are fleeing their countries in Central  America to try to seek refugee in the United States, the response that  the Republicans just came up with basically is saying we are going to  withhold any money for Vice President Harris' travel budget unless she  goes to the border and does a photo op.   We are supposed to be a serious legislative body. We are supposed to  be the most serious, most deliberative legislative body in the world,  and my friends say we are going to withhold her travel budget unless  she goes to the border and does a photo op. That is what this is.   Never mind that Vice President Harris represented California as a  United States Senator, which is a border State. Never mind that she  just went to Central America because people are coming to our border  from places like El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Never mind she  went to some of these countries where people are fleeing so we can try  to figure out how to deal with this issue.   My Republican friends have brought to the House floor a bill that  basically says: You know what? Our solution is you either go and do a  photo op at the border or we are going to withhold your travel budget.   I mean, really? That is a serious legislative proposal?   I don't even know how to respond to that, other than to say that, you  could have come up with something better. This isn't even worth any  more of my time talking about it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The gentleman can come and huff and puff all he wants on the House  floor, but, again, I remind people that the solution that is being put  forward by my Republican friends is to withhold the Vice President's  travel budget until she does a photo op. I think this is beneath, quite  frankly, the dignity of this legislative body.   I would also say to the gentleman that what the Vice President was  trying to do was get at the source of migration, of people coming to  our border, trying to solve the problem. She was spending her time  trying to figure out how to solve the problem, not try to figure out  how to overturn the last election; not trying to figure out how to  reinstate the last President who lost the election not only fair and  square, but by a pretty big margin, but actually trying to solve  problems.   It is hard to sit here and listen to some of the things we have  listened to here today and then be told: Oh, here is our proposal.   I mean, come on. Give me a break.   Let's get back to trying to figure out to solve problems rather than  try to score political points. And if you are going to try to score  political points, certainly you can come up with a better idea than  this.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I don't know what the gentleman was talking about, about woke yuppies  and all this other kind of stuff he was talking about here today, but  Democrats actually believe in science. We believe that climate change  is real. We believe that we ought to have some accountability,  especially in the corporate world, as to what they are doing and how  they are reporting their actions.   I find this so concerning that we can't even have a debate on what,  in fact, the underlying legislation is. I think the bill that  Congresswoman Waters has brought to the floor is a commonsense bill  that I hope even some Republicans might support.   I would also say that the other piece of legislation that we were  talking about here today is Barbara Lee's bill to repeal the 2002  Authorization for Use of Military Force. Many of us have been urging  that we repeal that 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force for  quite a while now. It has passed the House and it has passed committee.  Yet here we are again, and now we have a President of the United States  that says that he no longer wants that, that he actually supports what  we are trying to do here. Yet we still have people on the House floor  who say, no, we need to hold onto it, an Authorization for Use of  Military Force that we passed almost 20 years ago that somehow is  applicable today. That just doesn't make any sense to me.   People like Congresswoman Lee; Congressman Adam Smith; the late  Republican Congressman, Walter Jones; and Congressman Tom Cole have  talked about the need for us to reclaim our constitutional powers when  it comes to committing American forces into harm's way.    Quite frankly, many of us have been raising this issue--didn't matter  who was in the White House, whether it was a Democrat or a Republican-- because we think it is the right thing to do. We think somehow it is  cowardice for Congress to just keep on kicking the can down the road to  ignoring these important debates.   You have those debates, and if people decide to continue the same  old, same old, fine. That is what the majority of people here vote for.  If people decide to end it, that ought to be fine, too. That is what we  are here for.  [[Page H2722]]    I think this institution would be better served if we took our  constitutional responsibilities with regard to war and peace more  seriously.   Today, I hope we will pass this rule and we will then pass the Lee  bill. But it isn't the end of our work. We are going to need to  continue to review and repeal and reform outdated Authorizations for  Use of Military Force, and we need to reimagine the broader issues  embedded in the War Powers Resolution, because never again should we  acquiesce and allow Congress to sit on the sidelines as wars are  crafted and carried out by the White House, wars that never end, wars  that sacrifice lives and sacrifice treasure.   Let's respect our troops. Let's respect their families. Let's respect  this institution. Let's finally get back to doing our jobs, taking  responsibility and voting on issues of war and peace. And let's start  today by supporting this rule and the underlying measures.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 473    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 3403) to limit travel by the Vice President until       after certain activities are undertaken with respect to the       southwest border, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Oversight and Reform; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3403.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
