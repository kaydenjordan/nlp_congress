 Mr. Speaker, today is the day lifesaving  Medicaid expansion takes effect as the State budget of North Carolina  becomes law.   After more than a decade of waiting, in some cases, dying, without  access to lifesaving healthcare, nearly 95,000 eastern North  Carolinians trapped in the Medicaid coverage gap now have a lifeline.   Medicaid expansion will be formally launched in North Carolina on  December 1, 2023. As co-chair of the State Medicaid Expansion Caucus, I  want to emphasize my unwavering commitment to this cause. I pledge to  work closely with my former colleagues in the State legislature to  ensure Medicaid expansion is implemented effectively and we address the  unacceptable health disparities that have persisted in the East for far  too long. Let us stand together and make the delivery of healthcare a  reality.                            ____________________
