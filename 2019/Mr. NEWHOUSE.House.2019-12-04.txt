 Madam Speaker, ``Service Above Self,'' that is the  motto of the more than 33,000 Rotary clubs and 1.2 million Rotarians  worldwide who provide service to others, promote integrity, and advance  world understanding, goodwill, and peace.   Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor 100 years of the Yakima Rotary  Club. From the early days in 1919, when the Yakima Rotary Club helped  to install street signs within the city limits of Yakima to help guide  the way for residents and visitors alike, to the $22 million YMCA and  Yakima Rotary Aquatic Center that just opened last month, Yakima  Rotarians ``always say yes.''   Be it from supporting children's health, literacy, and hunger to  promoting our parks and public spaces and awarding thousands of dollars  of academic scholarships every year, their volunteerism, fellowship,  and deep love for our community has made a deep and lasting impact on  the greater Yakima Valley.   Congratulations on 100 years of ``Service Above Self,'' Yakima  Rotarians, and enjoy what I have no doubt will be the greatest party  ever.                            ____________________
