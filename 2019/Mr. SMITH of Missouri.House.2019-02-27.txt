 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration  of a bill I sponsored, H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act, to make sure that the most vulnerable children in the  United States have access to lifesaving medical care, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent  request cannot be entertained, I urge the Speaker and the Majority  Leader to immediately schedule a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act so that we can protect the sanctity of human  life.
