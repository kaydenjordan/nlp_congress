 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary and  Homeland Security Committees and as founder and co-chair of the  Congressional Children's Caucus I rise in strong support of S. 772,  ``AMBER Alert in Indian Country Act of 2017.''   This bill ensures that Native American tribes would be eligible for  Justice Department grants to establish AMBER Alert systems, authorizing  a $10 million grant program.   The bill would allow grants to cover costs associated with  integrating tribal AMBER Alert systems into state and regional plans to  ensure broader distribution of alerts involving Indian children.   This legislation provides crucial infrastructure to keep children and  adults safe in all of America, whether they live on a reservation or  not.   The Justice Department will be able to waive their 50 percent funds  matching cap if any Native American Tribe is not able to fully fund  their nonfederal share of the project.   Law enforcement agencies use the AMBER Alert system through radio,  television, phones, email, and road alerts to alert the public of child  abductions.   This system is responsible for the successful return of over 800  missing children.   The lack of coordination between tribal and state authorities, and  the resulting delays in broadcasting an AMBER Alert, were blamed for  the 2016 death of Ashlynne Mike, an 11-year-old Navajo girl.   More than 7,500 Native American children are listed as missing in the  United States. This legislation will reduce that number.   This legislation facilitates coordination between tribal and state  authorities, resulting in faster unification of families of abducted  children.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will make a difference and deserves the  overwhelming support of this body.   The sheer volume of abduction of love ones is enough to support this  legislation.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in protecting our children and  those suffering from abuse by supporting S. 772.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to H.R. 2410, the  ``Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment  Act of 2017.''   I support this bipartisan legislation because it will improve the way  states study and monitor sickle cell disease.   This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the  Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to states to:   Collect data on the prevalence and distribution of sickle cell  disease;   Conduct sickle cell disease public health initiatives to improve  access to care and health outcomes; and   Identify and evaluate strategies for prevention and treatment of  sickle cell disease complications.   Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that:   Sickle cell disease affects 90,000 to 100,000; Americans;   Sickle cell disease occurs among about 1 out of every 500 Black or  African-American births;   Sickle cell disease occurs among about 1 out of every 36,000  Hispanic-American births;   Sickle Cell Trait occurs among about 1 in 12 Blacks or African  Americans.   If one parent has sickle cell 4 anemia and the other has sickle cell  trait, there is a 50 percent chance (or 1 out of 2) of having a baby  with either sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait with each  pregnancy.   It is critical that infants with Sickle Cell are identified early.   Sickle cell-related deaths among African-American children younger  than 4 years of age fell by 42 percent from 1999 through 2002.   This drop coincided with the introduction in 2000 of a vaccine that  protects against invasive pneumococcal disease.   Many racial health disparities stem from lack of access to quality  healthcare and proper health awareness.   Certain medical illnesses are known to be more prevalent in certain  demographic groups, including type II diabetes, lupus, sickle cell  anemia, and Triple Negative Breast Cancer for which African Americans  are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed on average.   As a Member of Congress, I have been a staunch advocate for my  constituents to find a cure for sickle cell disease.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation will prepare states to  combat sickle cell disease in the 21st century, while helping provide  access to healthcare for Americans.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of  H.R. 2410.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2422,  the Action for Dental Health Act of 2017.   The ADH Act will allow states to receive grants that will establish  innovative dental programs on behalf of the Health Resources and  Services Administration.   Passing H.R. 2422 will establish of dental homes for children and  adults, reduce use of emergency departments for dental services, and  reduce geographic, language and cultural barriers in the dental care  system.   Mr. Speaker, there is a great need to improve oral health education  and prevent dental diseases in low-income and underserved communities.   The health of many Americans is dependent upon the resources we  provide.   African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans and Alaska Natives  generally have the poorest oral health of any racial and ethnic groups  in the United States.   African Americans, non-Hispanics, and Mexican Americans aged 35 to 44  years experience untreated tooth decay nearly twice as much as white,  non-Hispanics.   Poor oral health is strongly correlated with other chronic health  conditions like cardiovascular diseases, lung disease, strokes,  diabetes and can also contribute to problems with employment which  furthers poverty.   The Surgeon General estimates that children with oral disease miss  over 51 million hours of school each year, and that adults with oral  disease miss approximately 164 million hours of work each year.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2422 to show their  support and compassion for the people we serve and to ensure that  individuals predisposed to contracting any sort of dental diseases  receive the proper prevention and care they deserve.    Mr. Speaker, although many in my constituency are  still recovering from Hurricane Harvey--and I wear a ``Houston Strong''  pin--we are working on getting housing rebuilt and seniors back in  their homes, I can tell you that, throughout my district, as I was  there this past week, they spoke in quiet tones about Douglas, the high  school, and the tragedy in Florida.   And none of them seemed to agree--and, in particular, young men, who  I will talk about in the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order on  guns. None of them seemed to agree to arming teachers. All of them had  ideas about gun violence and handguns, as well as weapons of war. And I  believe the young people should be listened to, and we should not leave  until we do constructive, sensible gun safety legislation, and it  should be done now.   I ask the American people to rise up and speak in tones of  nonpartisanship, bipartisanship, to save and secure our children and  our teachers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished  gentleman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for his leadership. I am  delighted to join the Congressional Black Caucus this evening under the  leadership of Chairman Richmond.   As my colleagues have said, we have been, sadly, a leader on  commonsense gun safety legislation, sadly, because many of our  districts, although we represent the huge numbers of diverse  Americans--our districts represent Anglos, African Americans,  Hispanics, and Asians, and all economic backgrounds, all wealth  backgrounds, all backgrounds dealing with religion--we are able to  speak because many of our districts have the reality of gun violence.   So I want to speak, Mr. Speaker, to a particular point that I have  heard from the stander-uppers of the NRA, particularly the president  and CEO when he spoke to the conservative organization just this past  week. I was certainly shocked to hear accusations about Democrats are  socialists, even to the extent of calling out Members' names, which I  think patently rejects the comity and collegiality of recognizing  democracy accepts two distinct parties and some other parties and  respects differences of opinion.   But let me be very clear on the record. No one Member of this body,  nor the distinguished gentleman, can eliminate the Second Amendment. No  group of 20 Members of Congress, no Republicans of Congress and no  Democrats of Congress, can eliminate the Second Amendment.   The Second Amendment is a constitutional amendment, and there is a  decided practice of a percentage of Members of Congress and the  percentage of Members of 50 States. With that in mind, let us clear the  air. But if we want to know the truth, what is being fought is gun  safety legislation, not gun eradication.   In my State, you cannot rent a car if you are not 21. The Federal law  says that you cannot buy a gun if you are not 21. I will be introducing  legislation to raise the age of 21. I already have legislation, a 7-day  waiting period banning bump stocks, and, of course, dealing with  automatic weapons. I know we are introducing one now.   There are a multitude of introductions of bills and a multitude of  decisions being made by the Florida delegation which we should listen  to. I hope they will come forward in a bipartisan way.   But let me talk about the children and parents. I was on the air  today talking--or hearing that parents are hovering and scared of  sending their children to school, and the children are scared. This  last week I went into my schools where children were not only talking  about not arming teachers, but the gunfire in their neighborhoods by  handguns, or those who were in schools dealing with children who had  steered in the wrong direction. Those children were talking about you  got to pack. Gun culture doesn't realize what we are turning our  children into that they have got to pack.   So from Las Vegas to Orlando, to Virginia, to Sandy Hook, to San  Bernardino, to now Douglas High School, the question is: When are we  going to act?   An average of 1,297 children die annually from a gun-related injury.  A majority of Americans now support gun policy proposals, such as  barring people with mental illness from buying guns. But let me make it  very clear. I don't label people who suffer from mental health issues.  What I say is: Let us provide the resources for those individuals and  clearly between mistakes of reporting what this young man had  indicated, to mistakes on the local and Federal level, to mistakes on  his mental health situation. We all can stand in blame. But they are  adults.   What the response has been from our good friends who are the gun  advocates, so they say, has been to close their eyes, close their ears,  and not sit down at the table of reconciliation. The gun manufacturers  cannot continue to dominate the discussion of sensible gun legislation,  from Gabby Giffords to the tragedies that I have listed, to children  who are saying: I hover in my room, my bedroom, listening to gunfire in  my neighborhood because the proliferation of guns is so extensive.   So guns are being trafficked illegally because of the gun culture.  There are many elements that will go into this. The Congressional Black  Caucus has been at the forefront of changing that gun culture, as  Congresswoman Kelly has preached about, because of what happened in  Chicago. I join her because what happens in our neighborhood is that  our children are cowering over gun violence, period.   No, arming our teachers is not the answer. Securing our school is;  banning those weapons of war is; extending the timeframe is; lifting  the age is; and getting the background checks to close the loopholes  is.   So I am asking this floor and this leadership, as we are doing good  legislation on human trafficking, of which I will participate in  tomorrow, that we put on the floor legislation of gun safety.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his  leadership tonight.
