 Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell Congressman Chris Smith  how proud I am, that he is one of my heroes for doing what he is doing.  The gentleman has never wavered on this.   Mr. Speaker, as we approach the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, it is a  solemn reminder of the tragedy that continues to befall some of our  Nation's unborn children. We should repeat this again on Mother's Day.   For 47 years the Nation has allowed the sanctity of life to be  questioned and infringed upon. All of us in this Chamber are here  because we were granted the blessing of life. We were allowed to live  our lives and decide what path we wished to embark upon. Unfortunately,  not all Americans are allowed this choice. Some children are stopped  before they can even defend themselves.   I, along with many of my colleagues, cannot and will not accept that  reality. A reality where we as a nation provide more protection for an  unhatched bald eagle or a turtle embryo, i.e, an egg,  [[Page H287]]  than we do the children of our own species.   It is my hope that on this anniversary we can pray for the souls of  those children lost and work towards a future where all children are  allowed to decide their own future in this blessed Nation of ours. Our  Founding Fathers were grounded in the Christian principles this Nation  was founded on.   2 Chronicles 7:14: ``If my people, who are called by my name, will  humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked  ways; then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin, and  will heal their land.''
