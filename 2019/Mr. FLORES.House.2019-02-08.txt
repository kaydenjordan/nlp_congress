 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Robert Packard  of Waco, Texas, who passed away on January 5, 2019.   Robert Packard was born on August 13, 1924, in Regina, New Mexico.  When he was 2 years old, his family moved to Temple, Texas, where he  graduated from high school in 1943.   After graduation, Robert enlisted in the United States Army, where he  served in the Combat Engineers and the Army Specialized Training  Program before being assigned to the Pacific theater and the Signal  Corps during World War II.   After the war, Robert returned to Texas, where he enrolled at the  University of Texas at Austin. He would go on to earn three degrees  from the university: a bachelor of science, a master of arts, and a  Ph.D., all in physics.   After working on national security, defense-related research, and  teaching undergraduate classes at UT, he received an invitation to  become an associate professor of physics at Baylor University in 1952.   While at Baylor, he met and married Joyce Hornaday, his wife of over  60 years. Joyce, who was the assistant dean of women at Baylor at the  time, and Robert were set up on a blind date by their students. They  were married April 15, 1954, on the Baylor campus. Together, Robert and  Joyce lived a life full of love and adventure.   In the 1960s, Robert and Joyce lived in Indonesia while Robert was  teaching with a medical team in Surabaya and leading Sunday school  classes at a local mission.   Robert's impact at Baylor cannot be overstated. In addition to being  the physics department chair, Robert also holds the record for being  the longest teaching professor. Teaching for almost 60 years, he is  estimated to have taught a quarter of Baylor alumni with his famous  ``Packard Physics'' class.   An icon in Baylor University, he was designated as a master teacher  in 1990, the highest honor granted to faculty members. He also received  the W.R. White Meritorious Award, the Legendary Mentor Award, the  Collins Outstanding Professor Award, the Baylor Alumni Retired Faculty  Award, and a Baylor University Alumnus by Choice. In 1990, his longtime  classroom was renovated and renamed in his honor.   Robert's impact went far beyond the classroom. He sponsored many  student organizations, such as Taurus, Circle K, Student Congress, and  Kappa Omega Tau. He served on the Student Life Advisory Board, Baylor's  Athletic Council, and was president of the Baylor University Strecker  Museum. In the 1980s, he sponsored the first ever collegiate chapter of  Habitat for Humanity. In 2003, he served as the grand marshal of the  Baylor Homecoming Parade.   Robert also selflessly gave back to the greater Waco community. He  served two terms on the Economic Opportunities Advancement Corporation,  volunteered at the Historic Waco Foundation's McCulloch House and the  Red Cross, taught Sunday school classes at Columbus Avenue Baptist  Church, and assisted the Waco Rotary Club.   Both he and Joyce were known for their commitment to Baylor's Mayborn  Museum, the Old Main Society, the 1845 Society, the Baylor Bear  Foundation, and the Baylor Tip-Off Club.   Robert received national recognition for his teaching efforts and was  named as an Outstanding Educator of America and an American Man of  Science. His talents and dedication were highly sought after by the  government and by universities all across the globe, but Robert turned  them down, opting to stay in Waco and at Baylor University.   Robert and Joyce loved Baylor students as if they were their own  family, and they were proud to be a part of that legacy.   Madam Speaker, Dr. Robert Packard's life was defined by his service  to his family, to our country, and to the world. He will be forever  remembered as a husband, a veteran, an educator of thousands, a mentor,  a selfless servant, and a great friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Packard family. We also lift up the family and friends of Dr.  Robert Packard in our prayers.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Robert Packard.   Madam Speaker, as I close today, I urge all Americans to continue to  pray for our country, for our veterans, for our military men and women  who protect us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                         Honoring Dr. Henry Dethloff     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Henry Dethloff  of College Station, Texas, who passed away on January 25, 2019.   Henry was born on August 10, 1934, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Carl  and Camelia Dethloff. He was raised in Natchitoches and was deeply  shaped by Louisiana's culture and geography.   As a boy, he grew up on Cane River Lake and became a skilled swimmer  and angler. It is said that Henry was one of the only people to swim  the width of the river completely underwater. In 1952, he graduated  from Natchitoches High School, and he moved to Texas.   In 1956, Henry graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with  a bachelor of arts degree. He was then commissioned as an officer in  the United States Navy, where he served from 1956 to 1958.   After his service, he returned to Louisiana to pursue a master's  degree at Northwestern State University. While there, he was introduced  to Myrtle Anne Elliot, who would become the love of his life and  longtime companion. They married in 1961 and had two sons.   In 1964, Henry received his Ph.D. from the University of Missouri and  continued teaching as a history professor at the University of  Louisiana at Lafayette.    In 1969, he joined the faculty at Texas A&M University in College  Station, and he served as the history department chairman from 1980 to  1985. Henry became a professor emeritus of history at Texas A&M and  became well known for his books covering a number of topics. One of his  most publicized works documented the history of Texas A&M for its  centennial anniversary in 1976.   Madam Speaker, Henry Dethloff's life was defined by his service to  his family, to our country, and to Texas A&M University. He will be  forever remembered as a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a great- grandfather, a veteran, a mentor, a selfless servant, and a friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Dethloff family. We also lift up the family and friends of Dr.  Henry Dethloff in our prayers.
