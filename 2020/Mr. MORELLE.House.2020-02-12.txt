 Mr. Speaker, it can be easy to feel disheartened in  Washington amid the partisan strife and bitter political division. I  want to take a moment to change that narrative and thank my district  for their profound display of community.   My office is leading a Valentines for Veterans drive this week, which  encourages members of our community to make valentines for those who  have bravely served our Nation. The number of heartfelt cards we have  seen thanking our servicemembers for their commitment to this country  has been truly heartening.   I would like to especially give a shout-out to the students in my  district whose classes have dropped off a number of incredibly creative  cards: Ms. Walsh's fourth grade class at Northside School in Fairport;  the Klem North Elementary School in Webster; TLC Adventure in Child  Care daycare; the Joseph C. Wilson Foundation Academy in Rochester; the  Mary Cariola Center; and my granddaughter Harper's class at Paddy Hill  Elementary School in Greece.   I am so proud of our Nation's veterans and of our community for  coming together in such a touching display of support for them.                            ____________________
