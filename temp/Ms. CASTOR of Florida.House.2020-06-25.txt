 Justice. Justice. I have heard my Tampa  neighbors and their calls for justice. Black lives matter, and I  dedicate my vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act today to  the generations of Tampa neighbors who have suffered the unfair burdens  of discrimination, disrespect, and violence due to the color of their  skin.   Too many lives over too many years in America cut short at the hands  of officers who were supposed to protect them, so House Democrats will  act decisively today to ensure that police officers are held  accountable for misconduct and that lives are saved. We will end  harmful policing practices, including racial profiling, no-knock  warrants, and chokeholds.   The time for change is now. In fact, a new paradigm for policing in  America is overdue.   I thank my good friend, Congresswoman Karen Bass of California, for  bringing us closer to justice today.
