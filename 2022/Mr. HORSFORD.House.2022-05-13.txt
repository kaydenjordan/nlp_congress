 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which will ensure we address the impacts health inequities have on  creating and exacerbating poverty within our communities.   As my constituents and far too many Americans know, unequal access to  quality healthcare can be financially crushing.   Whether an individual is too sick to work and cannot receive adequate  care or the care they received was very expensive and inadequate, we  know health inequity is a root cause of poverty in Nevada and across  the country.   We cannot combat poverty without recognizing the role that health  inequities play to perpetuate the cycle of poverty.   Through my work coleading the Ways and Means Committee's Racial  Equity Initiative, I have seen firsthand just how valuable data can be  when we are examining disparities.   In our healthcare system, the data speaks for itself. In my State of  Nevada, African Americans and Latinos are twice as likely as their  White counterparts to develop asthma. This and other chronic illnesses  exacerbate disparities due to their inherently pervasive nature.   To combat this, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the  CSBG Modernization Act in a bipartisan manner.
