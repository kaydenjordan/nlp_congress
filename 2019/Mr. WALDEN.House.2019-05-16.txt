 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the life of an  American hero who I was honored to call my friend, Bob Maxwell of Bend,  Oregon, who passed away last weekend at the age of 98.   Bob Maxwell represented the best of what Oregon and America had to  offer. Bob was the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient in our  country, and his gallantry was well known.   On the night of September 7, 1944, in France, Bob Maxwell threw his  unprotected body on top of a German hand grenade to protect the lives  of his comrades in World War II.   This unhesitating selflessness earned Bob Maxwell America's highest  military honor. It earned him his second Silver Star, a second Purple  Heart, and a Bronze Star.   For those who had the pleasure of knowing Bob, as I did, they know  that his bravery and heroism were only matched by his kindness, his  warmth, his sense of humor, and his humility.   Bob once said of his Medal of Honor: ``I am not wearing the medal for  any personal deeds. I am wearing it because it represents all the  casualties we had in the war. It represents those who were killed  defending their country and the ideals that they believed in.''   Like his fellow soldiers, Bob's service will forever be cherished in  the country that he sacrificed so much to protect.   Bob's legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of everyone he  interacted with, and especially in his community in central Oregon,  where Bob Maxwell was a pillar.   To the entire Maxwell family, Mylene and I send our heartfelt  condolences and prayers during this difficult time of loss.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, The Washington Post said it best. Allow me to quote  this headline from yesterday: ``Democrats Are Putting a Political  Pothole in the Way of Bipartisan Drug Pricing Bills.''   It didn't have to be this way. Americans want us to come together,  work together, solve problems. This is a big one. I hear about it every  time I am home, and I have done more townhalls than anybody in this  House--20 of them so far this year.   Drug pricing is a big issue. We actually agreed. We worked it out. We  passed these bills out of committee, unanimously. And then somewhere  along the path to the House floor, they jammed our bipartisan efforts  to lower drug costs with clearly partisan bills. The chairman didn't  mention those bills came out of committee on a partisan vote.   To bail out ObamaCare, Democrats are once again putting politics and  partisanship over what could have been bipartisan public policy.   Republicans and Democrats have been working together on bipartisan  legislation to bring generic drugs to market faster by incentivizing  more competition and ensuring patients get the earliest possible access  to more affordable prescription drugs.   We agree on that, just as we did in the last Congress when I was  chairman. We led the effort to revamp every part of the FDA and how  they can get drugs to market sooner.   As a result of our work there and in our bipartisan work before that  on 21st Century Cures, we really ramped up the ability of the FDA to  get competition and new drugs into the market. They set a record last  year in getting generics to market as a result of our bipartisan work.  We could have had that, today, on this floor.   The first measure that we do agree upon would ensure branded drug  makers do not withhold samples that are needed to get generic drugs  approved; the second would ban pay-for-delay agreements; and the third  would limit first-approved generic makers' ability to stall another  rival's launch. So we put a stop to what I would say are bad behaviors  in that process.    Together, these bills would help patients actually get access to more  affordable prescription drugs, and those bills are bipartisan. Just how  bipartisan? Two of the bills passed the Energy and Commerce Committee  by voice vote, and the third passed unanimously on a 51-0 vote.   Now, Mr. Chair, this is how the American people expect us to get our  work done, but, sadly, House Democrats once again could not pass up a  chance to play gotcha politics. So what did they do? They packaged  these agreed-to bipartisan drug pricing proposals with a bailout of  ObamaCare that passed out of committee on a purely partisan vote.   Now here is what that bill contains:   First, $200 million a year in taxpayer funding for States to  establish ObamaCare marketplaces. This funding expired 5 years ago,  albeit not before hundreds of millions of Federal taxpayer resources  were wasted, including in my own State that finally had to give up on  that and go with a national plan.   New Jersey has recently expressed an interest in creating a new State  exchange, and they say they can do it without new Federal taxpayer  money; they can do it without us. If a State decides to create an  exchange, then they shall be allowed to do so, but we don't need to  create new Federal grants for things that States say they have the  capacity to do themselves.  [[Page H3855]]    Second, $100 million a year--$100 million a year--to fund the  navigator program. Now, for plan year 2017, navigators received a total  of $62.5 million in grants, and they enrolled 81,426 individuals. That  means it cost $767 per person that they enrolled, and that accounted  for less than 1 percent of the total enrollees.   Now, it is important to understand, by contrast, agents and brokers  assisted 42 percent of those in the enrollment year of 2018. Do you  know what it cost for them to do it? $2.40. Yet, under this law, you  can't use the funds for the navigators to actually pay for those folks,  the brokers and agents, to do this work that they do very efficiently.  $767 per enrollee versus $2.40.   Third, the bill reverses the administration's efforts to allow more  State-regulated insurance plan options for consumers who, frankly, are  getting priced out of the market and are looking for choices that fit  them and their lives.   I want to set the record straight on these plans.   The plans you heard described earlier were actually legal under  ObamaCare and the Obama administration, and they are legal under the  Trump administration. They provide choices to people in between jobs or  people who can't afford these exploding premiums.   You know, the promise that your premium is going to go down 2,500  bucks kind of evaporated as soon as the bill became law, so people are  stuck with ever-increasing premiums, enormous deductibles, and saying:  Could we please allow our States to put together options for us that  still have to go through a State insurance regulator? And they  certainly care about their systems.   CBO projected premiums for these plans could be as much as 60 percent  lower than the cheapest Federal mandated plan, 60 percent, and, even  more, States can regulate these plans. In fact, in the chairman's home  State of New Jersey, they are simply banned. That is New Jersey's  choice. They should have that choice.   In my home State of Oregon, they are limited to 90 days. That is what  we have chosen. This is kind of federalism at its best.   But in their Washington-knows-best mentality, the bills brought  before us today strip away this option for longer term plans, and that  is wrong and it is unfair.   Fourth, the bill spends $100,000,000 a year to market the Federal  plans. They couldn't stop there. Instead of educating patients on all  the plans' options available to them, their legislation actually places  a gag order on the promotion of more affordable choices, specifically  association health plans, known as AHPs, and the short-term limited  duration insurance plans. You can't even tell consumers about that. Oh,  no. We are going to have a gag order from Washington.   So there is simply no reason to combine these bills with our  bipartisan, I would say unanimously approved, bills to deal with drugs.   Energy and Commerce Republicans put forth an alternative bill that  includes all of H.R. 987's bipartisan drug provisions I referenced  earlier but removes the partisan, the strictly gotcha provisions.   Our pragmatic plan replaces these partisan provisions with language  extending funding for community health centers, the National Health  Service Corps, and other public health extenders for a year. Now, these  public health extenders should be a top bipartisan priority for the  Congress, as they must be done before the end of the fiscal year, the  end of September, and they deserve the attention of Congress.   Let me go back to the navigators for a minute. The Wall Street  Journal reported: ``One grantee took in $200,000 to enroll a grand  total of one person.'' They went on to write: ``The top 10 most  expensive navigators collected $2.77 million to sign up 314 people.''   If you take that $2.77 million that they want to give to these  navigators--they are the most expensive operators on the planet--to  sign people up for insurance and gave that to our community health  centers, do you know how many people they could cover with $2.77  million? One estimate is 20,000 patients--20,000 patients.   So Republicans are saying let's take that money and actually get it  out to help patients through our community health centers rather than  spend it on navigators that can take $200,000 and enroll one person, or  $767, on average, versus $2.40 when agents and brokers do this  enrollment.   We think we have a better way. Our bill, H.R. 2700, is called the  Lowering Prescription Drug Costs and Extending Community Health Centers  and Other Public Health Priorities Act. It is pretty straightforward.  It is an honest title.    We should take this bill up now, Mr. Chairman, because the majority,  unfortunately, has decided to put politics before us today with our  bipartisan efforts to lower drug costs.   The bill before us right now is going nowhere in the Senate. They  have said that. The White House has weighed in, so they don't like it  either.   We should take up the alternative to move our bipartisan work forward  and take care of our responsibilities to ensure our community health  centers and other public health priorities are funded. That has always  been a bipartisan effort.   Finally, just to further the point on the blatant and unnecessary  partisanship on display here today, House Democrats made 26 amendments  in order on this bill--26. One of those amendments, just one, was  authored by a Republican.   Now, they control everything around here, and they said in the  opening days they are going to open up this process. Ninety-two percent  of the amendments allowed to be brought to the floor so far this year  have been from Democrats. When we were in charge, 45 percent--45  percent--were the minority's amendments that came to the floor.   So, so much for openness. Just one was authored by a Republican. So  it is unfortunate we find ourselves here today. It didn't have to be  this way.                                time  1245    These are measures, especially on the drug side, we are already all  in agreement on. If they were separated out, you would have passage. It  would go right to the President from the Senate. I think they would  take them up and pass them to become law. So, when the majority is  ready to make law, let us know.   In the meantime, we have a better way to take care of our community  health centers, our patients, and those seeking more choices and more  affordable rates for an insurance product than what the Federal  Government is mandating.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), a very accomplished member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), our top Republican on the Health Subcommittee, a  former chairman of the subcommittee, and a distinguished member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, before I recognize our pharmacist, Mr. Carter from  Georgia, I just want to say I have been on the floor a lot in the last  few weeks on this issue, and we keep getting the same refrain about  Republicans voting 60 times to repeal ObamaCare.   What is never said is that 30 of those bills, my friends on the other  side of the aisle voted for, and President Obama signed them into law-- I'm sorry. Twenty-one of those bills were signed into law by President  Obama. So it is 21 of the 30 were signed into law by President Obama.   So my point being is, ObamaCare had problems. We came together and  tried to address those problems with this legislation, repealing the  unsustainable CLASS Act, the co-ops, the Cadillac and medical device  taxes we voted to delay, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and on  and on. My friends on the other side of the aisle voted with us and we  with them to fix those sorts of things. So don't come down here and  tell me it is only Republicans who voted to do things on ObamaCare.   We also support these drug bills. There is no question about that,  because we want to get lower-cost drugs and stop bad behaviors that  prevent generics from coming to market sooner.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), a pharmacist.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to make a couple of points before I introduce the author of  the CREATES Act. The gentleman that just spoke, Mr. Hoyer, voted 21  times, on 21 of the bills that were signed into law to repeal parts of  ObamaCare. The gentleman voted for it because those parts were  unworkable. So when you hear about 60 times, remember the leader, the  distinguished leader, my friend, actually voted for 21 of those, as did  I.   When we talk about the people, let me read you a little statement  from Tom from Medford who wrote me in October of last year. He said,  ``Greg, I just received a letter from the insurance company stating  their monthly premium next year will go up nearly 40 percent, from $632  to $883 per month, and that is with the plan more or less staying the  same, but without any out-of-network healthcare.''                                time  1315    That is not affordable. That is why we think States should have  options.   When it comes to the navigators that they want to dump all this money  into, remember agents and brokers in the private sector cost about  $2.40 for them to sign somebody up. The navigators would cost, based on  2017 numbers, $767 per enrollee. And for the $2.7 million that was  spent to sign up 314 people, if you put that money--as Republicans want  to do--into community health centers, one estimate is you could cover  20,000 people with that $2.77 million.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Sensenbrenner). My friend is the former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee and the former chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, and a leader on this CREATES effort legislation on bringing  drug prices down.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to reinforce what the gentleman from Wisconsin said.   This is from The Washington Post: ``The Health 202: Democrats Are  Putting a Political Pothole in the Way of Bipartisan Drug Pricing  Bills.''   That is all you need to know. It didn't have to be this way. These  bills came out of the committee individually. The Democratic leadership  put them together knowing full well they could put a poison pill into a  drug reform bill and delay consumers' ability to get more affordable  drugs sooner, because this legislation could move through the Senate  and down to the President much more quickly if it didn't have these  provisions.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to thank the gentleman from Vermont for not only his comments here on  the floor, but his comments publicly about what we agree with, which is  these issues should have remained separate and not lumped together.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will say that the State of Florida  actually allows State-regulated plans to go up to 364 days to give  Floridians an opportunity to have choice. When it comes to association  health plans that allow small businesses like I used to own to get  together and offer more affordable health insurance, they put a gag  order on so that you can't tell America's patients they might have that  option.   So, Mr. Chairman, I don't know that I would fully trust all these  navigators. According to The Wall Street Journal, one grantee took in  $200,000 of your tax dollars and enrolled one person. The  [[Page H3860]]  top 10 most expensive navigators collected $2.77 million to sign up 314  people. If you put that $2.77 million into our community health  centers, as the Republicans would prefer, to spend that money, then you  would cover 20,000 patients, according to one estimate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my friend from Oregon is right on the drug  pieces, and like other Democrats I know, there are a lot of people who  think that we should keep these bills separately and they would zoom on  through here, but not package them up the way they are.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  State (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Chairman, at this point I would reserve the balance  of my time to close.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on each side, please.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire again about the amount of  time on each side.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time, as I  have no other speakers.   I would just like to point out, make clear for the Record and for all  our colleagues, Republicans supported and worked closely with our  Democratic colleagues on the drug reform bills here to get lower cost  prescriptions and more generics into the market sooner. There is no  light between our shoulders on those issues.   If those bills were brought here independently as they came out of  committee independently, they would be headed to the Senate and likely  to the President, and we would be moving forward. But, instead,  Democrats merged in bills they know Republicans oppose.   When it comes to navigators, the actual number is $767 per individual  the navigators signed up; agents and brokers cost $240 per enrollee.  Mr. Chairman, we would rather take that money and put it into community  health centers. That would take care of 20,000 patients, just at $2.7  million.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   So let's talk about the navigator program. They enroll less than 1  percent today, less than 1 percent.   Wall Street Journal reported an investigation that one grantee took  in $200,000 to enroll a grand total of 1 person; and they found the top  10 most expensive navigators collected 2.77 million taxpayer dollars,  2.77, Mr. Chairman.   Do you know how many people they signed up? 314.   They want to add $25 million more on top of the $62,500,000 in  grants. We are talking about less than 1 percent.    Meanwhile, while they are talking about oh, we have got to educate  people about all their options, then they put a gag rule in here that  says, can't talk to you about short-term duration plans. Oh, no, we  can't educate about that choice. No, you can't know about that. No, we  are going to stop that. Oh, and you can't know about association health  plan options either. It might be better for you and your family and  actually be more affordable. No, no, no, because that is not our  Federal decision here. They decide, and they don't want you to even  know. So navigators can't talk about those things. That is gagged in  this law.   The amazing thing we never hear about is the good work of the Trump  administration and the economy as it has taken off. And I say that in  the context that we have seen the lowest unemployment rates for  virtually every American and group of Americans; whether it is African  Americans, Hispanic Americans, you name it, we are seeing, the lowest  rates, in some cases, since they began keeping track of unemployment.   So the economy is doing really well. Over 3 percent GDP growth the  first quarter.   So what has that meant for insurance?   We have heard the constant, unrelenting attacks; you might as well  use impeachment here at some point probably today.   Look, the number of Americans in employer health coverage has  increased by more than 2.5 million since President Trump took office.  Two-and-one-half million more Americans aren't having to get their  healthcare through the government and taxpayers. They are getting it  through a job and their employer.   In fact, today, there is a greater percentage of Americans in  employer health coverage since Trump took office than any time since  2000, any time since 2000.   See, there is another way to provide healthcare and that is through a  job.   Now, I know those who support a full Federal takeover of everybody's  health insurance don't like to hear that because, see, they don't think  that employers should offer health insurance. They think only the  government knows best. And so their Medicare for All plan, which would  cause great delays in access to care, drive up costs, you would pay  more; but it would take away your health insurance. If you get it from  your employer, or if you get it from your union, or if you are a senior  on Medicare and you have a Medicare advantage policy, that goes away  too. Veterans with TRICARE? Democrats' Medicare for All program, that  is gone, too.                                time  1545    It is kind of ironic to talk about how wonderful the Affordable Care  Act is working for Americans, who, by the way, tell me: ``Look, I am  getting stuck with the highest deductibles and premiums I have ever  seen. I can't afford it.''   We had an example from Grand Island, Nebraska, last week. A 60-year- old couple makes $70,000 a year. They were paying $38,000 in premiums  and $11,000 in deductibles.   That is affordable insurance? I don't think so.   That is why we think States should have the ability to experiment and  regulate plans at the State level, as they did under ObamaCare.   All that talk about junk plans and all that, by the way, those were  approved under ObamaCare. Those were allowed under ObamaCare. Trump  just allowed them to be there longer. But because he changed something,  there is this automatic partisan response.   I think we all ought to come together here. I have fought my entire  legislative career in Oregon and here to make healthcare more  affordable.   The underlying drug bills, there is no light between us, none,  between Republicans and Democrats. Those bills came out of committee  unanimously.   The only reason we are having this fight on the floor today is  because somewhere along the way, the political operatives, Mr.  Chairman, decided to bolt these two unrelated sets of bills together.  They knew it would be kind of a poison pill and kind of fun to watch  Republicans squirm on the floor. That is why we are here.   The ObamaCare bills we are voting on today just dump more money into  programs that investigations have shown are filled with fraud and  abuse. How can you justify putting another $25 million into a program  where the top 10 most expensive navigators collected $2.77 million and  signed up a grand total of 314 people? Who in their right mind in  private business, Mr. Chairman, would make that kind of investment?   The Las Vegas Review-Journal said, after reading that, ``The  navigator scheme is a make-work government jobs program rife with  corruption and highly susceptible to scam artists.''   Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), America's only pharmacist in the  U.S. House of Representatives and a distinguished gentleman from the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of my friend from Georgia, a  distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   We really have come to rely upon Mr. Carter for his guidance,  especially on areas related to pharmacies and trying to get the costs  of prescription drugs down for consumers. We are all about that.    We worked together in the last Congress to empower the FDA to get  more generics to market sooner so we have more competition. That was a  bipartisan bill.   That is the way we operated in the last Congress, Mr. Chairman, as  Republicans and Democrats. I led the committee, and we revamped  everything at the FDA in generics, on medical device approvals, and on  pharmaceuticals so we could benefit the patient first.   We brought those bills to the floor unanimously. We didn't mess  around with them and package them up with poison pills. We said: Let's  go legislate, and let's get this done. And they did. They got done.  They got into law, signed by President Trump.   And guess what? Last year, the FDA approved more generics in one year  than at any time in its history. So we did do things, led by  Republicans in the House, the Republican leader of the Senate, and  President Trump, joining with Democrats, just as we have attempted to  do on the drug bills before us today.   We are in full agreement. Stop the bad behaviors, get competition  into the market, and bring down costs of drugs. But we also believe we  should make sure Americans have choices that are  [[Page H3883]]  more affordable when it comes to their insurance.   Democrats voted for ObamaCare. They blocked every amendment we had as  Republicans at the time that was legislated. Remember, the former  Speaker, now Speaker again, said you have to pass it so you can find  out what is in it. It is kind of an odd way to legislate, but, anyway,  here we are.   By the way, the short-term plans they call junk plans on that side,  Mr. Chairman, those short-term plans are the same ones we are debating  today, except all President Trump did is say you can have them a little  longer, because guess what? For some people, it is the only affordable  health insurance they have access to in their States.   They are regulated by the States. They are not unregulated. States  can do all kinds of things. We should empower them to do things to make  insurance more affordable.   Unlike my friends on the other side, Mr. Chairman, they want to gag  the navigators so they can't even tell them about alternatives that may  actually benefit them and be more affordable.   The plans that the other side of the aisle is railing against today,  Mr. Chairman, are plans that are very much like the ones that were  approved under President Obama and ObamaCare. It is just that President  Trump said you can have them for longer if they work for you. But the  States can come in and say, no, no.   My State says just 3 months. That is it. Boom. Other States say 30  days. Some States say none at all.   Mr. Chairman, I am not going to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  for her amendment. We are not going to object to the amendment. The  exchanges already do a lot of this reporting, and more information is  better than less.   Now, I want to talk about these short-term, State-regulated, limited  duration insurance policies because I think I have got a chart here,  and we  [[Page H3884]]  will put it in the Record that there are 27 of our States, Mr.  Chairman--27--that have decided that short-term plans are good for  their people to be able to take advantage of. There are States from  Alaska to Wyoming, from Kansas to Iowa, to Idaho and Pennsylvania where  you can go up to 364 days.   Now, there are 12 other States that have said, you know: We want to  limit these to 6 months. That includes places like Colorado and Arizona  and Nevada and Oklahoma, North Dakota.   Then there are eight States, Mr. Chairman, that said: No, we want 3  months. We think that is all we need in places like Oregon, Hawaii, or  New Mexico.   Then there are four States--California, Massachusetts, New Jersey,  and New York--that said: No, we are just not going to allow any of  these options in our State.   Guess what. That is federalism. They get that right.   Now, I know my friends on the other side of the aisle would like to  take away that ability for these short-term duration, State-regulated  plans and remove options from consumers, and I don't think that is the  way to go. It is an honest disagreement here that we have, Mr.  Chairman, between the parties.   I have seen a lot of innovation come out of my home State of Oregon.  I was meeting with one of our former Governors, John Kitzhaber, this  morning, talking about the effect of the coordinated care  organizations, and they have been able to actually bend the cost curve  and improve access to delivery of care by having the flexibility, in  some cases through waivers, to bring providers together, match them up  with patients, and deliver care more efficiently and more effectively  and with better outcomes. That should be what we are debating today:  How do we get to better outcomes?   We should also be debating how we get healthcare costs down, Mr.  Chairman. We are doing a bit of that with the drug bills.   It is unfortunate. It didn't have to be this way that they got made  into partisan issues, because there is no partisan divide on those  bills. It is the fact that, you know, bailing out some of these  programs in ObamaCare that are so expensive.   When it costs $2.40 per enrollee for agents and brokers to assist in  enrollment and $767 if you spent $62.5 million in grants and they  enrolled 81,000 individuals, it averages out, just a rough average, to  over $700, why would we pour more money into the navigators that cost  700 bucks and then say: Oh, by the way, these agents and brokers can't  do anything to keep them out of this?   The Trump administration actually expanded the authority for the  agents and brokers to be involved, leveraging that private-sector help,  and do you know what? They support 3,660,000 health plan enrollments.  That is 42 percent of the plan enrollments in 2018 on the Federal  platform exchanges--42 percent. Mr. Chairman, navigators do 1 percent.  And my friends on the other side of the aisle want to keep dumping more  and more money into the navigator program that, as I pointed out  earlier, we found all kinds of wasteful spending in.   So there is really an issue about spending. We know the results. We  know there is a much better way to do this.   So, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to oppose this particular amendment.  It is fine, and more information is better than less.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is interesting; the prior amendment that  passed added $25 million more to this navigator program. For the plan  year 2017, navigators received a total of $62.5 million in grants and  yet only enrolled 81,426 individuals. That is less than 1 percent of  the total enrollees.   You see, the issue here isn't whether we should or shouldn't enroll  more people. The issue is who is most efficient with the taxpayer or  private-sector dollar to do that.   We keep pouring more and more money into this navigator program and  we know there is all this, well, I guess I am going to call it waste. I  don't know if it is fraud.   But holy smokes, as I have said before, one grantee, according to The  Wall Street Journal, took in $200,000 and enrolled one person--one  person. You want to have a Government Accountability Office report and  investigation, let's look at the underlying program and how in the heck  that could happen.   And then they also found the top 10 expensive navigators collected  $2.77 million and signed up 314.   These aren't my numbers. These are The Wall Street Journal  investigative reporters. You know, in the press, these are facts, which  caused the Las Vegas Review-Journal to editorialize that: ``The  navigator scheme is a make-work government jobs program rife with  corruption and highly susceptible to scam artists. It's a slush fund  for progressive constituent groups.''   Not my words, that is the press. I have a journalism degree. I have a  great respect for the press and what they write. I don't always agree  with them.    But, look, when you take these independent reviews and you look at  what is happening there, CMS reported that 17 of those navigators  enrolled fewer than 100 people at an average cost of $5,000 per  enrollee--$5,000. $5,000. And my friends on the other side of the aisle  want to shovel more money into that program. I think that is the height  of fiscal irresponsibility.   See, for $2.7 million, if we put that into community health centers,  Mr. Chairman, do you know how many people we could cover? We could take  care of 20,000 patients, according to one estimate--20,000.   Health centers are really, really important to me and my  constituents. We have 63 different places in my district, which is  bigger than eight States east of the Mississippi, Mr. Chairman, where  people get their healthcare in our communities. We have to reauthorize  this year, by the end of September, our community health centers.   Now, when I was chairman, we did that at a record level because they  deliver record good healthcare. We have had no plan yet to figure out  how to pay for that, but you are going dump $25 million more into this  navigator program. Why don't we put it into actual healthcare?   We reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program under  Republicans and fully funded it for a decade. The longest that had ever  been done was 5 years, and, unfortunately, most of my friends on the  other side of the aisle voted repeatedly against doing that for a whole  host of reasons, but they voted ``no.'' In Oregon, we have 122,700  children and expectant moms that rely on CHIP, SCHIP, partnership with  the State for their health insurance.   So there are a lot of things we can invest in with the proceeds from  the savings from the drug bills, but investing in the navigator  program? $5,000 per enrollee?   There are 100 navigators, that is all they did? One for 200,000,  enrolled one person? I mean, come on. There has got to be a better way  to not spend the taxpayers' money than that.   And so I think you look at the incredible growth in men and women  working in America, getting better paying jobs, bigger paychecks and  healthcare, 2.5 million since President Trump took office, and  Republicans put progrowth policies into the Tax Code, progrowth  regulatory policies into the bureaucracy.   Jobs are coming up. The biggest issue I run into with employers now  is not overregulation; it is: Where do I find more people to work?   So we need to look at job training. We need to work at available  workforce. But this, this amendment, I think, is, frankly, from my  perspective--with all due respect, GAO doesn't need to waste their time  on this nor the taxpayer's money, and especially after $25 million more  was just signed up in addition to--what?--$63 million, roughly, an  enormous amount of money into a program that I think has a lot of  problems. And the editorial writers at the Review-Journal said,  ``highly susceptible to scam artists,'' ``slush fund for progressive  constituent groups.'' So I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the amendment,  but I am not necessarily opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment.   I find it a bit interesting, though, that under the navigator  program, on the one hand, my friends on the other side of the aisle  say, Look, you can't talk about--in fact, you can't tell anybody about  association health plans and those as options.   You can't educate the public, the consumers about an opportunity to  save money by having a state-regulated plan. No, not under the  navigator. You can't do that.   And yet, with this amendment, they want to expand that knowledge, so  they can get training on the other government plans, Medicaid and CHIP  enrollment. And that is not necessarily a bad thing. I am not saying  that is a bad thing.   But what I am saying is, why wouldn't we want full education? Why  would we want, basically, a gag order here that prevents the navigators  from telling the consumers, Here are some other options you may want to  look at. Now, they have limitations; they are regulated by your State;  you need to be fully informed--in fact, really informed, because some  of them don't cover everything--as we have heard--because that was how  it was designed under President Obama's plan, that there would be these  options and they wouldn't be the fully covering plans, but they were  okay because they would fill a gap.   And those are the same plans we have heard a lot about today that  States regulate. And I would go back to the fact that in some States it  is 3 months.   Well, in 27 States they go up to almost 1 year, including States such  as Rhode Island and Tennessee, even Texas, Virginia, Georgia and Idaho.   In 12 States, they go up to 6 months. In eight States, including  mine, we said--in Oregon--just 3 months, that is all we are going to do  in short-term duration plans.   California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, said no. Zero. We  are not going to allow them.   That is okay. That is federalism.   But why, in the navigator program, would we say, You can't talk about  things.   I got a degree in journalism a long time ago at the University of  Oregon, and I believe in the facts. And I believe marketplaces and  consumers are better served when they have complete information to make  choices.   And I know that these insurance products are on the market. Some are  fine, people like them.  [[Page H3887]]    And I get these letters--I got one from Tom in Medford--that talked  about how his premium, I think, went from 400-and-some dollars to $800  in 1 year. And he is not sure what he is going to do. That was in  October when the new numbers came out.   And meanwhile, when we put all this reliance on these navigators. We  know from the Wall Street Journal, one grantee took $200,000, enrolled  one person.   I guess, if you are the grantee, that is a pretty good deal. All you  have to do is find one person to enroll, and you get 200 grand. To me,  that sounds like a big waste of taxpayer dollars.    The ten most expensive navigators collected $2.77 million, signed up  314 people.   Now, we heard about how the government needs to borrow and spend more  than taxpayer dollars--or at least spend more taxpayer dollars--and do  more education because the enrollment in the government plans has gone  down by, I think, the figure is about $1 million or so. I guess, that  is what is bandied about.   What isn't mentioned, however, Mr. Chairman, is that under President  Trump and the policies Republicans put into law, the economy took off.  The economy took off. Thank goodness the economy took off.   And 2.5 million Americans now get their insurance, more get their  insurance through an employer.   So, see, they got a job, they got a paycheck, they got insurance  through their employer.   And my guess is that accounts for some of that downturn. They don't  have to come to the government to get their insurance. They are getting  it through their employer.   So you might have had like $1 million roll off on the exchanges, but  you have got a 2.5 million pickup in the private insurance side. And I  think that is pretty cool. I mean, that is important.   And I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle with their  national takeover of health insurance want to abolish ObamaCare and  replace it with a single-payer system, which sounds sort of simple on  its face, but we know that means you would have to double the personal  income tax, double the corporate tax, and our doctors and hospitals,  they would have to take like a 40-percent reduction.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my friend, the doctor, the former chairman of  the Health Subcommittee, to make some comments.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this section provides $200 million for  States to establish State-based marketplaces. The Federal law provided  States with the option of building their own State-based marketplace or  utilizing the Federal marketplace.   I know my own State blew through close to $300 million trying to  create its own exchange. It was a terrible financial disaster, a total  waste of money. They couldn't get it going. They finally closed the  thing up, but not before they blew through hundreds of millions of  dollars, and then they went to the Federal exchange.   Every State except Alaska applied for these grants. Florida and  Georgia were awarded planning grants but later returned their entire  grants. Other States returned some of the grant money they received but  also kept some.   This would have been under the Obama administration when they were  enacting ObamaCare. No funding was awarded after December 31, 2014, in  accordance with the law.   From the 2018 plan year, 34 States had federally facilitated  marketplaces; 12 States had State-based marketplaces; and 5 States had  State-based marketplaces using the Federal platform.   The Committee on Energy and Commerce issued a majority staff report  entitled: Implementing ObamaCare Review of CMS' Management of the  State-Based Exchanges, September 13, 2016.   I think it is important to share with my colleagues, among the  report's key findings in 2016 were: CMS was not confident that the  remaining State-based exchanges would be sustainable in the  [[Page H3888]]  long term, and as of September 2016, every State-based exchange still  relies upon Federal establishment grant funds 20 months after the  State-based exchanges were supposed to be self-sustaining by law.   CMS eased the transition for these failed State-based exchanges so  that they could join healthcare.gov by allowing them to keep the user  fees collected by insurance carriers intended to pay for the use of  healthcare.gov.   Now, here we are, 5 years after the funding has expired considering a  bill to reopen grants for States to establish State-based marketplaces.  We have seen kind of a spotty record here. Maybe it is just a  coincidence that $200 million is being made available now, because my  friends on the other side set the agenda and they want to continue  pushing out this idea.   On Friday, Politico reported that New Jersey is proposing to create a  State-based health exchange. Now, I think they have told us they  actually don't need Federal money for that.   But anyway, I don't think we are dealing with earmarks here; but  earmarking money to help States create their own marketplaces is not  what we should be about, and I am not sure we are. I don't think this  is a Garden State giveaway, but it is kind of interesting.   That is all I have got to say on this, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment is pretty straightforward in asking the GAO to do this  evaluation, and I think it is important to have cost-benefit analyses  of State-administered health insurance plans for States that may want  to offer a public option.   Again, here we have a situation where States are experimenting, and  our States are great laboratories for reform. The gentleman comes from  a State where Republican Governors helped lead that effort, Governor  Romney and others, and now Senator Romney from a different State.   But my State did a lot of reform work as well, and we are all trying  to figure out: How do we get healthcare to people in a timely way that  is affordable? And we share that goal.   Unfortunately, some of the promise of ObamaCare turned out not to be  the case. People's insurance premiums did not go down $2,500. I still  hear in my town meetings and in correspondence with my constituents  that some were well-served, but I have a lot of them who were left  behind, and they are out in the cold.   At one of my townhalls, I had a middle age couple come up and say: We  have decided we can't afford health insurance, so we have decided to go  without.   They looked at the premiums. They looked at the deductibles that are  in these markets, and said: We can't pencil it out.   None of us want that to be the case. That is why I think some of  these options are really important to look at. And States can do that.   And that is what President Trump tried to do is take what President  Obama had agreed to with the short-term plans regulated by States to  fill gaps to make health insurance options more available and health  insurance more affordable. He just said: Well, if it is good for 3  months, what is wrong with 364 days.   So as a result, you have got 27 States that go up to nearly a year;  12 are 6 months; 8 at 3 months; and 4 say, no, not in our State at all.  So I think the report is probably going to give us some valuable  information.   Mr. Chairman, I guess I have actually convinced myself I am going to  support this amendment despite my initial reservations, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it should come as no surprise that I seek  time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing his  amendment as well. He is a distinguished Member of our U.S. House of  Representatives and an engineer, and we appreciate his intellectual  horsepower on this issue.   I was thinking, as he was talking about having the GAO have to do an  audit to figure out the best time for routine maintenance to provide  the least disruption to consumers, this is what happens when you have a  government-run system. You have to have your independent auditors  figure out how the system can keep current and not disrupt consumers.   I was thinking that we don't have too many amendments that say let's  have GAO audit Amazon's website to find out the best times to deal with  consumers or your local whatever you go to for your hotels or your  rental cars. Nobody is saying, hey, you have to have GAO, a government  entity, figure out the best time or worst time to disrupt consumers on  the Avis website or Enterprise or whatever. But we have to here, which  is a government-run system with basically one website.   We all know and we all lived through what happened with the initial  rollout with this website, so, Mr. Chairman, to my friend from  Illinois' point, it is important that we give the consumers the best  possible experience when they are trying to sign up because we have all  had to deal with it.   In its initial days, man, it was a mess. I remember all those  problems. We did hearings and oversight hearings in the Energy and  Commerce Committee on it.   Mr. Chairman, this is probably a good idea to do, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the right to object.    Mr. Chairman, I know there were a lot of amendments that  came through the system. I am trying to figure out what the issue is  here, but I know we offered 16 amendments and got one. The Democrats  got 25 amendments and had one technical amendment through the Rules  Committee.   Could the Parliamentarian or somebody explain what the problem is  here and why we have to correct it here on the floor?   That is my question.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chair, I withdraw my reservation.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's commitment,  especially on mental health and substance abuse. He has done a lot of  work in this area.   I know, Mr. Chairman, when we in the last Congress worked together in  a bipartisan way, we passed 60 different bills related to the deadly  scourge of opioid addiction and overdose. The prior Congress to that I  believe is when we rewrote America's mental health laws for the first  time in decades.    We all have friends, family, and people in our communities who need  help, especially with mental health and, as we know, substance use  disorder. We did a lot of good work, I would say. We have to make sure,  to the gentleman's point, that the efforts we have put forward, the  programs we have initiated, and the funding we put behind these  programs actually get to the people who need the help.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess), who was chairman of our subcommittee when we  were in the majority and now is the top Republican of the Health  Subcommittee, to talk a little bit about these issues.    Mr. Chairman, I would just conclude that I appreciate the  gentleman's comments.   As I look at a bunch of amendments coming up, to my colleague from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), there are a whole bunch of these that they are  saying, oh, we have to order the navigators do this, do this, and do  that.   You wonder what their current training is that we have to pass laws  telling them to learn about these things and then go talk to people.   This is part of my argument that we are pumping a lot of money into a  program that we know there has been--I don't know if I can say fraud,  but if you got $200,000 to enroll one person or $2.7 million to enroll  314, some of the Nation's leading editorial writers have had some  pretty strong words to say about corruption and scam artists and that  sort of thing.   We are having to pass laws that tell them, oh, by the way, talk about  mental health, talk about substance abuse, talk about referrals to  community-based organizations, the navigator system, vulnerable  populations, all these things. Holy smokes, what don't they know and  what is left out?   We should have a hearing on this issue in the committee as well as  the Medicare for All proposal.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just say a couple of things. One, I  represent a very rural district in Oregon. It is two-thirds of the  landmass of the State. We suffer a lot of these same issues: low  income, high levels of poverty, and the need for basic services.   Mr. Chairman, that is why I worry a lot about making sure our  community health centers get funded. I think you know this. They run  out of funding in just a matter of months. The National Health Service  Corps, same thing. By the end of September, I think they run out of  money. I have a number of Indian reservations. Native Americans. Their  Special Diabetes Program runs out of money. The teaching health centers  run out of money.   Yes, today we are pouring money into a program that some of our  Nation's leading editorial writers have called susceptible to scam  artists and corruption and that spends $2.7 million to sign up 314  people. That doesn't seem like a very good expenditure to me. I would  rather put that money into our community health centers and into some  of these other proven programs that work.   I think it is fine to do outreach, certainly, and to expand  education. I do wish it were more fulsome. I wish there weren't a gag  restriction on our navigators so that they can't talk about other  insurance alternatives that our States have pioneered and regulate,  that even the Obama administration approved these short-term plans; yet  derided today, these were approved, in many cases, under the last  administration.    This one said: If they work good for 3 months, let's see if States  want them for 6 or 9 or pretty close to 12.   That is what the President did.   President Trump, too, if you think about the economy--all we ever  hear on the other side is kind of all the negative. It is sort of  Debbie Downer day here.   Actually, the economy is doing really well, and, as a result, people  are getting jobs. When they are getting jobs, they are getting bigger  paychecks. They are also getting insurance. And 2.5 million people now  have insurance who didn't have it before, through their employer,  during the Trump administration.   I realize they are not going to go bragging on the Trump  administration, my friends to the left, but I do think it is important  to get the facts out there because facts matter, and I believe in  facts.   Mr. Chair, 2.5 million more people now have insurance who didn't have  it before, and they have it through their employer. That is the  direction we should go: jobs, income, insurance through your employer.   Then what we really should focus on--and I think there is bipartisan  support for this--is how do we get at the costs for healthcare.   By the way, who knows what anything costs, right? We are paying more  and more out of pocket through our deductibles and our copays, yet what  does an MRI cost here versus there versus there?   I was at the White House with the President on Thursday, Mr. Chair,  and he is going after surprise billing. My friend from New Jersey and I  are joined on this effort to pass bipartisan legislation so that the  consumer doesn't get stuck with a bill because somebody showed up to  care for him at a hospital that, it turns out, wasn't in their plan.  They played by the rules, the consumer did.   We had one example there of a doctor whose daughter got care and then  was asked to do a urine test because of some medication. They wanted to  do just a quick test. The doctor said: Hey, will you do it? She did it  on the way out.   It turned out the lab, I think it was, was not in the network of her  insurance plan. She didn't know that. She just followed the doctor's  orders. Do you know what that bill was? Over $17,000.   He brought a copy of the bill. I don't have it here, but he brought  it to the White House.   And President Trump is full-throat ready to solve this. Just as he  and his administration--I don't think we have ever had a President, not  in my lifetime, that has leaned in more to get prescription drug prices  down for consumers.   That is what is going on there in the real world. And the President  and Secretary Azar and the team at CMS, they are leading on this now.   There are things you might like or dislike in terms of their  proposals, but we have never had a President and an administration do  more to try and drive out the unnecessary costs that consumers are  being forced to pay.   That is where they are making the decision of whether they can afford  to actually take the drugs from the pharmacist and go home or leave  them on the counter.   So we have got a lot of issues, and some of them we are going to work  out. I just so regret that we are here today with these for funding the  navigator program with another $25 million on top of the 68 so they can  spend $2.7 million and sign up 314 people. We can do that much more  efficiently. We have proven that.   CMS says that others can do it for much less money, much less money.  Not $767 per enrollee, but $2.40. Who wouldn't take that deal, $2.40  per enrollee or $767?   So I just think there is a better way to operate. This amendment is  fine in the end, I guess, and so I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I seek the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I will try and make this fairly quick.   I actually am going to oppose this amendment for this reason. Here we  are going through trying to say to the health navigators, in amendment  after amendment: Your job is to enroll people in health insurance. That  is your job. And, by the way, we are going to have to pass a law that  tells you to be sure and include a discussion about mental health, be  sure and include and get educated on substance use disorder benefits.   One after another, we are going through and putting in the statute  all the things that ought to be, A, common sense and, B, ought to be  part of an overall educational program for the navigators.   And now recognizing, well, first of all, they are very expensive;  second, there has been at least some level of questionable activity in  the use of the taxpayer dollars; and, third, they don't know what they  are doing, so we have got to instruct them via statute; now we are  going to say: By the way, go do all these other things, too, that have  nothing to do directly with enrolling people in the Affordable Care  Act.   So you are going to say, on the one hand: We don't think you are  getting it right; we have got to give you more money. Now we are going  to give you new duties that are kind of loosely described, if you ask  me, to provide referrals to community-based organizations and address  social needs related to health outcomes.   That is all going to be in law now? Really?   I think this whole program, the more I sit and listen to all the  amendments that need to be put into law to change it--this was an  ObamaCare creation, so I guess we are--I don't know. I wouldn't say you  are sabotaging ObamaCare with this, but, certainly, you are changing  ObamaCare and the navigators.   We are looking at the costs, and, gosh, there is a lot we could do.                                time  1715    I think the gentleman has 40 health centers in his district. And I  assume he knows that I have got about 63 locations; and I assume the  gentleman knows the money for those health centers runs out at the end  of the fiscal year, and we have got to find a way to pay for that. I  would rather put the money into that than into this program.   So, Mr. Chairman, I am going to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object.    Mr. Chairman, I guess this is the second time we have had  to edit amendments on the House floor, if I understand what is  happening.   There were a lot of amendments offered in the Rules Committee. We  were promised by the Democrats at the beginning of this legislative  session that this would be an open House where our amendments would be  considered. I know 92 percent of the amendments the Democrats have  allowed to come to the floor have been Democrat amendments. Imagine  that.   We had 16 Republican amendments on this bill alone. We got one  amendment. Democrats got 25, and two of them we have had to edit here  on the floor. And then we had one that was a bipartisan, just technical  change amendment.   I sure hope we are not going to see that for the rest of this  Congress under Democratic control, that we are shut out of the  amendment process.   When Republicans were in charge and had the Rules Committee, 45  percent, something like that, of the amendments were minority  amendments, Democrat amendments. We opened the floor to that, and now  it has been shut down.   Mr. Chairman, I won't object to this change. It needs to be done.   Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my objection.  [[Page H3894]]     Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I know it has been a long day here on the  floor, and we are covering a lot of ground. We have got a few more  amendments to go.   Again, I think as we go through these amendments, and the gentlewoman  is spot on, we have got to make sure people are trying to help people  get access to insurance; can speak the language, can assist in each one  of our districts.   But it is kind of an indictment to the existing program, if you think  about it, that you have got to come here and legislate this. To me,  whether it is about mental health, or substance abuse, or this, or the  one before, this should be commonsense management of a program, and it  tells me we have got a problem with the underlying navigator program.   We know that it is very, very expensive. We know that they enroll  less than 1 percent, less than 1 percent. Everything we are arguing  about this afternoon with all the amendments on the navigator program,  both, are shining the light on the shortcomings of the program itself,  which I think the administration has pointed to and said, This thing  isn't working very well, and it is at the least very expensive; $767  per enrollee, it appears. In the private sector they do it for much,  much, much, much less.   So it is not that this amendment is bad or misguided. I don't think  it is. But I think, once again, it is like a bright light on the  underlying program that must be fraught with all kinds of problems,  because we have got 16--no, wait. We have got 25 amendments from my  friends on the other side of the aisle, most of which are to tell the  navigator how to do a better job and to put in Federal statute how to,  basically have common sense.   I have never thought, by the way, you could legislate common sense. I  don't know what my colleagues think of that. I never thought you could.   But I do know we need to fund community health centers, and the  National Health Service Corps, and special diabetes programs, and  teaching hospitals. And we have got this issue of the--this will be one  that will be interesting.   If you don't want to change ObamaCare, are you going to let the  Cadillac tax hit insurance plans of union workers and people working in  business?   Or are you going to put off the big cuts that are coming right at our  hospitals?   I had my hospitals in the other day, and they are saying, Boy, I sure  hope you are going to turn off those DSH cuts that are headed our way.  We did that last Congress. I helped lead the effort on that.   But that is actually called for in the underlying ObamaCare which, by  the way, a disproportionate share of hospitals are those in our rural  areas, in many cases, have a high portion of Medicaid, and they were  supposed to, as part of the grand bargain with the Obama administration  and Democrats, take these cuts. And now they are coming back to us  saying, We can't afford to take these cuts.   So I don't know if you will describe that as sabotaging ObamaCare,  but I will bet you are going to join us in trying to hold off those DSH  cuts that are coming at our community hospitals.   So it just strikes me, again, that this navigator program must be a  mini-disaster in the making if everybody has to come to the floor with  an amendment to tell them how to do their job, and to reach out and  serve the people this whole thing was intended to serve.   So it is not that I am opposed to the amendment. I just think the  underlying program is pretty darn expensive. But you have heard me say  that before today, Mr. Chairman, a time or two.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Chairman, I note that the gentlewoman's amendment--and it is a  serious amendment, we appreciate it being offered. But in her State of  Virginia, the State of Virginia said it is okay to offer these plans up  to 364 days duration, short-term, limited-duration insurance policies.  These fill a gap that are regulated by her State.   These kinds of plans, Mr. Chairman, were first approved by the Obama  administration, because they must have recognized that there would be a  need for a short-term plan to fill a gap here and there, and obviously  a lot of Americans have taken advantage of those plans.   Now, because of that, the Trump administration said, well, maybe if  they are good for 3 months, we should let States decide up to a year,  and then they could go up to a couple of years, I guess. Four states  have already said no way, no how; three have said 8 months, that is as  long as you can go; 12 have said that you can go to 6 months; and 27  States, including the State of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia,  has said 364 days.   Now, look, the important thing here, and I think we would have to  agree on this if this were the amendment, there should be full and  complete disclosure of what these plans cover or do not cover, full and  complete, completely transparent, because the last thing any of us  wants is someone with a preexisting condition or some other issue or  complex medical situation, like the gentlewoman described, from getting  a plan that basically they are told covers those things when it  doesn't.   Now, it is interesting, I know Dr. Burgess is not only a  distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, but one of  the rare individuals in our body that also serves on the Rules  Committee.   If memory serves me right, Dr. Burgess, I believe one of our  colleagues, the chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on  Health, had an amendment in the Rules Committee that would require full  disclosure and transparency, right?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, back to the issue of the gentlewoman's  amendment, the chair of the Subcommittee on Health, her amendment, the  short summary here says:         Require short-term, limited-duration insurance plans to       prominently carry a disclosure the plan provides coverage for       limited medical conditions and benefits.    That amendment was not made in order. It should have been made in  order, because then we could get to the other question here, which I  think we all agree on, is that there needs to be complete transparency  of these things, because they don't cover everything. We all buy lots  of insurance products for cars, houses, life insurance, disability, and  all these things, and I want it to be easy to understand, full  disclosure.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I am  all about setting targets and holding people accountable for their  goals, it turns out the navigators already tried that, and it didn't  work very well. So I don't know that having Secretary Azar set a goal  for each of the exchanges and all is going to work any better.   Navigators enrolled less than 1 percent of total enrollees. And  according to one report, in fact, the navigator's program had an  enrollment goal of 2,000, but, well, he kind of fell short. He only  enrolled one person. So that is a bit of a problem.   I think goals are a good thing, but I don't know that that is going  to help here. We know how many people get enrolled. We know information  around this.   I don't know. Once again, here we are trying to micromanage a program  that clearly has a lot of flaws, or we wouldn't be putting all these  things into statute.   I mean, I don't think we are giving these amendments to 25 Democrats  just because they are freshmen. I think they have substantive issues  they are trying to bring to the floor here. But it seems to me that  this is really odd to micromanage a program to this level, and so I am  going to end up opposing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, it is amazing to me that 17 navigators,  according to CMS, during the grant year 2016 to 2017, 17 of these  navigators that my friends on the other side of the aisle are such big  fans of enrolled fewer than 100 people at an average cost of $5,000 per  enrollee. That doesn't seem to be very cost efficient to me.   As I have said before, today, The Wall Street Journal investigation  found one grantee got 200 grand and enrolled one person. This is a  great program.   You can't understand why the Trump administration wants to cut back  and put some boundaries around? I can't imagine why you would embrace  that. I just don't get it.   The top 10 most expensive navigators collected $2.77 million, and  they signed up 314 people. Let that one sink in. I mean, if you all  want to embrace that, that is up to you. Not the way I would do  business.   The Las Vegas Review-Journal editorialized: ``The navigator scheme is  a make-work government jobs program rife with corruption and highly  susceptible to scam artists. It's a slush fund for progressive  constituent groups.''   That is a respected newspaper. The journalist is writing this, Wall  Street Journal's investigation.   We figure out $62.5 million in grants enrolled 81,426 individuals.  That is less than 1 percent. That is your navigators, Mr. Chairman,  that some are so enthralled with; that is their body of work: $62.5  million, 1 percent.   Now, if you just run a simple calculation, that means about $767 was  spent  [[Page H3898]]  per individual that was enrolled. That is a lot of money.   By contrast, agents and brokers assisted with 42 percent of the  federally facilitated exchange enrollment for plan year 2018, which  cost the FFE only $2.40, $2.40 per enrollee to provide training and  technical assistance.   So we have before us this opportunity to either fund a program that  appears to be susceptible to scam, according to one paper: One person  gets enrolled, and one person gets paid $200,000 to enroll that one  person. That is the outcome. That doesn't seem to make a lot of sense  to me.   So I would say to my colleague from California that where we really  need the transparency and accountability is on the navigators  themselves. That is where we ought to be investigating.   And on the short-term duration plans, it is unfortunate that Ms.  Eshoo's amendment was not made in order, because I agree that we need  more transparency on those plans so people know what they are buying. I  don't want anybody to get a plan that doesn't cover what they need. I  don't think any of us do.   So, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and unless any  other Member requests time, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just make a couple of points.   First of all, of course we want navigators to work in areas where  there is high unemployment. My district, over the years, has had some  of the highest unemployment in the State of Oregon.   Then I go down the list of future amendments here, and it is like,  oh, we have got another one coming up that ensures rural areas are  included in the navigator outreach. Well, that is a good idea.   And then there is another one that ensures that State healthcare  exchange outreach activities also target our veteran population. Yes,  that is a good idea.   Why are we having to put all this in statute? Who the heck is running  this program, and why is it such a mess that it requires amendment  after amendment after amendment? My point is: Where does this stop?   Of course we want them to work with veterans. Of course we want them  to work with seniors and the young. Are we going to go to age segments  here, 18 to 29, 31 to--I mean, come on. Really? We are going to put all  this in statute?   How do they not have common sense? Who are these navigators that we  have to direct them from the floor of the House into statute? Oh, by  the way, be sure and work in an unemployed area. Be sure to mention  that there are services for mental health and substance abuse. Oh,  don't forget this, that, and the other thing.   I mean, I think we only ran out of amendments because we ran out of  ideas of things to put into the statute, but that is no way to run a  program.   And if it costs $767 for everyone they sign up for the government to  run its navigator program but the private sector can do it for $2.40,  that is not a very economical way. You don't make it up in volume.   And of course we want people to get access to insurance and  information. I was in the radio business for 20 years. Our job was to  get information out to consumers, so I am all about that.  [[Page H3899]]    It is just amazing, though, when you see the inefficiency of a  Federal system versus the efficiency of a private-sector initiative.   And here we just passed an amendment, $25 million more into this  program, and yet we know in some cases there is enormous cost, and  there appears to be, you know--I don't know--malfeasance. I don't know  what it is.   But if the top 10 most expensive navigators collected $2.77 million  to sign up 314 people, I think we are in the wrong business. We ought  to go be navigators at that rate. That is a pretty good rate of return  for them, but not for the people and the taxpayers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader of the United States  House of Representatives.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the Republican leader of the  U.S. House for not only his leadership on this issue but on so many  others, and for giving us clarity on what is really going on here.   It is unfortunate. As The Washington Post and other news media  organizations reported, it didn't have to be this way. It didn't have  to be this way.   We did pass the three drug reform bills unanimously out of the  committee. I was a big supporter of them. Every Republican was. I think  every Republican on the floor will be if they get a chance to vote for  those.   In the past, when I was chairman of the committee, we moved over 143  bills out of the committee. Ninety-three percent of them had bipartisan  votes on the House floor. Fifty-seven became law. One of those 57  contained about 60 different opioid bills we rolled into just one.   I agree with the leader. This is going to delay passage in the Senate  because they are going to have to sort this out, rip it apart. The  added spending and the navigator piece probably don't survive. But it  didn't have to be that way.   I found that if you have big bipartisan support out of the House, you  are likely to get quicker action in the Senate, and it goes down to the  President.   If you want to do something quickly about high-cost drugs and stop  bad behavior that denies access for new generics, then you want to move  quickly, not slowly. You want to move in a bipartisan way, not a  partisan way. Unfortunately, that is not our way today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the amendment.  [[Page H3901]]     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am outraged to find out that these  navigators are not reaching out to people in rural areas. What we have  learned today on the House floor is that apparently this program  doesn't reach people in rural areas. That is why the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma has this amendment, apparently. These navigators, what the  heck do they do?   We have had amendments to say you have got to have navigators reach  out to people on Medicaid. You have got to have navigators reach out to  people on the Children's Health Insurance Program. We have to tell them  that? What have they been doing?   We are going to have an amendment coming up saying, Navigators, we  are going to put into Federal law that you have to reach out to the  veterans' community. They don't do that today? Are you serious?   And we are going to have navigators that have to be educated. When  you are reaching out, you better talk about mental health services and  substance abuse. Have they been ignoring that all along? I guess so.   Because my friends on the other side of the aisle have been bringing  amendment after amendment to correct these obvious omissions and  problems with the navigator program. What has been going on in the  navigator program?   This is outrageous to learn that rural areas--and I represent an area  that would stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to Ohio, 69,000 square  miles--and you are talking about rural. I am going to find out why the  heck those navigators aren't talking to people in my district, and why  we have to put in law that they have to now.   How many years has this been going on under ObamaCare, and at what  cost to taxpayers? And you are going to give them another $25 million.  Who are they talking to? Are they talking to people in suburban areas  only, or urban areas only?   But if they are not talking about Medicaid and CHIP, and apparently  not to veterans, who are they counseling and what are they telling  them? What a disaster of a program. We ought to halt right now and  figure out who are these people and what are they getting paid to do.   We know they cost $767 for every enrollee, compared to $2.40 in the  private sector. So we are paying them a lot. We know that  investigations have shown that one grantee took $200,000 and enrolled  one person, and, apparently, that person was not a veteran, not on  Medicaid, not in a rural area, and not on CHIP. Who knows. Right?   I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment, but I am astonished to  learn of the fact that we have to put it in law that they have to talk  to people in rural areas. This demands investigation to figure out what  in the heck is going on.   Now, let's talk about what else is facing us. What really takes care  of people in rural areas are our community health centers, 27 million  people, 1 in 12 in every State. The District of Columbia and the  territories rely on community health centers for their care, and of the  patients treated at these centers, one in three are living in poverty;  one in five are rural residents; and one in nine are children.    If you want to put the taxpayer money to good purpose, it would be to  fund our community health centers, like Republicans led the way on last  time at record levels because we know they deliver for people in rural  areas. They deliver for people in urban areas. They deliver quality  care.   That is where our money should go, not into a program like this,  apparently, that we have to have these amendments from Democrat  Members. I think we had 25 amendments from Democrat Members telling  navigators we are going to go to rural areas, we are going to go to  veterans. Who are they serving today? It is a mess.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as I said in the last amendment debate, it  is astonishing to me that apparently these navigators aren't serving  people in rural areas, and now I find out that they are apparently not  serving our veteran population effectively as well.   I am going to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his service to  the country and all of our veterans, men and women, who wear our  uniform and deserve our undying appreciation and thanks.   But it is astonishing, once again, it is appalling that these  navigators apparently aren't serving our veterans. We have to come to  the floor with amendments to Federal law to order them to take care of  our veterans. What kind of program is this?   We know it is expensive. We know some in the news media, some of the  editorial writers in our country said it is open to fraud and--let me  read it.   An editorial paper out West said, ``In reality, the navigator scheme  is a make-work government jobs program rife with corruption and highly  susceptible to scam artists. It's a slush fund for progressive  constituent groups.''   That is how one editorial came out. I am sure there are good people  in there somewhere doing good work, but we know that according to CMS,  17 navigators enrolled less than 100 people at an average cost of  $5,000 per enrollee. What kind of program is this? We know it is  expensive.   One grantee took in $200,000 and enrolled one person. The top ten  most expensive collected $2.77 million and signed up 314 people. So it  is inefficient, but at least it is really expensive. What a waste.   I am sure they enroll people, but only 1 percent of those enrolled in  the exchange are helped by navigators. And then today, we find out that  we have to tell them what to do, which makes you wonder, what have they  been doing? Because we have had amendments to say, you have got to have  them educate people about Medicaid, or CHIP, or veterans, rural areas,  mental health, substance abuse--one thing after another. I think we  ought to investigate them and the whole program stem to stern.   If there is waste and fraud, we ought to go after it. If there is all  of this expense, we ought to knock it down. And if they are not serving  people--I am glad we had the rural amendment. Do we need one for urban,  and suburban, and semi-frontier counties? It makes me wonder who they  do serve. We know it is expensive.   Obviously, we are going to tell them to serve the veterans. You know  that makes sense.   I am glad your amendment got made in order. We had 16 Republican  amendments. They only made one in order. There were 25 Democratic  amendments made in order. Two of those we had to edit on the floor, and  one technical amendment.    It seems an odd way to run the House. We were promised in the opening  days by the chairman of the Rules Committee that it was all going to be  different. Boy, he was right. It is just a different way.   I think that our Member on the Rules Committee could probably tell us  92 percent of the amendments that have been allowed on the House floor  have been from Democrats. When Republicans were in the majority, 45  percent of the amendments came from Democrats. We tried to have an open  process. Now we are being shut out, and that is unfortunate.   So, Mr. Chairman, we have had a long day here. I think we all care  deeply about making sure people have access to affordable healthcare.  Republicans believe we need to reform how our systems work. We need to  drive down the cost of drugs, and nobody has led more on this in my  history around here than the President of the United States, Donald  Trump.   From day one, he has told the drug companies: You need to get your  prices down. I was with him in the White House when he said that in  about February of 2017, and he has never relented. And he is a partner  in this progress to go after surprise billing, to go after high drug  costs. He is leading through his administration, and he will sign the  drug bills that we worked out in committee.   The travesty is the pothole created by the Democrat politicos that  said we have got to link the drug bills we all have agreement on that  the President would sign, to bills that we know are bailing out  ObamaCare. And worse, we are now funding huge money, and even more  authorized today, into a program that apparently wasn't taking care of  veterans, nor people in rural areas.                                time  1830    It is astonishing. So, Mr. Chairman, this amendment is fine. It makes  sense. It is just outrageous we have to put in Federal law that these  navigators have to actually help veterans because they ought to be  doing that day in and day out. Veterans are the ones who give us our  freedom. We need to investigate the navigators.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Oh, my gosh, Mr. Speaker, in its current form,  absolutely, yes, sir.    Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats worked together on  provisions to bring generic drugs to market faster and to stop abusive  practices. We did that on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and we  brought this House multiple bills to achieve that goal, and we did it  unanimously.   We believe our bipartisan work will increase competition and  ultimately help lower the cost of prescription drugs.   These policies passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee. They help consumers, and they have the added benefit of  helping the Federal Government by producing $4 billion in savings.   Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle, Democrats,  decided to pair these bipartisan bills to lower drug costs with what  they knew were very partisan bills that I, frankly, think waste  taxpayer money in many cases.   We ought to be working together on this, not descending ``into  partisan politics on a seemingly bipartisan issue.'' Those are the  words of STAT News as reported today.   The fact is, when we do work together, we can achieve real results.  In the last Congress, we reauthorized the Food and Drug Administration,  and we gave that agency the tools and resources to get generic drugs  into market faster.   It is already working. Our work produced, with the FDA's efforts, a  record number of generic drugs coming to market, driving competition,  and giving consumers more choices.   We did the same thing in the prior Congress when Fred Upton and Diana  DeGette led the effort on 21st Century Cures so we could invest in  medical research. That was bipartisan.   Unfortunately, today you have partisan bills coupled with bipartisan  bills, a poison pill, if you will. And the Democrats have decided to  use the money, in part generated by our work on generic drugs, to fund  more navigators.   Let me just talk briefly about navigators.   They cost you an average of $767 every time they sign up an  individual. In the private sector, it is $2.40. And they just added  another $25 million to that.   The Wall Street Journal reported one grantee took in $200,000 to  enroll a grand total of one person.  [[Page H3909]]    The top 10 most expensive navigators collected $2.77 million in  contracts from the Federal Government. They signed up 314 people. That  is how they spent the money.   One newspaper editorialized: ``The navigator scheme is a make-work  government jobs program rife with corruption and highly susceptible to  scam artists.''   Today on the House floor, you will have a choice with this motion to  recommit, and the choice is to spend it that way and add more money  into that navigator program, that, by the way, we just approved a bunch  of amendments to tell navigators to go work with people in rural areas,  to work with people on CHIP, veterans. Apparently, they weren't working  with any of those folks.   So the motion to recommit says this: same drug bills that we passed  out of committee, so you will be able to vote ``yes'' on those, and  then the money that is generated, rather than going to this flawed  navigator program will go to the NIH innovation fund to support  childhood cancer research. That is your choice.   By using the savings from the drug pricing provisions to pay for  childhood cancer research, this amendment makes clear the bipartisan  drug pricing offsets should be used to pay for bipartisan healthcare  priorities.   So, if you support lowering the cost of prescription drugs and you  support the work of the NIH and its efforts to save countless lives of  children with cancer, then you vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
