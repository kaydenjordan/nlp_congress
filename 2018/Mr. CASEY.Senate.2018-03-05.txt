 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today as Syria is about to enter its  eighth year of conflict. We have witnessed 7 years of displacement and  violence, 7 years of war crimes, and 7 years of Bashar al-Assad's  illegitimate grasp on power. To say that it is past time for Assad to  go or that it is past time for the conflict to be resolved dramatically  underestimates the horrible suffering and destruction the people of  Syria have experienced. In these 7 years, almost 500,000 Syrians have  been killed and more than 12 million have been displaced from their  homes.   This conflict has disproportionately affected children, as all  conflicts do. According to Save the Children, inside Syria, 7.5 million  children have lived their whole lives knowing nothing but war.  Emotional and psychological stress has manifested itself physically;  Syrian children now face an increase in heart disease, diabetes, and  depression. These children are growing up in refugee camps, with no end  in sight. This means the loss of their childhood and  [[Page S1335]]  of educational opportunities. I don't exaggerate when I say that  because of this war, an entire generation of Syrians will be both  displaced and disaffected in an already volatile region. Ignoring these  children ensures decades of instability to come.   In Eastern Ghouta this past week, we saw the most recent example of  the brutality of the Assad regime, aided and abetted by Russia and  Iran. While only just now making headlines, Eastern Ghouta has been  held under siege by the Syrian Government since 2013. This  neighborhood, which had supposedly been designated as a deescalation  zone, has been bombarded by Syrian Government forces armed with Russian  weapons. In just a few days, 500 civilians have been killed, and that  number is growing.   Years after the international community reached a consensus that  Assad had lost his legitimacy as the leader of Syria, he not only  remains in power but is more secure than ever. The United States has  not only failed to exert moral leadership in the face of Syrian  suffering but has also failed to show strategic leadership in the face  of a tangible threat to U.S. national security.   I have long called on both the Obama and Trump administrations,  warning that U.S. interests were not being represented in Syrian  negotiations, but this has never been more clearly illustrated than in  November of this past year, November of 2017, when a picture circulated  of Presidents Ruhani, Putin, and Erdogan shaking hands in Russia after  a round of negotiations to determine a potential resolution of the  Syrian conflict.   I have to ask, is it now U.S. policy to let these three dictate  policy in the Middle East--Ruhani, Putin, and Erdogan? The United  States was not there, nor were our European allies. The United States  is failing our own interests by ceding leadership in Syria to Iran and  Russia, whose national security interests often directly contradict our  own.   What do these bullying regimes want from Syria?   Let's start with Iran. Iran sees Syria as an investment in its  political infrastructure and its campaign for regional hegemony. It is  their ``land bridge'' from Tehran to Beirut, a weapons pipeline, a  training camp for Hezbollah. It is a practice ground for a future war  with Israel.   What about the Russians? The Russian Government, led by Mr. Putin,  has made clear that they believe all Syrian territory must return to  the Assad regime and to the Assad regime's control before political  reforms can be considered. Putin seeks a solution that shows that he is  the arbiter of events in the Middle East. Lately, foreign leaders-- including Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, President Ruhani, and  King Salman of Saudi Arabia--fly to Moscow instead of Washington. They  see a Russia that seeks to write the rules of international order and  an America that sits back, too enmeshed in our own political strife to  lead.   This is not the America that I know and that most Americans know. The  America I know does not believe that where you are born should dictate  where you live or die or if you spend your childhood in a refugee camp.  The America I know does not stand by while enemy nations threaten to  expand their spheres of influence. The America I know sees the  complexity of our own foreign involvements, understanding, for  instance, that ISIS cannot be fully defeated without considering the  context of the Syrian civil war. The America I know supports its  allies, like Israel, that share a chaotic border with a nation at war  with itself.    In 1963, President John F. Kennedy spoke at the Fort Worth, TX,  Chamber of Commerce on the challenges posed by the Soviet regime.   He said:         This country, which desires only to be free, which desires       to be secure, which desired to live at peace for 18 years       under three different administrations, has borne more than       its share of the burden, has stood watch for more than its       number of years. I don't think we are fatigued or tired. We       would like to live as we once lived. But history will not       permit it. . . . The balance of power is still on the side of       freedom. We are still the keystone in the arch of freedom,       and I think we will continue to do as we have done in our       past, our duty.    So said President Kennedy. He spoke to the paradox of our country  then and now, what we continue to face. If we are to remain the  keystone in the arch of freedom, we cannot become fatigued by the  responsibility to fight tyranny.   These are the very issues that should receive public debate as part  of the congressional consideration of a new authorization for the use  of military force, known by the acronym AUMF. We undermine our own  credibility when we continue to send our men and women into conflicts  that Congress has not authorized. Secretary Tillerson, our Secretary of  State, has indicated that he sees a need for a long-term U.S. military  presence in Syria; yet many of us believe that there is no purely  military solution to this conflict. Where is the strategy? we ask. I  would like to see the administration put forward a plan that  encompasses all components of this conflict--military, political, and  humanitarian.   When we ask our men and women in uniform to put their lives on the  line to protect our homeland and fight terrorism, we need to be willing  to back them up by doing our jobs here in Washington. Just consider  Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians have made a substantial sacrifice in the  past 17 years of war as 288 of our brave servicemembers have been  killed in action in those 17 years and as almost 2,000 have been  wounded in action in Afghanistan and Iraq.   We owe it to these men and women to have a robust, bipartisan debate  about this strategy and a vote on an AUMF. We should also vote on  legislation to cut off financing for ISIS or any other terrorist  organization in the world. I have a bipartisan bill, the Stop  Terrorists Operational Resources and Money Act, the so-called STORM  Act, with Senator Isakson. I have a bill, as well, with Senator Rubio,  the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq and Syria Act, to promote  humanitarian aid and sanction the Russian and Iranian actors who are  destabilizing this region--all of the components of a comprehensive  strategy.   Let's have a serious debate on this critical national security issue.  We are not always faced with situations in which our moral obligation  and our strategic priorities lead to the same conclusion, but this is  one of those rare moments.   May it be said of us years from now, just as President Kennedy said,  that we do our duty to continue to be the keystone in the arch of  freedom, including helping the Syrian people, especially her children,  be free of Assad's brutality and bombing.    Mr. President, I restate my support for the investigations  by Robert Mueller into Russia's election interference, as well as to  condemn the partisan attacks on the independent investigation being led  by Robert Mueller, who has been an honorable public servant over many  decades.   In 2016, our Nation came under attack by a hostile foreign power.  Everyone knows that now. Our election process--the bedrock of our  system of government--was targeted by Russian agents. They used a  variety of measures to pursue their goals. The intelligence community's  unclassified report concluded:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential presidency. We further       assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear       preference for President-elect Trump.    That is from the unclassified report of our intelligence community.   These brazen and illegal actions have already resulted in the  indictments of 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies as  part of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.   Russia may not have used traditional military force against us, but  the actions they took present just as serious a threat to our national  security. Make no mistake, when a foreign adversary targets an American  election, it has targeted America, itself. Yet the President, whose own  campaign is being examined as part of the Russia investigation, has  refused to enforce sanctions against Russia. He has refused to fight  back against Putin and his regime, despite there being clear evidence  that they attacked us. The President's failure to take action against  Russia underscores the urgent need for Special Counsel Mueller's  independent investigation to continue unfettered.   In this investigation, Mr. Mueller has already amassed enough  evidence to have a grand jury indict Russian operatives and high- ranking members of the Trump campaign, including former Trump campaign  manager Paul Manafort and deputy campaign manager Rick Gates. Other  Trump advisers, like Mr. Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, have pled  guilty to Federal crimes.   Unfortunately, as this evidence has come forward, unwarranted,  dangerous, and partisan attacks on Mr. Mueller's investigation and on  Mr. Mueller, himself, have accelerated; yet a brief glance at Mr.  Mueller's lifetime of service reflects his commitment to serving the  American people with honor, integrity, and courage that, I think, is  unmatched by anyone I know in Washington. Here are a couple of  examples.   As a young man, Mr. Mueller served with distinction in the Vietnam  war and was awarded a Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals, the  Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for his leadership  and exemplary service.   Mr. Mueller received the Bronze Star for his ``heroic achievement''  after leading his fellow marines through an 8-hour battle, where, under  enemy fire, ``Second Lieutenant Mueller fearlessly moved from one  position to another, directing the accurate counterfire of his men and  shouting words of encouragement to them. . . . [H]e then skillfully  supervised the evacuation of casualties from the hazardous fire area.''  After that battle, he was promoted to first lieutenant.   Just 4 months later, he sustained a bullet wound when he responded to  an ambush by enemy forces on marines who were in his command. For his  heroic response, Mr. Mueller received the Navy Commendation Medal with  a citation praising him for rushing to save his fellow marines while  ``completely disregarding his own safety.''   I will give a recitation of some of the record that Special Counsel  Mueller developed long before he was named to this position. I was  going through his actions as a marine in combat, and I have a few more  parts of his record to review.   Mr. Mueller not only fought courageously on the battlefield, but upon  returning home earned his law degree. He continued serving his country  throughout his legal career.   After serving in U.S. attorney's offices in both Boston and San  Francisco for over a decade, he later served at the Justice Department  leading the Criminal Division of the Justice Department under President  George H.W. Bush. There he oversaw cases ranging from the prosecution  of the Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, to the Lockerbie bombing.  [[Page S1342]]    In 1995, Mr. Mueller left a high-paying position in the private  sector to join the DC U.S. attorney's office--in this case, the  Homicide Division--working to hold violent offenders accountable for  their crimes.   Three years later, he became a U.S. attorney himself, serving again  in San Francisco and earning a reputation as a dogged and fair  prosecutor committed to enforcing the rule of law.   In 2001, Mr. Mueller was nominated by a second Republican President,  President George W. Bush, to be the Director of the FBI. He was then  confirmed unanimously by this body. His tenure at the FBI included  leading the response to the September 11 attacks, spearheading the  Bureau's efforts to combat cyber crime, which has been widely praised.  In fact, in 2011, when his 10-year term was scheduled to end, we in the  Senate voted 100 to 0 to extend his term as FBI Director through 2013,  another 10 years.   Though our political system has become more polarized, each time Mr.  Mueller has been named or nominated for a new position, he has received  unqualified praise from people across the political spectrum and  rightly so.   With Mr. Mueller's record as a war hero, a dedicated public servant,  and an expert in law enforcement, it is hard to imagine anyone better  suited to lead the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016  election. There is no one in Washington, DC, or, frankly, in all of  America better prepared to do this job.   Serious congressional oversight of executive branch operations is  always appropriate. However, the reckless partisan attacks on Mr.  Mueller's investigation and on Mr. Mueller himself are not the same as  congressional oversight. Such attacks have made us less safe as a  nation. The political smears like those we have seen undermine our rule  of law and strike at the heart of our democracy. They are a disservice  to the brave men and women in law enforcement who put their lives on  the line to keep all of us safe.   As Members of the U.S. Congress, we have a duty to uphold the rule of  law and the principles of fairness and independence that American  democracy is built upon.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defend the  integrity of Mr. Mueller's investigation and reject the politically  motivated attempts to discredit the investigation and its underlying  conclusions. I call on the House and Senate majority to give us a vote  on legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller's independence and  ensure that he can continue his investigation free from interference.   To ensure the integrity of our elections and our democracy, we must  make sure we never allow a hostile foreign power to interfere in our  electoral process again, and to do that we must allow the special  counsel to get to the bottom of what Russia did in 2016 and whether it  was aided by American individuals. That is what the whole investigation  is about--those two parts.   History, of course, will be our judge. We will be judged about how we  handled this crisis. We know that in 1787, when the Constitutional  Convention had just adjourned, Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of  government the Convention had chosen for our young nation. He responded  that the Convention has given us ``[a] Republic, if you can keep it.''   Democratic principles are only as strong as those elected to uphold  them. I hope my colleagues will stand together and stand strong to  preserve the rule of law and the institutions of this Republic we have  been given, and we must ``keep it,'' as Franklin said.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
