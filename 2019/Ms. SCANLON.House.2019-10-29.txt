 Mr. Speaker, last week, we celebrated the life of  service of our colleague Elijah Cummings. He always said our children  are the living messengers we send to a future we will never see.  Nothing could be truer.   In addition, students and young advocates inspire me every single  day, so I want to share with all of you an initiative that students in  my district launched this month. Students at the Interboro School  District are wrapping up their celebration of Kindness Month, a program  inspired by Sandy Hook Promise in an effort to reduce bullying and  reduce school violence.   Since the beginning of October, Interboro students have been  encouraged to say a simple ``hello'' to students they might see every  day but not usually speak to or to hold the door for someone they don't  know.   In honor of Kindness Month, I, too, have committed to reaching across  the aisle to say hello and strike up conversations with colleagues I  may not know that well.   We all have something to learn from the Interboro students as we work  together to create a world that is more respectful, fair, and kind for  this generation and the next.                            ____________________
