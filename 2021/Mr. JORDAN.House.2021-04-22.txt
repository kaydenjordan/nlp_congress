 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats started last week with one of their Members  saying we should get rid of the police altogether. They ended last week  with another one of their Members being admonished by the trial judge  in Minneapolis for saying ridiculous things.   What did they do in between? They passed out of committee this bill,  which gives two more Democrat Senators to the District of Columbia. And  less than 24 hours after that bill passed in committee, they introduced  legislation to pack the Supreme Court.   In 3 months of Democrats being in control of the Federal Government,  they have increased the debt by $2 trillion; they created a crisis on  the southern border; and they continued their push to defund the  police.   Now, so they can continue their radical policies, think about what  else they have passed out of this body: a bill to federalize our voting  laws, federalize our election laws; a bill to pack the Court, as I  said. They introduced that legislation. The chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, of all people, introduced that bill. And here we are today,  with a pure power grab to give two Democrat Senators to the District of  Columbia.   There is a crisis on our southern border. The American people want us  to focus on the crisis. Even the President called it a crisis.   Let's stop the power grab. Let's deal with the issues the American  people want us to deal with. That is what we should be focused on.   I hope we vote this bill down. I urge a ``no'' vote.                                time  0945
