 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I thank the gentleman for that information.   As the majority leader knows, after today we will have 8 legislative  days left before the CR runs out on April 28. We will be gone, as the  gentleman knows, for 2 weeks, or a few more days than that, for the  Easter break. We have not enacted any appropriation bills except for  the MILCON-VA and the Defense Appropriation bill we passed through this  House in a bipartisan vote and that is pending in the Senate.                                time  1045    Given the limited number of days in session before April 28, we are  going to require relatively quick action if we are to fund the  government for the balance of the year past April 28.   Mr. Leader, can you tell me--because no appropriation bill or CR or  omnibus was on the schedule for next week, can the gentleman tell me  when he expects some form of continuing to authorize expenditures for  the balance of the year between now and September 30 will occur?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments.   Does the gentleman contemplate the possibility of a short-term CR  being necessary?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information  and comments.   Frankly, I want to tell the majority leader, honestly, nobody on my  side, maybe someplace else, but nobody on my side is wanting to shut  down the government. We don't want to shut down the government.   Of course, I will remind my friend, the majority leader--and I  appreciate his comments about our cooperation and ability to work  together--the only way the government has been kept open over the last  5 years has been with Democratic votes. My friend didn't have 218 votes  on his side of the aisle that would do that. So I think that belies the  fact that we want to shut down the government.   I would assure my friend that that is neither our intent or desire.  As a matter of fact, we want to work quickly to avoid that happening.  That is not good for, obviously, the American people, it is not good  for managers trying to plan on how to deliver services, and it is  certainly not good for our Federal employees. So I would want to work  with you to make sure that doesn't happen.   As we have in the past, we will be prepared to provide votes, as we  have every time, to ensure that that does not happen.   Let me ask my friend, as we work towards the end of not shutting down  government and passing, hopefully, an omnibus which will complete the  2017 appropriations process and fund the government through September  30, let me ask him--he was quoting some information. I have a quote for  him as well. I know he would be disappointed if I didn't have a quote.  This is not nearly as difficult as some of the others, however. It  says:         House Republicans are considering making another run next       week at the passing of the healthcare bill that they abruptly       pulled from the floor in a setback to their efforts to repeal       ObamaCare. Two Republican lawyers say the leaders are       discussing holding a vote, even staying into next weekend, if       necessary, but it is unclear what changes would be made to       the GOP's healthcare bill . . .    That was in Bloomberg News on March 29.   Does the majority leader have any information or expectation that we  would be considering another bill seeking to repeal the Affordable Care  Act next week? I know the majority leader didn't announce that for next  week, and I know on Thursday we will break for the Easter break.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   If I hear what the gentleman just said, my interpretation is that we  don't expect anything next week, but that does not mean that we don't  expect something in the future. Is that a correct reading of it?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
