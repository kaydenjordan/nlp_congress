 Mr. President, first, I want to thank my colleague who  just spoke about some really important issues.   Senator Grassley from Iowa talked about the fentanyl crisis that is  facing our country. Unfortunately, this synthetic opioid is now killing  more and more Americans. We are back to record levels of overdose  deaths, and probably two-thirds of them are caused by fentanyl.   He is absolutely right. We need to be sure it is scheduled clearly as  an illegal drug, as well as all the variants of it.               Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022    Mr. President, I am coming on the floor today to talk about another  issue that is really important to our country, and that is protecting  us from cyber attacks.   Last night, I commend this body because the U.S. Senate passed  legislation called the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of  2022.   What does that mean? It means that we took the time to do our  homework, had hearings, and reported out legislation that helps protect  our government data, including personal data of American citizens, but  also our national security data and other sensitive information from  cyber attacks.   Also, we put in place provisions to help protect the private sector,  particularly critical infrastructure.   With what is going on right now around the world, particularly with  regard to Russia and Ukraine, it is incredibly important that we put up  better defenses here in this country, as well as helping Ukraine and  other countries to fight against these cyber attacks.   In recent years, we have seen this time and time again. I am sure you  remember the Colonial Pipeline. Remember, they shut down gasoline  distribution to the eastern part of the United States. These were cyber  attacks.   You probably heard of some of these other cyber attacks, like  SolarWinds or ones where these criminal gangs demand a ransom using so- called ransomware. This is happening increasingly.   Again, my concern is, particularly with what is going on today in our  volatile and dangerous world, that it will continue to happen and even  become much more dangerous for us.   The House of Representatives now has a chance to take up this  legislation and pass it. They have been working with us on this all  along on a bicameral basis, the House and the Senate, Republican and  Democrat. This hasn't been a partisan issue. It has been one of these  issues where we have worked together.   Senator Peters, who is the chair of the Homeland Security and  Government Affairs Committee--I am the ranking Republican, top  Republican--we have worked together on this, but so did a lot of other  members across the aisle.   Senator Rubio and Senator Warner, Senator Collins, and others, they  vitally represent the Intelligence Committee, which also has a strong  interest in this.   In my role as the ranking member on Homeland Security, we spend a lot  of time focused on the oversight of this issue, how to respond to  things like SolarWinds we talked about or Colonial Pipeline or other  cyber attacks. What we have found is that these cyber attacks are  increasingly sophisticated and that our own government doesn't have the  tools they need, and that is why this legislation is so important.   Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an atrocity. It must not stand. But  one of the things they have done in Ukraine for the last 8 years--and,  really, before that as well, but particularly the last 8 years, since  2014 when Ukraine decided to turn to the West, to turn to us--is Russia  had done these cyber attacks relentlessly in Ukraine. And they are  stepping them up right now, along with the horrible scenes we see of  the bombings of innocent civilians in their apartment buildings. I saw  today that not only have hospitals and childcare institutions been  bombed but also the Holocaust memorial in Kyiv has been damaged. So  what the Russians are doing is appalling, and the entire freedom-loving  world needs to stand up to it, and we need to help Ukraine more.    But one thing they have also done is they have launched these cyber  attacks against the Ukrainian Government and against the private sector  infrastructure in Ukraine. That, too, is a place where we can help.   But, again, we need to be sure that we have our own house in order  here to be able to be more helpful, to be able to provide the best  practices, and to help Ukraine be able to deal with these attacks, both  kinetic attacks, these military attacks, and also the cyber attacks.   Many times, the cyber attacks are also mixed with disinformation  attacks because the Russians are flooding the zone and trying to take  their disinformation and their lies and spread it around to the  Ukrainian people. By the way, not many people are  [[Page S931]]  believing it anymore because it is so outrageous.   In China, we see another sophisticated cyber adversary ramping up  their rhetoric and their incursion into Taiwan's air defense zone. All  these threats make enacting this legislation we passed last night all  the more important.   Legislation has three complementary bills combined into one. First,  it will protect our critical infrastructure better from cyber attacks  by increasing our visibility as a country into these cyber attacks and  building the government's ability to warn potential victims and mount a  nationwide defense and provide best practices to our critical  infrastructure.   It will strengthen the government's own response and recovery  capabilities, protecting sensitive data as well. And, finally, it will  make government acquisition and use of cloud services more secure, more  accountable, more efficient, and, significantly, keep countries like  China and Russia from being able to access the cloud.   All of these bills were passed out of the Homeland Security and  Government Affairs Committee with strong bipartisan support. And,  again, it passed the Senate overwhelmingly last night.   The first of these bills that I mentioned is called the Cyber  Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. Cyber attacks  against U.S. critical infrastructure, whether by foreign governments,  like Russia and China, or criminal organizations, are, of course, a  serious national security threat.   Today, no one U.S. Government agency has visibility into all the  cyber attacks occurring against critical infrastructure on a daily  basis. We need that. We need to know what is going on to be able to  warn other infrastructure and to be able to respond quickly.   Right now, if Russia initiates a cyber campaign against U.S. critical  infrastructure, there would be nothing to ensure that the U.S.  Government is notified of that so it can mount a nationwide response  and, again, warn other critical infrastructure operators similarly  situated.   This bill would change that, enabling a coordinated, informed U.S.  response to cyber attacks against the United States.   The Cyber Incident Reporting Act will require critical infrastructure  owners and operators to report substantial cyber attacks within 72  hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours to what is called the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It is called CISA.   CISA has done an effective job in the Trump administration, now in  the Biden administration, but they need these tools to be able to do a  better job.   CISA having this information will be able to use the data to  immediately contact the FBI and other appropriate law enforcement but  also to help with best practices to mitigate the damage and to warn  other critical infrastructures of threats, help these victims recover,  analyze trends, and enable a whole-of-the-nation defense and response  to these attacks.   It is a cyber attack. It is not soldiers with guns, but it can have  some of the same horrible impacts and damage to our economy and to  individuals. Again, think of the oil pipeline, Colonial Pipeline, being  basically shut off to the whole East Coast of the United States.   The second bill that is part of this package is called the Federal  Information Cyber Security Modernization Act, or FISMA.   FISMA is the acronym for the way in which we protect our Federal  Agencies. And, unfortunately, we know that Federal Agencies--government  Agencies--have failed to protect Americans' data--our data, personal  data.   Last August, I released a report with Chairman Peters detailing the  significant cyber security vulnerabilities of eight different key  Federal Agencies--Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education,  and the Social Security Administration--the Social Security  Administration where a lot of our sensitive information is kept.   This report that we issued followed a report just a few years ago, in  2019, that I issued with Senator Carper when I was chair of the  Permanent Committee on Investigations, and we investigated all eight of  these Agencies to determine how they were doing in terms of pushing  back against cyber attacks.   In last year's report, only the Department of Homeland Security had  an effective cyber security program. No other Agency we reviewed met  the standard. And we found that, governmentwide, the average cyber  security grade in pushing back against these cyber attacks was a C- minus--not the grade I would have wanted to take home to my parents.  But that is the truth. We are just not prepared.   The report identifies several common Agency vulnerabilities,  including the failure to protect personally identifiable information.  Again, think about some of these Agencies, HHS or Social Security. That  is a big issue; second, maintain an accurate list of the Agencies' IT  equipment so they know what they have; third, install security patches  quickly; and, fourth, replace vulnerable and insecure legacy  technology. A lot of these Agencies have technology that needs to be  updated that is stovepiped--in other words, isn't working well together  and that makes it difficult to push back against these cyber attacks.   In the 7 years since FISMA was last updated, Federal Agencies have  had these same vulnerabilities year after year, putting America's data  at risk. So this legislation takes the important steps to remedy these  systemic problems we identified. It incorporates recommendations from  my bipartisan reports with Senator Peters and Senator Carper and will  adopt a risk-based approach to cyber security budgeting; position the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency--CISA, we talked about  earlier--as the lead Agency in securing these Federal networks. There  needs to be accountability, and that is missing now.   We need to require Agencies to notify Americans whose personal  identifiable information is compromised during a breach. To me, this is  just a basic requirement for government. If you have personal  information that has been breached because the government system has  not been properly protected, you ought to be told about that so you can  take your own steps to protect yourself.   Complement the Cyber Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act by  ensuring that Federal Agencies and contractors also notify CISA when  they suffer a breach. We talked about that earlier. But having that  information is very helpful.   And, finally, update the requirements for congressional notification  when an Agency suffers a major cyber incident.   We have an oversight responsibility here. We need to know if there  has been a major cyber attack.   Finally, this legislation includes a third part, which is called the  FedRAMP Authorization Act. This is the one that will authorize the  Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program that deals with cloud  computing and protecting the cloud. FedRAMP is a governmentwide program  administered by the General Services Administration that provides  Agencies and cloud service providers with a standard approach to  evaluating, authorizing, and monitoring the security of cloud services.  So when a Federal Government Agency wants to use the cloud services,  they have to go through this process.   In the first 4 years of FedRAMP, the program authorized only 20 cloud  service providers. Today, there are more than 230 cloud service  providers--30 percent of which are small businesses. This act builds on  the successes of FedRAMP and Agencies' continued push to adopt  commercial cloud solutions by addressing existing costs and processing  times.   But it also includes measures to strengthen the government's response  to foreign interference in our cloud systems. Supply chain security  experts have warned us about the weaknesses in FedRAMP that leave our  cloud systems vulnerable to interference from countries like Russia and  China, North Korea, Iran.   The reforms in this bill will allow for increased transparency and  better monitoring of possible foreign influences in FedRAMP-approved  systems. For example, it requires an Agency to review, on  an interagency basis, government standards to identify and assess the  origin of software and code to  [[Page S932]]  provide the transparency and accountability needed into the FedRAMP- approved systems that are developed and maintained by foreign engineers  in countries like Russia and China.    This bill also requires private-sector, third-party assessment  organizations to disclose to GSA any information they have related to  any foreign interests, any foreign influences, any foreign control, of  course, or ownership, and to report a change in foreign ownership or  control to GSA within 48 hours.   We have had instances like this where we are using cloud-based  services that then become bought by a foreign entity and that is not  reported and therefore they continue to provide these services, which  is something we need to stop.   I commend the hard work of so many of my colleagues in crafting this  broader legislation, including Chairman Peters, Chairman Warner,  Ranking Member Rubio, Senator Collins of the Intelligence Committee, as  well as so many other colleagues on the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee and the Intel Committee.   I also want to thank our colleagues in the House, particularly  Representatives Clarke and Katko, because this has been a truly  bicameral exercise, both in terms of the oversight and identifying what  the problems are and coming up with appropriate legislation.   And by the way, this legislation is strongly supported by those in  the administration who are responsible for dealing with cyber attacks.  They need these tools, and they want these tools.   We are not done yet because it has just passed the Senate. It has not  passed the House. But we need to move quickly to enact these important  changes to modernize our cyber security posture.   I urge the House to act quickly, to be sure we can protect ourselves  from cyber attacks, particularly in this increasingly dangerous  environment. I would hope that we could send this critically important  legislation to the President's desk for signature very soon and be sure  we are doing all we know to do to be able to better protect our country  and our citizens in cyber attacks.                                  H.R. 3076    Mr. President, we are also on the floor today talking about the  postal reform legislation. I know we are going back and forth trying to  determine how many amendments will be offered and which amendments are  germane or relevant to the legislation or not. But let me just say that  we already had a strong vote to move to this legislation. We had a vote  of over 70 Members, which is rare around here--a strong bipartisan vote  saying let's move forward with this postal reform. And it is really  important we do it because the post office is in deep trouble. And if  we don't act, it is going to get a lot worse. We are going to have big  problems.   In looking at this issue, again, in my oversight responsibilities on  the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, it looks  like, in the next few years, the post office would probably go  insolvent. And none of us wants that. When that happens, there would  probably be a big government bailout.   So this legislation, along with internal reforms that the post office  is making themselves--and I commend them for that--is intended to avoid  that problem. It is intended to ensure that we can get this under  control before there is an insolvency.   Right now, the post office is projecting a 10-year loss of $160  billion if we just continue with the status quo. The reality is, the  post office is in a tough business situation. Think about it. How many  first-class letters have you sent recently? And how many did you send 5  years ago or 10 years ago? Probably more. Increasingly, we are relying  on sending things by email and not sending them by first-class mail.  That changes the post office's business model.   They are also delivering to more and more addresses because everybody  wants to be connected to the post office to receive packages, to  receive other kinds of mail--advertising, newspapers, bills. People who  are reliant on getting their prescriptions through the mail are very  eager to see the post office be strong and, of course, be a post office  that addresses their universal service requirement--in other words,  goes to every single mailbox around America.    So the math doesn't work very well when you have more and more  addresses and not as much first-class mail to be sent out. That is one  reason that the post office is in trouble. And we need to address that  new reality.   The current Postmaster General, by the way, whose name is Louis  DeJoy, came and talked to some of us yesterday about this and talked  about an ambitious plan that he has embarked on along with the support  of the postal Board of Governors and the support of the previous  administration and this administration to ensure that we can transform  the post office by finding efficiencies, including transforming  existing capabilities to make sure they more efficiently meet the needs  of the American people.   He has a 10-year plan that makes changes to make the post office more  efficient, but it also continues to have this universal service  obligation where everybody is going to be getting their mail. In fact,  under our legislation, there is also a 6-day-per-week mail delivery  requirement. So it is not just that everybody's post office box or  mailbox or door is being serviced by the post office but that it is  done 6 days a week.   But he needs help to do that. In particular, he has made it very  clear to us that he needs the financial space to be able to put these  reforms in place to be able to take away some of the huge liabilities  that they currently face at the post office. That is what we do in this  legislation.   First, we eliminate a burdensome prefunding requirement for retiree  health benefits. This has really been a problem for the post office. It  has made their lives much more difficult. We mandated this in Congress  back in 2006 for current employees. This has crippled the post office  financially.   You should know, by the way, prefunding of healthcare retiree  benefits is something the Federal Government does not do. So other  Agencies and Departments don't have to do that. It is also not  something the private sector does. So it is something that the post  office uniquely has had to deal with, and, again, it has been a  financial burden for them that has really made their financial  statements extremely difficult.   Second, we require post office employees who are retiring, who have  been paying into Medicare their entire career, by the way, to join up  with Part B and Part D of Medicare--in other words, to go into  Medicare, and instead of having the Federal employee health benefit  plan be their plan, to have that be the backup and have Medicare be  their primary payer.   Everybody is in Part A, by the way, already--Medicare Part A. But  some Postal Service employees are not enrolled in Parts B and D.   Now, about 75 percent are enrolled in entire Medicare but, again,  about 25 percent are not. So that saves money for the post office  because Medicare is not as generous a program, frankly, as Federal  employee health benefit plans or the new Postal Service Federal health  benefit plan.   Third, we require the Postal Service to maintain its current standard  of this 6-day-a-week delivery we talked about through an integrated  delivery system of mail and packages. That simply says that the status  quo ought to continue so that you are delivering packages and letters  at the same time, not separately. That would be incredibly inefficient,  to say, OK, you are going to have a separate system for packages and a  separate system for letters.   In addition to doing all these things, the Congressional Budget  Office estimates that the bill is going to save money. It is going to  save $1.5 billion a year to the American taxpayer.   I would also like to note what the bill does not do because there has  been some information out there, including one editorial I saw  recently. One, it doesn't appropriate any new funds to the U.S. Post  Office.   Two, it does not change the accounting or cost structure for packages  and letters. So it does not disadvantage private-sector carriers. It is  the status quo. And that is very important to me.   Third, it does not impact the solvency of the Medicare hospital trust  fund. That is the Part A trust that is  [[Page S933]]  going broke in a short number of years. And that is the big focus of a  lot of us: make sure that doesn't happen. It does not affect Part A  trust fund at all.   It also does not increase the Medicare Part B or Part D premiums. And  that is important, I think, to a lot of us.   And, finally, it does not allow the post office to enter into new  commercial services like postal banking, which I believe would be a big  mistake.   The legislation received strong bipartisan support when it was taken  up in the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago. It passed by  a vote of 342 to 92. Not much gets passed in terms of major legislation  along those lines. And I am proud of the people who worked hard on this  on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol to come up  with a bipartisan bill. It is not the bill any one of us would have  written, but it is the right bill to save the post office.   I think Republicans and Democrats alike in the House looked at this  and said: We have to do something here. We do not want the post office  to go belly-up.   Some say that this is a whole lot better than the alternative. I  agree with that. I think that is one of the reasons we need to pass  this. It does get the Postal Service back on track; again, with reforms  being undertaken internally at the post office itself--that combination  of what we are doing here to provide them some financial space to be  able to make the reforms and the reforms that they are doing.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  Let's put the Postal Service in a position to succeed, to continue to  provide these essential services. Small businesses and our veterans  with regard to their healthcare, prescriptions being delivered, and our  rural constituents absolutely need the post office to be there to  service them. They rely on this. That is why so many, again, of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle strongly support this  legislation.   I want to thank my colleague Senator Peters for working with us over  time to find consensus on this bill. Let's pass it and ensure that the  Postal Service--the post office--remains viable for years and years  ahead. Nothing is more important to my rural constituents, who talked  to me about this quite a bit, than ensuring that the post office stays  healthy. It is really important to, again, some of the veterans I  represent who get their needed medication through the mail.   It is important to our voting system in this country because a lot of  voting is by mail, including in Ohio, where for many years we had  absentee voting that is no-fault absentee. We rely on our post office  to ensure our ballots get delivered on time.   This is an opportunity on a bipartisan basis to ensure the post  office remains strong. I hope we take advantage of it and pass this  legislation and have appropriate amendments in the meantime and get  this done in short order.   I yield the floor.
