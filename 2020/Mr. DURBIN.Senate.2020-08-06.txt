 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the news this morning about the actions  taken by Facebook and Twitter in relation to statements made by  President Trump is incredible. We now have a decision by these two  major sources of social media to draw down and to remove statements  made by the President of the United States on the issue of the national  health emergency which we currently face.   They believe--and certainly, on its face, it is clear--that these  statements by President Trump misrepresented medical fact in terms of  the immunity of children to COVID-19 and the state of play in America  when it comes to this pandemic.   The numbers 5 and 25 tell a real story. America has roughly 5 percent  of the world's population and, sadly, 25 percent of the COVID  infections in the world. How could a great and strong nation like ours  have reached this point where this medical crisis has reached a point  where many parts of America are facing recordbreaking infection levels?   Part of it has to do with the lack of leadership: a President who has  refused to acknowledge experts like Dr. Fauci and others, who, when  they say things that disappoint him, are banished from appearing on  television with him or making public statements in contradiction of his  bizarre point of view. We also know, as well, that the President has  downplayed, from the start, the threat of this COVID-19. One of the  reasons Facebook and Twitter removed his statements is that the  President continues to diminish the severity of this crisis.   We know, as well, that he has failed to tell us the truth and has  speculated on medical theories that are just pure quackery. Who can  forget the President's famous press conference talking about ingesting  disinfectants, his theories about ultraviolet lights, and this  hydroxychloroquine fantasy that he continues to enjoy telling the  American people? We know, as well, that he has failed to take action  when it was needed   Initially, Governors, including my own in the State of Illinois, were  desperate for the equipment that they  [[Page S5232]]  needed to protect healthcare workers and to save the lives of those who  were infected with the coronavirus. At this moment in time, many people  are asking me basic questions on my website. One of the questions from  a lady this morning said: Why is it that the United Kingdom has a rapid  test and we don't in the United States? I wish I could answer that, but  I can't.   The fact is, if you are taking a test to see if you are positive for  the coronavirus and the results aren't available for 5 days or even 12  days, they are almost pointless. At that point in time, it is just a  data point in history, not something that you could rely on in terms of  your own conduct.   How do the Republicans in the Senate explain the nonchalance many of  them have displayed when it comes to the challenges we face? This is  the worst national health crisis we have faced in 100 years. We know  that people are dying. Over 150,000 have died already in this country,  and we know that number is likely to grow.   Despite that, when it comes to putting money into testing, Democrats  have called for a dramatic investment to make that happen, and the  Republicans--just $16 billion for a nation that needs so much more.   When it comes to the economy, I can't understand the position of the  Republicans. They refuse to come forward with their own plan to rescue  our economy, to help unemployed families, and to put businesses back in  business, and they seem to lack a sense of urgency as to the situation  we currently face.   The American people take this situation very, very seriously. We have  recently done surveys and found that they overwhelmingly believe we  still have major challenges ahead, and they start with the coronavirus.  Why hasn't this President used the resources of this government to come  up with a quick, rapid-results test so that people can learn whether  they are positive for coronavirus in a quick fashion? We can't  realistically expect to open the economy or open our schools until we  have that available across the United States of America. Yet the  President doesn't seem to want to take on that responsibility.   For those who believe that we can say to the unemployed ``If you  would just work a little harder, you would find a job,'' they ought to  face the reality. The reality is we have four unemployed workers in  America for every job opening. The reality, as well, is that employers  who wish to fill their positions are doing it at a faster pace than at  any time. And this notion that if you are receiving an unemployment  check you are going to stay home and not go back to work--in the last  few months, of the people who have returned to work in America, 70  percent of them were being paid more on unemployment than they were on  the jobs that they returned to, but they wanted to get back to work.  They believe in work. They know that unemployment is a temporary help  and that they have to get back on their own feet as quickly as  possible. Plus, there are benefits to working. One of them is health  insurance, and many people returned to work to get back to the health  insurance that they particularly think is right for their family.   So why would the Republicans be suggesting a reduction in the weekly  benefit by some $400? They ought to sit down and talk to the people who  are receiving these unemployment checks, as I did last Friday in  Chicago. Let them tell their stories. What are they spending these  unemployment checks for? Overwhelmingly, the basics of life: food,  paying utility bills, rent and mortgage payments.   People aren't salting this money away. Almost half of the unemployed  in America have exhausted all of their savings. Some of them have  resorted to selling some piece of property they own, some goods or  articles that might raise enough money to help them pay their bills. It  is a desperate situation for the 30 million Americans who are  unemployed. I don't understand why the Republicans don't engage with us  in addressing this problem directly.   How can we possibly explain that, in the negotiation over the next  rescue package for America, we have the President's Chief of Staff; the  Secretary of the Treasury; the Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy  Pelosi; Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate; and two  empty chairs? Senator McConnell does not participate in this  negotiation, nor does Leader McCarthy from the Republicans in the  House.   They should be there. That is their job. This notion that they can  stand off on the sidelines and just criticize things that are being  discussed is not productive. America needs more. America needs a better  approach when it comes to this.   Another issue that comes up every time I open any conference call to  questioning from an audience is our Postal Service. In July, Postmaster  General DeJoy eliminated overtime for postal employees even though  parcel volumes were up almost 60 percent in June compared to last year.  Usually, about 20 percent of all the work by mail handlers, city  carriers, and postal drivers is done in overtime.   In the July memo announcing these operational changes, the new  Postmaster acknowledged that employees--listen to this quote--``may see  mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks . . . which is  not typical.'' Postmaster General DeJoy routinely compares the Postal  Service, a 245-year-old government agency that performs a service, to  U.S. Steel as an example of the need to adapt to the new market  realities. Postmaster DeJoy does not seem to understand that the Postal  Service is an essential service provided by the government, not a  luxury and certainly not a routine business.   Americans rely on the U.S. Postal Service to deliver needed packages,  medications, Social Security checks, and other benefits. Many small  businesses would absolutely fold if they couldn't use the U.S. Postal  Service and its daily operations, and rural Americans especially know  that many for-profit delivery services will not come to their addresses  in smalltown America. The Postal Service will be there.    We are less than 100 days from an election where mail-in ballots  delivered by the Postal Service will be vital to ensuring people of all  political persuasions that they can safely exercise their right to vote  while following public health experts' recommendations to reduce the  spread of COVID-19.   When contacted to schedule a call with the Postmaster General, his  office's response was this: ``Currently, he is not taking calls or  meetings as he is focusing on understanding the organization.''  Understanding the organization?   The Heroes Act that passed the House of Representatives 11 weeks ago  included $25 billion in emergency funding to cover revenue losses over  the next 2 years. I believe in the Postal Service, and I thank the  employees. My own mail carrier in my neighborhood back in Springfield,  Greg, works late hours, usually delivers our mail at 7 p.m. He tells me  he is delivering a lot of packages now. He said: Senator, I just  delivered a package of duct tape to one of your neighbors. I want to  make sure I deliver your mail every single day, as promised.   He is a dedicated public servant. You can tell it in his manner and  his gait and his attitude. He takes his job very, very seriously, and  he does it well, as so many do.   We need to support our Postal Service. This is not something we can  afford to skimp on at this moment in American history. I hope the  Republicans will join us in believing that the Postal Service is worth  an investment today, and I hope that we can include that in anything  that we move forward.   There is another provision I would hope to include in any rescue  package, and it addresses an issue that we all feel intensely. Across  America, many communities routinely face the harsh reality of too few  doctors or nurses, dentists, or behavioral health providers. It means  delayed healthcare in many communities, gaps in accessing lifesaving  services, and, ultimately, worse health outcomes, especially in low- income rural and urban areas.   Our Nation is projected to face a shortage of up to 120,000 doctors  within the next 10 years and a shortfall of hundreds of thousands of  nurses for each of the next several years. If you ask the question, you  will find that many hospitals and clinics in smalltown America resort  to contract nurses. These are nurses who are available in an emergency,  but they are expensive, sometimes charging two or  [[Page S5233]]  three times what a nurse is usually paid at the same place--and that  was before the coronavirus rampage across our Nation.   This pandemic has magnified these shortages in our system. In my  State of Illinois, Governor Pritzker had to call providers out of  retirement from other States to deliver surge care while fourth-year  medical students at the University of Illinois at Chicago were  graduated early so that they could go to work.   Over the past 6 months, America's healthcare workers have faced  incredible strains on the frontlines in our fight against the  coronavirus. Hundreds of healthcare workers have, tragically, died from  COVID-19, tens of thousands have been infected, and countless more  endured trauma and burnout from intense patient care.   The crisis has also compounded alarming health disparities for Black  and Latinx Americans, who are three times more likely to get sick and  die from COVID-19 than White patients. A lack of minority physicians  and health professionals of color contributes to this unconscionable  inequity. In 2018, only 4 percent of incoming medical students in  Illinois were Black men. A recent study found that there are fewer  Black male medical students today than there were in 1978. That is 42  years ago.   The simple economics of American medical education pose a barrier to  our health workforce needs. We take our most promising students, put  them through years of rigorous education and training, license them  after a backbreaking residency on one condition: They have to be  prepared to assume a student debt of, on average, more than $200,000 to  be a doctor in America.   The burden of paying off these loans steers some of our best and  brightest minds into higher paying specialties and communities, leaving  many areas with gaps and vulnerable to the challenges we are facing  today.   To address these health workforce challenges and medical disparities  and to bolster surge capacity for future emergencies, I have partnered  with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Together, we have introduced  Strengthening America's Health Care Readiness Act, immediately  restoring our pipeline of doctors, nurses, and other providers. How do  we do it? We provide scholarships and loan repayment funding through  the National Health Service Corps and Nurse Corps to those who commit  to serve in needy areas.   In 27 States, more than 70 percent of inpatient hospital beds are  full. One of the major issues with this capacity strain is the lack of  providers to actually staff these health units. Our bill would help to  surge tens of thousands of clinicians into these communities. To narrow  disparities that I mentioned earlier, our legislation would emphasize  recruitment from populations historically underrepresented in  healthcare, and our bill would enhance our emergency preparedness by  providing loan repayment for clinicians who serve in a reserve  capacity--similar to our National Guard--who could be deployed from the  private practice to serve in disaster locations.   Representative Schakowsky--Jan Schakowsky of Chicago--is our partner  in the House. We are pleased to have the support of the American  Medical Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the  National Association of Community Health Centers, and many more.   Senator Rubio and I are working to include this policy in the next  coronavirus relief package. We urge our colleagues to support it.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, in his powerful eulogy for Congressman  John Lewis, President Barack Obama described John Lewis as a man who  ``brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals.''  President Obama went on to say, ``And someday when we do finish that  long journey towards freedom, when we do form a more perfect union-- whether it's years from now or decades or even if it takes another two  centuries--John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer,  better America.'' Such a beautiful and fitting epitaph.   Another founder of that ``fuller, fairer, better America'' was the  Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian. C.T. Vivian and John Lewis departed this life  on the same day. The timing of their leaving is proof, perhaps, that  Mark Twain was right when he said that history does not repeat itself,  but sometimes it rhymes.   Who was C.T. Vivian? Martin Luther King called him ``the greatest  preacher ever to live.'' The Reverend Gerald Durley, who met C.T.  Vivian in 1960 when Durley was a member of the Nashville Student  Movement and who delivered the eulogy at his home going, called Dr.  Vivian ``the most patient impatient man'' he ever met. Patient with  people but impatient with injustice.   C.T. Vivian was mentor to John Lewis, Diane Nash, and many other  brave young civil rights activists a half century ago. Before they sat  at those segregated lunch counters or boarded those Freedom Rider  buses, Dr. Vivian taught them about the tactics--and the transformative  power--of nonviolent civil disobedience.   He was as a Baptist minister, an early civil rights organizer, and a  member of Martin Luther King's inner circle or advisers. As field  general for Dr. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference,  Dr. Vivian was the national director of some 85 local affiliate  chapters of the SCLC from 1963 to 1966, directing protest activities  and training in nonviolence, and coordinating voter registration and  community development projects.   He led passive protests through angry mobs and was beaten viciously  by segregationists, but he never once struck back. He received his  first beating in 1961 on a Freedom Ride to Mississippi. In 1964, a  white mob beat him with chains and nearly drowned him in the Atlantic  Ocean in St. Augustine, FL.   In Selma, AL, in 1965, 2 weeks before Bloody Sunday, Dr. Vivian was  trying to register Africa-American residents to vote when Sheriff Jim  Clark punched him in the mouth so hard that the blow sent the minister  reeling down the courthouse steps. Sheriff Clark then ordered deputies  to arrest him for ``criminal provocation.'' Television coverage of Dr.  Vivian being dragged away, blood streaming down his face, helped  galvanize the voting rights movement.   C.T. Vivian was a hero to all Americans, but many in my State feel a  special connection to him because of the formative years he spent among  us. He was, like many great Illinoisans, an adopted son of the Land of  Lincoln.   He was born Cordy Tindell Vivian in Boonville, Missouri, on July 30,  1924, the only child of Robert and Euzetta Tindell Vivian. His father  left the family when he was a baby. His mother lost the family farm in  the Depression and the family home in town to arson.   When C.T. was 6, he moved with this mother and maternal grandmother  to Macomb, Illinois. The women chose Macomb because its public schools  were integrated. They had great expectations for C.T. and they believed  in the power of education. C.T. Vivian joined his first protest in  Peoria, IL, in 1947, helping to desegregate a downtown cafeteria. In  many parts of Illinois at the time, segregation of public facilities  was not a law, but it was a custom rigidly enforced.   He first heard Dr. King speak in 1957, while studying for the  ministry at the American Baptist College in Nashville. In 1959, he met  th Reverend James Lawson, who was teaching nonviolent strategies to  members of the Nashville Student Movement, including a young John  Lewis.   After leaving the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1966,  Dr. Vivian returned to Illinois--this time to Chicago--to direct the  Urban Training Center for Christian Missions, where he trained clergy,  community leaders and others to organize. He worked to advance civil  rights and educational and economic opportunities for African  Americans, and to reduce the gang violence that ensnared to many young  Black men.   He left Chicago in 1972 to become dean of the Shaw University  Divinity School in Raleigh, NC. He moved to Atlanta later in the 1970s  and founded the C.T. Vivian Leadership Institute, to continue to train  the next generation of leaders in the principals and tactics of  nonviolent change.   In 2013, Dr. Vivian received the Presidential Medal of Freedom--our  Nation's highest civilian honor, from President Barack Obama. It was a  moving and historic moment and I was honored to be there.   He died on July 17, 2 weeks shy of his 96th birthday. He is buried in  Atlanta next to his fellow foot soldier for justice, Dr. King.   In the last calendar year, we have lost Elijah Cummings, the Reverend  Dr. Joseph Lowry, John Lewis and Dr. C.T. Vivian--all giants in the  civil rights movement. This is the passing of a great generation,  founders of the ``fuller, fairer, better America,'' as President Obama  said. As we mourn their passing, let us also give thanks for their  lives, and resolve to use the blueprints they left us to continue  towards a more perfect union.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1971, a young doctor named Babu Prasad  boarded a plane in his native India, headed for America. He was 24  years old and 1 year out of medical school. His first stop was Canton,  OH where he worked for a short while before moving to Chicago to  complete a residency in anesthesiology at the University of Illinois- Chicago.   He spent the following decade practicing medicine in Alabama before  returning to Illinois, this time to the Springfield area, where he  spent the next 18 years practicing anesthesiology at HSHS St. John's  Hospital before retiring in 2004.   Two weeks ago, this doctor who arrived in America as a young man with  no money announced that he was donating $1 million to HSHS St. John's  to support a major expansion of the hospital's neonatal intensive care  unit. An article in The State Journal-Register, Springfield's hometown  newspaper, called Dr. Prasad's gift his ``love letter to the hospital  and community.''   At a press conference announcing his donation, Dr. Prasad said  simply: ``I want to give back to a country that has given so much to my  family and me.''   ``Children are our future, so I wanted to direct by gift to the  neonatal intensive care unit, to give the babies a healthy start in  life,'' said Dr. Prasad.  [[Page S5263]]    Dr. Prasad and his wife, Dr. Sudah Prasad, an immunologist, have been  quiet and consistent donors to St. John's NICU over the years. Their  latest gift of $1 million will support a major expansion of St. John's  neonatal intensive care unit. The expansion, expected to be finished in  February, will more than double the size of the current NICU and  provide single-family patient rooms for premature and critically ill  infants.   As a father whose first baby came into this world with serious health  challenges, I have a sense of what such supportive accommodations will  mean to families of sick and fragile babies, and I am grateful to Dr.  Prasad for his generous support of this worthy cause.   St. John's was one of the first hospitals in Illinois to establish a  NICU for premature and critically ill infants. Each year, about 2,00  babies are born at St. John's, and about 700 babies from 35 Illinois  counties receive care in the hospital's NICU.   In announcing Dr. Prasad's donation, Beverly Neisler, chief  development officer for the HSHS St. John's Foundation said, ``Dr.  Prasad's gift is a beautiful testament as to who he is as a person. He  is a generous and kind man who has built a successful life through hard  work, dedication and determination. He means so much to us.''   ``A golden opportunity'' is how Dr. Prasad remembers his chance to  come to America nearly a half-century ago. ``It felt like heaven,'' he  says, nothing like India in the 1970s. At 24, he had never before seen  TV.   Nearly 50 years later, Dr. Prasad is a father of three and  grandfather of six. Two of his daughters have followed him into the  medical profession. Dr. Prasad himself continues to practice  anesthesiology and pain management 2 weeks each month at a private  medical practice in the Springfield area.   The current COVID crisis reminds us daily how much we depend on the  skills and sacrifices of fronteline medical workers and how many of  those medical workers are, like Dr. Prasad, immigrants. We are  fortunate and we are safer and healthier because they have chosen to  make America their home. On behalf of the families of Illinois, I want  to thank Dr. Prasad again for keeping two generations of Illinoisans  healthy and for his generous gift to future generations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
