 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to be with my distinguished colleague  from Michigan on this legislation, which is part of a package of bills  brought forward by the majority, which we believe undermine the ability  of Federal agencies to effectively promote the public interest.   To begin with, it is quite clear that this legislation is  unnecessary. Current law already bans the use of agency funds for  ``publicity or propaganda purposes.'' Current law also currently bars  agency employees from grassroots lobbying campaign designed to pressure  Members of Congress to support or to oppose agency proposals.   So, at the very least, all of this is duplicative, which wouldn't be  so bad just to add another level of red tape and legislation, except  for this: If you look at the legislation, under Restriction, part 2, it  says:   ``Any public communication issued by an Executive agency that refers  to a pending agency regulatory action, other than an impartial  communication that requests comment on or provides information  regarding the pending agency regulatory action, may not--   ``(A) directly advocate, in support of or against the pending agency  regulatory action, for the submission of information to form part of  the record of review for the pending agency regulatory action. . . .''   So let's parse that for a moment. What they are saying is that the  agency may not directly advocate to the public: Please tell us whether  you are for or against this regulation and why.   They are not trying to prevent a viewpoint-specific propaganda  intervention by the agency. This would actually stifle the ability of  the agency to solicit anybody's point of view to go out on Facebook and  ask, ``What is your position about this,'' and to use social media to  solicit the public's input.   So although the legislation masquerades as an attempt to promote  government transparency, it actually radically undercuts government  transparency and the ability of the agencies to solicit the widest  possible input.   It also says that the agency may not appeal to the public or solicit  a third party to undertake advocacy in support of or against the  pending agency regulatory action.   Now, I would have no problem if what they were trying to do is simply  restate the current ban on one-sided propaganda inquiries by an agency  to get one side to come out and support or oppose an agency rulemaking,  but that is already against the law.    What they are trying to do is to cut off the ability of the agency to  solicit any public input on all sides of the issue.   Why would we place that kind of duct tape over the Administrative  Procedure Act?   Well, one thought, if you look at this proposal in the context of  everything else they have brought forward this week, they want to try  to reduce everything to a cost-benefit analysis. That is, what would  the cost to polluters be? What would the cost to the violators of the  public interest be?   They never look at what the benefit to the public is of the  regulations, and they want to do it behind closed doors and then  prevent the agencies from going out and aggressively soliciting the  input of the public on all sides of the issue.   So we don't see what the need for this proposal is. We believe that  it will have a severely chilling effect on the ability of agencies to  do their job. They continually talk about one case, the WOTUS case, the  waters of the United States case, where I cheerfully and readily admit  that the agency went too far in terms of campaigning for its proposal.  But they were called on that. The GAO already determined that they ran  afoul of the prohibitions.   So they have one case which was dealt with completely legitimately  within the law, and they have not cited another case.   I would gladly yield my time to my distinguished colleague from  Michigan if he can invoke one other case where there was a problem or  explain why the resolution of this problem was not sufficient in this  case, because I think everybody understood that the agency had gone too  far. It was dealt with. The problem is over.   So now we have a so-called cure, which is far worse than the  underlying disease because the so-called cure is going to stifle and  chill the ability of every Federal agency in the United States  Government to go out and aggressively solicit public input. That is  what we want in the agency process.   Now, yesterday, they just voted to create a new roving  supercommission that would pore through the rules of all the different  Federal agencies and bring back a package and then ask us to give a  thumbs up or a thumbs down so they can just more readily dismantle  public regulation.   Let's be very clear about it. We're talking about regulation that  protects clean air. They rejected an amendment that would carve out the  Clean Air Act from that bill. We're talking about regulation that  protects clean water. We're talking about regulation that protects the  purity of our food and our drugs. We're talking about regulations that  advance our interests in a clean environment and reduces greenhouse gas  emissions.   So it seems like they want to put the whole Federal regulatory  process into a straitjacket, prevent the public from being involved,  and prevent the agencies from going out and soliciting public input.  That doesn't sound like giving government back to the people. That  sounds like giving government over to billionaires, special interests,  and big corporate powers that have all the lobbyists in Washington and  know how to get things done behind closed doors.   Mr. Chair, I invite my distinguished colleague from Michigan to  address any of the questions I have if there are any examples that he  can provide of problems that would yield the need for such a dramatic  shutdown on the ability of agencies to solicit public input.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, the advocates for the legislation returned to this one single  case, which we all agree about. The GAO ruled that the EPA ran afoul of  the prohibition on propaganda and on campaigning.   So the law worked there. The GAO blew the whistle on that. They  shouldn't be coming out on one side of an issue and running a  propaganda campaign. The government should not be engaged in  propaganda. We all agree to that.   This legislation does something completely different. This  legislation, rather than just saying a good day's work to the GAO for  blowing the whistle, it says: Now we are going to tell all the Federal  agencies and departments that have been out soliciting public input on  all sides of issues, saying there is a regulation that has come up  about clean air, about clean water, about food, about drugs, about the  disposal of nuclear waste, about radioactive materials, and it tells  them you can't do that anymore. You can't go out and solicit public  input.   It places a complete chill on the ability of the government to go out  and invite public participation in our government. Why? They keep  returning to one case where the GAO blew the whistle where everybody  agrees they were out of bounds.   A flag was thrown on the play, but now they want to use that in order  to essentially impose a gag rule on Federal agencies across the land  who are doing our work. The much reviled regulation that the agencies  are engaged in is an attempt to flesh out the laws that we pass in this  body because we don't want to be setting all of the particular rules  about exactly how many pollutants can be in this water, in this  [[Page H1472]]  stream, in this river, in this creek, and so on, because we are not  scientific experts on how many pollutants can be put into the air here  and there. So it is delegated to government agencies.   But when they go through the Administrative Procedure Act and they  have a rule and comment process, they should be able to go out and  invite the public to participate.   Again, I invite my distinguished and thoughtful colleagues on the  other side to cite one other case. Can they cite one case where the GAO  did not blow the whistle? Can they cite some other litany of examples  where there has been a real problem with government agencies being  overzealous where it has not been corrected by the GAO?   The silence is deafening.   They have used the example of one problem that was caught, that was  corrected, in order to try to demolish the ability of Federal agencies  to go out and solicit the public's input.   To me, that is a familiar experience now, because I have been in the  House of Representatives for just 2 months, and, in the committees I  serve on, we continue to vote on bills where we have not had a single  public hearing. We are not hearing from any of the groups.   I have a letter here objecting to this legislation that has been  signed by the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, American Association for Justice,  American Association of University Women, Americans for Financial  Reform, Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, Autistic Self Advocacy  Network, BlueGreen Alliance, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean  Water Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America,  Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, Demand Progress,  Earthjustice, Economic Policy Institute, Environment America,  Environmental Working Group, Food & Water Watch, Greenpeace, Homeowners  Against Deficient Dwellings, Institute for Agriculture and Trade  Policy, International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace, and  Agricultural Implement Workers, League of Conservation Voters, National  Association of Consumer Advocates, and on and on and on.   I would like to have heard from these people in this process, but it  seems like all we are getting from the other side is an attempt to have  a curtain of darkness fall over all public process. We would like to  have hearings. We want groups to be involved. But these people were not  invited to testify. They didn't have a chance to opine on this.   Mr. Chair, in general, the problem here is that, rather than making  government more transparent, we are making government more opaque.  Rather than making government more open, we are making government  more closed. Rather than reaching out to the public and inviting it  into the rulemaking process, we are shutting the door and closing the  blinds on it.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think we are finally having some light here on the  subject.   My distinguished colleague and fellow freshman from Michigan is most  concerned about what did take place in the Waters of the United States  case. He praises the GAO for responding to Senator Inhofe's inquiry.   We all agree that the GAO determined that the EPA ran afoul of  existing prohibitions in law on propaganda, on taking a side in an  issue. A flag was called on the play and the problem was dealt with.   If you find a kid shoplifting a candy bar, and you catch him, you  remove him from the store, you tell him not to do it again. You don't  then go pass a law saying that anybody under 18 cannot enter any  commercial establishment in the country. The law worked in that  specific case.   But, you see, they have taken a sledgehammer to a mosquito, and the  mosquito was already killed. So now what they are busting up is the  ability of agencies across the country simply to use the social media  to go out and to solicit and invite public input into the rulemaking  process. What are we afraid of?   Justice Brandeis said that sunshine is the great disinfectant. We  want the public involved. We want the public's engagement.   So, again, I invite my thoughtful colleagues on the other side to  cite one case of an agency doing this that was not dealt with by the  GAO. I can cite you countless examples of cases where Federal agencies  have gone online to invite public input in a completely objective and  neutral way. Now we are creating a chill over that process because of  this ban on soliciting advocacy from the public on either side of the  issue.   So I simply don't get it, and I am puzzled why they continually talk  about one case which was happily resolved under existing law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record several letters  opposing the bill.                                                        Coaltion for                                             Sensible Safeguards,                                                  February 28, 2017.      Re House floor vote of H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity           Act.         Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards       (CSS), an alliance of over 150 labor, scientific, research,       good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and       public interest groups, strongly oppose H.R. 1004, the       Regulatory Integrity Act.        The bill is a brazen attack on the public's right to know       by micro-managing the type of information that agencies are       allowed to communicate to all of us when taking actions to       protect the public, our economy, and the environment. An open       government that prioritizes democratic public participation       requires agencies to be able to effectively convey       information to the public and make agency policy positions       clear to the public. This bill will make our government less       open and less democratic and should therefore be rejected.        H.R. 1004 will significantly inhibit federal agencies'       ability to engage and inform the public in a meaningful and       transparent way regarding its work on important science-based       rulemakings that will greatly benefit the public. As a       result, the bill will lead to  [[Page H1473]]       decreased public awareness and participation in the       rulemaking process in direct contradiction of the       Administrative Procedure Act and agencies' authorizing       statutes, which specifically provide for broad stakeholder       engagement.        Substantial ambiguities in the bill threaten to create       uncertainty and confusion among agencies about what public       communications are permissible, and thus risks discouraging       them from keeping the public apprised of the important work       that they do on its behalf. In an era when agencies should be       increasingly embracing innovative 21st century communications       technologies needed to reach the public, including social       media, H.R. 1004 sends exactly the wrong message.        The legislation strictly prohibits agencies from issuing       ``public communications'' that ``emphasize the importance''       of a particular agency action unless the communication has       the ``clear purpose of informing the public of the substance       or status'' of the particular action. The legislation applies       to a wide swath of regulatory actions including rulemakings,       guidance, policy statements, directives and adjudications.        While H.R. 1004 assumes that the distinction between       informing the public of an agency action and emphasizing the       importance of that action is self-evident, in practice the       distinction is anything but clear. As a result, agencies are       likely to avoid any public communications that risk running       afoul of this ambiguous prohibition, no matter how       informative the communication might be for the public.        For example, various executive orders and statutes compel       agencies to conduct cost-benefit analysis on their pending       rulemakings, and thus to determine whether the rule's       benefits outweigh its costs. As currently written, the       Regulatory Integrity Act could potentially prohibit an agency       from communicating the results of such an analysis when it       concludes that a particular rule generates net benefits.       After all, that conclusion is tantamount to declaring that       the rule makes society better off on balance. Instead, the       agency would likely be forced to simply share the basic       information that they had conducted a cost-benefit analysis       of the regulation without being able to share the further       crucial information that the regulation's benefits exceeded       the costs. Given that many of the bill's sponsors       enthusiastically endorse the expanded use of cost-benefit       analysis in the rulemaking process, these kinds of arbitrary       prohibitions on communications concerning cost-benefit       analysis seem especially peculiar.        Agencies would encounter this problematic scenario when       deciding to share vital information, such as:        How many lives would be saved by a regulation;        How much property damage would be averted;        How much money consumers would save; and        Any of the other myriad public benefits that regulations       are designed to provide.        The stark absence of any clear bright-lines in the       legislation delineating what is and what is not prohibited       public communications is sure to have a chilling effect on       agencies, with the predictable result that agencies will be       less willing to share crucial information with the public and       that the public will be less informed about government       activities.        H.R. 1004 also will severely impede, rather than enable,       agency use of new communication technologies, most notably       social media platforms, to reach the public. Regulatory       experts and scholars agree that agencies should be using       social media forums and platforms.        Agencies will find it difficult, if not impossible, to       communicate with the public through social media under H.R.       1004 since the bill prevents any usage of social media that       both conveys information about a regulatory action but also       promotes the importance of that action.        For example, the U.S. Department of Interior operates a       Twitter and Instagram account that is very popular with the       public because it regularly features photos of beautiful       landscapes and wildlife from national parks across the United       States. Under the Regulatory Integrity Act, the Department       might be prohibited from posting such photos on Twitter and       Instagram because they are not solely informational in nature       and could be interpreted as promoting the importance of the       department's work in environmental and wildlife preservation.        Enactment of H.R. 1004 will lead to less transparency in       the government, make it more difficult for agencies to use       new communication technologies popular with the public, and       generally chill agency communications with the public on       important matters due to the lack of any bright-line       standards for agencies to follow.        We strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 1004, the Regulatory       Integrity Act.            Sincerely,                                                Robert Weissman,                                                          President,      Public Citizen Chair.                                   ____                                    League of Conservation Voters,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Re Oppose H.R. 998, 1004, & 1009--Assaults on Environmental           Safeguards in the Guise of ``Regulatory Reform.''      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,       the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn       environmental values into national, state, and local       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters       nationwide, and the media.        LCV urges you to vote NO on H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, H.R.       1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and H.R. 1009, the OIRA       Insight, Reform, And Accountability Act. LCV joins our       partners in the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an       alliance of consumer, public health, labor, good government,       environmental, and scientific groups--in strongly opposing       this trio of extreme bills that have far-reaching and       damaging consequences for vital public health and       environmental safeguards.        H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, would jeopardize critical       environmental safeguards that have been in place for decades       and would make it extremely difficult to develop new       standards in response to threats to public health and the       environment. This legislation creates a regulatory review       commission that would disregard the public benefits of       environmental safeguards and only consider the costs to       industries. By creating a misguided ``cut-go'' system for       safeguards, this bill would result in key public health       protections being eliminated.        H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act, would       significantly hinder communications between federal agencies       and the public and would discourage agencies from using       social media platforms. This legislation would reduce       government transparency and would leave the public less       informed about government activities. The vague guidelines       about what public communications are allowed would result in       agencies being less willing to share key information with the       public.        H.R. 1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, And Accountability       Act, would endanger clean air and clean water protections by       opening them up to more litigation. The bill would       effectively rewrite dozens of laws in which Congress mandated       that agencies prioritize public health, safety and the       preservation of clean air and water over concerns about       industry profits.        LCV urges you to REJECT H.R. 998, 1004, & 1009 and will       strongly consider including votes on these bills in the 2017       Scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,      President.                                   ____         Good Morning Everyone: I am writing to express the       opposition of the American Association for Justice (AAJ) to       the three anti regulation bills that will be voted on on the       House floor this week. The Searching for and Cutting       Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017       (SCRUB Act); The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017; and the       OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act all impede the       ability of federal agencies to appropriately protect the       health, safety and well-being of the American public. As a       result, we urge your boss to vote NO on all three bills. See       below and attached for additional information on each bill.       Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.                                                   Sarah Rooney,                                     Director of Regulatory Affairs,                                  American Association for Justice.                          H.R. 998, The SCRUB Act         The SCRUB Act would establish a new regulatory review       commission charged with identifying duplicative and/or       redundant regulations to repeal. In addition, the bill       provides for a blanket percentage reduction in the cumulative       regulatory cost to industry without adequately considering       the benefits bestowed upon the public by these same       regulations. Under the severe SCRUB Act regulatory cost       considerations, targeted regulations could be repealed even       when the benefits of these rules are significant, appreciated       by the public, and far outweigh the costs.        The SCRUB Act also contains entirely ineffective cut-go       provisions. Under the bill's cut-go provisions, an agency       would be required to remove an existing regulation of equal       or greater cost from its cut-go list before it can issue a       new regulation. As a result of these provisions, agencies       will be unable to respond to any emerging hazard with any new       public regulatory protections or guidance.              H.R. 1004, The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017         The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 significantly limits       the types of communications federal agencies can have with       the public regarding pending regulatory actions and prohibits       agencies from soliciting support for its regulatory actions.       These inappropriately restrictive provisions have two goals:       stymieing important public protections and preventing the       public from knowing about the positive impact pending       regulations may provide.        H.R. 1009, The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act         Lastly, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act       creates yet another duplicative and unnecessary commission to       provide for the repeal of regulations, while also providing       for numerous additional hurdles in the regulatory review       process. It would codify the numerous burdensome regulatory       review requirements and make them subject to judicial review       which would provide for extensive challenge and delay of       important protections. More concerning, this bill would  [[Page H1474]]       severely damage the impact of dozens of Congressionally       passed public interest laws that require agencies to       prioritize public health and safety and protecting the       environment and instead focus on cost to industry. It also       would make federal agency science much more vulnerable to       judicial review. Lastly, the bill would effectively undermine       Congressionally chartered independent agencies by putting       them under the influence of the Office of the President.     Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for his thoughtful  presentation and thank the Chair for his indulgence.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I do want to express my opposition to this  amendment because it is perfectly duplicative, and it does nothing to  cure  [[Page H1477]]  the very serious deficiencies in the underlying bill. Executive Order  13563, which was issued by President Obama, requires each agency to  ``periodically review existing significant regulations to determine  whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded,  or repealed, so as to make the agency's regulatory program more  effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.''   Because there is little doubt that this executive order covers the  review and elimination of duplicative and overlapping regulatory  actions, there is no need for the additional reporting requirements  that this amendment would redundantly impose. More importantly, this  amendment simply fails to address the profound flaws in the underlying  bill. It fails to provide the bright lines for what an agency can  communicate to the public safely within the stringent new guidelines.  It fails to eliminate the unnecessarily burdensome and onerous  requirements in the bill that seem to have no purpose but to reduce the  amount of information agencies would be able to release to the public  and invite from the public.                                time  1000    The amendment fails to eliminate the prohibition against agencies  making public communications that directly advocate for or oppose the  submission of public comments or expert analysis of a pending rule. The  amendment fails to remove the serious impediments this bill places in  the way of agency use of social media platforms. Most importantly, the  amendment does nothing to cure the serious chilling effect that the  bill would have on agency communications and the negative effects that  this imposition would have on the ability of agencies to educate  millions of Americans about the costs and benefits of a particular  regulation and to invite their input into the rulemaking process.   Because the amendment does nothing to improve the flaws of this bill  and is duplicative of work that agencies are already required to do, I  urge all Members to oppose this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise only to note the remarkable irony of  the gentleman making an argument for the reduction of duplicative  regulations by adding another duplicative regulation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this redundant and duplicative and, again,  chilling amendment will only add more red tape, divert the time of  agency officials to produce more paperwork that is unnecessary, and  point us right back to the central flaw of the legislation.   My distinguished opponents have mobilized all of one case to  demonstrate the necessity of this legislation, and it was a case which  was properly resolved by the GAO, and everybody agrees to it. So I  understand the urge to get up and say we need more legislation to do  what we have already been able to accomplish under existing law, I  understand that everybody wants to make a point about the righteousness  of legislative change, but sometimes we just don't need another law.  The law works as it was. We don't need another law.   And again, I am just impressed by the irony of saying we need another  law to eliminate excessive and redundant regulation when the current  law already does it. It is almost like a caricature of what we do here  in Congress.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, a regime of fear has descended on the Federal  workforce, and I have got 88,000 Federal employees in my district.   If they insist on this legislation--unnecessary, redundant,  confusing, and chilling--at the very least, we must pass the  gentlewoman's amendment to say that it does not trench on the First  Amendment rights of our citizens who are simply exercising in a  viewpoint-neutral, in a content-neutral way the determination of the  agencies to solicit public input.   You say you support on your side the input of the public. You say you  support the intent of the amendment. Let's accept the amendment, and  let's all embrace the First Amendment together.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
