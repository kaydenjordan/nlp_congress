 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee, and a representative from the New South that President Jimmy  Carter symbolized, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5472, the ``Jimmy  Carter National Historical Park Redesignation Act,'' bipartisan  legislation that elevates the designation of the Jimmy Carter National  Historical Site to accurately reflect its status in the National Park  System and accord with a standard pattern of nomenclature.   National historical parks are typically areas of greater physical  extent and complexity than national historic sites; often they contain  multiple discontiguous sites.   According to the National Park Service, the Jimmy Carter National  Historic Site, which was established by Congress in 1987, is comprised  of facilities at several sites in and around the town of Plains,  Georgia and has the characteristics that make the designation of  ``national historical park'' a more appropriate title than ``national  historic site.''   Congress passed the legislation in 1987 to preserve the key sites and  structures associated with President Jimmy Carter during his life,  provide for the interpretation of the life and presidency of Jimmy  Carter, and present the history of a small rural southern town.   The historic site consists of President Carter's boyhood home in the  community of Archery; Plains High School, now used for a visitor center  and headquarters for the historic site; the Plains depot, which was  used as a headquarters for Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign; and  the Carter compound, where President and Mrs. Carter have resided since  1981.   It is therefore fitting and proper that we pass this bipartisan  legislation, supported unanimously by the Georgia congressional  delegation, designating this complex of historically significant places  as the ``Jimmy Carter National Historical Park,'' in honor of the 39th  President of the United States, whose post-presidency is universally  regarded as the greatest and most consequential in history.   Madam Speaker, Jimmy Carter was little known outside the South before  he became president and I vividly recall his acceptance speech in July  1976 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which he began by  saying simply: ``My name is Jimmy Carter and I'm running for  president.''   It was at that convention that the great Congresswoman Barbara  Jordan, who held the seat I now hold, made history by being the first  African American woman to give the keynote address at a major political  party nominating convention.   Madam Speaker, it is perhaps a failing of all us that we do not  acknowledge nearly enough the enormous achievements and contributions  to our country of the Carter Administration.   Let me list briefly some of the enormous positive changes wrought by  President Carter, this most moral of public men was awarded the Medal  of Freedom in addition to being the 2002 recipient of the Nobel Peace  Prize.  [[Page H7251]]    During his administration, President Carter signed into law many  legislative proposals that have changed our lives for the better and  made living in America safer, more affordable, fairer, and better.   For example, President Carter signed into law the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, known as the  Superfund Act (Pub. L. 96-510).   The U.S. Department of Energy was created in 1977 with the enactment  of Department of Energy Organization Act, signed into law as Pub. L.  95-91.   The U.S. Department of Education was created in 1979 with the  enactment of Department of Education Organization Act, signed into law  as Pub. L. 96-88.   Airline travel was deregulated, making it affordable for millions of  Americans to travel by air for the first time with the passage of the  Airline Deregulation Act, Pub. L. 95-504.   Under President Carter, both the trucking and rail industry were  deregulated leading to reduced shipping costs and lower prices for  consumers with the signing of the Motor Carrier Act, Pub. L. 96-296,  and the Staggers Rail Act, Pub. L. 96-448.   Madam Speaker, a little recalled fact is that under the Carter  Administration, 9.8 million jobs were created, more than any president  from Nixon until Clinton, thanks to economic legislation like the  Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, signed into law as the Full  Employment and Balanced Growth Act (Pub. L. 95-523) and Comprehensive  Employment and Training Act Amendments (Pub. L. 95-524.   A full listing of the important laws signed by President Carter would  take more time than we have available but includes the Civil Service  Reform Act, Pub. L. 95-454, which created the Office of the Inspector  General, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Pub.  L. 96-487, which designated certain public lands in Alaska as units of  the National Park, National Wildlife Refuge, Wild and Scenic Rivers,  National Wilderness Preservation and National Forest Systems, resulting  in 79.54 million acres of refuge land in Alaska, of which 27.47 million  acres were designated as wilderness.   President Carter was the first president to express to the nation the  interrelation between national security and energy independence and to  take action to enhance both, with the passage of the:   1. National Energy Act, Pub. L. 95-617 through 621,   2. Emergency Natural Gas Act, Pub. L. 95-2,   3. Reorganization Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-17,   4. Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act, Pub. L. 96-223, and   5. Energy Security Act, Pub. L. 96-294.   Other major legislation signed into law by President Carter were the  Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, Pub. L.  96-221; the Trade Agreements Act, Pub. L. 96-39, and the Panama Canal  Treaties.   In the areas of foreign affairs and national security, President  Carter deescalated and normalized diplomatic relations with China,  brokered the historic Camp David Accord between Israel and Egypt, and  hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union by supporting the mujahideen  as it fought to repel and defeat the invading forces of the Soviet  Union.   President Carter proudly and firmly made promotion and protection of  human rights a cornerstone of American foreign policy and made clear  that the United States would not overlook or tolerate human rights  abuses, whether committed by adversary or ally, which helped hasten the  end of apartheid in South Africa and authoritarian governments in South  and Latin America.   President Carter appointed the first woman of color to a cabinet  position when he chose the Hon. Patricia Roberts Harris as his  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and then as Secretary of  Health and Human Services.   It was President Carter who appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the  federal judiciary when he nominated her to be a judge of the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1980.   It was President Carter who appointed Stephen Breyer to the federal  judiciary when he nominated him for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the First Circuit in 1980.   In fact, when President Carter took office, just eight women had ever  been appointed to one of the 500 federal judgeships in the country, he  doubled that number and appointed 40 women, including eight women and  33 men of color.   President Carter changed the face of the federal judiciary to make it  more representative of the American people and set the example which  Presidents Clinton and Obama followed.   After leaving office, President Carter embarked on an energetic and  tireless post-presidency, founding in 1982 the Carter Presidential  Center at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which is devoted to  issues relating to democracy and human rights.   Most everyone has seen Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter working with Habitat  for Humanity International building housing and helping underprivileged  persons realize the dream of home ownership.   President Carter has served as a freelance ambassador for a variety  of international missions, including mediating disputes between  countries, observing elections in nations with histories of fraudulent  voting processes, and advising presidents on Middle East issues.   He has also made time to be a prolific author, writing more than 30  books, including Keeping Faith: Memoirs of a President (1983), Turning  Point (1992), and An Hour Before Daylight (2001).   The United States and the world are better off because Jimmy Carter  emerged from humble origins to become the 39th President of the United  States.   Not bad for a Georgia peanut farmer, Annapolis graduate, and nuclear  submariner, not bad at all.   I strongly support this bipartisan legislation and urge all Members  to join me in voting to pass H.R 5472, the ``Jimmy Carter National  Historical Park Redesignation Act.''   God bless President Carter, and the United States of America.    Madam Speaker, I thought about every day I would  rise to emphasize the number of Americans who have died in the last 24  hours because of COVID-19, some 3,000-plus; 300,000 Americans have  already died, a half a million are expected to lose their life by the  beginning of the year.   It is crucial that we, without ceasing, pass a COVID-19 package that  includes a lifeline for families that are trying to survive: cash  payment; unemployment; more money for vaccines; more testing; more  money to stop evictions; more money for small businesses, restaurants,  and our transportation community.   But more importantly, children are losing parents. And the holiday  season is coming, and many are not even thinking about another surge  like we had from Thanksgiving.   Madam Speaker, I beg of America to prayerfully commemorate,  celebrate, love this holiday season, but it should be a skinny season  to save lives.   Save lives.   And we must pass a COVID-19 package, not leave until we get it done.   Americans are dying, and that means that we have to stand up, and  stand up for them, and I am here on the floor to stand up for them.                            ____________________
