 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the barbaric terrorist attacks of  October 7 have elicited two sorts of reactions in the West. Most  reasonable people have responded to the slaughter of innocent Israelis  with utter horror, fervent prayer, and strong support for Israel's  right to defend itself.   The overwhelming majority of Americans think the United States should  publicly support our closest ally in the Middle East. They recognize  this moment as a time for choosing, and they see the choice between a  democracy's right to self-defense and a terrorist group's obsession  with destroying it as an easy choice.   The United States must have Israel's back as it roots out the  terrorists who threaten it. For as long as it takes, I am proud to  stand with this overwhelming majority.   But, alas, in recent days, we have also seen just how the default  position in some highly influential corners of our society--from  national newsrooms to elite college campuses--how quickly they have  been to blindly amplify terrorists' versions of events.   This was especially true of the reporting of a deadly explosion at a  Gaza hospital yesterday. Hamas immediately blamed Israel for the blast,  and major news organizations took their word for it, running headlines  about an ``Israeli strike.'' In the hours since this tragedy, credible  evidence has emerged suggesting that the same terrorists who used  innocent civilians as human shields were themselves responsible. Well,  the media can revise its headlines, but the shameful anti-Semitic  fringe of our society has already heard what it wanted to hear.   Unsurprisingly, the woke incubators of the Ivy League have been at  the epicenter of this anti-Israel outrage. One coalition of 30 student  groups at Harvard declared that they ``hold the Israeli regime entirely  responsible'' for Hamas's terrorism--that Israel is responsible for  Hamas's terrorism.   Now, student radicals taking extremist stands is par for the course.  The more important question is how university administrators--the  supposed grownups on campus--would respond. The answer is not good. As  former Harvard President Larry Summers rightly noted, his institution's  initial silence ceded the field to campus extremists in defining  Harvard's response.   And when Harvard's leaders did respond, they failed the most basic  test: distinguishing the victim from the aggressor. The university's  response professed heartbreak at ``the war in Israel and Gaza now under  way,'' as if there were even a shred of moral equivalence between  terrorism and self-defense.   The presidents of Columbia and Dartmouth expressed regret at ``the  ensuing violence'' and ``the escalating violence,'' respectively. Not  to be outdone, Notre Dame didn't even assign perfunctory blame to the  terrorists.   Instead, they bemoaned ``the outbreak of war in the Holy Land'' and  calling ``for an end to the cycle of violence.''   I am reminded of a retort the late, great Bill Buckley deployed in a  debate when his opponent tried to have both sides of the Cold War. He  said:         That is like saying that the man who pushes a little old       lady into the path of a bus is morally equivalent to the man       who pushes her out of its path, because they both push little       old ladies around.    If you want to know where this leads, take the American Bar  Association, the organization that accredits our Nation's law schools.  At first, the ABA's president called ``on both sides to show  restraint'' and urged Israel and Hamas to ``settle their disputes in a  peaceful and legal fashion.'' But yesterday, the ABA denounced Israel's  self-defense efforts as ``collective punishment, forced displacement,  [and] ethnic cleansing.''   Terrorism and self-defense are not morally equivalent. They are not  morally equivalent. And you would think the leaders of America's higher  education would understand that.   Some leaders in higher education have argued in recent days that  schools should not wade into political disputes. Stanford's president  said that doing so means picking winners and losers on campus.  Northwestern's president observed of his students and faculty that  ``for me to speak for them displaces their own freedom to speak.'' That  may actually be a wise policy, but it is certainly not one elite  academia has been known to practice in the past. It doesn't take long  to find the impassioned stances universities took following the murder  of George Floyd or the ending of DACA. So why the new policy?   Let's be clear. Some university leaders have displayed admirable  conviction. Our former colleague Ben Sasse at the University of Florida  describes support for the terrorists who murdered Israeli children as  ``sickening'' and ``dehumanizing.'' Emory's president said the attacks  ``must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.'' Princeton's  president called it ``among the most atrocious of terrorist acts'' and,  importantly, placed the blame for the coming war entirely where it  belongs--on Hamas's shoulders.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of these statements-- the good, the bad, and the ugly--be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as fallows:                           University of Florida         Dear Jewish Gator Alums: Many of you have reached out about       the vigil at UF last night. I was overwhelmed to see a       thousand Gators standing with Israel. You can find my remarks       here.        The chaos at the event was an unfortunate end to a       beautiful gathering, but I wanted to let you know that there       was no attack on campus and the injuries that have been       reported seem to be relatively minor. From what we can       gather, a student passed out and, when a fellow student       called for 911, other students--understandably on edge--fled.        While we all wish the night had ended differently, we are       tremendously proud of the students who came to stand with       Israel. I hope Rabbi Jonah and Rabbi Berl reschedule the       vigil, and I hope the community reconvenes.        Like you, I am tremendously grateful for our students. The       University of Florida is home to the largest number of Jewish       students at any university in this country. We are honored by       and committed to that legacy. Our Jewish students and alumni       around the world have been devastated by Hamas' terrorism.        I will not tiptoe around this simple fact: What Hamas did       is evil and there is no defense for terrorism. This shouldn't       be hard. Sadly, too many people in elite academia have been       so weakened by their moral confusion that, when they see       videos of raped women, hear of a beheaded baby, or learn of a       grandmother murdered in her home, the first reaction of some       is to ``provide context'' and try to blame the raped women,       beheaded baby, or the murdered grandmother. In other       grotesque cases, they express simple support for the       terrorists.        This thinking isn't just wrong, it's sickening. It's       dehumanizing. It is beneath people called to educate our next       generation of Americans. I am thankful to say I haven't seen       examples of that here at UF, either from our faculty or our       student body.        As for us, our educational mission here begins with the       recognition and explicit acknowledgment of human dignity--the       same human dignity that Hamas' terrorists openly scorn. Every       single human life matters. We are committed to that truth. We       will tell that truth.        In the coming days, it is possible that anti-Israel       protests will come to UF's campus. I have told our police       chief and administration that this university always has two       foundational commitments: We will protect our students and we       will protect speech. This is always true: Our Constitution       protects the rights of people to make abject idiots of       themselves.        But I also want to be clear about this: We will protect our       Jewish students from violence. If anti-Israel protests come,       we will absolutely be ready to act if anyone dares to       escalate beyond peaceful protest. Speech is protected--      violence and vandalism are not.        I'm grateful to have heard from so many of you. Like I said       at the vigil last night: When evil raises its head, as it has       in recent days, it is up to men and women of conscience and       courage to draw strength from truth and commit ourselves to       the work of building something better--to the work of       pursuing justice and pursuing peace. That is what we aim to       do through education, compassion, and truth here at the       University of Florida.            Sincerely,      Ben.                                   ____                               Emory University         Dear Emory Community: As students return to campus this       morning after fall break, I know many at Emory are in       profound pain,  [[Page S5058]]       absorbing the shock and grief from the Hamas terrorist       attacks in Israel over the weekend. So am I. The reality of       Jews being senselessly murdered and taken as hostages will       not soon leave my mind, and must be condemned in the       strongest possible terms.        We are fortunate that Emory students and faculty in the       region are safe at this time. I have heard from many members       of our community about how the attacks have affected them and       their families and friends. The suffering they are       experiencing is tremendous. I know they are not alone.        In June, I traveled to Israel with a delegation of Emory       colleagues. We visited with Emory students studying and       interning, alumni who live and work in the region, and       scholars at universities in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. It was my       first trip back to Israel in 40 years and as a Jew, it       offered me an opportunity to visit a homeland that is       meaningful to my family across generations. To see the nation       where I walked peacefully a few months ago now under attack       is hard to comprehend. Acknowledging that a war has begun and       more lives, both Israeli and Palestinian, will be lost to       this conflict fills me with grief.        Each member of our community is experiencing this tragedy       in their own way. As we move forward, we must show empathy       for one another. My wish is for Emory to come together       peacefully, and I see that we are already doing that with       student-led vigils and memorials. I also urge you to treat       your peers and colleagues with dignity as difficult       conversations take place. As a research university, we are       fortunate to have scholars who have deep expertise on the       Middle East, Israel, and relevant disciplines. Our faculty       experts will be invaluable at this time.        The students, faculty, physicians, staff, and alumni who       call Emory home come from all over the world and represent       many backgrounds and life experiences. Emory's motto, the       wise heart seeks knowledge, is based on an understanding that       we treat each other with respect even, and especially, in       moments of disagreement. That is my plea to you in the coming       days--seek knowledge but do so in a way that acknowledges our       shared humanity. That's what unity looks like at Emory.        Treat each other well and keep your minds and hearts open.       Pray for peace.            Sincerely,                                                 Gregory L. Fenves,      President.                                   ____                             Princeton University         Even in a world wearied and torn by violence and hatred,       Hamas's murder and kidnapping of hundreds of Israelis over       the past weekend is among the most atrocious of terrorist       acts. This cruel and inhumane attack has provoked a bloody       war that has already claimed the lives of thousands of       Palestinians and Israelis and will tragically take many more       as it continues.        Princeton is a community that embraces many Israelis and       Palestinians among its cherished members, as students,       faculty, staff, and alumni. Even more have friends or       relatives directly experiencing this awful violence. The       nightmare underway in Israel and in the Palestinian       territories is being deeply felt on this campus. That pain       will inevitably continue in the months ahead. My heart goes       out to everyone personally affected.        The University has reached out to students and other       community members from Israel and the Palestinian       territories. Resources and support services are available       from the Davis International Center, Counseling and       Psychological Services, and the Office of Religious Life.        Our experts at the School of Public and International       Affairs have produced a thoughtful compilation of initial       analysis and there will be many more such scholarly       contributions and public panel discussions about these events       in the coming days.        Of course, our work as researchers and teachers must also       make space for the recognition of suffering, and for time to       grieve and heal. I hope that Princetonians from all       backgrounds will treat each other with grace and compassion       during this difficult time.       Christopher L. Eisgruber.                                   ____                                  Notre Dame         Given the current situation in Israel, we have relocated       our students who were studying in Jerusalem to other Notre       Dame International locations. We will continue to support our       relocated students and ensure that their transitions are as       smooth as possible. We have temporarily suspended our study       abroad program at Tantur and will continue to assess the       situation as it develops.        Saddened by the outbreak of war in the Holy Land, I join       with many in abhorring the killing of non-combatants and I       echo the Holy Father's call to pray for all victims of the       current conflict, for an end to the cycle of violence, and       for a lasting peace with justice. I welcome all of our Notre       Dame family to join us for this evening's interfaith prayer       service for peace and protection of the innocent.                                   ____                              Harvard University         Dear Members of the Harvard Community: We write to you       today heartbroken by the death and destruction unleashed by       the attack by Hamas that targeted citizens in Israel this       weekend, and by the war in Israel and Gaza now under way.        The violence hits all too close to home for many at       Harvard. Some members of our community have lost family       members and friends; some have been unable to reach loved       ones. And, even for people at Harvard who have not been       affected directly by the fighting, there are feelings of       fear, sadness, anger, and more that create a heavy burden. We       have heard from many students, faculty, and staff about the       emotional toll that these events are taking.        Across Harvard, we will continue providing as much support       to our students and colleagues as possible. Our Schools       either have shared or will soon share messages regarding       available resources.        We have also heard an interest from many in understanding       more clearly what has been happening in Israel and Gaza. Even       as we attend immediately to the needs of our community       members, we can take steps as an academic community to deepen       our knowledge of the unfolding events and their broader       implications for the region and the world. We expect there       will be many such opportunities in the coming days and weeks.        We have no illusion that Harvard alone can readily bridge       the widely different views of the Israeli-Palestinian       conflict, but we are hopeful that, as a community devoted to       learning, we can take steps that will draw on our common       humanity and shared values in order to modulate rather than       amplify the deep-seated divisions and animosities so       distressingly evident in the wider world. Especially at such       a time, we want to emphasize our commitment to fostering an       environment of dialogue and empathy, appealing to one       another's thoughtfulness and goodwill in a time of       unimaginable loss and sorrow.        As many colleagues, classmates, and friends deal with pain       and deep concern about the events in Israel and Gaza, we must       all remember that we are one Harvard community, drawn       together by a shared passion for learning, discovery, and the       pursuit of truth in all its complexity, and held together by       a commitment to mutual respect and support. At this moment of       challenge, let us embody the care and compassion the world       needs now.            Sincerely,                                                      Claudine Gay,      President, Harvard University.                                   ____                             Columbia University         Dear Fellow Members of the Columbia Community: I was       devastated by the horrific attack on Israel this weekend and       the ensuing violence that is affecting so many people.       Unfortunately, at this moment, little is certain except that       the fighting and human suffering are not likely to end soon.        I know many members of our community are being impacted in       profound ways and I want to assure each of you that Columbia       will provide any measure of care or comfort that we can. This       is your community, and you are not alone.        Since Saturday, our first priority has been to make sure       everyone connected to Columbia is safe and to provide       logistical support and other types of resources for students,       staff, and faculty who are directly affected by the conflict.       We are in close touch with students, staff, alumni, and       faculty throughout the region. I have included a list of       university resources below.        I am gratified by and grateful for the skill, agility, and       care that I have witnessed by professionals across Columbia.       Colleagues in our community have shown great sensitivity and       leadership, including staff at the Kraft Center for Jewish       Student Life, our leaders in the Earl Hall Center for       Religious Life, and the various student support teams across       our schools.        Many of you have reacted to these terrifying events by       pulling closer your friends, classmates, and relatives whose       sense of security was shattered. These acts of kindness and       empathy represent the best of Columbia and exemplify what we       as a community can contribute to this moment. I encourage you       to continue gathering, supporting each other, and listening       to one another in the days ahead.        As a global university, we are devoted to examining and       debating difficult issues that affect our world. Our job is       to educate, enlighten, and engage. We must reject forces that       seek to pull us apart and model behavior that shows respect       for all. I welcome events like the SIPA webinar scheduled for       tomorrow, examining the evolving situation in Israel and       Gaza. I strongly encourage Columbia faculty to find ways of       bringing clarity and context to this painful moment, just as       you contribute your expertise and scholarship to other great       challenges of our time.        I am committed to ensuring that these values are reflected       in our teaching, our research, and our community support.            Sincerely,                                                   Minouche Shafik,      President, Columbia University.                                   ____                                  Dartmouth         Dear Dartmouth Community: Like many of you, I watched with       growing horror the Hamas attack on Israel this weekend, the       escalating violence, and the devastating loss of life,       especially among civilians. Adding to my deep sorrow over the       overwhelming human tragedy playing out in Israel and Gaza are       the ways in which the war affects Dartmouth's global       community and many of our colleagues, peers, and friends.       Dartmouth alums live in the region, scholars work there, and       students, staff, and faculty have deep roots in the areas now       in danger. I want to extend my concern to each of you at this       time.  [[Page S5059]]         We have been working over the weekend and into this week to       make sure our community members with ties to the region--both       in the U.S. and abroad--are as safe and supported as       possible.        In every conflict, one of the most important roles a       university can play is to help us understand it, and to make       a space for dialogue and community. As Dean Elizabeth F.       Smith and Senior Vice President Shontay Delalue indicated in       their message below, shared yesterday with the campus       community, Dartmouth faculty and staff experts have organized       a series of discussions that can help bring us together and       shed light on the situation. These discussions will be held       today and Thursday at 5 p.m. and livestreamed for those who       cannot attend.        I encourage you to join these forums, which you can view       here, and others that we will plan over time. As we navigate       these difficult times, please care for one another and take       advantage of the support Dartmouth has to offer, as an       institution and a community.            Sincerely,                                                 Sian Leah Beilock,      President.                                   ____                                   Stanford         Dear Stanford Community: Our news and social media feeds       have been filled over the last few days with horrifying new       details about the Hamas attack in Israel last weekend, which       involved intolerable atrocities including murder of civilians       and kidnapping. The likelihood of a lengthy and violent       continued conflict in the region has become clearer. Our       focus as university leaders is on supporting the members of       our Stanford community in this difficult moment. We hear the       deeply felt concerns, fears, and grief that have been       expressed by students, faculty, and staff. We want to address       several issues that have arisen on our campus in the past few       days.        We have heard many expressions of concern regarding student       safety. We have heard from Jewish students, faculty, and       staff concerned about rising antisemitism. We have heard from       Palestinian students who have received threatening emails and       phone calls. We want to make clear that Stanford stands       unequivocally against hatred on the basis of religion, race,       ethnicity, national origin, and other categories. The       expression of political views, in appropriate times and       places, is important. Thoughtful, reasoned discussion of       current issues is central to the life of the university. Our       commitment to academic freedom means that latitude for       expression of controversial and even offensive views is       necessary to avoid chilling freedom of thought and ideas. But       harassment and abuse have no place here. We are committed to       working with affected communities to provide support and       resources, and also to ensuring the physical safety of those       on campus.        We have received a report of a class in which a non-faculty       instructor is reported to have addressed the Middle East       conflict in a manner that called out individual students in       class based on their backgrounds and identities. Without       prejudging the matter, this report is a cause for serious       concern. Academic freedom does not permit the identity-based       targeting of students. The instructor in this course is not       currently teaching while the university works to ascertain       the facts of the situation.        We have received complaints about banners, signs, and       chalking on campus that express views that many find       offensive. Again, it is important to remember that       controversial and even offensive speech is allowed except       when it crosses the line into certain illegal categories such       as threats or harassment for which the threshold is quite       high. Unlawful threats and harassment will not be tolerated.       Stanford also has content- and viewpoint-neutral time, place,       and manner rules that limit locations for banners and signs.       Thus, many of the banners and signs have been removed,       because they were in places where they are not allowed.       Moreover, it is worth remembering that while a climate of       free expression requires breathing room, our aspiration as a       community is for respectful and substantive discourse.        Here and across the nation this week, there also has been       discussion of the role of university leaders in commenting on       global events. This provides an opportunity for the two of       us, who are new in our current roles at Stanford, to share       some further thoughts on this topic, and on the place and       purpose of universities.        Stanford University is a community of scholars. We believe       it is important that the university, as an institution,       generally refrain from taking institutional positions on       complex political or global matters that extend beyond our       immediate purview, which is the operations of the university       itself. Maintaining university neutrality allows for our       individual scholars to explore them freely. In recent years,       many universities have gotten into the habit of issuing       frequent statements about news events. This creates a number       of difficulties. The decision to take a position about one       event or issue yields implications for silence with regard to       other issues; given that different subsets of a campus       community may be more or less affected by particular issues,       this inconsistency is felt acutely. It can enmesh       universities in politics and create a sense of institutional       orthodoxy that chills academic freedom. In addition, crafting       each message is challenging, from gathering facts and context       on complex issues at the speed of online media and the news       cycle while also walking a line between platitudes and overly       political positions.        As a moral matter, we condemn all terrorism and mass       atrocities. This includes the deliberate attack on civilians       this weekend by Hamas. One of the advances in international       law in the 20th century following the horrors of the       Holocaust was the development of international humanitarian       law prohibiting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and       genocide. Such crimes are never justified. Sadly, they occur       regularly throughout the world; the International Criminal       Court website lists seventeen different country situations       for which it has launched investigations, all of which       involve mass atrocities. And that court's docket does not       even reflect the full range of situations. We point this out       not to in any way diminish the shocking severity of the       events in Israel and Gaza this week, but to highlight the       pervasive problem that humankind faces in conquering hate.        The events in Israel and Gaza this week have affected and       engaged large numbers of students on our campus in ways that       many other events have not. This is why we feel compelled to       both address the impact of these events on our campus and to       explain why our general policy of not issuing statements       about news events not directly connected to campus has       limited the breadth of our comments thus far, and why you       should not expect frequent commentary from us in the future.        The fighting in the Middle East is likely to continue in       the coming weeks, with casualties on both sides, and the       overall situation has a deep and complex history. Stanford       has community members who are themselves from the region or       who have friends and family there. We recognize the deeply       felt impacts across our community. We encourage you to       approach one another with a spirit of compassion and respect       for our shared humanity.            Sincerely,                                                    Richard Saller,                                                         President.                                                    Jenny Martinez,      Provost.                                   ____                                 Northwestern         Dear Colleagues: Some of you have asked either me or the       provost about whether the University would be issuing a       statement on the current conflict in Israel and Gaza. I also       know many of you are receiving similar requests from your own       leadership, staff and communities. I am not planning to put       out a statement officially stating a University position. I       thought I would write to give you a bit of insight into why.        Let me start by saying that I am deeply repulsed, sickened       and disappointed by what Hamas has done. Kidnapping,       beheading, murdering people--children and adults, civilians       and people in the armed forces--is horrific and inhuman, pure       and simple. This sort of behavior is entirely unacceptable       regardless of one's political convictions or grievances.       Period. No moral equivalencies needed.        That is the view of Mike Schill, citizen, Jew and human       being. I didn't give up those parts of me when I assumed the       presidency of Northwestern.        However, I understand that when I put out an official       statement on a political matter, an atrocity, a catastrophe,       people read it not as the views of Mike Schill, but as       President Michael Schill speaking for the University. As       such, the decision to exercise speech takes on different       meaning. We are a University which celebrates free       expression, diversity of people and diversity of viewpoints.       This is essential to our role in society. The University does       not speak for our faculty, students and staff on these       matters--they have their own voices, and I would venture to       say, there are no doubt differences among our students and       faculty on what Hamas did and how Israel is responding. For       me to speak for them displaces their own freedom to speak.        Some of you who have followed recent discussions about free       expression may see strong influence of the Chicago       Principles, and you would not be mistaken. Regardless of what       the University has done in the past, I do not foresee that I       will be issuing statements on political, geopolitical or       social issues that do not directly impact the core mission of       our University, the education and futures of our students, or       higher education. This reticence to speak out publicly as       President Michael Schill will sometimes please and often       infuriate members of our community. But I believe it is the       right approach.        Just to be clear, as individuals in a democracy, we do not       give up our rights to have and express our personal political       and social viewpoints. We just need to make clear we are       speaking for ourselves and not for all our students, faculty,       staff and trustees. So, on Monday night when I stood with our       students at a Vigil for Israel in Deering Meadow, I did that       as Mike Schill. And I will continue to personally support,       when my conscience demands it, issues that I care deeply       about, always making the distinction in roles as clear as       possible.        I will end by expressing my concern, my prayers and my       hopes for a peaceful resolution of the current violence. We       all have an obligation at a moment like this to care for one       another . . . and most particularly our students and members       of our community who have loved ones whose lives have been  [[Page S5060]]       taken, who are held hostage or who are engaged in combat. If       you wish to relay my views to your respective communities, I       ask that you stress that our community has resources       available to help. Please contact Vice President for Student       Affairs Susan Davis if you would like to inquire more about       resources for students. Lorraine Goffe and Sumit Dhar can       address resources for our staff and faculty.     I can only hope that the leaders of America's  universities recognize what time it is in America. This is a time for  moral clarity, not a time for anti-Semitic hate dressed in faculty- lounge jargon. Leaders cannot afford to be silent. Terrorism is evil.  Anti-Semitism is despicable. And Israel has a right to exist. It  shouldn't take a Ph.D. to understand that, but it also shouldn't be so  hard for a Ph.D. to acknowledge it.                     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau    Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, today, the Senate  will vote on a Republican resolution to chip away at yet another  example of the Biden administration's runaway regulatory state using  the Congressional Review Act. The junior Senator from Louisiana,  Senator Kennedy, has put forward a measure that would block a proposed  rule at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would require  financial institutions to collect and report personal information on  small business loan applications, including data on race and sex.  Apparently, as if the radical progressivism on campuses wasn't enough,  Washington Democrats want to tie small business loans to diversity  quotas.   Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American dream, and I am  grateful to my colleague from Louisiana for giving the Senate an  opportunity to stick up for them. I would urge each of our colleagues  to join me in supporting his resolution later today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
