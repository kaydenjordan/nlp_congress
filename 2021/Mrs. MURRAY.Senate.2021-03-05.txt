 Mr. President, I want to really thank Senator Schumer,  Senator Wyden, and Senator Sanders and others who are working so hard  with me on making sure that our relief bill includes a much needed  raise for our workers.   Democrats and Republicans alike have joined together in rightly  calling our essential workers heroes and the backbone of our economy.  But despite their tireless work and the constant risk of COVID  exposure, too many of these workers are paid wages so low, they cannot  afford to pay for even their most basic needs.   This pandemic should be a wake-up call that these workers whom we all  call heroes deserve more than $7.25 an hour. I urge my colleagues to  vote for the Sanders amendment in order to give a much needed raise to  millions of workers and end the tipped minimum wage and subminimum wage  for youth workers and workers with disabilities.   After more than a decade since the last Federal minimum wage  increase, the tides are turning, and there is overwhelming support for  Congress to act. So let me be clear. Today's vote is just one step in  our fight. We are not going to give up. Today we are going to keep  working to get this historic bill across the finish line because right  now this country is on fire. Republicans' biggest concern seems to be  that we might use too much water. The reality is, we are far from doing  too much because we will not have done enough until this crisis is  over, until families across the Nation are safe, and until we rebuild a  stronger and fairer country.   Anyone who says this bill is too expensive needs to understand how  much this pandemic has already cost our communities, how much it has  already taken from families, and how much more is at stake if we don't  finally bring it to an end.   They need to listen to public health and healthcare workers who have  been straining to test, to contact trace, to  [[Page S1224]]  vaccinate people across the country, and to grapple with the trauma of  fighting this pandemic on the frontlines.   They need to listen to parents who are asking how they are supposed  to go to work when they don't have childcare and their kids can't go to  school in person, who wonder how are they going to pay rent, how are  they going to pay for groceries, how are they going to pay to keep the  heat on, and fearing what will happen if they cannot.   They need to listen to students whom this pandemic has robbed of  critical school resources, as well as opportunities to grow and thrive  and socialize with their peers.   They need to listen to our States and our cities and our Tribes and  our territories that have seen their budgets upended.   They absolutely need to listen to people of color, to voices in the  Black, Latino, and Tribal communities who have been hit the hardest by  this pandemic in every way.   Anyone who has been listening to the American people and anyone who  has been watching what they have gone through understands the danger in  this moment is not doing too much; it is doing too little.   If Republicans want to talk about too much, there are almost 10  million fewer people working compared to this time a year ago. There  are 11 million people at risk of eviction and 11 million people about  to lose their unemployment benefits. That is too much.   One study says that by June, this pandemic will likely have set  students back 5 to 9 months in math from where they could be in a  typical year, and that setback is even larger for students of color.  Another notes that as schools across the country have shifted to remote  learning, that one in four students lacks access to internet at home.  According to the CDC, one in four young adults has considered suicide.  That is too much.   Since the start of the pandemic, we have lost over 650,000 jobs in  higher education and 1 in 6 jobs in childcare. That is too much.   Across this country, this virus has infected over 28 million, left  thousands of ``long haulers'' still experiencing symptoms, and killed  over half a million people. That is too much.   We have to act. We have to. And that is why we are fighting to pass  the American Rescue Plan. This American Rescue Plan will send families  long-overdue direct relief and prevent expanded unemployment benefits,  which have been a lifeline to so many people, from expiring. It will  help get vaccines in arms faster. It will hire and train more public  health workers. It will ramp up our testing capacity and invest in  programs to counter the disproportionate harm COVID-19 has caused  specifically to communities of color and Tribes. It will expand  affordable insurance to more families and give schools much needed  resources to help our students get back to classrooms for in-person  learning safely. It will stabilize our struggling childcare sector,  which is so critical to helping women and working families get back to  work. It will support small businesses and help States keep educators  and firefighters and sanitation workers and others on the job.   So before my Republican colleagues worry anymore about the cost of  doing all that, I hope they take a moment to consider the staggering  cost of failing to do it. There is a reason bold action like this plan  has the support of Republican Governors like Jim Justice in West  Virginia; the support of Republican mayors like Betsy Price in Fort  Worth, TX, or Francis Suarez in Miami, FL, or David Holt from Oklahoma  City; and, according to a recent poll, the support of a majority of  Republicans.   That same poll showed that the American people support this package  by an overwhelming 3-to-1 margin. People support this American Rescue  Plan because the American Rescue Plan supports people--workers,  families, communities--who know firsthand the loss and hardship of this  last year and because they understand the simple fact that when the  house is in flames, you do not argue about how much of the fire to put  out or how much water to use or how many lives to save; you do whatever  it takes until the crisis is over and everyone is safe, and you do it  as fast as you can. That is what Democrats are trying to do today. That  is what this bill is about, and I urge every single Member of the  Senate to support it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the only way to safely reopen schools for  in-person learning and keep them open is to provide the $125 billion  that is included in the American Rescue Plan Act for our K-12 schools.  This Federal funding will support schools in their implementing safety  protocols that are aligned with local public health guidance in order  to safely reopen, stay open, and help students with learning recovery.  Our goal is clear.   Let me make something else clear. The amendment offered today to  condition funds on forced school reopenings is simply a political show  that will, actually, further disadvantage schools that have already  suffered the most. If we only provide funding to schools that are  physically open, schools in communities with high rates of COVID-19  can't receive the money they need to implement health safety protocols,  but they will feel the pressure to reopen even if it is not safe. So  conditioning funds actually undermines our ability to get students back  in the classroom safely.   Let's prioritize student learning. Safe in-person learning is  paramount so let's stop wasting time. Let's pass this plan and get the  schools the funds they need.    Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. It would strike  two important improvements we made to the program that funds private  schools.   First, Republicans are critiquing this bill for not being targeted  enough, but this amendment would remove the requirement to target  funding to private schools that serve significant percentages of low- income students.   The American Rescue Plan provides an additional $2.75 billion for  services to private schools. And the bottom line is, Federal funds  shouldn't be spent at expensive private schools. Instead, they should  be targeted to low-income students at private schools like all our  other education investments.   The pandemic is disproportionately harming students of color and  those from families with low incomes. While these students are already  much more likely to attend public schools, we need to make sure that  those who do attend private schools are prioritized as well.   Secondly, this amendment strikes the limitation we placed on the  funds being used for reimbursements at private schools. Reimbursements  that were permitted with the first round of funding for this program  were in order to cover past expenses incurred by private schools. Those  expenses should be reimbursed by that first round. These additional  funds are intended to provide services for private schools in the  future. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Madam President, it is frustrating, but not at all  surprising, that in the middle of a pandemic, as we are working to get  urgently needed relief to our families, to our small businesses, and to  our communities across the country, some Republicans would rather spend  time launching political attacks on reproductive health.   That is exactly what this amendment is--an effort to expand  restrictions on abortion that already make it harder for women who have  low incomes, who are often women of color, to exercise their  constitutionally guaranteed right to make their own healthcare choices.   I oppose this amendment because it is completely unnecessary. It is a  harmful attempt to distract us from the work that we are on tonight.                                Point of Order    Madam President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment  produces budgetary changes that are merely incidental to the non- budgetary components of the amendment, and it therefore violates  section 313(b)1(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Madam President, this is yet another amendment that  conditions funding to our public schools under the guise of wanting in- person learning, when in reality withholding this funding is counter to  everyone's goal.   But this amendment goes a step further. It strips much needed funds  from our public schools that want to reopen for in-person learning and  implement safety protocols that are aligned with local public health  guidance in order to create a voucher program.  [[Page S1249]]    That is right. This amendment takes money from public schools that  serve 90 percent of our students and sends those funds to private  schools. It is unclear to me if our colleague's goals are really about  reopening public schools or just about advancing long-term ideological  goals.   If we only provide funding to schools that are physically open,  schools in communities with high transmission rates of COVID-19 will  not receive the resources necessary to implement safety health  protocols. Conditioning funds undermines our ability to actually get  our students back into the classroom.   Let's stop wasting time and pass the American Rescue Plan so those  resources can get to our schools and our students.                          Vote on Amendment No. 969     Madam President, this amendment will undermine the goals  of this bill to provide assistance to all educators, all students, and  families who have struggled through this pandemic. It is simply an  attempt to discriminate against transgender students.   All students, including transgender students, benefit from  participating in sports--to challenge themselves, to improve fitness,  to be part of a team. Allowing transgender students to participate in  athletic activities consistent with their gender identity in no way  disadvantages their fellow students.   For the love of God, can't we just have a little bit of heart and  compassion in this world for someone who doesn't look or live exactly  like you?   Instead of focusing on discriminatory policies, we should be  examining the real issues with gender parity in sports when it comes to  funding and resources and pay equity.   I oppose this amendment because it discriminates against transgender  students. It is a harmful attempt to undermine our work to help  students and families.                                Point of Order    Madam President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment  produces budgetary changes that are merely incidental to the  nonbudgetary components of the amendment and violates section  313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.                               Motion to Waive     Let's be clear. This is a delay tactic intended to stop  what we are doing here to send the bill to the HELP Committee. It would  instruct the HELP Committee to remove $135 million in critical funding  that will help support humanities and cultural organizations weather  the worst of this pandemic.   Mr. President, the pandemic has devastated our arts and cultural  organizations. Our Nation's museums, indigenous cultural organizations,  and local education nonprofits are facing significant losses in  revenue, in layoffs, in furloughs. Our cultural organizations in rural  and urban and suburban areas need these resources to continue to serve  our communities.   The UAC Program at the Department of Health and Human Services is  critical for ensuring the health and welfare of unaccompanied children.  We absolutely do need to take steps to support this program to ensure  the well-being of children in ORR care. But this amendment is merely a  delay tactic to address the critical issues at hand related to the  COVID-19 crisis. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion.                           Vote on Motion to Commit
