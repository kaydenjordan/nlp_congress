 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1585, the Violence Against  Women Reauthorization Act of 2019. This legislation is the result of  the tireless work of advocates, Chairman Nadler, of the bill's original  sponsor, my colleague from California, Congresswoman Karen Bass, and  most especially, the women who survived domestic violence and sexual  assault and bravely shared their stories. Without their courage, this  legislation would not be on the floor today.   I also appreciate the title in this bill which helps victims of  domestic violence access safe housing. Women who are in dangerous  situations at home need to be able to quickly transfer to alternative  housing, and that is precisely what Title 6 of this bill aims to do. I  understand that there are some stakeholders who have raised some  questions about how the implementation of this title would work, and I  will continue to work with them as this bill moves through the Senate.   Though the Violence Against Women Act has led to widespread change in  how our Nation understands and responds to domestic violence, sexual  assault, and sexual harassment, much work remains to be done.   Twenty-five years after the original Violence Against Women Act  passed in 1994, women who came forward are still too often disregarded,  disgraced, and humiliated, all because those in power know that if the  stories of the trauma and abuse suffered by women are true, then  everything--including their power--would need to change. My amendment  is another step toward ensuring that women who speak out and refuse to  be silenced are supported and heard.   Section 303 of H.R. 1585 includes the grant program that provides  funds to higher education institutions to combat violent crimes on  campuses, including especially, domestic and sexual violence. My  amendment would create a new purpose area for section 303 grants, which  allows funding to be used by higher education institutions to train  employees on how to conduct victim-centered, trauma-informed interviews  with the students who report being a victim of sexual assault, domestic  violence, stalking, or harassment. The employee would be trained to  communicate in a manner which does not blame or judge the survivor for  the crimes he or she reports.   My amendment stipulates that if a student requests to have a record  of their conversations with college employees and administrators, then  schools which accept funding for this purpose area must offer a  recorded interview. Given the lengthy record of colleges suppressing  reports of sexual or domestic violence on campus, recorded interviews  can be incredibly important to survivors.   Only one in five female college students report their sexual assault,  and many cite a fear of retaliation and not being believed as the  primary reasons they stayed silent. Students who come forward and  report an assault or other crime should never be made to feel that they  are at fault, that they will be punished, or that they should feel  shame. College administrators should never use their ignorance as to  how trauma affects young women--which can often make it difficult for a  victim to recall exactly what happened and when--as a reason to  discredit those who report.   My amendment will help ensure that never happens by facilitating the  training necessary for colleges to better support students as they  navigate what is likely to be one of the most traumatic moments in  their lives.   So, Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support training to  promote more effective conversations between students and college  employees and vote in the affirmative for my amendment.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I rise to continue to try and educate my  colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle about the trauma that is  faced by victims of sexual assault, and I am hopeful that they will  agree with me, join in this amendment, and support this amendment so  that we can create the opportunity to get these conversations going so  that, indeed, these women can be supported and understood perhaps in  ways this has never happened before.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) who  is the chair of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600
