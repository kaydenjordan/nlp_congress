 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5809,  legislation I introduced to designate the U.S. Post Office located in  Norco, California, as the Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui Memorial Post  Office Building.   As we approach the 1-year anniversary of Lance Corporal Nikoui's  death, my congressional district continues to honor the life and memory  of Kareem, who was a Norco resident and will be forever remembered as  an American hero.   As a student at Norco High School, Kareem was inspired to answer the  call of service to his country. When he joined the Marine Corps, Kareem  was following in the footsteps of patriots. Like his fellow marines, he  was not signing up for glory or reward, but out of a sense of duty.  Kareem was willing to make sacrifices in his own life so that others  could live freely.   In his final days, Kareem was on the front lines of a mission to  secure freedom for desperate people trying to flee Afghanistan. Like so  many of the U.S. servicemembers and coalition allies, Kareem conducted  himself with bravery and compassion, despite the chaos that resulted  from a poorly planned exit from Afghanistan. In addition to securing  the airfield, Kareem helped care for children, women, and the elderly  by sharing with them water and candy.   The suicide bombing that claimed the lives of Kareem and 12 other  U.S. servicemembers, as well as hundreds of Afghans, was an act of  cowardice and evil. The worst of mankind heartbreakingly robbed us of  so many who represented the best of mankind.   This bill, this Congress, and this country can never fully repay the  Nikoui family for the sacrifice that they have made, but by passing  this bill, the House remembers Kareem's bravery, and we pay tribute to  a young life taken too soon. As the sponsor of this bill, I will  continue to work so it becomes law so that the community of Norco will  forever honor and enshrine the name of Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui.
