 Mr. Chairman, I have enjoyed working with my chairman,  and, of course, our ranking member, on behalf of our true American  heroes over the years, and we have got much more good work to do for  our heroes.   Mr. Chairman, too often, the VA has failed to hold employees  accountable when they do not uphold their duty to care for those who  served.   The vast majority, as has been said by our chairman, are hardworking  and dedicated to our Nation's heroes. But those bad actors are harmful  to veterans and the VA's reputation as a whole. They must be fired. If  a VA employee fails in their duty to care for veterans, they should be  removed, as I said, from their post swiftly, no matter how senior their  position.   It is unacceptable that it can take a year, or even longer, to  remove, demote, or suspend a VA employee. The VA Accountability First  Act would remove those bureaucratic roadblocks and rid the agency of  its toxic culture of mediocrity.   The bill would also safeguard whistleblowers--that is necessary--from  retaliation and protect employees' due process rights.   I am proud to cosponsor the VA Accountability First Act, and I  strongly urge passage.
