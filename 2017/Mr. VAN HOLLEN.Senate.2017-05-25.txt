 Mr. President, the Senate is an institution that  remembers its giants, its lions--the Senators who have served with  distinction, who negotiated critical legislative deals, who fought for  their States and their constituents, and who have participated in  historic debates on this Senate floor. They have statues and libraries  to remember them and portraits in these halls.   The Senate has been home to many extraordinary individuals but less  frequently acknowledged is the truth that no Senator operates alone. We  rely on the counsel and good service of dedicated staff in both our  committees and personal offices. Among those staff, there is perhaps no  greater giant of the Senate than Bill Dauster, who retires this week  after more than three decades of service.   With a clear-eyed understanding of the Senate, with all its features  and its flaws, a dedication to progressive values and collegiality that  has endeared him to Senator and staffer alike, Bill has been an asset  to this institution and to all who have served with him. I am very  pleased he is with us on the floor today.   Senator Harry Reid called Bill his ``utility player'' for his ability  to step into any issue or complicated matter and find a solution.   I am privileged that Bill Dauster joined my staff early this year to  help me set up my office and get it off to a good start in the U.S.  Senate. I could not have asked for a better and more knowledgeable guy  as I began my service here.   There are few major legislative battles that Bill Dauster has not  joined in the past 30 years, including the Children's Health Insurance  Program, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, and the Affordable Care  Act. He worked for Senator Feingold when he stood against the so-called  PATRIOT Act because of its invasion of privacy, and he helped shepherd  Democratic priorities, ranging from the minimum wage to important  infrastructure investments.   He has written a book on Senate procedure--and I mean literally--and  he has been as much a scholar of the Senate as a participant in its  daily life.  [[Page S3185]]  Bill is a leader of what the Washington Post once called ``the whisper  brigade,'' the people, the staff who stand with their Senators, from  committee hearings to floor speeches, to answer questions and offer  suggestions and help make us better and more prepared.   In that capacity, Bill Dauster has mentored countless staff and  always stayed accessible to answer the most basic questions. With a  quote or a quip, he has brought levity to serious policy discussions.  He has built a reputation as an honest broker, a brilliant dealmaker,  and an incredibly generous soul.   Bill's character is shaped by his Jewish faith, which he has studied  and sought to illuminate to others. He has devoted free time to  analysis of the Torah on Wikipedia and many other places, crafting  interpretations that are as detailed, carefully explained, and  straightforward as the analysis he has provided on countless Senate  bills.   Bill Dauster is a devoted family man with his equally accomplished  and brilliant wife Ellen and his three children who are his pride and  joy. I am very pleased that his wife Ellen and daughter Emma are with  us today.   He is a science fiction fan, particularly of Star Trek, perhaps  seeking stories that are more believable than modern politics.   I wish Bill a restful retirement, but given his active mind, I  suspect he would sympathize with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' maxim  that leisure is ``a chance to do other jobs that demand attention.''   Instead, I will thank him for his service to the Senate and his  country and wish him a joyful and fulfilling next frontier. I ask my  colleagues to join me in saying: Farewell, but don't wander far.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I stand to pay tribute to a  distinguished young man from the State of Maryland: 2LT Richard Wilbur  Collins III, a brave, brilliant, passionate, selfless, and kind  American hero.   Second Lieutenant Collins, a resident of Calvert County, MD, was a  23-year-old student at Bowie State University, where he was a member of  the Bowie ROTC Program and was airborne-certified. On May 18, just last  week, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's  intelligence branch. Second Lieutenant Collins was scheduled to  graduate with a bachelor's of arts in business administration from  Bowie State University earlier this week. His future could not have  been brighter.   Tragically, Second Lieutenant Collins' life was cut short by a  horrific act of violence that the FBI is investigating as a hate crime.  We must bring the perpetrator of this evil act to justice and directly  confront the racism behind it.   Second Lieutenant Collins' selfless and courageous contributions to  our State and Nation will continue to have a lasting impact on those  who knew and loved him and on the broader community who learned of his  tragic and senseless death. At the young age of 23, Second Lieutenant  Collins raised his right hand to protect and defend the Constitution of  the United States. He was a young man of extraordinary courage and  ability and will be deeply missed by all who knew him.   Second Lieutenant Collins leaves behind his grieving family: his  father, U.S. veteran Richard W. Collins II; his mother Dawn Collins,  his sister Robin Collins, and countless friends.   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Second  Lieutenant Richard Wilbur Collins III and in expressing our deepest  condolences to his family and friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as our colleagues know, just yesterday  we received the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the most  recent version of the Republican health care bill, the bill that passed  out of the House of Representatives, also known as TrumpCare 2.0.   I encourage all of us, every one of our colleagues, to read the CBO  report and to read it carefully. For those who are interested, it can  be found online at www.cbo.gov. On the front page you can link to the  report, which I have here in my hand.   I think it is worth reminding our colleagues that the Congressional  Budget Office is composed of professionals, budget experts, and the  current Director of the Congressional Budget Office was selected by the  Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee and the Republican  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. Without an umpire on budget  issues, this Senate would be in absolute chaos when it comes to  determining the impact of many of our major decisions, so it is very  dangerous when people start attacking the umpire when it comes to these  important issues that can have literally life or death implications for  our constituents.   What you will find in this most recent Congressional Budget Office  report is that the most recent House Republican plan is even worse than  the original plan, which also was the subject of a Congressional Budget  Office report. What this CBO report tells us is that, like the earlier  version, this so-called health bill is really a massive transfer of  wealth from working-class and middle-income Americans to the top 1  percent of the wealthiest in our country and some very powerful special  interests. Its title would much more fittingly be ``wealthcare,'' not  healthcare.   Let's take a look at some of the findings that are in this report  that can be found online. I turn to page 4 of the report, where the  Congressional Budget Office reaches the conclusion that if we adopt  this House proposal, if the Senate votes for the House Republican bill,  there will be 23 million fewer of our fellow Americans who will have  access to affordable healthcare when it is phased in than today. So if  we were to adopt this, if this becomes law, we are saying to 23 million  of our fellow Americans: Sorry, we are going to take away your access  to affordable healthcare. It is right there on page 4. That is because  what this so-called healthcare bill does is take away some of the  supports that provide access to affordable healthcare. It reduces for  millions of Americans the tax credits they use for their premiums in  the Affordable Care Act exchanges.   As you will find on page 3 of this report, it also cuts Medicaid by  $834 billion. Now some people will say: Hey, no problem; that is just  going to be sent to the States, and States are going to have more  flexibility.   The Congressional Budget Office is very clear that when you are  talking about Medicaid cuts of this impact, one of two things happen:  Either a lot fewer people get access to affordable healthcare or States  have to raise taxes on the people in their States to ensure continued  access. But this notion that somehow there are all these extra funds  floating around and that greater flexibility will allow fewer dollars  to go further with no negative impact is a fairytale.   In fact, Medicaid already has lots of provisions for flexibility.  They have a whole suite of waiver provisions. Our State of Maryland  exercised lots of waivers under the Medicaid program to allow it to be  creative and flexible.   This $834 billion cut we found out about yesterday with the  President's budget is just the first round of cuts. They are proposing  another almost $610 billion cut to Medicaid. Total cuts are $1.4  trillion to Medicaid.   I would remind my colleagues that in addition to helping working- class Americans get access to healthcare, two-thirds of Medicaid money  goes to help seniors in nursing homes, and 60 percent of seniors in  nursing homes use Medicaid to help pay the bills. Two-thirds of it goes  to those seniors and people with disabilities.   The Congressional Budget Office is telling us that this TrumpCare  2.0, this latest version of the Republican healthcare bill, is going to  result in 23 million fewer of our fellow Americans having access to  healthcare. It is going to cut Medicaid, and this is just the first  round, by $834 billion.   Why do this? Who is benefiting from this? Well, let's look at the  very first page of the Congressional Budget Office report. It reduces  revenues by $992 billion. There are cuts to Medicaid by $834 billion,  and it reduces revenues coming in by $992 billion, essentially  transferring revenues that are going to help tens of millions of our  fellow Americans get access to healthcare and  [[Page S3186]]  transferring that to tax breaks. Those tax breaks go overwhelmingly to  the very wealthiest Americans--to the top 1 percent, in fact.   One of the things we did when we put together the Affordable Care Act  to help pay for it was--we said: You know what, we think wealthier  households should have to pay a small fee on their unearned income to  be devoted to the Medicare trust fund.   Everyone in the country knows when they get that pay stub, it tells  them how much is taken out for Medicare--3.4 percent. We said: Look,  that should not just apply to earned income from hard-working people.  If you're in the top 1 percent, if you are a higher income earner, you  should also be contributing some of your capital gains revenue to help  strengthen Medicare. That is what we did.   Yet this bill provides all those households with a tax cut. In fact,  for millionaires, the average annual tax cut as a result of this bill  will be $50,000--a $50,000 tax cut to millionaires while cutting access  to affordable care for 23 million of our fellow Americans.   Why all these tax cuts are in something masquerading as a healthcare  bill, I don't know, but we now know certainly who benefits the most  from this legislation. Beyond those top 1 percent income earners, you  also have insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry. They get  some tax breaks, as well, under this legislation.   Finally, I said at the outset that this TrumpCare 2.0, the most  recent Republican healthcare bill, is worse than the original one. The  original one was rotten to the core. The original one had most of the  provisions I am talking about. So what got added that makes this one  even worse? To find that, people should look at page 5 of this report  and see what happens to people in States that decide to get rid of the  patient protection provisions in the Affordable Care Act.   We have heard a lot of talk about how that House bill isn't really  going to hurt people with preexisting conditions like diabetes and  asthma. We have heard all that, but here's what the Congressional  Budget Office report says. This is what the referee, the umpire, has to  say about that with respect to those States. It says: ``Community rated  premiums would rise over time, and people who are less healthy,'' and  then they state ``including those with preexisting conditions or newly  acquired medical conditions,'' right? So people who have had any kind  of preexisting condition or prior health condition that an insurance  company will argue makes them a much greater risk--people who are less  healthy and those with preexisting conditions ``would ultimately be  unable to purchase comprehensive nongroup health insurance at premiums  comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at  all.'' They go on to say ``despite the additional funding that would be  available under H.R. 1628.''   That is the House bill. Despite that additional funding to help  reduce premiums, they go on, and I hope our colleagues will pay  attention to this conclusion: ``As a result, the nongroup markets in  those states would become unstable for people with higher-than-average  expected health care costs.'' Translation: People with preexisting  conditions, people who, because they had diabetes or asthma as a child  or they have a congenital disease--any preexisting condition will make  it much harder for them to afford any kind of coverage at all, and  ultimately the nongroup markets in those States will become unstable  for those people. That is why this TrumpCare 2.0, this House healthcare  bill, this Republican bill, took a really rotten bill and actually made  it worse.   It is not enough, colleagues, for people to make a few cosmetic  changes to this, to put couple of bandaids on it in the Senate, and say  ``Hey, we made this thing better'' because this is rotten to its core.   If people really want to address healthcare reform, let's work  together to improve the exchanges. There are commonsense things we can  do to improve the exchanges, but you don't improve the exchanges by  cutting Medicaid by $834 billion. That has nothing to do with the  exchanges. You don't improve the exchanges by giving a windfall tax  credit to the wealthiest Americans. That has nothing to do with  healthcare.   TrumpCare 2.0, this Republican healthcare bill, is rotten to the  core. Let's throw it out, and let's focus on the question of fixing the  exchanges. If people want to do that, we can actually get something  done. But let's not pretend we are doing healthcare when really what  the goal so far has been is ``wealthcare.''   Thank you.
