 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to preserve our current  Clean Water Act protections over our rivers, streams, and wetlands.   Our Nation's river system and wetlands provide values that no other  ecosystem can: natural water quality improvement; flood protection;  shoreline erosion control; recreation; general aesthetic appreciation;  and national products for our use at no cost.   Yet section 107 of this bill seeks to undermine protection of streams  and wetlands and the critical balance between protecting these waters  and the day-to-day operations of our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and  foresters.   Under current law, farmers, ranchers, and foresters can carry out  their normal operations in any water body without requiring a Clean  Water Act permit. What this means is that farmers can continue to plow  their fields--including potential wet areas that have been farmed for  decades--plant their seeds, and harvest their crops without ever having  to obtain approval under the Clean Water Act.   Any normal farming, ranching, or forestry exemption is going to  include  [[Page H4927]]  minor limitations. For example, a farmer cannot use the current  exemption to convert his farmland to a residential development without  obtaining a permit; a rancher can't use this exemption to plow under a  wetland to expand his grazing lands; and forestry operations can't use  this exemption to change the course of a local stream to improve  drainage on their growing lands.   In short, the way the Clean Water Act currently operates is to allow  normal ranching, farming, and forestry operations to continue without a  permit unless the activity either changes or converts the use of a  water body to a new purpose or impairs the historic flow or reach of a  stream or wetland. If the planned activity triggers either of these  limitations, current law obviously would require that activity to  obtain a permit.   Section 107 of this bill, in essence, would provide an absolute Clean  Water Act exemption for impacts to any streams or wetlands that happen  to be on agricultural, ranching, or forestry lands.   Mr. Chairman, this is a fundamental change to the Clean Water Act,  and it is one where the impacts have never been explored. This  amendment would be a significant departure from almost 40 years of  implementation of the Clean Water Act by Democrats and Republicans by  eliminating the existing provision requiring that the exemptions apply  only to normal--as in established, ongoing--farming practices.                                time  1645    Mr. Chairman, we should not be using an appropriations bill to change  Federal policy related to the protection of our Nation's rivers and  streams. To the best of my knowledge, no hearings or investigations on  the impacts of this provision have ever been held.   If this Congress is interested in overturning almost 40 years of  Clean Water Act precedent, regular order would require hearings before  the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and approval  by that committee before consideration on the floor.   This rider is bad policy for the protection of our environment, bad  policy for the protection of human health, and bad policy for the  protection of public safety.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I find myself confused by the comments of my  distinguished friend from California. Nothing has changed in the law in  40 years. This law has been applied under Democratic and Republican  Presidents and administrations.   The law is very clear that any normal farming use, forestry,  agriculture or ranching is exempt already. It is only a wholesale shift  from what the farm's original exemption was intended for that would  require a Clean Water Act permit.   So if a farmer is, in fact, going to turn out and develop houses, a  subdivision, you need a clean water permit. But there is nothing in  there that says you need a clean water permit to plow, to plant, or to  use the land as it has always been used.   My fear is that I don't know of any specific instances where there  has been an overinterpretation of existing law, but section 107 would  basically throw out the entire baby in order to fix an  overinterpretation problem by one or two agents of the Department of  Agriculture.   Essentially, section 107 says everything is accepted under the Clean  Water Act if it is agriculture, forestry, or ranching on that land.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I respect the concern about an  overinterpretation of existing law that has been on the books for 40  years. The real challenge with section 107 is it throws out the entire  exemption process and makes everything legal.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Beyer-Eshoo-Esty amendment simply  restores funding to the Advanced Research Project-Energy, ARPA-E, to  the FY18 enacted level that was already approved by this Congress  earlier this year.   ARPA-E was created to replicate the successful DARPA model by  incentivizing researchers to develop promising research into game- changing technologies that can meet our future energy needs.   Mr. Chairman, despite the huge payoff, the private sector does not  often and cannot invest efficiently in kind of high-risk, high-reward  energy research. ARPA-E has already demonstrated incredible success in  advancing energy technology solutions that neither the public nor the  private sector has been willing or able to support in the past.   Since 2009, 136 of these projects have attracted more than $2.6  billion in private sector follow-on funding.   And please note, the amendment does not cut fossil energy research.  It simply reduces the plus-up for the account. The Fossil Energy R&D  will still receive $30 million more than last year and 50 percent more  than President Trump's FY19 request level.   I urge my colleagues to support the Beyer-Eshoo-Esty amendment to  make ARPA-E whole. ARPA-E is a smart bet on America's proven ability to  turn creative ideas into market-creating, job-growing businesses.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, there is virtually nothing my friend from  West Virginia said that I disagree with, except the idea that we are  somehow taking money from fossil fuel research that is untoward. Just  remember, this is a $30 million step up from last year and 50 percent  more than President Trump has even asked for.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Chairman, I simply add that we are not cutting the  fossil fuel research and development, which we do believe in. This is a  plus-up from last year of at least $30 million and 50 percent more than  President Trump has requested.   All we are simply doing is trying to appropriate to ARPA-E what was  enacted by this Congress and, also, to point out that ARPA-E does not  exclude fossil fuel research.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
