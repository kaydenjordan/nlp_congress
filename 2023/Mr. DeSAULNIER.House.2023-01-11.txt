 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  Dr. Chris Farnitano.   Dr. Farnitano has dedicated his career and his life to improving the  lives of others and advancing wellness and compassionate care in the  district that I represent in Contra Costa County and the San Francisco  Bay area. Over the course of his 30 years, Chris has served in an  important leadership role at the Contra Costa Regional Medical Center  and its clinics and ultimately ended up as the Contra Costa County  health officer in 2018.   Chris' commitment to promoting public health and well-being in our  community is apparent in all of the work he has done. In 1997, he  assisted in the development of the Pittsburg Health Center's HIV  Medical Clinic, which was the first of its kind in the Nation. Chris  was also instrumental in minimizing the spread of the coronavirus in  our county and in the region.   Chris' work has had significant impact on our community, and our  county admires his compassion and his dedication and wishes him well in  his retirement.                            ____________________
