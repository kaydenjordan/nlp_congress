 Mr. President, on August 15, 1887, 2  years after the end of the Civil War, history was made in Florida, when  a group of newly freed slaves voted to incorporate the town of  Eatonville on 122 acres of land. With its founding, Eatonville became  the first African-American incorporated city in America. I want to  congratulate Eatonville as they celebrate their 132nd anniversary and  Founders Day this August. The story of Eatonville is one that all  Americans should be proud of, and it stands today as an example to our  Nation and the world.   This town started as a tightly knit community, built around church,  school, and family, and they have maintained that heritage through over  a century of growth and development. They share the challenges faced by  all of our communities: the need for good jobs, a great education for  their children, and a safe community.   Eatonville is famous for being the home for two influential authors,  Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker. Zora Neale Hurston wrote about  Eatonville in her 1937 novel, ``Their Eyes Were Watching God.'' Forty- five years later, Alice Walker would write ``The Color Purple,'' which  shared similar themes. Today, Eatonville and Zora Neale Hurston are  recognized in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African  American History and Culture in Washington, DC.   In 2018, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded Eatonville the  prestigious Culture of Health Prize for their efforts to address the  high rates of diabetes in their community. This is an honor awarded to  just a handful of communities across the Nation each year, with only 4  winning cities out of 200 entries.   To address the health needs of the entire community, they created the  Healthy Eatonville Initiative and established a diabetes education and  research center, the Healthy Eatonville Place, where residents can come  to learn how to improve diet and exercise habits. They improved access  to fresh fruits and vegetables. They built safe sidewalks and bike  paths and placed historical markers along the way for all residents to  learn and take pride in their rich history.   I am proud of the community spirit of Eatonville and the work they  have put in to make the community so successful. As Governor and now as  Senator, it is an honor to work with partners like the Town of  Eatonville to make Florida the best place to live, work, and raise a  family, and I look forward to their future achievements.
