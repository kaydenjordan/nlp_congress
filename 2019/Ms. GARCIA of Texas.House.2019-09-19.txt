 Madam Speaker, this legislation is very simple.  It would establish a whistleblower program at the Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board based on the program Congress established at  the Securities and Exchange Commission under Dodd-Frank.   The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was originally  established to ensure proper oversight of audits of public companies.  This was done after the implosion of Enron and its accounting firm  Arthur Andersen, something that was very painful to many in my district  in Houston.   In the Dodd-Frank Act Congress passed, it expanded the whistleblower  program at the SEC to both provide individual protections for  retaliation if they came forward to the Commission and made them  eligible for monetary awards if their information led to enforcement  action. Likewise, under my bill, individuals would be eligible for a  reward program upon the successful completion of disciplinary action.  Whistleblowers would be incentivized to come forward when they suspect  violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; the rules of the PCAOB and the  SEC; and other rules, laws, and professional standards governing audits  of public companies. Importantly, these whistleblowers would also be  protected against retaliation from their employers.   In July, this House overwhelmingly passed the Whistleblower  Protection Reform Act by a vote of 410-12.                                time  1615    This bill uses the very same whistleblower protections that the House  passed in that piece of legislation.   This legislation would implement a key recommendation that the  Project on Government Oversight board made in a recent report.   Madam Speaker, as one can see from that report, it is likely more  could be done to strengthen this oversight board and its enforcement  abilities, but I am confident that this bill is a good first step.   One of the reasons that investors from around the world invest in  America is the stability and transparency of our public markets.  Congress, the private sector, and regulators have all worked hard to  make transparency a selling point around the world. This bill is just  one small tool in the toolbox of making sure that transparency and the  investor faith it generates in this country continue.   Supporters of this bill include the National Whistleblower Center,  The Institute of Internal Auditors, and Public Citizen. This bill  passed by voice vote out of committee.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters and the ranking  member, Mr. McHenry, and their staffs for working with us to  incorporate some of the bipartisan suggestions that I believe make this  bill stronger by ensuring that the SEC and the PCAOB coordinate in  their whistleblower efforts. Those changes make this bill stronger, and  I thank them for their bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I will close by simply saying that PCAOB works. Let's  [[Page H7803]]  keep it going. I hope that all my colleagues will join me in supporting  this legislation, and I ask for their support.    Madam Speaker, I will be brief, just two points:   Number one, it is not redundant. If it were so, the National  Whistleblower Center and The Institute of Internal Auditors wouldn't  see a need for it, and neither would the report that we have now placed  in the Record. It is needed, and certainly we need to support it.   Secondly, in terms of costs, the cost for implementing this bill will  be offset by the increase in fees that the board will collect from the  accounting boards for which they have oversight. So there will be no  additional costs. It will be offset.   Madam Speaker, it is needed, and I urge adoption of this bill.
