 Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic and hypocritical to hear  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who speak from this august  Chamber about the children and the families at the border when, today,  we are going to vote on legislation that doesn't lift a finger to help  those children and those families. It doesn't give a dime to our  President and make the investment in infrastructure and healthcare and  the things that this President has asked for repeatedly to help those  children.   Instead, we hear demagoguery after demagoguery, and it is all talk;  it is no action. And the action we need is not amnesty for people who  are in this country illegally. What we need is real solutions to  putting the American citizens first, their security and well-being  first.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the legislation the  Democrats are bringing to the floor today that will grant amnesty to  millions of illegal immigrants, incentivizing even more people to come  to this country illegally and which would do nothing to combat the  national security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border that  continues to grow worse every day.   The title of the bill is the ``American Dream and Promise Act''--the  ``American Dream and Promise Act.'' This may be a dream for those who  get placed in front of the line in front of millions of people who  respect our immigration laws; it may be a dream for folks who get  blanket immigration, a pass and citizenship to this great country, who  have committed violent acts, criminal acts, folks who are convicted of  DUIs, gang members; but it is not the dream of the American citizen. In  fact, it is a nightmare what is happening on the border of this  country.   And it is anything but a promise. It is a failure. It is a broken  promise to do our first job, and that is to protect the American  people, to provide for a common defense.   From denying we have a crisis in the first place, despite all the  evidence to the contrary, to irrationally calling walls immoral, to  repeatedly refusing to get the President the resources he needs to  secure the border and safely detain the children and families who have  made the dangerous trek, Democrats have been derelict in their  constitutional duty to defend our borders and to stop this flow of  illegal immigrants into our country.   We have a responsibility to safeguard our sovereignty as a nation and  know who is coming into this country.   President Reagan said: ``A nation that cannot control its borders is  not a nation.'' Right now, we have zero operational control of our  borders.   For the second straight month, Border Patrol agents apprehended more  than 100,000 people trying to cross the border illegally, the highest  number in 12 years. That is an average of 4,500 people a day. Homeland  Security experts say we apprehend one out of three. So we are talking  about thousands upon thousands of people that we don't even apprehend.   Just last week, Border Patrol agents in El Paso encountered a  thousand people who just walked across the border. We couldn't do  anything. We just let them go. We don't have the capacity. We don't  have the resources.   Even The New York Times and President Obama's Homeland Secretary Jeh  Johnson--no fans of this administration, for sure--have admitted that  the system is being pushed past the breaking point and that having over  4,000 people cross every day constitutes a crisis.   The situation is so bad, the Border Patrol agents are being forced to  release folks into the interior of our country because they have run  out of room to house everybody.   And from the great State of Texas, my home State, where we are on the  front lines against the fight against illegal immigration, I can tell  you that our brave patrolmen and -women are simply outnumbered and  overwhelmed.   And yet, in the midst of this unprecedented border crisis, what is  the solution from the Democrats? A blanket amnesty to millions of  people, to reward those who come over here illegally over the millions  who have respected our laws and waited in line to become citizens,  waiting for years to become citizens.   To grant amnesty to illegals while abandoning our own citizens and  their security needs is disconnected from reality. It is disrespectful  to our citizens, and it is downright un-American.   Mr. Speaker, I wish today's vote was an isolated incident.  Unfortunately, it is the latest in a long litany of examples that  exposes just how extreme the Democratic Party has become, whether it is  advocating for open borders, allowing for abortion up to point of  birth, or putting our country on the road to ruin with failed socialist  policies, and it is just another example of Democrats showing they are  more interested in opposing and obstructing a President than solving  real problems.                            ____________________
