 Mr. President, I rise today to formally enter a legal  opinion from the Government Accountability Office into the Record. The  contents of this legal opinion confirms that the Biden administration's  reckless student loan scheme has gone too far, violated process, and  must be submitted to Congress as a rule, subject to the Congressional  Review Act.   The Biden administration proposes to transfer the burden of $400  billion in Federal student loans onto taxpayers, citing COVID-19. The  administration continues to charge the U.S. Treasury $5 billion per  month to extend the loan pause, preventing any return to repayment on  student loans while it works to cancel them. Meanwhile, Americans who  chose not to attend college or already sacrificed to pay off their  loans will be forced to carry the burden of the student debt from those  who willingly took on these loans.   GAO's determination means that the Biden administration is not  playing by the laws of this land in attempting to implement their mass  student loan scheme and extend the payment pause via executive fiat.   This GAO legal opinion will allow Congress to exercise its oversight  prerogative and move forward with a Congressional Review Act resolution  of disapproval, while we await a Supreme Court decision on the  constitutionality of the policy.   I implore all of my colleagues to join me in support of a  Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to stand for the 87  percent of Americans  [[Page S854]]  who chose not to take student loans or paid off their debt responsibly.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letter from  the Government Accountability Office be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the U.S. Government Accountability Office]                                  Decision       Matter of: U.S. Department of Education--Applicability of the           Congressional Review Act to the Department of Education's           Student Loan Debt Relief Website and Accompanying Federal           Register Publication.      File: B-334644.      Date: March 17, 2023.                                    DIGEST         The U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced actions to       extend a pause on federal student loan repayment and to       cancel certain loan debts on a website titled ``One-Time       Federal Student Loan Debt Relief.'' ED also publicized these       actions in a Federal Register document titled Federal Student       Aid Programs (Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Family       Education Loan Program, and William D. Ford Federal Direct       Loan Program). GAO received a request for a decision as to       whether ED's actions announced on its website and in the       Federal Register (collectively ED's ``Waivers and       Modifications'') are a rule for purposes of the Congressional       Review Act (CRA). CRA incorporates the Administrative       Procedure Act's (APA) definition of a rule and requires that       before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule       to both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well       as to the Comptroller General. ED did not submit a CRA report       to Congress or the Comptroller General on its Waivers and       Modifications.        We conclude that ED's Waivers and Modifications meet the       definition of a rule under CRA and that no exception applies.       Therefore, ED's Waivers and Modifications are subject to the       requirement that they be submitted to Congress. If ED finds       for good cause that normal delays in the effective date of       the rule are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the       public interest, then its rule may take effect at such time       as the agency determines, consistent with CRA.                                   DECISION         On August 24, 2022, President Biden announced that the U.S.       Department of Education (ED) would take action to extend a       then-current ``pause on federal student loan repayment,'' as       well as to provide ``debt cancellation'' for certain federal       student loan recipients. The White House, Fact Sheet:       President Biden Announces Student Loan Relief for Borrowers       Who Need It Most (Aug. 24, 2022), available at https:// www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/ 24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief- for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/ (last visited Mar. 10, 2023).       After President Biden's announcement, ED outlined the       referenced actions on a website titled ``One-Time Federal       Student Loan Debt Relief.'' ED, Federal Student Aid, One-Time       Federal Student Loan Debt Relief, available at https:// studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt- relief-info (last visited Mar. 10, 2023). ED also provided       notice of these actions through a Federal Register document       titled Federal Student Aid Programs (Federal Perkins Loan       Program, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and William       D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program). 87 Fed. Reg. 61512       (Oct. 12, 2022). For ease of reference, we refer collectively       to ED's actions in the above-referenced website and Federal       Register document as ED's ``Waivers and Modifications.'' GAO       received a request for a decision as to whether ED's Waivers       and Modifications are a rule for purposes of the       Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter from Chairwoman       Virginia Foxx, Senators Bill Cassidy and John Cornyn, and       Representatives Bob Good and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, to the       Comptroller General (Sept. 23, 2022). As discussed below, we       conclude that ED's Waivers and Modifications meet the       definition of a rule under CRA and that no exception applies.       Therefore, ED's Waivers and Modifications are subject to       CRA's submission requirement. Consistent with CRA, ED may       forgo the normal delay in a rule's effective date for good       cause. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 808(2).        Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal       Decisions and Opinions, GAO-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:       Sept. 2006), available at https://www.gao.gov/products/gao- 06-1064sp. Accordingly, we reached out to ED to obtain the       agency's legal views. Letter from Assistant General Counsel,       GAO, to General Counsel, ED (Oct. 17, 2022). We received ED's       response on February 22, 2023. Letter from General Counsel,       ED, to Assistant General Counsel, GAO (Feb. 22, 2023)       (Response Letter).                                  BACKGROUND       Federal Student Loans and the HEROES Act        ED currently administers federal student loans pursuant to       at least four programs: the William D. Ford Federal Direct       Loan Program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)       Program, the Federal Perkins Loan Program, and the Health       Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program. See 20 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 1087a-1087j, 1071-1087-4, 1087aa-1087ii; ED, Health       Education Assistance Loan Program, 82 Fed. Reg. 53374 (Nov.       15, 2017). For each of these programs, Congress set forth       relevant terms and conditions in title IV of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (HEA). 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1070 et seq.       Among other things, HEA outlines the responsibility of       borrowers to repay their loans, the consequences of failing       to do so, and the possibility that ED may cancel loans under       certain circumstances. See 20 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1078-10, 1078-      11, 1080, 1087j, 1087e, 1087dd, 1087ee. ED also implements       HEA through its own regulations. See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. parts       674, 681, 682, and 685.        In the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students       Act of 2003 (HEROES Act), Congress gave ED the power to       ``waive or modify'' HEA provisions and regulations under       limited emergency circumstances. Specifically, the Act states       that:        ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless       enacted with specific reference to this section, the       Secretary of Education . . . may waive or modify any       statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student       financial assistance programs under title IV of [HEA] . . .       as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or       other military operation or national emergency . . . .''       20 U.S.C. Sec. 1098bb(a)(1). As a prerequisite to providing       waivers or modifications under the above-quoted provision, ED       must find them ``necessary to ensure'' certain objectives       listed in the HEROES Act. Id. Sec. 1098bb(a)(2). The first       listed objective is to ensure that ``recipients of [loans]       under title IV of [HEA] . . . are not placed in a worse       position . . . in relation to [such loans] because of their       status as affected individuals.'' Id. The second listed       objective is to ensure that ``administrative requirements       placed on affected individuals . . . are minimized, to the       extent possible without impairing the integrity of the       [federal student loan] programs . . . to ease the burden on       such students.'' Id.        The HEROES Act outlines processes for ED to inform the       public about waivers and modifications. Id. Sec. 1098bb(b).       In addition, the HEROES Act requires ED to provide certain       information to Congress about waivers and modifications. Id.       Notwithstanding section 437 of the General Education       Provisions Act (GEPA) and section 553 of APA, the HEROES Act       says that ED must ``by notice in the Federal Register,       publish the waivers or modifications of statutory and       regulatory provisions that [it] deems necessary'', as well as       ``the terms and conditions to be applied in lieu of such       [waived or modified] provisions.'' Id. Additionally, ED must       provide Congress with an ``impact report'' no later than 15       months after it provides any waiver or modification. Id.       Sec. 1098bb(c). This report must discuss the impact of ED's       waivers or modifications ``on affected individuals'' and       ``programs under title IV of the [HEA],'' as well as ED's       ``recommendations for changes'' to provisions waived or       modified. Id.        Finally, the HEROES Act speaks to the timing of ED's       waivers and modifications. In a subsection titled ``no delay       in waivers and modifications,'' the Act says ``Sections       482(c) and 492 of the [HEA] shall not apply'' to ED's waivers       and modifications. Id. Sec. 1098bb(d). Ordinarily, those       provisions require ED to delay the effective date of certain       regulations, and to engage in a ``negotiated rulemaking''       process--including the input of students, institutions of       higher education, and other affected entities--for       regulations concerning federal student loans. See id.       Sec. Sec. 1089(c), 1098a.      ED's Waivers and Modifications        In its Waivers and Modifications, ED invoked the HEROES Act       to take emergency actions in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.       As ED explained, President Trump had declared a national       emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic on March 13, 2020,       and it remained in effect at the time of ED's actions. 87       Fed. Reg. 61512, 61513. As ED further explained, because the       COVID-19 emergency declaration encompassed all areas in the       United States, ``any person with a Federal student loan under       title IV of the HEA'' was an ``affected individual'' under       the HEROES Act. Id. In light of ``the financial harm caused       by the COVID-19 pandemic,'' ED said that certain ``waivers       and modifications [were] necessary to ensure that affected       individuals [were] not placed in a worse position financially       with respect to their student loans.'' Id. ED ``further       determined'' that these Waivers and Modifications would       ``help minimize the administrative burdens placed on affected       individuals.'' Id.        In sum, ED's Waivers and Modifications amounted to two       specific actions:        First, ED extended a then-current ``automatic suspension of       payment and application of a zero percent interest rate'' for       all individuals with federal direct loans or federally-held       FFEL, Perkins, or HEAL loans. Id. ED explained how an       automatic suspension of payment and zero percent interest       rate originated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and       Economic Security (CARES) Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136 (Mar. 27,       2020), and how the President and ED had extended these       measures through August 2022. Id. at 61513-61514. ED now       announced that it was further extending these measures       through December 31, 2022. Id. at 61513.        Second, ED announced that it would ``discharge certain       amounts'' of federal direct loans and federally-held FFEL and       Perkins loans. Id. Subject to specified income limitations       and individual borrowers' submission of applications, ED       announced that it would discharge up to $20,000 for borrowers       who had  [[Page S855]]       received a Pell Grant, and up to $10,000 for borrowers who       had not received a Pell Grant. Id. ED explained that it was       ``modif[ying] the provisions of'' HEA and its implementing       regulations in order to make these discharges permissible.       Id. at 61514.        ED indicated that the Waivers and Modifications were       effective as of October 12, 2022 (i.e., immediately upon       publication in the Federal Register), and that, except where       otherwise indicated, they would ``expire at the end of the       award year in which the COVID-19 national emergency expires .       . . .'' Id. at 61513.      The Congressional Review Act        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy of       the rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the       rule,'' and the rule's proposed effective date. Id. CRA       allows Congress to review and disapprove federal agency rules       for a period of 60 days using special procedures. 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 802. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, then the       new rule has no force or effect. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(b)(1).        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551 (4), which states that       a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3). However,       CRA excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1)       rules of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to       agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. Id.        ED did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on its Waivers and Modifications. ED       contends that the Waivers and Modifications do not meet the       definition of a rule under CRA. In addition, ED relies on a       provision of the HEROES Act allowing ED to modify student       loan requirements ``notwithstanding any other provision of       law.'' Response Letter at 1-2 (quoting 20 U.S.C.       Sec. 1098bb(a)(1)-(2)).                                  DISCUSSION         At issue here is whether ED's Waivers and Modifications       meet the definition of a rule under CRA. As explained below,       we conclude that they do.        ED's Waivers and Modifications meet CRA's definition of       ``rule'' as an agency statement of future effect designed to       implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. They are an       agency statement because ED published them as such on its       webpage and in the Federal Register. 87 Fed. Reg. 61513. They       have future effect because they temporarily extended a       suspension of payment and interest terms, and because they       invite borrowers to apply prospectively for the discharge of       certain debt amounts. Id. And they implement law and policy       by ``waiv[ing]'' and ``modif[ying] the provisions of'' HEA       and its implementing regulations. Id.        Additionally, none of CRA's three statutory exceptions are       applicable:        First, the Waivers and Modifications are not a rule of       particular applicability. A rule of particular applicability       is one addressed to specific, identified entities. See B-      333732, Jul. 28, 2022 (explaining that a rule of general       applicability is one with an open class but a rule of       particular applicability is limited to those named). By       contrast, ED's Waivers and Modifications suspended payment       obligations and modified interest rates for all individuals       with federal direct loans or federally-held student loans. 87       Fed. Reg. 61513. They also offer to discharge certain debt       amounts for all such individuals meeting specified income       limitations. Id.        Second, the Waivers and Modifications are not a rule       relating to agency management or personnel. A rule relates to       agency management or personnel if it applies to agency       employees and not to outside parties. See e.g., B-331324,       Oct. 22, 2019 (determining that 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3)(b) does       not apply when the rule deals with actions regulated parties       should take and not agency management or personnel). But       here, the Waivers and Modifications relate to the student       loan obligations of all ``affected individuals,'' which ED       has defined broadly to include ``any person with a Federal       student loan under title IV of the HEA.'' 87 Fed. Reg. 61512,       61513.        Third, and finally, the Waivers and Modifications       substantially impact the rights and obligations of non-agency       parties because they allow student borrowers to forego       ordinary loan-repayment obligations and apply to have certain       amounts of debt discharged.      ED's Response        ED asserts that the Waivers and Modifications are not       subject to CRA because they are ``not a rulemaking, but a       one-time, fact-bound application of existing and statutorily       prescribed waiver and modification authority.'' Response       Letter at 4. ED also states that its Waivers and       Modifications are not subject to CRA because the HEROES Act       allows ED to modify student loan requirements       ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' Id. at 1-2       (quoting 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1098bb(a)(1)-(2)).        ED bases its first assertion upon Goodman v. FCC, 182 F.3d       987, 993-94 (D.C. Cir. 1999), as well as similar cases       finding that an agency's action was an ``order'' or another       type of action other than a ``rule'' within the meaning of       APA's definitions that CRA incorporates. Id. However, those       cases are distinguishable here. In Goodman, the Federal       Communications Commission (FCC) took action to resolve       several outstanding issues related to Specialized Mobile       Radio (SMR) licensees. Id. at 990. The D.C. Circuit found       that FCC's action was an ``order'' and ``not a rulemaking''       because it addressed the ``temporary waiver'' of existing FCC       rules for already-issued licenses, whereas a rule would have       had ``legal consequences `only for the future.' '' Id. at 994       (quoting Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U.S.       204, 216-17 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring)). GAO has applied       Goodman to find other agency actions beyond CRA's coverage,       including most recently in B-334400, Feb. 9, 2023. In that       case, we found that the Environmental Protection Agency's       resolution of 69 small refinery petitions was an order, not a       rule, because the at-issue petitions concerned specific       requests for ``statutory exemptions,'' which the APA       recognizes as a type of ``license'' and order. B-334400, Feb.       9, 2023.        Here, unlike in the above cases, ED's Waivers and       Modifications are oriented generally toward the future and       have potentially broad consequences for all loan holders, not       just a specifically-identified subset thereof. They do not       address existing requests from particular licensees or       petitioners, as was the case in Goodman and in B-334400, nor       do they apply existing law to the facts of any particular       claim or request. To the contrary, ED's Waivers and       Modifications substitute new benefits and requirements across       the board. See 87 Fed. Reg. 61513. ED asserts that it has not       previously submitted rules under the CRA process when using       its HEROES Act authority. Those prior HEROES Act actions,       however, are not before us and we do not interpret those       instances as Congress or GAO finding that CRA did not apply.       Instead, we have been asked to assess whether the current       Waivers and Modifications are subject to CRA.        With regard to ED's second assertion, the Supreme Court has       recognized that statutory ``notwithstanding any other       provision of law'' clauses signal Congress's general intent       to ``override conflicting provisions of any other [laws].''       Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 18 (1993). To       determine the scope of any particular ``notwithstanding''       clause, we construe the particular language and ``the design       of the statute as a whole.'' See K. Mart Corp v. Cartier,       Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291 (1988); see also B-290125.2, B-      290125.3, Dec. 18, 2002 (``In expounding a statute, we must .       . . look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its       object and policy.'') (quoting Maestro Plastics Corp. v.       National Labor Relations Board, 350 U.S. 270, 285 (1956)).       Generally, laws that are not contrary to the design of a       ``notwithstanding'' clause will continue to apply despite       that clause. Thus, in B-290125.2, B-290125.3, Dec. 18, 2002,       an appropriation act directed the Department of Energy (DOE)       to award a construction contract and, ``notwithstanding any       other provision of law,'' to negotiate with the awardee and       make contract modifications as necessary to ensure that       groundbreaking occurred by a specified date. DOE argued that       this ``notwithstanding'' clause overrode GAO's authority to       decide bid protests under the Competition in Contracting Act       of 1984 (CICA), 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3551-3556 (2000). Id. However,       GAO rejected DOE's argument because we found that our CICA       authority did not ``interfere'' with and ``would not       prevent'' DOE from performing the specific time-delimited       tasks with which DOE's appropriation was concerned. Id. See       also District of Columbia Federation of Civic Assn's v.       Volpe, 459 F.2d 1231, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1971), cert. denied,       405 U.S. 1030 (1972) (provision of Federal-Aid Highway Act       directing construction of a bridge ``notwithstanding any       other provision of law'' did not render inapplicable certain       federal statutes regarding protection of historic sites).        By contrast, where a law cannot be reconciled with the       intent of a ``notwithstanding'' clause, it is overridden. For       example, in United States v. Novak, the Ninth Circuit       considered a Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA)       provision indicating that ``notwithstanding any other Federal       law,'' a judgment imposing a fine ``may be enforced against       all property or rights to property of the person fined . . .       .'' 476 F.3d 1041, 1045, 1046 (9th Cir. Feb. 22, 2007)       (quoting 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3613A(d)). The Court found that this       provision overrode sections of the Employee Retirement Income       Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) prohibiting the ``alienation''       of retirement savings. Id. In doing so, the Court noted the       ``breadth of Congress's reference to ``all property or rights       to property,'' as well as its use of express language to       override a similar ``anti-alienation'' provision in the       Social Security Act of 1935 (SSA), among other things. Id. at       1047; see also, e.g., Schneider v. United States, 27 F.3d       1327 (8th Cir. 1994) (judicial review precluded by Military       Claims Act provision stating that agency determinations were       final and conclusive ``notwithstanding any other provision of       law.'').        Here, the ``notwithstanding'' clause in the HEROES Act does       not exempt ED's Waivers and Modifications from CRA. CRA does       not contain a ``specific reference'' to the HEROES Act. See 5       U.S.C. Sec. 801; 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1098bb(a)(1). As a basic       matter, however, following CRA does not conflict with the       design or policy of the HEROES Act. Congress in the HEROES       Act empowered ED to address  [[Page S856]]       ``emergency'' situations. It did this by directing ED to       waive or modify student loan provisions that it found       necessary to ``ease the burden'' on loan recipients and to       ``ensure'' that the emergency did not place them in a ``worse       position,'' among other things. Id. Sec. 1098bb(a)(2). It       also did this by directing ``no delay'' in the implementation       of ED's waivers and modifications. Id. Sec. 1098bb(d).        Consistent with these aims, CRA also specifically       contemplates the possibility of emergency actions requiring       immediate implementation. As a general matter, rules subject       to CRA may not become effective for 60 days pending       Congress's review and potential enactment of a disapproval       measure. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801, 802. But Congress in CRA allowed       agencies to find for ``good cause'' that normal delays are       ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public       interest,'' and the agency's rule may then take effect at       such time as the agency determines. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 808(2). As       in B-290125.2, then, applying CRA's requirements does not       ``interfere'' with and ``would not prevent'' ED from carrying       out emergency actions under the HEROES Act. B-290125.2, B-      290125.3, Dec. 18, 2002. If ED believes that its Waivers and       Modifications must take immediate effect-as appears to be the       case--then it need only make a ``good cause'' finding       consistent with CRA's requirements.        Context considerations provide additional support for our       conclusion that Congress did not mean to exempt HEROES Act       actions from CRA. First, CRA itself contains a clause       indicting that it should apply ``notwithstanding any other       provision of law.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 806(a). While this alone is       not definitive, Congress in the HEROES Act took express       action to override certain other provisions without taking       comparable action on CRA. Specifically, Congress said that       HEA's negotiated rulemaking requirements ``shall not apply,''       and that the HEROES Act's public-reporting requirement would       apply ``notwithstanding'' the normal reporting requirements       applicable to ED under GEPA and APA (which GEPA references).       20 U.S.C. Sec. 1098bb(d). If we interpret the       ``notwithstanding'' clause literally, as ED urges us to do,       then it was not necessary for Congress to make any of these       additional carve-outs because neither HEA, nor OEPA, nor APA       references the HEROES Act. U.S.C. Sec. 553, 20 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 1089(c), 1098a, 1232. Clearly, then, Congress       contemplated that procedural requirements like those in HEA,       GEPA, and APA could continue in force without presenting any       conflict with the ``notwithstanding'' clause; the HEROES Act       needed to address these provisions specifically to exempt ED       from their requirements.        ED also asserts that the HEROES Act speaks definitively       ``to the role of Congress vis-a-vis waivers and       modifications'' with ``its own mechanism of congressional       reporting.'' Response Letter at 6. As described above, the       HEROES Act requires ED to provide Congress with an ``impact       report'' no later than 15 months after it provides any waiver       or modification. Id. Sec. 1098bb(c). On its face, this       reporting requirement does not displace the purpose of CRA       and its requirements, which trigger before an agency takes       action. It would be wholly consistent with both CRA and the       HEROES Act for an agency to first submit a CRA report (and       find ``good cause'' to forego the normal requirements), and       then to take action pursuant to the HEROES Act, and then to       report on the impact of such actions within 15 months. See 8-      333501, Dec. 14, 2021 (finding that the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention (CDC) had to submit a CRA report in       connection with new masking requirements, but that it could       address the need for emergency implementation through a good       cause waiver); 8-333732, Jul. 28, 2022 (``While CRA does not       provide an emergency exception from its procedural       requirements . . . (it] addresses an agency's need to take       emergency action without delay.''). Indeed, over the course       of the COVID-19 public health emergency, several agencies       have submitted rules for congressional review while waiving       the delay in effective date by invoking CRA's good cause       exception. See, e.g., B-33486, Aug. 10, 2021; B-333381, Jul.       9, 2021; B-332918, Feb. 5,2021.      Issues before the Supreme Court        With this decision, we are not addressing the questions       currently before the Supreme Court in Biden v. Nebraska,       which include whether ED's Waivers and Modifications       ``exceed[ed] the Secretary [of Education]'s statutory       authority or [were] arbitrary and capricious.'' See Supreme       Court Docket No. 22-506, Questions Presented (Dec. 1, 2022),       available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/ html/gp/22-00506qp.pdf. For present purposes, we treat the       Waivers and Modifications as an exercise of the HEROES Act       authority that ED invoked to support them. We hold only that       a valid exercise of authority under the HEROES Act is subject       to CRA We need not reach the more specific conclusion about       the substantive validity of ED's Waivers and Modifications at       issue in the Supreme Court's decision in Biden v. Nebraska in       order to reach a conclusion under CRA.                                  CONCLUSION         ED's Waivers and Modifications meet the definition of a       rule under CRA and no exception applies. Therefore, ED's       Waivers and Modifications are subject to the requirement that       they be submitted to Congress. If ED finds for good cause       that normal delays are impracticable, unnecessary, or       contrary to the public interest, then its rule may take       effect at whatever date ED chooses, consistent with CRA. 5       U.S.C. Sec. 808(2).                                             Edda Emmanuelli Perez,      General Counsel.                            ____________________
