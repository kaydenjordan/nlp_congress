 Mr. President, as we debate the need for additional  coronavirus relief funding, I am pleased to join my colleagues in  commending the millions of Americans who have gone above and beyond to  help others during this pandemic.   Throughout our Nation's history, everyday heroes emerge in times of  turmoil to aid their neighbors in so many ways. The COVID-19 pandemic  is no exception. In every corner of my State, Mississippi's first  responders and healthcare providers are historically stepping into  harm's way to provide care to patients affected by the virus.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me first honor the life of  William David Martin, a paramedic with American Medical Response of  Southwest Mississippi, serving on the frontlines of Mississippi's  healthcare as COVID-19 began to spread.   Sadly, in April, he passed away from complications due to the virus.  Mr. Martin is a true hero and one example of the extent to which first  responders and healthcare workers are working to overcome this national  emergency                            ____________________     Mr. President, rural hospitals like King's Daughters  Medical Center in my hometown of Brookhaven have always been the  backbone of healthcare in Mississippi. The work of the staff at these  rural hospitals during the pandemic has been remarkable.   Dedicated nurses like my friends Larue Lambert, Tammy Livingston,  Misty Britt, Christina Miller, and their coworkers--which are so many-- toil every day under heavy stress and heart-wrenching situations to  care for patients and their families. They are lifesavers, and they are  best friends to total strangers. They take on extra shifts and duties  while doing what they can to keep morale up. They are healthcare heroes  who are enduring extreme conditions.   Doctors like Dr. Jeff Ross are working through both physical and  mental exhaustion. Yet they continue to do their job, selflessly  managing the care of their fellow Mississippians.   In the heavily affected Jackson metropolitan area, the University of  Mississippi Medical Center has brought its unique capabilities to bear.  In the early days of the pandemic, its research labs rushed to create  its own in-house COVID test. And the UMC National Telehealth Center of  Excellence quickly ramped up technology to triage patients for testing  and provide socially distanced care.   I greatly admire UMC's work with the Federal Government on best  telehealth practices during a pandemic. As potential treatments have  emerged, UMC researchers and healthcare providers have stood up eight  cutting-edge COVID clinical trials in their new clinical trials unit.   Our healthcare providers aren't the only ones who have been working  to protect the health of Mississippians. Industries across the State  have quickly pivoted to provide needed supplies to fight COVID-19. For  example, distilleries like Wonderbird Spirits in Taylor, Cathead  Distillery in Jackson, and Lazy Magnolia Brewery in Kiln made the quick  decision to begin producing hand sanitizer early in the pandemic.  Furniture companies, like Confortaire in Tupelo, stepped up to produce  needed PPE for the North Mississippi Medical Center and our local  schools. And Mississippi Prison Industries, a nonprofit that gives  incarcerated individuals the opportunity to be employed and gain work  experience, is producing up to 15,000 masks and 7,000 isolation gowns  per day.   Since the start of this pandemic, I recognized that we are dealing  with two emergencies. There is the healthcare emergency and the  economic emergency. I am proud of the many ways in which Mississippians  are helping each other weather these difficult economic times.   Mississippi bankers worked around the clock, 7 days a week, to help  small businesses access the Paycheck Protection Program loans. Our  friend Brad Jones at the Bank of Franklin in Meadville, MS, was so  helpful in keeping me abreast of the needs of our local business  owners. Because of their efforts, Mississippi ranked No. 1 in the  entire Nation in PPP loans, with nearly 50,000 loans processed. This  tireless work is helping small businesses stay open with their  employees at work.   Ensuring Mississippians have access to food has been a challenge. A  Mississippian who has been a godsend to  [[Page S4899]]  many families is Andy Mercier, who leads Merchants Foodservice in  Hattiesburg. In partnership with the Mississippi Food Network, his 800  employees have remained on the payroll and worked to provide more than  100,000 gallons of milk and nearly half a million food produce boxes to  those in need.   These USDA Farmers to Families boxes filled with food products from  Mississippi farmers and producers have sustained families and helped  our hard-hit agricultural industry.   In addition to efforts in the private sector, our churches and  nonprofits across our State are also working tirelessly for  Mississippians. St. James United Methodist Church in Columbus  coordinated with a Delta catfish producer to distribute five tons of  Mississippi farm-raised catfish to those in need in the Golden Triangle  region.   Finally, I could not stand up here today and fail to mention our  Mississippi teachers, especially as so many schools across our State  are beginning the new academic year this month.   Last spring, our teachers accepted the challenge and quickly  transitioned their classrooms to a new kind of learning through  technology and other socially distanced means. While those challenges  continue as schools navigate how best to serve students this fall, each  and every one of our teachers will be in my prayers over the next few  weeks.   In every facet of our society, we have heroes standing up to help  their neighbors during unprecedented challenges. To all of the  healthcare workers and first responders on the frontlines against this  virus, to all the researchers racing to test treatments and develop  protocols, to all of the people making hand sanitizers and PPE to help  prevent the spread of this virus, to all the bankers and small  businesses working to keep people on the payroll, to all of our  farmers, ranchers, food distributors, and grocery store workers keeping  food on the store shelves and on our tables, to all of our churches and  nonprofit organizations serving our communities, and to our teachers  who are facing challenges they could have never imagined, from the  bottom of my heart, I say thank you. Your heroic labors are noticed,  and they are greatly appreciated.   I yield the floor.
