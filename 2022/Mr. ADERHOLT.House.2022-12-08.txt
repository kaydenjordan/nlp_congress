 Madam Speaker, I am in strong opposition of H.R. 8404,  the so-called Respect for Marriage Act.   I remain steadfast in my longstanding belief that marriage, as has  been the tradition in this nation and around the world, is between one  man and one woman.   To my colleagues who may be swayed by the inadequate attempts made in  the Senate to increase religious protections in this flawed piece of  legislation: The changes simply do not do enough to protect those that  could face the harmful effects of this bill.   The overly vague provisions of this bill leave far too much to be  interpreted and decided by the courts. We, as Members of Congress,  should be compelled to protect the religious freedom of Americans and  should not leave this cornerstone of our Constitution to the whim of  the courts.   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .''   In passing this bill, our government IS making a law that prohibits  the free exercise of religion. These are not just words. They are  fundamental to our country and who we are as a people.   Moving forward, court cases concerning private entities exercising  their religious freedom, much like cases heard this week at the Supreme  Court, will face new challenges. They will now be litigated under the  rubric of a national policy in which the court could interpret someone  not recognizing same-sex marriages, or even abstaining from providing  website design services for a same sex marriage, as akin to racial  discrimination.   This bill goes far beyond the protection of same-sex marriage.  Instead, it exposes private entities to government discrimination based  solely on their deeply held religious beliefs.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this legislation  before us today.
