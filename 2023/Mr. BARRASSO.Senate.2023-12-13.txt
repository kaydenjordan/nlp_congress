 Mr. President, first, I want to congratulate my friend  and colleague from Nebraska for his excellent remarks because I am  seeing the same thing in Wyoming that he is seeing in Nebraska.   He is a former Governor of that State. He knows the people of the  State. He goes home and visits with his constituents, his friends, his  family, and they know the impact of Bidenomics and the expenses it has  had on their lives and how much more money people are having to spend  as a result of the really irresponsible actions of the Democrats and  this administration.   I hear about it every weekend. When I was at a grocery store, a lady,  last week, had a little plastic bag, and she said: This shouldn't cost  $100 for this bag of groceries. And she is right.                               Border Security    Mr. President, the other thing that I hear about at the grocery  store, in addition to the issues that the Senator from Nebraska was  talking about, is the issue of the border, and I come today to the  floor to talk about America's broken southern border--what we need to  do about it, what the concerns are, what I hear about every weekend-- because every time Americans turn on their TV, they see it. They see  what is happening at the southern border--the flood, the waves of  individuals coming across the border, not being stopped, not being  checked, and then moved into the neighborhoods across America.   Well, last week, Senator Schumer put a national security bill on the  floor. The problem is it lacked serious border security policy changes,  things that we need in this Nation. Republicans voted against it  because we know national security starts with border security. We are  going to stand firm until serious changes are made.   Since last week, the scope, the scale, the seriousness of the Biden  border crisis has accelerated. One week ago, an all-time record high of  over 12,000 illegal immigrants crossed the southern border. To put that  number into perspective, President Obama's Homeland Security Secretary,  Jeh Johnson, said this in the past. He said a thousand encounters a  day--a thousand encounters a day--would overwhelm the system. Well, it  was 12,000 each day last week--some days 10,000, some days 11, some  days 12--record numbers each and every day, 10 times the number that  President Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security said would overwhelm  the system, day after day after day.    So let's be clear about what is happening with Joe Biden and the  White House and Democrats in the majority in the U.S. Senate. Well, the  Democrats and Joe Biden have gambled with American's safety and  security. The border--the southern border--is now a hotspot for  terrorism and trafficking like we have never seen before in this  country.   This body heard last week from the Director of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, Christopher Wray. He testified in front of the Judiciary  Committee. Director Wray said this: ``Post October 7, you've seen a  veritable rogues gallery''--rogues gallery--``of terrorist  organizations calling for attacks against us''--the United States.   The head of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, said: ``I  see blinking lights everywhere.''   Everywhere he is looking, he is seeing the threat. Are any of the  Democrats in the Senate listening to him? Is there any concern from the  Senators on the Judiciary Committee?   Well, Director Wray isn't the only person to warn us that the threat  of terrorism aimed against Americans is increasing. The Homeland  Security Secretary for President Obama mentioned it in the past, and,  now, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas--the current one for  President Biden--said: We are definitely in a heightened threat  environment.   I agree with him.   President Biden would have us believe that the border, as he said, is  ``safe [and] orderly and humane.'' I don't think he has been there in a  long time to actually see what is going on, because that is not what I  witnessed just a few weeks ago when I went down there with a group of  Senators.   So what is the reality? Well, the reality is President Biden has  created the deadliest, most dangerous, and most disastrous border  crisis in our Nation's history. Democrats' definition of border  security is very different from what I am hearing about at the grocery  store in Wyoming, because the Democrats' definition of border security  is to just make it easier for illegal entry into the country: Wave them  all through. Come on in. Everything is fine.   Well, it is not. Illegal immigrants ought to be turned away.  Democrats are waving them through in record numbers.   So why is this happening? Well, it is happening because the Biden  administration is manipulating the law of the land. The administration  is hiding behind such terms as ``asylum'' and ``parole,'' and they are  using that to quickly process and move inland migrants from all around  the world by the thousands.   The night I was at the border, I was with late-night midnight patrol.  People from all around the world were coming in--three from Moldova.  They had to go through lots of different countries before they got to  come up through Central America. And, oh, by the way, they paid those  cartels dearly--the criminal element trafficking humans to be deposited  then at our border's edge.   Our laws are no longer used to determine who gets in and who stays.  The illegal immigrants make that decision, and that is wrong. Simply,  if they show up at the border, Joe Biden waves them all through. That  is the policy of the Democrats in this body. They utter a few magic  words and are released into the country.   Under President Obama--under President Obama--about 21,000 people a  year requested asylum. They are fearing for their lives. They are  feeling concerned. They are fearing what happens in their home  country--21,000 in a year under President Obama.   So what has happened with Joe Biden now? The Border Patrol agents say  that the number that was a full year from President Obama happens every  2 days, with Joe Biden and the Democrats from this body looking the  other way: Things are fine; things are secure. Two days equal a full  year from the Obama administration.   It is absolutely preposterous to argue that all of those people  qualify for asylum. We know they don't. We know it. The American people  know it. The President ought to know it. The Members of this body ought  to know it.   Ten thousand illegal immigrants, day after day, will quickly add to  over 10 million illegal immigrants into this country during 4 years of  the Biden administration. President Biden is allowing it to happen, and  Democrats in this body are encouraging him all the way. This  administration has turned what was known to be a notice to appear into  a license for illegal immigrants to disappear into the homeland.   Well, the payment for Biden's breakdown of law and order is now  coming due. The blinking lights, as the head of the FBI said, are  everywhere. If the Senate finally acted to secure the border, this  Nation would be safer, and people would rest assured in my home State  of Wyoming and, certainly, in big cities like New York and Chicago,  where the mayor of New York said the illegal immigrants are  overwhelming the system, destroying the city.   It is indisputable. So where can the Senate start? Here is an idea:  Let's fix our broken parole and asylum system. Republicans want border  enforcement, border security, real policy changes to keep our community  safe.   The American people don't have that today. So it is no surprise that  they are angry and they are afraid. This needs to change. Real border  security is a top national security need. Republicans don't need  another recordbreaking day to understand that this crisis requires  swift, serious, and substantive action.   Republicans have solutions--solutions to make our communities and our  country safer. The President and the Democrats in this body need to  include these measures in any national security bill. Otherwise, there  will not be a national security bill.   I yield the floor.
