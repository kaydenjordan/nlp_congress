 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of our Syrian Kurdish  allies who have lost thousands of men and women in the fight against  ISIS at the behest of the United States of America.   And I join my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to call on Turkey to  end its invasion of northern Syria. Giving Turkey the green light to go  into this area will go down in history as a moral and strategic  disaster.   There so many consequences, Mr. Speaker. Our Kurdish friends were  betrayed and slaughtered and are now forced to align with Syrian forces  backed by Iran creating an even bigger threat to our friend Israel.  ISIS is now unleashed, Russian troops filling our vacuum, and our other  allies wondering if we can ever be trusted again.   The Trump administration's weak sanctions are like an arsonist  calling in the fire department. Mr. Speaker, we must protect United  States soldiers, secure our nuclear weapons in Turkey, provide  humanitarian support to the Kurds, and impose crippling sanctions on  Turkey until they end their Syrian campaign, and most importantly,  pursue a diplomatic solution to end the conflict.   I want to end by thanking Mr. Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for  their bipartisan leadership. I urge adoption of this resolution.
