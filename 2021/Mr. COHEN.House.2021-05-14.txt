 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   This meaningful legislation will protect pregnant workers who have  suffered because of insufficient workplace protections, a story far too  familiar to many workers in my district in Memphis, Tennessee.   In 2018, I was shocked to read of the disturbing workplace abuses in  an XPO Logistics warehouse in Memphis, which was reported in The New  York Times. Warehouse workers were denied minor and reasonable  accommodations, like less taxing workloads and shortened work shifts.  These were pregnant workers.   As a result, several women suffered miscarriages, some of which  happened while they were still on the warehouse floor.   I, along with Congresswoman DeLauro and 97 of my colleagues, wrote to  the Education and Labor Committee to urge the 115th Congress to take  decisive action and consider the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   I also participated in the Education and Labor Committee's  subcommittee hearing on this bill last Congress.   Many pregnant workers are being forced to choose between maintaining  a healthy pregnancy and losing their jobs at a time when both their  healthcare and their economic security are crucial.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will ensure that pregnant workers  get accommodations when they need them without facing discrimination or  retaliation in the workplace by putting in place a clear, explicit  pregnancy accommodation framework similar to the accommodation standard  that has been in place for decades for workers with disabilities.   I urge passage of this bill. I include in the Record the Better  Balance report on the need for this law in spite of inaction by the  State and the need for the 14th Amendment to be invoked. About eight  States are included here.                                                       May 13, 2021.   A Better Balance Legal Analysis of State Actor Pregnancy-Related Gender                               Discrimination         Decades after Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination       Act (``PDA''), pregnant workers continue to face pernicious       and unconstitutional gender discrimination at the hands of       their employers, including state actors.        Evidence of persistent discrimination by state actors       against pregnant workers in need of accommodation warrants--      and indeed demands--Congress's exercise of its Section 5       power under the Fourteenth Amendment to remedy and deter       violations of equal protection.        In the 21st century, sex discrimination against pregnant       workers often takes the form of reliance on insidious gender       role stereotyping concerning women's place in the home and in       the workplace. Too often, such stereotypes--such as, that       motherhood and employment are irreconcilable--force pregnant       women ``to choose between having a child and having a job.''       Stereotyping surrounding pregnancy and motherhood is       pervasive, and biases can be intentional, implicit,       unconscious, or structural. For instance, a study published       in June 2020 surveying pregnant women who work in physically       demanding jobs found that 63 percent of women surveyed       worried about facing negative stereotypes related to their       pregnancy, and many avoided asking for accommodations,       sensing instead that they needed to overexert themselves       physically in order to avoid stereotyping. As a result, the       study's authors recommended ``creat[ing] better social       support for utilizing pregnancy accommodation.'' Those       pregnant women who are let go or pushed out for needing       accommodation face a double burden based on stereotyping:       After losing critical income at the very moment their growing       family needs it most, they must then fight to re-enter a job       market that assumes new mothers are less competent and       committed than fathers and their childless peers.        As the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed, such sex       role stereotyping is a problem of constitutional magnitude.       Indeed, the constitutional right to be free of invidious sex       stereotyping ``at the faultline between work and family'' is       now well-established For instance, in Nevada Department of       Human Resources v. Hibbs, the Court rejected the ``sex-role       stereotype'' that ``women's family duties trump those of the       workplace. Craig v. Boren, the Court rejected ``outdated       misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home       rather than in the 'marketplace and world of ideas.' '' And,       in Califano v. Westcott, the Court rejected ``the baggage of       sexual stereotypes that presumes the father has the primary       responsibility to provide a home and its essentials, while       the mother is the center of home and family life.''        Yet state employers continue to participate in and foster       unconstitutional sex discrimination, including gender-role       stereotyping, by failing to provide reasonable accommodations       to allow pregnant women to be both mothers and wage earners.       The problem is pervasive. To offer just a handful of       examples:        In Alabama, Devyn Williams, a correctional officer trainee,       informed her employer, the Alabama Department of Corrections,       that she was pregnant. Corrections officials immediately       began to discuss how to terminate Williams, with one deputy       commissioner commenting in an email, ``Let me guess, we have       to pay this person [Williams] through the entire       pregnancy[?]''. At officials' urging, Williams provided a       doctor's note recommending she be excused from the state's       monthly physical training session due to her pregnancy. Upon       receipt of the note, one corrections official emailed the       others, ``[t]his [doctor's note] will give us grounds to       separate [Plaintiff] from service.'' The state promptly fired       Williams. In one sense, Williams was lucky: Alabama officials       had the poor judgment to document their animus. Their emails       made explicit the unconstitutional sex stereotypes motivating       their refusal to accommodate. Employers do not always put the       animus underlying their failures to accommodate in       discoverable emails. The PDA has failed to root out such       intentional yet ``subtle [forms of] discrimination that [are]       difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis,'' thanks in part       to a proof structure that demands onerous and lengthy       litigation. (Williams was still litigating her case nearly       five years after she requested accommodation.)        In Oklahoma, Clarisa Borchert, a childcare attendant,       informed her employer, a state university child care center,       that she was pregnant. When Borchert's doctor recommended a       20-pound lifting restriction--which Borchert believed would       allow her to continue to care for infants--the state told her       that she would not be permitted to work ``with restrictions       of any kind.'' The gender-based animus underlying the state's       blanket refusal to accommodate Borchert's pregnancy was       revealed by the ``daily disparaging comments'' made by       Borchert's boss and other employees about her pregnancy. For       instance, in response to Borchert's ``severe and ongoing       nausea and vomiting caused by her pregnancy,'' her boss told       her to ``get over it'' and accused her of feigning illness,       telling Borchert that she ``wasn't  [[Page H2339]]       really sick.'' Soon thereafter, the state issued Borchert a       Separation Notice.        In New York, Lakia Jackson, a nurse technician, informed       her employer, a state university, that she was pregnant.       Jackson repeatedly requested assistance changing patients,       which her state employer denied because, in the words of her       supervisors, the university ``does not accommodate pregnant       women.'' As a result of the strain of changing one patient,       Jackson had to be rushed to the emergency room and ``nearly       [went] into pre-term labor.'' In defense of its refusal to       accommodate Jackson's pregnancy, her state employer invoked a       common sex stereotype about pregnant women: that she was       simply ``using her pregnancy as an excuse for not doing her       work.'' The state terminated her shortly thereafter.        In Tennessee, Amber Burnett, a veterinary assistant,       informed her employer, a state university, that she was       pregnant. When Burnett alerted her employer that she could       still work but that her physician had advised minimal or no       contact with diseased animals placed in isolation, her       employer told her that ``she should begin looking for another       job.'' Shortly thereafter, the state terminated her. In       justifying the termination, the state claimed concern for the       potential for harm to Burnett's pregnancy--a rationale that       the Supreme Court recognized decades ago is rooted in       impermissible sex discrimination.        In North Carolina, Lauren Burch, a special agent, informed       her employer, the state alcohol enforcement agency, that she       was pregnant. On her doctor's advice, Burch requested light       duty status to avoid ``situations that would put her at risk       for physical altercations.'' Her state employer approved the       request but assigned her to a worksite that ``required a       daily, six-hour round-trip commute'' (for which she was       provided ``no work credit for travel time'' and was forced to       use ``her personal vehicle at her own expense''). The state       refused to grant her an assignment with a shorter commute--      despite Burch's doctor's recommendation that she travel no       more than 1.5 hours--and pushed her onto unpaid leave.        In Illinois, Tracy Atteberry, a police officer, informed       her employer, the Illinois State Police, that she was       pregnant. Upon the advice of her doctor, she requested light       duty, which the state denied, despite providing light duty to       other non-pregnant employees with medical needs. Instead, the       state forced Atteberry to use up her personal time prior to       giving birth to her child.        In Oregon, Maricruz Caravantes, a caregiver, informed her       employer, a state agency, that she had a high-risk pregnancy.       Upon the advice of her doctor, Caravantes requested--and was       denied--assistance with lifting patients, causing her to       ``seriously injure[]'' her back.        In Kansas, Deanna Porter, a psychiatric aide, informed her       employer, a state hospital, that she was pregnant. When       Porter's doctor advised that she avoid lifting more than 40       pounds, the state refused to allow Porter to work with the       lifting restriction in place and sent her home. Shortly       thereafter, she was terminated.        Due to a combination of gaps in the law and narrow judicial       interpretations, Congress's efforts through the PDA to       eradicate ``the pervasive presumption that women are mothers       first, and workers second'' have ``proved ineffective for a       number of reasons.'' First, as described in A Better       Balance's report, ``Long Overdue,'' two-thirds of women lose       their PDA pregnancy accommodation claims in court. A high       percentage of these losses can be traced to courts' rejection       of pregnant workers' comparators or to workers' inability to       find a comparator, under the Supreme Court's Young framework.       The Young standard also has done little to create clarity in       the law, sowing confusion among lower courts, juries, and       litigants alike. As A Better Balance co-president Dina Bakst       testified earlier this year:        [R]ecent decisions further illustrate how steep a barrier       Young and its comparator standard have erected to proving       pregnancy discrimination in court. Workers, especially low-      wage workers--and particularly women of color--typically do       not have access to their coworkers' personnel files and do       not otherwise know how they are being treated. Often, this       information is rightly confidential, which means a pregnant       worker would be unable to find the information needed to show       they are entitled to an accommodation.        Second, litigating accommodation cases under the PDA has       proven so onerous and timeconsuming as to be wholly       ineffective in the lives of real women. As noted above, Devyn       Williams was still litigating her accommodation case nearly       five years after she requested accommodation. Such delay has       devastating consequences for pregnant workers who need       accommodation promptly, not five years later. As our co-      president testified:        Most pregnant workers do not have the resources, time, or       desire to engage in timeconsuming and stressful litigation to       attempt to obtain such information. They want, and need, to       be able to receive an accommodation promptly, so they can       continue earning income while maintaining a healthy       pregnancy.        Finally, even when pregnant workers win their PDA       accommodation cases, it is because they are lucky enough to       find the perfect comparator or, like Devyn Williams, to have       a state employer foolish enough to document their gender       animus in a ``smoking gun'' email--the kinds of evidence       courts have deemed necessary to prevail under the PDA. The       many pregnant women who lack such evidence--but who       nevertheless are denied the accommodations they need due to       their state employers' animus and stereotypes--do not bring       suit at all, a reality A Better Balance often hears from       workers on its legal helpline. If a standard is so onerous as       to prevent workers from seeking justice, that means current       law offers no adequate remedy for a pernicious,       unconstitutional form of discrimination.        The PDA's failure to combat states' record of       unconstitutional gender discrimination demands further action       by Congress. Where, as here, ``Congress ha[s] already tried       unsuccessfully'' to remedy violations of equal protection and       such ``previous legislative attempts ha[ve] failed,'' then       ``added prophylactic measures'' are justified and, indeed,       imperative. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) is just       such a measure.        The PWFA is narrow, tailored, and targeted to combat gender       discrimination, including invalid sex role stereotypes about       the place of ``mothers or mothers-to-be'' in the work sphere.       By requiring reasonable accommodation of pregnant workers       only where doing so would not cause employers undue hardship,       the PWFA is carefully crafted to deter and quickly remedy       unconstitutional sex discrimination in the hiring, retention,       and promotion of young (potentially-pregnant) women and soon-      to-become mothers. Moreover reasonable accommodations for       pregnancy are inherently time-limited, and the vast majority       of accommodations pregnant workers need, like the right to       carry a water bottle or sit on a stool at a retail counter,       are low-cost or no-cost. The minimal (or non-existent)       economic cost of a pregnancy accommodation is one reason       major industry groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,       champion the PWFA.        We urge Congress to pass this much-needed legislation:     I remind the House that we were under attack on January 6.   Earlier this week a freshman Republican said that January 6 could  have  [[Page H2347]]  been seen as just a typical tourist day in the Capitol.   Well, let me tell that gentleman that on typical tourist days in the  Capitol, 100 policemen aren't beaten by people who try to enter the  Capitol when it is closed to public attendance because of the  coronavirus.   On typical tourist days, people don't put excrement on the walls of  the Capitol of the United States.   On typical tourist days, people don't urinate on the floors of the  Capitol of the United States.   On typical days, people don't batter down the windows on the outside  to breach the Capitol.   On typical days, people don't batter down the doors and the glass  entering the Speaker's lobby, resulting in one person's death. And if  that person wasn't dead, they would have breached the floor of the  House and God knows what they would have done if they could have found  a person in the House.   They were hollering, ``Hang Mike Pence,'' ``Nancy Pelosi, where are  you? We are here.'' That was an insurrection. That was an attack on our  Constitution. It should never be forgotten by anybody who was serving  in the Congress, by any American because our liberty, our Constitution,  our country, our values were on the line.                            ____________________
