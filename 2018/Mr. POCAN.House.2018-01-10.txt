 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the bill before us that  takes away National Labor Relations Act protections for hundreds of  thousands of workers.   I support Tribal sovereignty. In my home State of Wisconsin, I am  proud the Ho-Chunk Nation is in my district. Potawatomi, Oneida,  Menominee, St. Croix, Stockbridge-Munsee, Lac du Flambeau, Lac Corte  Oreilles, Red Cliff, Bad River, and other Tribes all reside in my home  State, and I am glad to support the autonomy of those Tribal nations.  But this bill isn't about Tribal sovereignty. It is about going after  workers' rights.   Look at the track record of the majority in this Congress. The  Republicans have continued to go after workers' rights, as they have so  far. They have repealed the rule that required companies seeking large  Federal contracts to disclose violations of labor law. They made it  harder for people whose jobs are shipped overseas to get unemployment  insurance. They have made it harder for workers whose employers don't  offer retirement plans to save for retirement. They have repealed an  OSHA rule requiring employers to maintain accurate records of serious  workplace injuries for 5 years, while the administration drastically  reduces the number of OSHA inspectors.   This bill isn't about meaningful sovereignty. It is about selective  sovereignty, because it only goes after labor rights.   If this were a bill about sovereignty, it would include a number of  other areas that Tribes are compelled to follow in addition to the  National Labor Relations Act: the Occupational Safety and Health Act;  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA; the Family and  Medical Leave Act; and the public accommodations of Americans with  Disabilities Act, just to start.   If this bill was about sovereignty, it would exempt OSHA and ERISA  and the FMLA and the ADA, for starters. But it doesn't do that. This  bill only exempts labor protections for hundreds of thousands of  workers, Tribal members and nonmembers, because the majority in this  Congress isn't really worried about sovereignty. It is concerned  [[Page H119]]  about taking away the rights of workers, and that is what this bill is  really about.   Mr. Speaker, if this body wants to help Tribes, I am here to help.  Bring a bill to the floor that covers all exempted areas, and that is a  bill that I could support. But that is not what is in front of us  today.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of opposition from the  International Union of Operating Engineers, the United Auto Workers,  United Food and Commercial Workers, and Unite Here.                                             International Union of                                             Operating Engineers,                                    Washington, DC, January 8, 2018.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The International       Union of Operating Engineers opposes the Tribal Labor       Sovereignty Act, legislation contained in S. 140 (115-54)       that would eliminate the labor protections currently       guaranteed to hundreds of thousands of American workers.       Indeed, if enacted into law, this bill would constitute the       biggest rollback in labor law since the passage of the Taft-      Hartley Act in 1947.        The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE)       represents nearly 400,000 men and women across North America.       Members of the International Union of Operating Engineers       maintain and operate Native American and non-Native American       gaming facilities around the United States, from Connecticut       to California, and this legislation would have a dramatic       effect on their lives and livelihoods. The IUOE is the       second-biggest union in the hospitality sector. But this       legislation extends beyond casinos and gaming. IUOE members       work in mining and energy facilities on Native American lands       in a number of locations, and those workers eventually could       lose their rights as a result of this legislation.        In a few short words, this bill changes current law by       exempting the National Labor Relations Act from tribal       enterprises on tribal lands. Today, the National Labor       Relations Board (Board) implements a case-by-case review of       whether labor law applies to tribal enterprises.        The precedent-setting case that comes from the San Manuel       Band of Mission Indians is instructive. The Tribe operated a       92,000-sq.ft. casino (over two acres), with 1,400 employees.       Only five of the workers were Native American. The Board       determined that this large commercial establishment should       not receive the exemption from labor law provided to states       and local government because its operations were       fundamentally different than a government. The San Manuels       were not providing a public good to members of the tribe.       They were not behaving like a government. Instead, the Board       determined that when the tribal operation in question is       commercial in nature, employs significant numbers of non-      Indians, and caters to a non-Native American clientele, ``the       special attributes of sovereignty are not implicated.'' The       Board determined that private labor law applies to the San       Manuel casino, just as it would with any other commercial       operation. Federal courts have supported this interpretation.       Sovereignty does, however, apply to governmental functions of       the tribe, just as they would with any state government.        If passed, the exemption from labor law would unfairly       advantage commercial tribal operations at the expense of non-      Native American private-sector companies. Competitors with       Native American commercial operations must comply with labor       law; Native American operations will not. As mentioned above,       the bill's reach extends well beyond the gaming industry.       Tribes are engaged in a variety of commercial enterprises,       from mining and energy development, to manufacturing and       construction. Over time, it is reasonable to expect that       tribal enterprises will expand and compete more aggressively       with non-Native companies in a wide variety of commercial       sectors, without any concern for the rights of workers.        Tribal labor law is woefully inadequate--virtually non-      existent in most tribes around the country. It is no       replacement for the nation's basic legal framework that       protects workers' rights. Eliminating the NLRA for tribal       enterprises will strip away freedoms guaranteed to Americans       today, including hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal       casinos who are not Native American. S. 140 (115-54) would       immediately eliminate the rights of thousands of Operating       Engineers in workplaces all over the United States.        The International Union of Operating Engineers opposes S.       140 (115-54), which eliminates nearly one-million workers'       individual right to take collective action to improve their       working conditions, and respectfully urges you to oppose it       when it comes to the floor of the House of Representatives on       Wednesday.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                 James T. Callahan,      General President.                                   ____           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and             Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                   Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million       active and retired members of the International Union, United       Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of       America (UAW), I urge you to vote against S. 140, because it       includes provisions from the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act       (H.R. 986). This misguided bill would deny protection under       the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to hundreds of       thousands of workers employed by tribal casinos. This       legislation could also impact dozens of other businesses,       including power plants, mining operations, and hotels.        UAW believes strongly in tribal sovereignty and has a       strong record of supporting civil rights. This bill, however,       is misleading. It is an attack on fundamental collective       bargaining rights and would strip workers in commercial       enterprises of their rights and protections under the NLRA.       Under the terms of this bill, when a labor contract expires,       a tribe could unilaterally terminate the bargaining       relationship with the union without legal consequence under       the NLRA, because the employer's obligation to bargain could       be eliminated. As a result of having a union and a legally       binding contract, hundreds of dealers have been promoted to       benefited and supervisory positions because of provisions in       the contract that maintain minimum percentages of full-time,       part-time, and supervisory positions. Work rules, wages, and       benefits have all improved because of the right to       collectively bargain. This bill would jeopardize these hard-      fought gains.        The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act seeks to overturn a       decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in San       Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, 341 NLRB No. 138 (2004). In       that decision, the Board concluded that applying the NLRA       would not interfere with the tribe's autonomy and the effects       of the NLRA would not ``extend beyond the tribe's business       enterprise and regulate intramural matters.'' The ruling does       not apply in instances where its application would ``touch       exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural       matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights.'' The NLRB has       taken a nuanced view on this matter and has ruled on a case-      by-case basis. Congressional interference is not justified.        Supporters of the bill argue that the bill creates parity       for the tribes with state and local governments who are not       covered under the NLRA. However, there are some significant       differences. Tribes are exempt from employment laws (Title       VII of the Civil Rights Act) that apply to state and local       governments, whereas private sector contractors work       extensively on behalf of state and local governments and       generally must comply with the NLRA. Non-tribal members       cannot petition a tribe for labor legislation, while workers       employed by a state or local government have a voice with       their elected leaders. This is significant because 75 percent       of Native American gaming employees are not tribal members.       At Foxwoods, where the UAW represents the workers, well over       98 percent of employees and patrons are not tribal members.       Hundreds of tribal gaming facilities make tens of billions in       revenue annually, and these employees are working for what is       simply a commercial operation competing with non-tribal       businesses.        At a time of growing wealth inequality and a shrinking       middle class, the last thing Congress should do is deprive       workers of their legally enforceable right to form unions and       bargain collectively. We urge you to oppose S. 140.            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                             UFCW,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.      To All Members of the U.S. House of Representatives.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.3 million members       of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union       (UFCW), I am writing to express our strong opposition to the       Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act as rolled into a bill that will       be reported as S. 140.        UFCW is proud to represent 1,000 members at casinos that       operate on tribal lands. These workers have joined together       to bargain collectively for good wages, decent benefits, and       a voice on the job. Passage of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty       Act would take that voice away.        We support sovereignty for tribal governments, but the       Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is so broad that it would       prevent any worker from exercising their freedom of       association under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).       The vast majority tribal casino workers are not tribal       members and therefore have no voice in tribal policy and are       not protected under tribal law.        Most federal laws protecting the workplace apply to tribal       businesses including the Employee Retirement Income Security       Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the       Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and NLRA. The NLRA should       not be treated any differently than these other important       laws that protect workers.        There are many differences between state and local       governments and tribal businesses. State and local       governments do not operate multi-billion dollar commercial       Enterprises, nor manage enterprises where the majority of the       employees and customers are from outside of the jurisdiction.       If working people don't like state and local government       policy  [[Page H120]]       they can change management by voting for different lawmakers,       while non-tribal employees and customers have no meaningful       way to influence tribal policy.        Congress should be working to expand the rights of American       workers, not take them away. We urge you to stand up for       American workers and oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Perrone,      International President.                                   ____                                                      UNITE HERE!,                                                       Las Vegas, NV        Dear Representative: UNITE HERE represents over 275,000       hardworking men and women in the hospitality industry and       strongly urges you to oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act       (H.R. 986).        Like most Americans, our members have a deep respect for       Native Americans and their role in shaping our nation. Our       members also have a deep and abiding respect for the rights       of American workers and to uphold the laws that govern our       nation and all of its citizens.        This brings me to H.R. 986. This bill would exempt all       businesses owned and operated by Indian nations from the       National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Tribal businesses,       including but not limited to Indian-owned casinos, have       workforces and customers that are almost all non-Indian. If       this bill were to become law, American citizens working for       Native American businesses would lose their U.S. rights under       the NLRA, including ``full freedom of association'' and       ``self-organization'' without ``discrimination.'' Over the       last 30 years, as Indian enterprises entered the stream of       interstate commerce, a number of federal laws protecting the       workplace have been applied to Indian businesses: Employee       Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety       and Health Act (OSHA), Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and       National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Congress should not       treat the rights Americans have under the NLRA any       differently than these other important laws that protect       American workers.        Much has been made of the need for this bill to give tribal       governments ``parity'' with state and local governments. This       comparison is misleading, if not absurd. States and local       governments do not typically operate multi-billion dollar       commercial enterprises. States and local governments do not       typically run enterprises where the overwhelming majority of       the government's employees are from outside of their       jurisdiction and the overwhelming majority of customers are       also from outside of their jurisdiction. In a state or       locality, if the citizens who live there don't like the       government's policies, they can vote for people to change       those policies. The non-tribal employees and customers have       no meaningful way to influence tribal policies.        In this time of incredible income inequality in our       country, Congress should be working to expand the rights of       American workers, not finding ways to take them away. H.R.       986 is no different than the laws signed by Governors Scott       Walker (R-WI) and Rick Snyder (R-MI): they attack the basic       rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain.        Please stand up for American workers and join our union to       oppose H.R. 986.            Sincerely,                                                         D. Taylor.
