 If you are going to have representative government, you  have to have dialogue between constituents and those of us elected.   Last week, I continued my annual 99 county meetings with Q&A's in 12  of our 99 counties.   No matter the setting, Iowans set the agenda at my meetings. Holding  face-to-face meetings is the best way to hear what is on Iowans' minds,  but it is not the only way.   I encourage Iowans to write in or call my office to voice their  opinions on any Federal issue. Iowans can also read my speeches and  press releases on grassley.senate.gov; follow me on Facebook or on  Twitter @chuckgrassley or @senatorchuckgrassley on Instagram.   I enjoyed my conversations with Iowans last week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
