 Mr. President, today along with Senator Carper, I am  introducing the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act. This  bill would ensure that we have accurate information about the extent of  mercury pollution in the United States.   A comprehensive national mercury monitoring network is needed to  protect human health, safeguard fisheries, and track the effect of  emissions reductions. This tracking is particularly important in light  of increasing mercury emissions from other countries, including a  substantial amount of mercury emissions from China. Mercury can be  transported around the globe, meaning emissions and releases can affect  human health and environment even in remote locations.   The issue of mercury emissions is growing in importance around the  world. In 2013, the United States was the first Nation to join and sign  the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global agreement to reduce  mercury pollution. The Minamata Convention has been signed by more than  125 countries and raises the issue that mercury poses a global threat  to human health. At present, scientists must rely on limited  information to understand the critical linkages between mercury  emissions and environmental response and human health. Successful  design, implementation, and assessment of solutions to the mercury  pollution problem require comprehensive long-term information. A system  for collecting such information, such as we have for acid rain and  other pollution, does not currently exist for mercury--a much more  toxic pollutant.   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant ecological and public  health concern, especially for children and pregnant women. It is  estimated that approximately 200,000 children born in the U.S. per year  are exposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high enough to  impair neurological development. Mercury exposure has gone down as U.S.  mercury emissions have declined; however, levels remain far too high.   By accurately quantifying regional and national changes in  atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation of  mercury in fish and wildlife in response to changes in mercury  emissions, a monitoring network would help policy makers, scientists,  and the public to better understand the sources, consequences, and  trends in mercury pollution in the United States. We must have more  comprehensive information and we must have it soon; otherwise, we risk  making misguided policy decisions.   Specifically, the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act  would:   Direct EPA, in conjunction with the Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S.  Geological Survey, National Park Service, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Association, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to  establish a national mercury monitoring program to measure and monitor  mercury levels in the air and watersheds, water and soil chemistry, and  in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms across the nation;   Establish a scientific advisory committee to advise on the  establishment, site selection, measurement, recording protocols, and  operations of the monitoring program;   Establish a centralized database for existing and newly collected  environmental mercury data that can be freely accessed on the Internet  and is comprised of data that is compatible with similar international  efforts;   Require a report to Congress every two years on the program,  including trends, and an assessment of the reduction in mercury  deposition rates that need to be achieved in order to prevent adverse  human and ecological effects every four-years; and   Authorize $95 million over three years to carry out the Act.   We must establish a comprehensive, robust national monitoring network  [[Page S5993]]  for mercury to provide the data needed to help make decisions to  protect the people and environment of Maine and the United States.                                  ______                                          By Mr. WYDEN:    S. 3403. A bill to authorize transitional sheltering assistance for  individuals who live in areas with unhealthy air quality caused by  wildfires, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs.
