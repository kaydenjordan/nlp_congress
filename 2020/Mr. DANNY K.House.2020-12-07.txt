 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the period during which  slavery legally existed represents the most horrific and most sordid  period in the history of the United States; therefore, I commend and  thank Representative G.K. Butterfield for facilitating and anchoring  this Special Order highlighting the importance and relevance and impact  of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments on changing America.   Of course, we know that the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, the  14th Amendment gave Blacks and former slaves citizenship, and the 15th  Amendment gave newly freed slaves the right to vote.   The period preceding, during, and after the Civil War, known as  Reconstruction, is not only one of the most sordid, but the most  violent and most repressive periods in our history.   The most interesting part of all of this, though, is not yesterday.  The most interesting part is that there are individuals and groups in  our country today who are attempting to take us back to that period,  and we can never let that happen.                                time  1645    In U.S. News Today, there is an article defining how some historians,  some boards of education, some school boards have attempted to rewrite  and teach a history that is very different than the real history.   When you consider the number of individuals who are part of the mass  incarceration system who are forced to work for nothing and whose  rights are suspended, that takes us back a ways. And when you consider  efforts to prevent and make it difficult or basically impossible for  people to vote, that nullifies the 15th Amendment.   So you see, Brother Butterfield, when you consider the times that we  are in, one would have to conclude that the 13th, 14th, and 15th  Amendments are all under serious attack, and we must glory in the fact  that we have overcome some of the obstacles, but we also must be  vigilant, vigilant to the extent of never going back to that period.   We must be able to say even as a 12-year old girl said when she wrote  a little poem that said: No chains on my hands, no chains on my feet,  but the chains on my mind are keeping me from being free.   So I thank you again for anchoring this Special Order, and I thank  you for reminding us that freedom is a hard-won thing. Each generation  has to win it and win it again.
