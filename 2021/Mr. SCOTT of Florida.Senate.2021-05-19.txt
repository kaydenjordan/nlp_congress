 Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic was  devastating to our Nation and Congress came together in a bipartisan  fashion to provide unprecedented relief for 2020.   Unfortunately, Democrats ditched that bipartisan approach in their  so-called COVID bill, the American Rescue Plan, which was full of  wasteful spending which has nothing to do with the crisis. It didn't  receive a single Republican vote. Only 10 percent of the funds in the  American Rescue Plan are related to COVID-19 and spending for vaccines  is less than 1 percent.   With our Nation nearly $30 trillion in debt and rising inflation,  this spending is irresponsible and reckless.   One of the more ridiculous examples of waste was $350 billion  included for State and local bailouts, even though our States are doing  just fine. In fact, California just announced it will have a $75  billion surplus. Reckless spending has consequences, and we need to be  fiscally responsible in every use of taxpayer dollars.   This amendment would simply pay for the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act and all provisions of this bill by using unobligated,  unnecessary funding for the American Rescue Plan. I ask for your  support.    Madam President, I am proud to stand today in  support of our great ally Israel. Israel is a vibrant democracy that  supports capitalism, champions human rights, and holds free and open  elections. Since its reestablishment in 1948, the United States has  been Israel's most fervent supporter, and my home State of Florida has  maintained a strong relationship with Israel throughout these years.   As Governor, I took a stand against discrimination and prohibited  State agencies and local governments from contracting with companies  boycotting Israel. I also signed legislation to ensure the State of  Florida will not support those who participate in the BDS movement.   I traveled to Israel three times as the Governor of Florida to  support our strong economic partnership and celebrate the opening of  the new Embassy in Jerusalem. Israel's economic strength is key to its  ability to defend itself and our common interests.   Last Congress, I was proud to cosponsor a bill recognizing Israel's  sovereignty over the Golan Heights and also supported the Eastern  Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act to promote security  and energy partnerships in the Eastern Mediterranean.   While I visited Israel numerous times, my most recent trip as Senator  gave me a clear perspective on Israel's proximity to its enemies Hamas,  Hezbollah, ISIS, and Iran. For decades, the people of Israel have  endured unyielding attacks from terrorist groups, like Hamas, which  with Iran's support and funding wish to destroy the Jewish State and  its people.   Now, as thousands of rockets rain down, our resolve to stand with  Israel must be stronger than ever. I want to be clear: Israel has every  right to defend and protect its people from terrorist attacks and to do  whatever is necessary to stop the murder of its citizens and foreign  nationals residing in Israel.   No country--certainly not the United States--would allow the murder  of its citizens. The terrorists blasting these rockets into Israel are  the same terrorists that chant ``Death to America.'' They don't believe  in democracy, and they want Israel wiped off the face of the Earth. As  our great ally and the only shining example of democracy in the Middle  East, Israel deserves our full support. Today and every day, the United  States must align with those fighting for freedom and democracy,  clearly denounce terrorism, and stand up against those who do not  respect human rights.   The Trump administration made tremendous efforts to facilitate peace  and prosperity between our great ally Israel and neighboring Arab  nations, but we see the Biden administration trying to unravel this  progress and appease illegitimate Palestinian leaders, demonstrating  once again the Democrats' reckless disregard for the security and  prosperity of Israel.   The Palestinian leadership, which has been operating as a  dictatorship for 15 years, had their last election for President in  2005. Biden has restored U.S. aid to the Palestinians, who openly  support terrorism, wage war against Israel, and do not recognize its  existence.   I am disgusted to see the anti-Israel agenda being pushed by the  radical left. The Biden administration can't go down this path. They  need to stop trying to rejoin the horrible Iran deal. Biden needs to  stop his weak and misguided strategy and keep maximum pressure on the  Ayatollah until Iran is no longer a threat to U.S. national security.   Israel deserves our full support; Israel deserves the right to peace  and security; Israel deserves the right to protect its people from  reprehensible terrorist attacks; and Israel deserves the right to take  whatever means are necessary to stop the murder of its citizens and  foreign nationals residing in Israel.   Because we have no greater ally in our efforts to preserve peace and  secure our interests in the Middle East, I am proud to lead 29 of my  colleagues today to condemn the escalating attacks by Hamas against  Israel and thank them for joining me on this effort.   The resolution reaffirms the unwavering commitment of the United  States to Israel and its right to take whatever means necessary to stop  the murder of its citizens and foreign nationals residing in Israel. It  is time for the U.S. Senate to say that enough is enough and  unanimously adopt this resolution to make it clear that the United  States stands with Israel. These terrorists need to know that acts of  aggression toward Israel will never be tolerated.   President Biden should take immediate action to remind these  terrorists and the world of the strong and unwavering support of the  United States for the Israeli people, and we should stop cowering to  the anti-Israel radical left.   I look forward to my colleagues joining me today to stand with  Israel.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senat proceed to the consideration  of S. Res. 226, submitted earlier today. I further ask that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.     Madam President, today is a sad day for the  U.S. Senate, and one we will not forget. No one in this body supports  the loss of innocent lives--no one. But let me be very clear about what  we just witnessed. We just saw the Democratic Party completely abandon  the sovereignty of Israel in support of a terrorist organization. The  radical left is fully embracing the lie of false equivalence and  refuses to plainly state: Israel has the right to defend itself,  period.   The resolution I offered today simply reaffirms our support of  Israel, one of our greatest allies and our most important ally in the  Middle East. And it condemns the escalating terrorist attacks against  Israel.   This isn't controversial. In fact, it is in line with everything  America has stood for, for generations. It is actually in line with  what my colleague just wrote in his op-ed for the New York Times. He  said: ``No one is arguing that Israel, or any government, does not  [[Page S2772]]  have the right to self-defense or to protect its people.'' So why is he  objecting to this today? Does he agree with the radical left that the  United States shouldn't follow through with a critical arms sale to  Israel as it continues to face attacks?   It was not long ago that the Senate, including my colleague, stood  with Israel on a bipartisan basis. In fact, in 2014, when Israel was  again subject to a barrage of rockets targeting innocent Israelis,  then-Majority Leader Reid offered a resolution supporting Israel's  right to defend itself against Hamas.   The 2014 resolution even acknowledges the simple truth that ``Hamas  refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist.'' It also said: ``Hamas  refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist.'' It says: ``Hamas uses  rockets to indiscriminately target civilians in Israel.'' It says:  ``Hamas intentionally uses civilians as human shields.'' And it  resolved to ``condemn Hamas's terrorist actions.''   The Senate, including my colleague, unanimously supported then- Majority Leader Reid's resolution supporting Israel's right to defend  itself against Hamas and never said at that time that the resolution  would embolden Hamas. Yet, today, something has changed for my  colleague. You are seeing a growing and dangerous anti-Israel agenda  permeate the Halls of Congress. Israel is a country surrounded by  nations and terrorist groups that want it wiped off the face of the  Earth. And as rockets rain down in Israel, my colleague refuses to  stand with our ally.   I will say it again. Today is a sad day for the U.S. Senate and one  we will not forget. I will never accept a weakened position on Israel-- never. I will never stop fighting to support Israel and ensure the  Biden administration upholds the longstanding and special partnership  between the United States and Israel.   I yield the floor                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 225     Madam President, reserving the right to object,  my colleague is wrong for trying to boil this down in an attempt to  distract from the reality we are seeing here today.   The radical left is fully embracing the lie of false equivalence and  refuses to plainly state: Israel has the right to defend itself,  period.   My colleague's resolution offers nothing supporting Israel's rightful  efforts to stop this repeated cycle of violence. No one in this body  welcomes the loss of innocent life--no one. But we cannot and I will  not accept the left's ignorance of the evil and devastating role Iran  plays in funding and supporting Hamas, the terrorist organization  responsible for taking innocent lives.   My colleague's resolution offers nothing to condemn Iran, the world's  largest state sponsor of terrorism. My colleague's resolution offers  nothing to condemn Hamas.   Here is the difference between Israel and Hamas. Hamas uses its  rockets to kill innocent Israelis. Israel uses its rockets to defend  its people. It should not be difficult for the Senate to simply  reaffirm our support of Israel, one of our greatest allies and our most  important ally in the Middle East, and condemn the escalating terrorist  attacks against Israel and its right to end the murder of its citizens.   It wasn't difficult to get that done in 2014, when my colleague and  every other Member of the Senate unanimously supported then-Majority  Leader Reid's resolution supporting Israel's right to defend itself  against Hamas. The same resolution also said: ``Hamas refuses to  recognize Israel's right to exist.'' It says: ``Hamas uses rockets to  indiscriminately target civilians in Israel.'' And it says: ``Hamas  intentionally uses civilians as human shields.'' And it resolved to  ``condemn Hamas's terrorists actions.''   So what does my colleague believe has changed about the facts on the  ground since then? Here is what has changed. The Democrats now have a  powerful and growing anti-Israel caucus in their party who defend  terrorism against Israel. The Democratic Party has abandoned American  values, and now they are abandoning American allies.   And, as I said earlier, we can't allow this dangerous anti-Israel  agenda to permeate the Halls of Congress. We can't allow a blatant  blind eye to be turned to Israel.   Israel is a country surrounded by nations and terrorist groups that  want it wiped off the face of Earth. I will never accept a weakened  position on Israel--never. And I am not going to stop fighting to  support Israel and ensure the Biden administration upholds a  longstanding and special partnership between the United States and  Israel.   Therefore, I object.
