 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 2273) to extend the period during which  vessels that are shorter than 79 feet in length and fishing vessels are  not required to have a permit for discharges incidental to the normal  operation of the vessel, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
