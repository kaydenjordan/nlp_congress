 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the partisan $1.9  trillion spending bill before us today.   It is shameful that Democrats have disregarded their obligation to  provide real COVID relief to the American people and are instead  attempting to use this process to jam through partisan agenda items.   This bill is not targeted, timely, nor tied to COVID relief. We need  to focus on solving the critical issues at hand: getting vaccines to  Americans; providing relief for our local businesses, restaurants, and  entertainment venues; and supporting those who have been seriously  impacted by this pandemic.   Only 9 percent of this massive $1.9 trillion package goes to fighting  COVID-19, and outside of stimulus payments, nearly half won't even be  spent this year. It is simply unfathomable that Democrats want to spend  money years down the road when we have so many pressing needs to  address today.   We have worked in a bipartisan manner to pass five--five--relief  measures, and I am disappointed that the Democrats have decided to be  so egregiously partisan in a time of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.                            ____________________
