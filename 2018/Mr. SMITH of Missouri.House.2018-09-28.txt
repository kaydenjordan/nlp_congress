 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  legislation.   Last year, Congress partnered with our President, President Trump, to  lower taxes and put more money in the hands of our American people. I  heard from the other side how the tax cut was just basically crumbs and  scraps. But in my district in southern Missouri, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act makes a real difference.   In the 9 months that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has passed, I have  traveled throughout my district, and I have seen small businesses in  West Plains, Missouri that told me: Congressman, because of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, I can now build a new building.   I have spoken to workers in St. James, in Rolla, in Caruthersville,  in Cape Girardeau, in Perryville, in Sikeston, in Malden, in Bernie, in  Gainesville, in Theodosia, and all the other 29 counties in our  congressional district of how their wages have increased and how these  employees have benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I have spoken to mothers who, because of their wages being increased,  were able to purchase new child seats in their cars. These were real  tax breaks. These were real advantages. For people in my congressional  district, the median income is $40,000 a year. It is not scraps. It is  not crumbs. It makes a real difference. It is car payments, it is house  payments, and it is food on the table.   Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that this is permanent. This bill  was not permanent because of some arcane Senate rules that allowed it  to just be temporary. I am hoping that the other side will join us  today in making sure that we deliver this tax relief permanently for  families in southeast Missouri and families throughout this country.
