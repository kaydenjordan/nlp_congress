 Mr. Speaker, it has been proven all over the  world that the most wasteful, least economical, least efficient way to  spend money is to turn it over to the Federal Government. If this was  not true, then places like Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela would be  heavens on Earth. Socialism simply does not work.   Money left in the private sector does much more to create jobs and  hold down prices than does any money turned over to government. A  business that continually wastes money and operates inefficiently will  eventually go out of business.   A government agency that wastes money or operates inefficiently just  uses that as an excuse to ask for higher appropriations. This is what  the tax cut bill is all about: an effort to leave more money in the  private sector, where it will create jobs and hold down prices.   Wealthy elitists come out ahead, even under our socialist, Big  Government systems. Lower income people come out better when more money  is left in private hands to create jobs and hold prices down.   College graduates often wonder why they can't find good jobs. In  large part, it is because our Federal, State, and local corporate taxes  are too high, and this has caused us to lose millions of good jobs to  other countries.   Mr. Speaker, we need lower taxes.                            ____________________
