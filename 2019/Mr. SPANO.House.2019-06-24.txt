 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Ranking Member Diaz- Balart and Chairman Price for working together on the bipartisan en  bloc package that passed the House this afternoon. That package  included my amendment to increase funding for commercial space  activities at the FAA by $8 million.   In Florida, and all over the country, we are seeing the commercial  space industry continue to grow rapidly, and the launch frequency is  only expected to increase.   The 5-year FAA reauthorization, which received strong, bipartisan  support and was signed into law at the end of the 115th Congress,  recognized the need to begin increasing funding for the Office of  Commercial Space Transportation. My amendment increased funding to $33  million, the fiscal year 2019 authorized level. This will ensure the  Office of Commercial Space Transportation has the resources necessary  to facilitate increased commercial space launches and reentries.                            ____________________
