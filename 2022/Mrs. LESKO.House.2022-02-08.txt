 Mr. Speaker, I was just listening to Congressman LaMalfa  from California, and I couldn't agree with him more.   Here we are, in the United States, where crime is skyrocketing.  Fentanyl is crossing the border in record amounts and is the number one  cause of death for ages 18 through 45.   Here, today, I see this headline. I just googled it and came up with  this one from blackenterprise.com. The headline says: ``Biden  administration to fund the distribution of crack pipes and syringes to  promote `racial equity.' ''   ``On Monday, applications closed for the Biden administration's new  $30 million grant program to provide crack pipes and `smoking kits' to  promote `racial equity.' ''   Are you kidding me? Our crime is rising, and this is what the Biden  administration thinks is the priority? It is nuts.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am going to read off some headlines. The  first one is from the New York Post. It says, ``Fentanyl now leading  cause of death among teens in Arizona border county.'' In the article  it says, ``Fentanyl overdoses have overtaken car crashes as the leading  cause of death among teenagers in an Arizona border county, as Governor  Doug Ducey blames President Biden's neglect of the U.S. border for the  rise in lethal drugs coming into the country.''   The next article is from a TV station in Tucson, and it is entitled,  ``Arizona poison centers sound alarm as fentanyl overdoses spike.''   Another article, and this one is from The Center Square. ``Arizona  seizes record amount of fentanyl, now cited as leading cause of death  of Americans between 18 and 45.'' It goes on to say, ``Authorities in  Arizona seized $9 million worth of fentanyl pills in the State's  largest bust of the illicit drug--enough, they said, to kill half the  population of Arizona.'' Wow. It goes on to say, ``Fentanyl has become  the drug of choice of the Mexican Sinaloa cartel, which controls the  U.S.-Mexico border stretching from California to El Paso, Texas.''                                time  1845    `` `This is not a recreational drug' Scottsdale Police Department  Chief Jeff Walther said. `This is death.' Two milligrams is a lethal  dose. A teaspoon holds about 5,000 milligrams, enough to kill 2,500  people. One pound of fentanyl, or 453,592 milligrams, could kill  226,796 people.''   The next headline, and this is from NBC News: ``Fentanyl Deaths from  `Mexican oxy' pills hit Arizona hard.'' And just a couple things it  says in this article: Aaron Francisco Chavez swallowed at least one of  the sky blue pills at a Halloween party before falling asleep  forever.''   He and three other teenagers took this drug.   And it says the four thought they were taking oxycodone. They didn't  know that it was laced with fentanyl. ```It's the worst I have seen in  30 years, this toll that it's taken on families,' said Doug Coleman,  the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge of  Arizona. `The crack (cocaine) crisis was not as bad.'''   These are just some of the headlines, ladies and gentlemen. And I  live in the border State of Arizona. We are impacted greatly.   I call on President Biden. I plead with President Biden: Come down to  the border. See it for yourself. Talk to the Border Patrol agents. They  will show you all of the fentanyl pills that they have seized. But we  know that there is a lot they haven't even caught, and it is coming  into our communities. It is killing our kids. It is killing our  brothers. It is killing our sisters. Please, President Biden, take this  seriously and secure the border now.
