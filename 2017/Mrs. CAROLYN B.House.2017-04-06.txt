 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for her leadership on this bill and in so many other areas. I  also thank Chairmen Hensarling and Huizenga; and, of course, my good  friend and colleague from the great State of New York, Nydia Velazquez,  the champion for small businesses; and Mr. McHenry, who has spent a  great deal of his time focusing on job creation and access to capital  for small businesses.   This bill passed in the last Congress under suspension with  overwhelming bipartisan support. This bill is intended to make it  easier for startup companies to raise money from sophisticated  investors by allowing sophisticated angel investors to pool their money  into a single venture capital fund, which allows them to leverage their  resources and make investments more effectively.   The bill does this by increasing the number of investors who can  invest in venture capital funds that are exempt from SEC oversight.   Under current law, a fund can be exempt from SEC oversight if it has  fewer than 100 investors and its securities are not offered publicly.  This is the exemption that the majority of venture capital funds  currently rely on.   Venture capital funds are long-term investors that provide much- needed equity capital to startups and other small companies. The fact  that venture capital funds are subject to the same limitation on the  number of investors they can have as other private funds, like hedge  funds and private equity funds, has limited the growth of venture  capital funds.    Specifically, it has limited the ability of angel investors--all of  whom are sophisticated, accredited investors--to coordinate their  investments by grouping together into a single venture capital fund in  order to invest in a promising startup company.   This bill will accommodate these types of angel investors who want to  coordinate their investments by increasing the number of accredited  investors they can have before they are required to register with the  SEC--from 100 investors to 250 investors.   The bill is also narrowly tailored to avoid raising investor  protection concerns. It only raises the investor threshold to 250 for  venture capital funds that meet the SEC's rigorous five-part definition  of a venture capital fund.   Finally, the bill is limited to funds that have less than $10 million  in capital invested. So we are only providing relief to relatively  small venture capital funds that do not pose a huge risk to the capital  markets.   This bill is the product of genuine hard work and bipartisan  compromise. Again, I thank Mr. McHenry for his leadership, along with  Ms. Velazquez, Ranking Member Waters, and Chairman Hensarling for their  hard work on this bill.   I urge my colleagues to join me--and I believe the majority in this  body--in supporting this important bill to provide easier and better  access to capital for small businesses.
