 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2453) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program in the  Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2453         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Intelligence Rotational       Assignment Program Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INTELLIGENCE ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM.         Section 844 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       414) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(b) Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program.--        ``(1) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish an       Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program as part of the       Rotation Program under subsection (a).        ``(2) Administration.--The Chief Human Capital Officer, in       conjunction with the Chief Intelligence Officer, shall       administer the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program       established pursuant to paragraph (1).        ``(3) Eligiblity.--The Intelligence Rotational Assignment       Program established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be open       to employees serving in existing analyst positions within the       Department's Intelligence Enterprise and other Department       employees as determined appropriate by the Chief Human       Capital Officer and the Chief Intelligence Officer.        ``(4) Coordination.--The responsibilities specified in       paragraph (3)(B) of subsection (a) that apply to the Rotation       Program under such subsection shall, as applicable, also       apply to the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program under       this subsection.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security currently has nine  designated component intelligence programs with trained analysts who  could benefit from an authorized, better organized rotation program. In  order to truly develop homeland security intelligence expertise, the  DHS has to develop and expand programs to cross-train their broad cadre  of analysts.   One of the major lessons we learned from the September 11 terror  attacks was the vital need to connect the dots by sharing information  across analytical silos and across agencies. The bill we are  considering today builds upon this foundation by authorizing a rotation  program for intelligence analysts across the Department.   Having served as an intelligence analyst in the Marine Corps and in  the intelligence community, including at the National Counterterrorism  Center and the Drug Enforcement Agency, I know firsthand the value of  analysts gaining experience in different mission areas and broadening  their analytical skills.   H.R. 2453, the DHS Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act of  2017, supports the effort to develop an integrated workforce of  analysts that will ultimately develop a homeland security intelligence  expertise. The bill authorizes the Intelligence Rotational Assignment  Program, or IRAP, and directs the Department to promote and reward  participation.   There is an existing IRAP, but based on oversight efforts over the  past year, it is clear the DHS needs a more integrated, coordinated,  and transparent rotation program. For example, numerous intelligence  components are not aware of the IRAP's existence, and it is not being  coordinated with other rotational programs offered by the Department or  the intelligence community at large.   Moreover, a recent joint inspector general review involving IGs from  the intelligence community, the DHS, and the Department of Justice  specifically referenced the creation of the IRAP as an important step  to help unify the DHS intelligence enterprise, but noted the lack of  incentives to encourage participation in this initiative. So this  legislation seeks to address these shortcomings by authorizing the IRAP  and providing the program with a management structure and participation  incentives.   Having a robust analyst rotation program is important for a number of  reasons. First, it offers key professional development opportunities to  analysts by exposing them to the legal authorities, collection  capabilities, and data sets associated with different intelligence  offices across the DHS. It also is an important building block in the  development of homeland security intelligence as a core competency  above and beyond individual mission areas at the Department.   Finally, the IRAP enhances the cohesion of the DHS intelligence  enterprise by exposing intelligence analysts to their counterparts in  one of the eight other intelligence components, thus encouraging them  to see themselves as part of the larger DHS intelligence enterprise.   In short, this bill promotes a more robust intelligence analyst  rotation program to ensure the Department is building a network of  employees with a true homeland security intelligence expertise.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will make the country more safe. I urge my  colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                 Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I understand H.R. 2453, 2468, and       2470 are slated for consideration on the suspension calendar       next week. All three bills amend the Homeland Security Act of       2002 to make certain improvements in the laws administered by       the Secretary of Homeland Security by requiring the       Secretary, acting through the Chief Intelligence Officer of       the Department, to perform specific intelligence-related       functions. All three bills are virtually identical to       specific provisions contained in H.R. 2825, the House-passed       ``Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017''       for which I wrote to you about on June 27, 2017. Accordingly,       since H.R. 2453, 2468, and 2470 implicate National       Intelligence Program (NIP)-funded activities, I expect that       they would be sequentially referred to the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence (the Committee).        As discussed in previous correspondence regarding H.R.       2825, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters on       January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to       clarify the Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over NIP-      funded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).       The January 2017 Exchange of Letters affirmed that,       consistent with the Rules of the House of Representatives,       the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is the vehicle that       through which Congress authorizes annual appropriations for       the NIP, including NIP-funded elements of the Department of       Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those Letters made       explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security would not       report to the House any bill that authorizes any elements of       DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such bill is       reported by the Committee  [[Page H7233]]       on Homeland Security, this Committee will request a       sequential referral of the bill.        In order to expedite the House's consideration of H.R.       2453, 2468, and 2470, the Committee will forego consideration       of all three measures. This courtesy, is however, conditioned       on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no       way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with       respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matter contained in these bills or any similar measure. It is       also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security's       adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017       Exchange of Letters.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and would request that you include in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of all three       bills, a copy of this letter, your response, and the January       2017 Exchange of Letters, including the Memorandum. Thank you       for your cooperation in this matter.            Best Regards,                                                       Devin Nunes,                                                          Chairman.        Enclosure.                                   ____                                                                             House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter supporting       the Committee on Homeland Security's plans to conduct a       comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of Homeland       Security (``the Department'') in the 115th Congress, as       expressed in the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of       the Department of Homeland Security.''        I appreciate your willingness to help ensure the Department       is fully authorized, and recognize that there may be areas of       jurisdictional interest to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (``Intelligence Committee'') in such an       authorization. Rule X (j)(3) of the House of Representatives       grants the Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over       the ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information,'' while Rule X(11)(b)(1) grants the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;''        The Committee on Homeland Security does not intend to       authorize any elements of the Department that are funded       through the National Intelligence Program (``NIP'') as part       of the Department authorization bill it reports to the House       this Congress, although we both agree that the reported bill       may include Department-wide provisions that could affect       Department elements that happen to receive funding through       the NIP, Accordingly, I will oppose as nongermaine any       amendments which may be offered in my committee's markup       related to the NIP-funded elements of the Department. I       further agree to consult you before taking any action on       similar amendments which may be offered during consideration       of the bill by the full House.        In the interest of ensuring the most robust Department       authorization possible, we further agree that you may offer       an amendment during consideration of the bill in the full       House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, you will not offer an amendment.       Understanding, however, that both of our committees have a       jurisdictional interest in the Department's Office of       Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to work together to       ensure that the Office receives the most effective       congressional guidance.        Finally, I reiterate my intention that nothing included in       the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' alters the jurisdiction of       either the Committee on Homeland Security or the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence. The Committee on Homeland       Security appreciates the past success we have enjoyed working       with the Intelligence Committee. I am grateful for your       support and look forward to continuing to work together       toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the Department and       its components are authorized on a regular basis.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                             House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                  Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: In accordance with paragraph 10 of       the January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' I write to confirm our       mutual understanding of the procedure through which the House       will authorize the elements of the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) funded through the National Intelligence       Program (NIP).        I appreciate your dedication to producing a comprehensive       reauthorization of DHS that will improve congressional       oversight of the Department. As you know, Rule X(11)(b)(1) of       the House of Representatives grants the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence sole jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;'' and       Rule X (j)(3) of the House of Representatives grants the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over the       ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information.''        As you also know, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA)       is the annual vehicle through which Congress authorizes       appropriations for the NIP, including for elements of DHS       that receive funding through the NIP. The IAA includes a       classified schedule of authorizations, incorporated into the       statute by reference, and direction and recommendations in a       classified annex to the report of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence. Nothing in the January 2017       ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of       Homeland Security,'' shall be construed to grant the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over proposed       legislation relating to the NIP or authorizations for       appropriations for the NIP.        In keeping with these principles, the Committee on Homeland       Security will not report to the House any bill that       authorizes any elements of DNS funded through the NIP. If any       such bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security,       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will request a       sequential referral of the bill. Understanding, however, that       both of our committees have a jurisdictional interest in the       Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to       work together to ensure that the Office receives the most       effective congressional guidance.        We further agree that if the Committee on Homeland Security       reports a DHS-wide authorization bill to the House, I may       offer an amendment during consideration of the bill in the       full House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, I will not offer an amendment,       and the DHS-wide authorization bill will not contain any       provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS. We       further agree that you will oppose as nongermane all       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS in       markup in the Committee on Homeland Security. If any       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS are       subsequently offered during consideration by the full House,       you agree to consult with me before taking action.        Finally, we agree that you will support the appointment of       the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence to any committee of conference on a       DHS-wide authorization bill that includes any provisions       related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS.        In accordance with Rule X(11)(b)(2) this understanding does       not preclude either the Committee on Homeland Security or the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from authorizing       other intelligence and intelligence-related activities of       DHS, including, but not limited to, the Homeland Security       Intelligence Program. In keeping with paragraph 5 of the       January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' our committees will work       jointly to vet and clear any provisions of a DHS       authorization bill related to these other intelligence and       intelligence-related activities of DHS. Furthermore, I hope       the staff of our committees can continue to closely and       expeditiously to conduct rigorous oversight of intelligence       activities throughout DHS.        The understanding detailed by this letter is limited to the       115th Congress. It shall not constitute an understanding       between our committees in any subsequent congress.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding. I look forward to working with you to       continue congressional oversight of DHS intelligence       activities, and I thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____      Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland            Security Submitted by Hon. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin         We, the chairs of the committees with jurisdiction over the       Department of Homeland  [[Page H7234]]       Security or its components, are hereby recording our       agreement on the following principles for the 115th Congress:        1. The Department of Homeland Security (``the Department'')       and its components should be authorized on a regular basis to       ensure robust oversight and improve its operation.        2. Committees with jurisdiction over the Department and its       components will prioritize the authorization of the       Department and any unauthorized or expiring component in that       committee's authorization and oversight plan.        3. To the maximum extent practicable, the committees with       jurisdiction over unauthorized or expiring components of the       Department shall coordinate with the Committee on Homeland       Security to produce a comprehensive authorization bill for       the Department.        4. The Committee on Homeland Security shall coordinate with       the committees with jurisdiction over unauthorized or       expiring components of the Department in the development of       any comprehensive authorization bill for the Department.        5. The Committee on Homeland Security and the committees       with jurisdiction over components of the Department shall       jointly develop a process for the vetting and pre-clearing of       base text and amendments offered at subcommittee and full       committee markups of a DHS authorization bill in the       Committee on Homeland Security that fall within the       jurisdiction of a committee other than or in addition to the       Committee on Homeland Security.        6. The committees will expedite consideration of any       comprehensive authorization bill for the Department,       including timely resolution of any matters subject to a       sequential or additional referral.        7. To the extent that there are policy differences between       the committees regarding a provision of the comprehensive       authorization bill for the Department, the committees will       make best efforts to resolve any such dispute.        8. The Committee on Homeland Security Committee shall not       include any provision in a comprehensive authorization bill       that the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means has       determined to be a revenue provision or a provision affecting       revenue. If the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means       makes such a determination, nothing in this agreement shall       be construed to preclude that chair from exercising an       additional or sequential referral over the measure, or a       point of order under clause 5 (a) of Rule XXI of the Rules of       the House of Representatives.        9. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as altering       any committee's jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of the       House of Representatives or the referral of any measure       thereunder.        10. Further, nothing in this memorandum precludes a further       agreement between the committees with regard to the       implementation of a process to ensure regular comprehensive       authorizations of the Department.            Signed,      Gregg ``Walden,        Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce      Devin Nunes,        Chair, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence      Jason Chaffetz,        Chair, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform      Bill Shuster,        Chair, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure      Michael T. McCaul,        Chair, Committee on Homeland Security      Bob Goodlatte,        Chair, Committee on the Judiciary      Lamar Smith,        Chair, Committee on Science, Space and Technology      Kevin Brady,      Chair, Committee on Ways and Means.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 11, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2453, H.R. 2468, and H.R. 2470. I appreciate your       support in bringing these very important pieces of       legislation before the House of Representatives, and       appreciate the willingness of the Permanent Select Committee       on Intelligence to forego seeking a sequential referral.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral on       these bills at this time, the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in any of these bills or similar legislation       in the future. In addition, should a conference on any of       these bills be necessary, I would support your request to       have the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence       represented for provisions within your jurisdiction on the       conference committee.        Additionally, the Committee on Homeland Security recognizes       and appreciates the importance of the Memorandum Regarding       Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security and the       letter exchange on January 11, 2017. The Committee on       Homeland Security contends that per such agreement the bills       considered on the floor today do ``not intend to authorize       any elements of the Department that are funded through the       National Intelligence Program (NIP). . . . but may include       Department-wide provisions that could affect Department       elements that happen to receive funding through the NIP.''        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of these bills on the House       floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for her hard  work, and I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2453, to  bolster the Department of Homeland Security's Intelligence Analyst  Program and, thereby, strengthen the DHS intelligence enterprise.   Additionally, I want to thank Chairman Nunes and the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence for working with the Committee on  Homeland Security to bring my bill, as well as H.R. 2468, offered by  Representative Perry, and H.R. 2470, offered by Representative Rogers,  to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2427) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002, to direct  the Assistant Secretary for State and Local Law Enforcement to produce  and disseminate an annual catalog on Department of Homeland Security  training, publications, programs, and services for State, local, and  tribal law enforcement agencies, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2427         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pathways to Improving       Homeland Security At the Local Level Act''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL CATALOG ON DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY                     TRAINING, PUBLICATIONS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES                     FOR STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT                     AGENCIES.         Section 2006(b)(4) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 607(b)(4)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (F), by striking the period and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(G) produce an annual catalog that summarizes       opportunities for training, publications, programs, and       services available to State, local, and tribal law       enforcement agencies from the Department and from each       component and office within the Department and, not later       than 30 days after the date of such production, disseminate       the catalog, including by--        ``(i) making such catalog available to State, local, and       tribal law enforcement agencies, including by posting the       catalog on the website of the Department and cooperating with       national organizations that represent such agencies;        ``(ii) making such catalog available through the Homeland       Security Information Network; and        ``(iii) submitting such catalog to the Committee on       Homeland Security and the Committee on the Judiciary of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on the       Judiciary of the Senate.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Pathways to Improving Homeland Security at the Local  Level Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings),  ensures that State and local law enforcement will continue to receive  valuable information on DHS resources and programs available to law  enforcement.   The bill requires the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement to  produce and disseminate an annual catalog that summarizes opportunities  for training, publications, programs, and services available to non- Federal law enforcement agencies from the Department of Homeland  Security, and to disseminate the catalog to State and local law  enforcement entities within 30 days of production.   This also requires DHS to share the catalog through the Homeland  Security Information Network. By requiring the Office to share this  catalog through this existing information sharing platform, it will  expand the number of State and local law enforcement partners who  receive it.   This bill is a commonsense measure focused on increasing transparency  on DHS tools and resources available to State and local law  enforcement.   I commend the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings) for her work on  this measure. She is unable to be present today because of Hurricane  Irma. Our thoughts and prayers are with her, her district, and the  State of Florida as recovery efforts continue.   On behalf of the Committee on Homeland Security, I want to express  our appreciation to the Judiciary Committee for working with us to move  this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write with respect to H.R. 2427,       the ``Pathways to Improving Homeland Security at the Local       Level Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 2427 that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any       further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2427 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any (House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.

Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, September 6, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 2427, the ``Pathways to Improving Homeland       Security at the Local Level Act.'' I appreciate your support       in bringing this legislation before the House of       Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the       Committee on the Judiciary will forego further consideration       of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of this bill at       this time, the Judiciary does not waive any jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in this bill or similar       legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference       on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to       have the Committee on the Judiciary represented on the       conference committee.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2427 to ensure that  State and local law enforcement continue to receive valuable  information on the Department of Homeland Security's services and  resources.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2470) to require an annual homeland threat assessment, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2470         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Threat Assessment       Act''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL HOMELAND THREAT ASSESSMENTS.

Homeland threat assessments.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in favor of this bill on behalf of  Congressman Mike Rogers. He is dealing with the aftereffects of  Hurricane Irma, which is the tropical storm affecting his district.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2470 received bipartisan support during  consideration by the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence  in May, and was included in the Department of Homeland Security  authorization bill, which passed the floor in July.   H.R. 2470 requires the Department of Homeland Security to release an  annual comprehensive homeland security threat assessment. This will  provide a common threat picture across the Department and for Federal,  State, and local partners.   This week, we are recognizing 16 years after the horrific events of  9/11. Sixteen years later, our ability to accurately identify and  evaluate threats to the homeland remains stunted, in many ways.   Though talented professionals across Federal agencies and at the  State and local level are hard at work gathering and analyzing threat  information, there is still not a formalized process that evaluates  homeland threats in a meaningful and comprehensive way.   The assessment in this bill requires DHS to incorporate and analyze  Departmental data in a strategic picture. By relying on information  provided by the on-the-ground professionals, including State and local  police and the Department's operational component, this threat  assessment will be a unique contribution to the intelligence community,  policymakers, and other stakeholders.   By requiring the Department to consider specific cyber,  transportation, and border security threats, in addition to traditional  terrorism threats, H.R. 2470 ensures that DHS will focus on critical  mission areas where it can provide real value.   Additionally, the threat assessment required by H.R. 2470 can inform  the Department's budgeting and planning by clarifying the nature and  scale of the threats DHS was created to counter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 2470, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 2470, and I yield back the balance of my time.
