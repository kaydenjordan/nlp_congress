 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, I bet all of our fellow Senators have  been hearing from businesses, hospitals, nursing homes, and local civic  business and political leaders about the issues they are facing right  now due to the coronavirus health crisis.   Likewise, I have been talking to family and friends back home in  Iowa. I find that they are banding together to support one another. In  times of strife, Iowans can count on each other.   We have to give special attention to the hard work of our medical  professionals and first responders. They are under immense pressure and  going above and beyond to serve their communities. I believe they are  doing God's work, keeping the American people safe and healthy. So I  thank our medical professionals and first responders for their  dedication to their communities and send my encouragement to keep up  their essential work in the days and weeks ahead, as we see ourselves  through this virus pandemic we are in.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in more than 48 hours of negotiations,  there has been a lot of progress made in the subjects that are within  the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, which I chair.   The results of these negotiations have led to decisions that will be  in legislation we hope to vote on tomorrow that would make sure that  checks go from the Federal Government to individuals--all individuals-- $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples, and $500 for each  child. Those would go to people who need it--people with no income and  people with up to $75,000 a year in income or a married couple with  $150,000 per year income, with a phaseout to make sure that no very  wealthy people or even higher income or middle-income people benefit  from it.   We are trying to help those who need the most help, and there wasn't  disagreement from the other side that we ought to mail checks out to  people. This would give Americans the cash they need to provide for  their families and to weather the storm.   This isn't the first time we have done this. We did it in 2008, when  we had the start of the great recession.   We also provided for liquidity for small businesses and larger  businesses by delaying some taxes being paid so that perhaps these  people who, right now, are thinking should they lay off their workforce  or keep their workforce in place, being productive--to enable them to  do that.   We also made a very big effort from both the Republican and  Democratic sides to very much enhance unemployment with an additional  $600 per week for people who are unemployed, plus a lot of people who  don't qualify for unemployment now would qualify for unemployment  insurance for over at least the next 3 months, with an understanding  that if this thing doesn't turn around in the next 3 months, getting  people back to work, getting the economy up and running--with all of  this stuff we are talking about, we are probably going to have to do  more. But right now, the unemployment rolls are going up by the  hundreds of thousands each day, and we have a vote tonight that can  give these people some assurances. And somehow that is not a  catastrophic situation that we should respond to?   I don't know what people on the other side of the aisle are thinking  about, particularly for the unemployed and particularly for those who  don't have checks. What are we going to do for them?   This package that came out of the Finance Committee will not solve  all the problems, but, as the leader said, there are four or five other  task forces that are doing things to make sure that small businesses  can qualify for loans if they will keep their people employed.   So I don't understand this vote at all, particularly considering the  good working relationship that I had with Democrats working with me on  these things as well.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
