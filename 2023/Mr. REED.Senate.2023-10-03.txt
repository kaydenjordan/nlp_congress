 Mr. President, after hearing oral arguments earlier today,  the Supreme Court will rule on a case that will determine whether  average Americans will continue to have an independent Federal watchdog  to push back against the abuses of big financial institutions.   The case I am speaking of is the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau--CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America. It  deals with an outlandish ruling of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals  that would invalidate the congressionally approved funding scheme of  the CFPB. If it stands, the ruling will starve the Bureau of funding  and effectively prevent it from working on behalf of the American  people.   But let's take a step back to remember why the CFPB was created over  a decade ago.   In the runup to the great recession, lenders were aggressively  marketing subprime mortgages with predatory features to borrowers they  knew had no ability to repay. Reckless Wall Street firms bundled those  mortgages into securities and sold them to investors, including pension  funds. And weak regulators stood by as all of this unfolded.   Borrowers ultimately discovered that they could not repay their  mortgages. The securities backed by these mortgages took a nosedive,  causing a meltdown of the banking system and taking down the entire  economy.   While Wall Street got a lifeline from the Congress and the Federal  Government, millions of Americans did not. They paid with their jobs,  their homes, and their savings.   The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent; nearly 7.5 million  families lost their homes; and Americans lost $20 trillion in household  wealth.   At the time, people rightfully asked who was looking out for them.  The truth was no one, really.   American families were ill-served by financial regulators and by the  system. A half dozen Federal Agencies shared responsibility for making  sure that working families didn't get ripped off, but they all failed.  In many cases, they seemed to regard their primary mission as  protecting the big players in the financial system. And they were  hamstrung by the Bush administration, which used the appropriations  process to starve Agencies, like the SEC, of the resources and  personnel they needed to be effective.   So while these Agencies all had some responsibility for protecting  consumers, none of them pursued it vigorously. The performance of  regulators at the time put truth to the saying that ``when everyone is  responsible, no one is responsible.''   This weakness in our regulatory system and structure is why Congress  created the CFPB and gave it a singular mission to protect Americans  from the worst kinds of financial abuses, not just for mortgages but  for every single consumer financial product.   The creation of this Agency is arguably one of the most important  reforms made following the financial crisis.   I recognize that Wall Street and big financial companies have always  feared the CPPB. That is because the CFPB is the only financial  regulatory Agency that exclusively focuses on protecting consumers  against abusive practices.   But Wall Street also fears the CFPB because its funding structure  insulates it from regulatory capture, aggressive lobbying, and  political pressure. Wielding its power judiciously and effectively, the  CFPB has delivered results for American families. In a little more than  a decade, the Bureau has obtained $17.5 billion in relief for 200  million consumers.  [[Page S4913]]    And so, the industry has never given up on killing the CFPB. The  industry hit pay dirt when an activist panel of judges on the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals issued a bizarre and potentially sweeping  decision, which invalidates the CFPB's funding structure based on a  distortion of the Constitution's appropriations clause. The court's  reasoning is flimsy. It relies on a single concurring opinion and a  series of law review articles, some of which were written by students.   (Mr. KELLY assumed the Chair.)   According to Georgetown Professor Adam Levitin, the argument about  the CFPB's funding was a ``throw-away point'' in the litigation, with  the parties dedicating a paltry 370 words apiece to this issue in their  briefs.   Unfortunately, the results of the Fifth Circuit's decision are not  academic. They are very real for the hard-working Americans whose  financial well-being is now at risk. If upheld, the Fifth Circuit's  ruling would call into question the validity of all the Bureau's past  actions.   The work of the CFPB matters to ordinary people. It is the only  Federal Agency that supervises nonbank mortgage lenders, private  student lenders, credit reporting bureaus, debt collectors,  international money remitters, and auto finance companies. Because  there has been a CFPB for the last decade, people in Rhode Island and  across the Nation have had someone who is working to make sure they  will be treated fairly, that their banks and lenders will deal with  them honestly, and that their interests would be protected whenever  financial institutions try to take advantage of them.   That will change if the Fifth Circuit's ruling stands.   I want to particularly highlight what that means for military  families because this has been an aspect of the CFPB's authority that I  have been deeply committed to since the beginning. Simply put, without  the CFPB, military families will be stripped of their financial  protections under the Military Lending Act. The CFPB has brought 40  public enforcement actions involving harm to servicemembers and  veterans, securing more than $175 million in relief.   The Agency plays a unique role in watching out for our Nation's 2  million servicemembers and their families, whether they are deployed in  the United States or overseas. The CFPB protects members of the Armed  Forces from exploitation at the hands of unscrupulous lenders and debt  collectors, who have charged servicemembers interest rates as high as  600 percent and who have threatened to derail their careers if they do  not pay up.   More than recovering money, the CFPB, through its supervisory powers  and by its simple existence, acts as a deterrent. If the Supreme Court  shuts it down, predatory lenders will reoffend against our troops again  and again and again, with little chance of being penalized.   The Presiding Officer understands this very well because, as a naval  aviator and leader of troops, like myself, who was a paratrooper,  executive officer, and company commander, we saw all the shenanigans  that lenders were playing, selling trucks to the young enlisted people  for a great bargain--nothing down but almost a 1,000-percent interest  rate. We saw them come and take those trucks later when the young  soldiers, sailors, and airmen couldn't pay--time and time again.   Finally, through the Military Lending Act and the CFPB, we stood up  and said: This is not fair. And in one of the great ironies, of course,  if you ever went off base, all of these car dealers and other service  agencies proudly had the American flag waving red, white, and blue,  while they were systematically, in many cases, stealing from the men  and women who protect this country.   In a letter written to Banking Committee Chairman Brown, Veterans'  Affairs Committee Chairman Tester, Intelligence Committee Chairman  Warner, and myself, in February, the CFPB Director said:         I am gravely concerned that this trend could impact       companies' compliance with the Military Landing Act and the       Federal consumer financial laws that protect servicemembers       and their families. The impact would be dire--effectively       stripping servicemembers and their families of legal       protections that are critical to maintaining military       readiness. . . . In the Fifth Circuit alone, which covers       Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, this could affect 300,000       servicemembers and their families.    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  letter from the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  Consumer Financial                                               Protection Bureau,                                   Washington, DC, Feburary 6, 2023.      Hon. Jack Reed,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Reed: Thank you for your letter regarding the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) work to protect       servicemembers and their families in the consumer financial       marketplace. As you note in your letter, a three-judge panel       of the Fifth Circuit recently vacated the CFPB's 2017 payday       lending regulation in Community Financial Services       Association v. CFPB. The Fifth Circuit panel found that the       statutory provisions funding the CFPB's operations violate       the Constitution's Appropriations Clause, and as a result,       vacated the payday lending rule that is the subject of that       litigation.        I believe that decision was incorrect, and the Solicitor       General has asked the Supreme Court to reverse it. In the       Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act       (Dodd-Frank Act), Congress established the CFPB as an       independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. Like the       Federal Reserve Board of Governors and other federal banking       regulators, Congress authorized the CFPB's funding through       its organic statute rather than through annual spending       bills. This type of funding for banking regulators has long       been a vital part of the nation's financial regulatory       system, providing stability and continuity for the agencies       and the system as a whole.         The CFPB's Work to Protect Servicemembers and their Families         In the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress directed the CFPB to       establish an Office of Servicemember Affairs. Since the       CFPB's inception, the CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs       has worked with the Department of Defense, state attorneys       general, and other law enforcement agencies to ensure       America's servicemembers, veterans, and their families       receive the consumer protections they are entitled to by law.        Each year, the Office of Servicemember Affairs issues a       report on the top financial concerns facing servicemembers,       veterans, and military families, based on complaints they       submit to the CFPB. In its most recent annual report, the       Office of Servicemember Affairs noted a nearly 20 percent       increase in complaints by servicemembers since 2019 and       detailed how servicemembers credit reporting inaccuracies       uniquely impact their housing, transportation, and security       clearance. A separate CFPB report released in December 2022       found that servicemembers appeared to be underutilizing the       protections and relief they are entitled to under the       Servicemember Civil Relief Act, which include a six percent       interest rate cap. Previous CFPB research compared       servicemembers' credit usage to their civilian counterparts       and identified debt trends among servicemembers during and       after they leave active duty.        The CFPB examines supervised financial institutions for       risks to active duty servicemembers and their families from       conduct that violates the Military Lending Act (MLA).       Additionally, when the CFPB identifies Servicemember Civil       Relief Act (SCRA) violations or an absence of SCRA compliance       policies and procedures, we refer the matter to appropriate       federal and state regulators and assess whether the conduct       may also violate other statutes we enforce, such as the       Consumer Financial Protection Act. And when companies break       the law and harm servicemembers, the CFPB brings enforcement       actions to hold them accountable. To date, the CFPB has       brought 38 public enforcement actions that involved harm to       servicemembers and veterans, including five enforcement       actions for violations of the Military Lending Act. These       cases have thus far resulted in more than $170 million in       monetary consumer relief.        Here are a few recent examples that illustrate the impact       of this work:        In September 2022, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against       MoneyLion and its lending subsidiaries alleging they violated       the MLA by charging consumers membership fees and stated       interest rates that when combined exceeded the MLA's 36% rate       cap, requiring covered borrowers to submit to arbitration,       and failing to make required disclosures. The CFPB's       complaint also alleges that MoneyLion's restrictive       membership cancellation practices are deceptive, unfair, and       abusive.        In November 2021, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against       FirstCash, Inc. and Cash America West, Inc. The CFPB alleges       that FirstCash and Cash America West made pawnshop loans to       active-duty servicemembers and their dependents that violated       the MLA. The CFPB alleges that between June 2017 and May       2021, FirstCash and Cash America West made over 3,600 pawn       loans from four of its stores to more than 1,000       servicemembers in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Washington at       rates that exceeded the MLA's 36% interest cap, as well as       other violations.  [[Page S4914]]         In December 2020, the CFPB issued a consent order against       Omni Financial of Nevada, Inc. The CFPB found that, among       other things, Omni violated the MLA's prohibition against       requiring repayment of loans by allotment. While Omni claimed       that other payment options were available, the CFPB found       that employees told servicemembers they were required to       repay by allotment, and records show that 99 percent of       active-duty servicemembers who took out loans repaid them via       allotment. The CFPB uncovered these violations as part of a       sweep of investigations of multiple lenders that were       suspected of violating the MLA.        Also in December 2020, the CFPB sued LendUp for violating       the MLA by charging interest in excess of 36 percent,       requiring covered borrowers to submit to arbitration, and       failing to make required disclosures. The parties entered       into a stipulated judgment in that action in early 2021. In       December 2021, the CFPB sued LendUp again for violating that       order. The parties entered into a stipulated judgment that       resulted in a court order that prohibited the company from       making new loans and collecting on outstanding loans.       Impact of the Fifth Circuit Ruling on the CFPB's Protection of                               Servicemembers         The Fifth Circuit's ruling has the potential to put the       CFPB's work to protect servicemembers at risk. While that       ruling only applied to the CFPB's payday lending rule, some       entities are attempting to use that ruling to try to escape       legal liability. For example, citing the Fifth Circuit's       ruling, lenders FirstCash and Cash America West filed a       motion seeking to dismiss the case and prevent the CFPB from       obtaining relief for harmed servicemembers, and the case is       stayed while CFSA is before the Supreme Court. Several other       defendants, both within and outside the Fifth Circuit, have       also sought to dismiss or delay CFPB enforcement actions       based on the Fifth Circuit's ruling.        I am gravely concerned that this trend could impact       companies' compliance with the Military Lending Act and the       Federal consumer financial laws that protect servicemembers       and their families. The impact would be dire--effectively       stripping servicemembers and their families of legal       protections that are critical to maintaining military       readiness and preventing involuntary separations, goals which       the Department of Defense reaffirmed when finalizing the 2015       regulations implementing the MLA. In the Fifth Circuit alone,       which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, this could       affect 300,000 servicemembers and their families.        The CFPB shares your commitment to protecting       servicemembers in the consumer financial marketplace, and I       appreciate your efforts to ensure that military financial       protections such as the MLA are being implemented as Congress       intended. Thank you for your attention to this important       issue.        Should you have any additional questions, please do not       hesitate to contact me or have your staff contact Janel       Fitzhugh in the CFPB's Office of Legislative Affairs.            Sincerely,                                                      Rohit Chopra,                                                          Director.     Mr. President, the Military Officers Association of America  and a dozen veterans organizations have validated the CFPB's strong  track record. In their words:         All told, the CFPB has become an indispensable agency for       protecting the legal rights and financial readiness of       servicemembers, veterans, and their families. The stability       of the CFPB's funding is therefore vital to the tremendous       work it does on [their] behalf.    Finally, let me add that it is not just average Americans who will be  put at risk. Responsible lenders will lose the protections of the  regulatory safe harbors created by the CFPB. These rules essentially  protect the industry against the risk of enforcement, so long as they  play by the rules and provide standardized disclosures in plain  English. Those responsible actors in our financial system, who extend  credit on fair terms and deal honestly with their customers, have a lot  to lose.   It all adds up to this: The Fifth Circuit's decision prioritizes the  interests of predatory lenders over responsible lenders, relies on  falsehoods over facts, and chooses chaos over stability. That is  certainly not what any court should be doing.   I hope sincerely that the Supreme Court reverses the Fifth Circuit's  dangerous decision. I hope it recognizes that this is not about  expensive lawyers and trade associations and big businesses. This is  about Americans, many of them wearing the uniform of our country. They  deserve the sympathy and the support of the Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have one request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 2:30 p.m., to  conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 96, S.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, as a further mark of respect to the late  James L. Buckley, former Senator from New York, the Senate, at 7:12  p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, October 4, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
