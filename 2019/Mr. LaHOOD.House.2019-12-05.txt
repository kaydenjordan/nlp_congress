 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sangamon  County's Williamsville High School, who, last week, won the Class 3A  Illinois State football championship, the school's first ever.   On Friday night at Huskie Stadium in DeKalb, Illinois, the  Williamsville Bullets rallied late in the fourth quarter to win a  thrilling 46-42 game against Byron High School. With just 3 minutes  remaining and Byron leading 42-39, the Williamsville defense  stonewalled Byron to force a turnover. The Bullets then marched down  the field, and junior quarterback Conor McCormick fired a game-winning  touchdown to secure the State title.   The Bullets' offense set a 3A championship record with 550 yards of  total offense. Wide receiver Brandon Bishop set a record for receiving  yards with  [[Page H9282]]  230, and quarterback Conor McCormick set the record with 335 passing  yards and four touchdowns.   The Williamsville football team has made all of central Illinois  proud with their accomplishments this season. The never-give-up spirit  that embodied this team was on full display in their State  championship, and their historic season is a testament to the hard work  of these young men.   I congratulate Coach Aaron Kunz and the Williamsville High School  Bullets.                            ____________________
