 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to set the record straight.   The American people are wondering what Congress is doing to help  folks who are still struggling from the effects of COVID-19 on their  health and on all of our economy. They see no movement in negotiations,  and I have had folks back home ask me, What are you all doing up there?  Well, sadly, the answer is, Not much, really.   Some in this Chamber claim that it is us, the Republicans, who have  no solutions on COVID. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me  just speak for myself. I have introduced more than a dozen bills with  my colleagues. Some of these bills are bipartisan, and they apply time- tested conservative principles to help people impacted and hurt by  COVID-19.   These are bills that expand healthcare access. They support workers.  They incentivize telework. They assure safe public housing. They  simplify PPP loans. Mr. Speaker, they stop stimulus payments to dead  people, of all things. They explore temperature checks at airports.  They establish flexible funding for States and localities; a bill that  holds China accountable, and helps incentivize a safe reopening of our  country, and much, much more. Each and every one of these bills has  been denied a vote in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I understand the politics of being less than 50 days  away from an election. And I get the political calculation that has  been made. The Speaker started this year--right there--by ripping up  the President's State of the Union. And she seems intent on ending it  by smearing Republicans as enemies of the State and blocking any  meaningful bills to help hardworking Americans.   But the American people deserve to know that my Republican colleagues  and I, we stand ready to govern and ready to pass commonsense  conservative policies that will help them make it through this  pandemic.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. He is a  great chairman, but also a great friend. I thank him, also, for  organizing this Special Order.   Over the past several months we have witnessed lawless anarchists  take to the streets and destroy historic monuments, vandalize and burn  small businesses, physically assault a U.S. Senator and his wife,  harass regular Americans who are simply enjoying an outdoor dinner, and  so on. The fact that this activity goes on and is tolerated by  Democrat-run cities is outrageous and an insult to every law-abiding  citizen of this land.   We need to double the Federal penalties for those who riot and loot.  We need to strip Federal funding from cities that refuse to confront  this lawlessness in their communities. And we need to put those  dithering local officials on the hook legally for the carnage that they  allow to happen.   There are people here in Washington who stand for law and order and  are trying to regain control of our streets, starting with our  President. Violence like this has no place in America. We have to get  back to resolving our issues through debate and democracy, not through  looting and lawlessness.   If officials in Democrat-run cities won't stand up for all of their  citizens, then under the leadership of President Trump, Republicans  will.
