 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in poll after poll, most respondents  blame President Biden's policies for the increasing inflation and  especially higher gas prices.   NBC:         Biden's job approval falls to the lowest level of his       presidency amid war and inflation fears.    In Gallup's poll, which they dubbed ``Americans Offer Gloomy State of  Nation Report'' in February--before the  [[Page S2013]]  record gas prices at the pumps were even here that we are seeing  today--the biggest decline in satisfaction sat squarely with energy  policies. In fact, only 27 percent of Americans said they were  satisfied with his energy policies.   But, if you ask the Biden administration and congressional Democrats,  who seem more interested in finger-pointing than in finding solutions,  the culprit changes on a nearly daily basis. First, it was OPEC+ not  producing enough oil. Then it was the evil corporations' price gouging  at the expense of hard-working American families. Then it was Vladimir  Putin's fault with his invasion of Ukraine. Now, it is oil and gas  companies sitting on 9,000 leases. Of course, we have come back around  today to those greedy oil companies again.   But the 9,000 leases is where I want to spend a little time today and  explain the problem with the claim of the 9,000 leases. Let's drill  deeper--if you will excuse the expression--into that number to truly  understand what is going on here and why this type of rebuttal argument  does a total disservice to the American people and our allies abroad.   The first and most fundamental mistake that White House spokesperson  Ms. Psaki has made is in using the words ``lease'' and ``permit''  interchangeably. ``Lease'' and ``permit'' are not the same thing. They  are not synonymous other than that both are regulatory hurdles required  by the Federal Government for a producer to work on Federal lands.   Second, it is important to understand the vast majority--in fact,  two-thirds--of oil and gas leases on Federal lands are producing. There  are 35,871 total oil and gas leases in effect, with about 66 percent of  them producing oil or gas. The rest are going through this abused  regulatory process or are being held up in litigation by environmental  NGOs. In fact, over 2,200 of the leases are currently in litigation,  and if there is one thing that liberals love more than regulation, it  is litigation.   Third, a lease does not mean the rented land contains oil and gas.  Not all 9,000 of these leases ``not being used'' even contain oil and  gas. Producers first have to perform exploratory work to discover  whether their leases even contain the minerals that they are after. Oil  and gas producers procure multiple leases because they need to mitigate  the financial damage which could result from acquiring only dry leases.  It is called a robust portfolio, a comprehensive portfolio.   Fourth, before any development on leases can occur, producers and  Agencies must navigate this bureaucratic maze--this labyrinth of  permitting and environmental laws covered by the Endangered Species  Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the National  Environmental Policy Act, just to name a few, which can take years to  complete. Rarely, do these things all get done at the same time. They  are never done simultaneously but, rather, consecutively. They each  take the number of days they need apart from one another rather than  all together.   Fifth, just because a producer obtains a lease and navigates the  regulatory hurdles required to permit a well does not mean they can  begin extraction. They must first secure adjoining leases for  horizontal drilling. You don't just drill a hole straight down anymore  and suck the oil straight up from one silo. You have to get leases from  the neighborhood. They must secure these leases and then accrue the  capital to finance mineral development. It is not done for free, and it  is not going to be done cheaply. They have to schedule the rigs,  construct access roads, obtain pipeline rights-of-way, establish  infrastructure to capture the natural gas, and hire capable workers.  All of these steps have been delayed by the administration's roadblocks  and Biden's supply chain and labor crisis.   Finally, after obtaining an adequate number of leases clearing all of  the regulatory hurdles and planning the logistics of the projects, a  company must obtain an approved application for a permit to drill,  otherwise known as an APD. There are currently 4,604 Federal APDs  awaiting approval from the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and another  162 APDs on Indian land.   The Biden administration's BLM could approve these permits now and  enable companies to move forward with the development to supply much  needed domestic energy at home and abroad. However, the BLM is  approving them at the slowest rate since the Obama administration--a  fact that Ms. Psaki conveniently leaves out when she claims President  Biden is doing everything possible to lower gas prices.    In fact, to this specific point, the Bureau of Land Management has  State offices in places like Dickinson, ND. They have regional offices  in places like Billings, MT. That is where the decisions have been made  as to whether the application for a permit to drill becomes a permit to  drill--until this administration. They changed that and gave the final  authority not to Dickinson, ND, and not to Billings, MT, but rather to  Washington, DC--at the very height of power. In fact, it goes all the  way to the Deputy Secretary of the Interior.   Now let's look at some of the data on APDs, applications for permits  to drill, and the timelines.   In March of 2020, the BLM testified in front of the House Natural  Resources Committee about the Trump administration's efforts to improve  oil and gas permitting processes. In fiscal year 2019, the BLM approved  3,741 APDs on Federal and Indian lands. The average APD processing time  for a single application dropped from 139 days in fiscal year 2016 to  just 44 days in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2021, which included 4  months of the Trump administration, APD approval times shot back up to  89 days, doubling the amount of time. This is yet another example of  the Trump administration's energy success being eliminated by the Biden  administration's incompetence.   The Biden administration approved just 97 permits for oil and natural  gas wells across Federal lands in January of this year--a significant  plunge from the 643 issued in April of last year. All of the leases in  the world don't matter if you can't get a permit to drill on them even  if, in fact, there is oil--and you don't even know that for sure.   On top of the regulatory hurdles, industry considerations, supply  chain issues, and labor shortages, producers must have certainty that  their products can reach the global market. A key aspect of reaching  the global market, of course, and reducing the European Union's  reliance on dirty Russian gas are the U.S. liquefied natural gas  terminals, or LNG export terminals.   As of March 16, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy had 16  applications pending or under review for increasing U.S. LNG exports.  If Secretary Granholm were to sign off on or were to streamline the  review of these applications, we could increase our export capacity to  help our allies abroad and grow our economy right here at home.   The Biden administration has extended its onshore and offshore oil  and gas leasing ban quarter after quarter despite being required by the  Mineral Leasing Act to conduct quarterly lease sales. At this point in  the Obama administration, they had held 35 onshore lease sales--35  under Barack Obama--and that is not all.   The Biden administration is actively working to starve the fossil  fuel industry of financial capital in order to push them out of  existence. That is right. They keep talking about the supply and the  demand; yet they crush the supply by starving it of the capital that it  needs. This is capital-intensive stuff.   In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a proposed  rule on climate disclosure--climate disclosure. This authority of  forcing publicly traded companies to develop and disclose their risks  from climate change is not in the purview of the SEC. They don't have  the authority to do that. Congress has never passed a law granting them  new authority in this space. It only serves to further discourage  investment in domestic energy development and to prevent American  energy independence, a critical tool for peace and the reduction of  global emissions.   Now, isn't that ironic?   The Biden administration is succeeding in its mission to destroy any  chance to once again be energy independent. Their radical nominees,  actions in the courtroom, regulatory schemes, budget proposals, and  foot-dragging exude hostility toward fossil fuels, inflicting a  distinct chilling effect on the oil and gas industry.   I have talked to a number of producers in North Dakota, and they are  [[Page S2014]]  capital-starved. If the right messages were being sent to the markets,  we could pick up another 200,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil per day. In  January of 2022--this year--North Dakota produced 1.1 million barrels  per day. To put this in context, Europe imports 2.3 million barrels per  day from Russia. At North Dakota's peak, we produced 1.5 million  barrels per day. North Dakota alone could provide two-thirds of the  product Europe imports from Russia. It would be cleaner than Russian  oil, and it would lessen Putin's malign leverage over Europe and,  really, the rest of the world.   Investors in domestic oil and gas have to receive the right market  signals in order to invest their capital. The administration seems to  believe energy production is simply a switch you turn on or a valve you  turn when you need it. Then, if you don't need it, you just turn it  off--no harm, no foul. It is very capital-intensive, as I said, and it  is reliant on regulatory certainty. I am not talking about 6 days of  certainty or 6 months of certainty but more like 6 years of certainty.  No sane energy CEO would invest millions or billions of dollars in a  project with the backdrop of an administration that is seeking to  ``transition'' them out of existence within months.    Let's take a walk down memory lane on some of the signals this  administration has sent to the industry.   First, the President himself said during a campaign stop in 2019:         I guarantee you, I guarantee you we are going to end fossil       fuel, and I am not going to cooperate with them.    Well, congratulations, Mr. President. You kept the promise.   Secretary Granholm appeared in a video and called for leaving fossil  fuels ``in the ground,'' she said. She then spoke to reporters at the  Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks, ND. It is an  exceptional organization at the forefront of promoting carbon capture  and other innovative solutions to reduce CO2 emissions.   During her comments, she proclaimed the United States doesn't--get  this now. The Secretary of Energy proclaimed, We don't have ``much  moral authority'' to criticize China over its emissions. We, the United  States of America, don't have moral authority over China?   Really, Madam Secretary? That is what you believe about the country  you serve?   How about the climate czar John Kerry? He flies around the world  while making outlandish comments like ``the United States won't have  coal in 2030,'' and he discourages the world from buying our products-- U.S. energy--while fanning the flames of radicalism and proclaiming  Ukrainian war refugees are nothing compared to climate refugees. It is  like he is the bishop of the Church of Climatology or something. He has  even expressed concern that the pesky war crimes that are going on over  there by Vladimir Putin are taking the focus away from the real  tragedy: climate change. Then he gets in his jet and flies home.   Meanwhile, recent reports indicate the administration has turned to  despots, like Iran and Venezuela, instead of to producers right here in  America in order to help bring the Biden inflation under control by  producing more of their dirty oil instead of our cleaner production. It  makes no sense, and it is offensive to every American worker.   We have a geopolitical opportunity right now to cut Putin's malign  influence, and we should be taking full advantage of it. What we ought  to be doing is encouraging production not just with our rhetoric but  with our actions. Producing more U.S. oil and gas will--believe it or  not, proclaim it or deny it as it is the truth--will reduce global  greenhouse gas emissions.   Now, if you don't want to take my word for it or trust the extensive  studies, science, and documentation of this fact, Biden EPA  Administrator Michael Regan, just last week, told the Financial Times  that recent calls for increased oil output are compatible--get this  now, this is from Biden EPA Administrator Regan--with goals to cut  CO2 emissions.   In fact, he specifically said:         These are not mutually exclusive goals.    Administrator Regan is exactly right. Producing more U.S. oil and gas  will reduce the West's reliance on dirtier fuels from our adversaries.  Doing so also avoids unilaterally disarming our economy and losing  ourselves to a 2050 fantasy that has come straight up to being a 2022  reality. Some in the Biden administration may finally be starting to  understand: Energy security is national security and economic security.  And so I say: Let's make the world safer, let's make the world cleaner,  and let's unleash American energy production.    With that, I yield the floor.
