 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I  thank Mr. McCaul for his support of this legislation as well.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 393, remembering  the victims of the violent suppression of democracy protests in  Tiananmen Square and elsewhere in China on June 3 and 4, 1989. The  resolution calls on the Chinese Government to respect the universally  recognized human rights of all people living in China and around the  world.   It is my hope that the U.S. House of Representatives will  overwhelmingly support this resolution and send a strong message that  the American people stand on the side of those seeking to exercise  their fundamental human rights in China.   It was 30 years ago, this week, that an estimated 1 million students,  workers, and citizens joined the peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square  and in over 400 cities throughout China. We remember with sadness and  outrage the crackdown that followed as the People's Liberation Army was  unleashed on its own people.   One of the most inspiring images in history is the lone man standing  in the street before the line of tanks on Tiananmen Square. His act of  resistance symbolizes the spirit of Tiananmen that lives on in the  hearts and minds of those continuing the struggle in China and abroad.   In China, the Tiananmen Mothers is a group of relatives and friends  of those killed in June 1989. At great risk to themselves, they  continue to ask for the right to mourn publicly and call for a full,  public, and independent accounting of the victims. The Chinese  Government fears their memory, their devotion, and their moral  standing.   In the years since Tiananmen, the human rights situation in China has  worsened. Some have described a slow-motion Tiananmen happening in  Xinjiang with the ongoing mass internment and surveillance of ethnic  Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.   A better path forward was offered by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and  Tiananmen student leader Liu Xiaobo when he coauthored the political  reform manifesto Charter 08 that was signed by more than 10,000 people,  despite efforts to censor it. Liu Xiaobo spent a total of almost 16  years in prison, and he died in state custody in 2017.   Today in China, the Tiananmen Square massacre is erased from history  books, and any mention of it is censored. In the last few weeks, the  Chinese Government has tightened controls to prevent any mention of  Tiananmen and heightened surveillance on the survivors, human rights  advocates, and their families. They have detained journalists,  scholars, filmmakers, social workers, and labor rights activists.   But we all know the spirit of Tiananmen is still alive and well. We  know in part because China's leaders demonstrate their fear of it every  day with their security cameras, censorship, detention centers, and  obsession with preventing the people of China from learning the truth.  Imagine the time, energy, and cost of monitoring and tracking the  actions of 1.4 billion people.   They are scared because the truth of Tiananmen threatens the Chinese  Communist Party's legitimacy to govern China. In his famous last  statement in court, Liu Xiaobo said:         I look forward to the day when my country is a land with       freedom of expression, where the speech of every citizen will       be treated equally well; where different values, ideas,       beliefs, and political views . . . can both compete with each       other and peacefully coexist; where both majority and       minority views will be equally guaranteed, and where       political views that differ from those currently in power       will be fully respected and protected; where all political       views will spread out under the Sun for people to choose       from, where every citizen can state political views without       fear, and where no one can under any circumstances suffer       political persecution for voicing divergent political views.  [[Page H4235]]         I hope that I will be the last victim in China's long       record of treating words as crimes. No force can block the       thirst for freedom that lies within human nature, and some       day China, too, will be a nation of laws where human rights       are paramount.    I look forward to that day, Madam Speaker, and let us pass this  resolution with a strong vote. Let us make it clear that we in the  United States Congress stand out loud and foursquare for human rights  and that we stand with the people of China.
