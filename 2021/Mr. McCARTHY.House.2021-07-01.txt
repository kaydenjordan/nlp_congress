 Mr. Speaker, consistent with Israel's request for $1  billion in emergency military aid to fund the Iron Dome, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Appropriations be discharged  from further consideration of House Joint Resolution 54 and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, can the Speaker inform us of the  composition of the floor leadership?    Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that clarification.   So that means that the Speaker and majority leader are blocking  funding for Israel?
