 Mr. President, Social Security provides vital benefits  millions of Americans who work and pay into the system with each  paycheck. Because Social Security is fundamental to workers' retirement  security, the law protected benefits from creditors. The only  exceptions were unpaid Federal taxes, child support or alimony  payments, and court-ordered victim restitution. These protections  ensured that the social safety net programs would be there for basic  needs. That protection was weakened over 20 years ago when the law was  changed. Now, more and more seniors face cuts in their Social Security  benefits because of student loan debts. While Congress and the Biden- Harris Administration took significant steps to protect Americans from  facing crushing debt during a global pandemic, exempting the economic  impact payments from garnishment and extending the freeze on student  loan payments through January 2022, seniors will still be on the hook  for cosigning their child or grandchild's student loan debt when those  payments resume. We need to take action today to restore the strong  protections to Social Security and other benefit programs.   We now realize what a profound effect the loss of these protections  has had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live  on fixed incomes. More and more seniors and people with disabilities  are having their Social Security and other lifeline benefits taken away  to pay Federal debts. For example, according to recent data from the  U.S. Bureau of Fiscal Service, over 167,000 Americans had their  benefits garnished for student loan debt. While 167,000 seems small  compared to a nation of over 320 million, those 167,000 had nearly $200  million garnished from their earned benefits. This is just the tip of  the iceberg as more Americans start receiving benefits. Between 2008  and 2018, the number of individuals whose Social Security benefits were  offset to pay student loans debt increased by 133 percent, from about  72,000 to 169,000. Over that same period, the amount collected from  Social Security benefits ballooned from almost $63 million to nearly  $200 million, a 217-percent increase.   Social Security plays a critical role in keeping seniors and people  with disabilities out of poverty. In Oregon alone, Social Security cuts  the poverty rate of the elderly from about 35 percent to 5 percent.  However, despite Social Security's critical role in the safety net,  close to 1 out of every 10 seniors over age 65 and 1 in 5 disabled  workers still live in poverty and that is simply unacceptable.   I, along with Senators Brown, Whitehouse, Leahy, Warren, Hirono.  Sanders, Padilla, Van Hollen, and Murray am reintroducing the  Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration Act. The bill would  restore the strong protections in the law that prevented the government  from taking away earned benefits to pay Federal debts, and guarantee  beneficiaries will be able to maintain a basic standard of living by  receiving the benefits they have earned. The bill is supported by the  Strengthen Social Security Coalition, Social Security Works, National  Association of Disability Representatives, AFL-CIO, the American  Federation of Government Employees, National Organization of Social  Security Claimants' Representatives, Justice in Aging, American  Federation of Teachers, Alliance for Retired Americans, and the  National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.   I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record  following this statement.                                  S. 3177         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
