 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the faculty,  staff, and students of Dallastown Elementary School in the Dallastown  Area School District on being recognized as a 2020 National Blue Ribbon  School.   The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program was founded nearly 40 years  ago to recognize outstanding public and private schools that are making  a difference and exemplify excellence. Dallastown Elementary was  recognized as an Exemplary High Performing School.   I thank Dallastown Area Superintendent Dr. Joshua Doll, the school  board, and the leadership and teachers at Dallastown Elementary for  working so hard for this achievement. In their application, school  principal Charles Patterson noted that one of the distinguishing  characteristics he sees about Dallastown Elementary is that they have  built a school family. The quality education these students receive  prepares them for success throughout the rest of their lives.   Congratulations, again, to Dallastown Elementary School for being  named a 2020 National Blue Ribbon School.                            ____________________
