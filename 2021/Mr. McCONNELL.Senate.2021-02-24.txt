 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, I discussed the K-12 crisis  facing American families. The science shows that in-person schooling  can easily be made safe. Private and religious schools and schools in  Europe have been open for months.   But Washington Democrats have apparently bought into Big Labor's myth  that schools cannot reopen without even more Federal funding, even  though their own plan would only spend about 5 percent--5 percent of  the money this fiscal year.   This is just one illustration of how Democrats started with  preconceived ideological goals and actually worked backward, instead of  starting with the actual needs of American families.   Let's take a look at the economy. When we had to stall our economy to  protect our health system, the Senate wrote the bipartisan CARES Act,  the biggest rescue package in American history. It spent $2.2 trillion  to save the healthcare system, find vaccines, and support families. We  refilled many of those programs with another $920 billion just last  December.   Today, we stand at a very different kind of crossroads. More than 13  percent of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  Manufacturers expect vaccine supply to keep ramping up dramatically in  the weeks ahead.   The trillions we spent on rescue policies in 2020 had the economy  prepped to come roaring back as health conditions keep improving.   Unemployment today is already lower than where, at one point in this  crisis, the Federal Reserve predicted it would be by the end of the  year. In some blue-collar sectors, both total employment and job  openings are already higher than they were before the pandemic. Retail  sales just smashed experts' predictions. Many manufacturers can't keep  pace with demand.   Remarkably, even as economic output obviously shrunk in 2020, overall  household personal income and personal savings actually went up. That  is because of the relief Congress delivered.   There is no question that some American families are still  struggling. Nobody thinks our health or economic fight is finished yet,  but on a broad national scale, households are sitting on an historic  pile of pent-up cash, waiting for the economy to reopen.    The former head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers  says:         We have no historic parallel with anything like this level       of excess saving.    He says we have never seen this much ``dry powder.''   Even mainstream liberal economists agree that our country does not  need another massive fire hose of borrowed money. This is not April of  2020. This is a different chapter. Washington should focus on practical  policies to finish this fight: accelerate vaccinations; get kids back  in school; help the families and small businesses that actually need  help; and get laid-off Americans matched with job openings ASAP.   Unfortunately, the Democrats' partisan proposal would not just be  wasteful but, in certain ways, actually counterproductive. It would  have Washington go out of its way to discourage hiring, discourage a  return to work, and actually keep things shut down longer.   Take the minimum wage policy. The CBO says this abrupt, one-size- fits-all change would kill about 1\1/2\ times as many jobs as the  number of workers it would lift out of poverty.   Or take their proposal for another long-term extension of a big  Federal supplement to unemployment benefits. Even in the middle of last  year, it was questionable policy to pay people more to stay home than  essential workers were earning while actually on the job. Now another  long-term, flat supplement would make even less sense.   Here is how one leading economist puts it:         In an expanding economy that is putting the virus behind       it, paying people more in unemployment than they could       receive from working is an act of substantial economic self-      harm. It would keep workers on the sidelines, stop the       unemployment rate from falling as rapidly as it otherwise       would, and slow the overall recovery.    Then there is the $350 billion bailout for State and local  governments, many of whom have already seen revenues and receipts  rebound. It is several multiples of any sober estimate of the actual  need. Apparently, even Senators on the Democratic side are trying to  pare back this absurd request--just one more way this proposal seems to  be stuck back in April of last year.   I haven't even talked about the hundreds of millions of dollars for  pet projects without a shred of relevance to the pandemic or the  recovery--money for ``climate justice,'' transportation earmarks for  the Democratic leader's home State--all kinds of liberal wish list  items that would do nothing to help American families put COVID behind  them. Just about 1 percent of the money is for vaccines, so either the  new administration has completely taken their eye off the ball or they  were not actually starting from scratch at all, like they claimed. Only  5 percent of the education funding would even go out this fiscal year.  Only 5 percent of the education funding would go out this fiscal year.   Our own Senate Democratic colleagues are reportedly admitting parts  [[Page S837]]  of this are poorly targeted. Liberal economists and the Washington  Post's editorial board are saying Americans deserve more bang for their  buck--a predictably chilly reception for a partisan bill that started  with an outdated, ideological wish list instead of the current needs of  American families.
