 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial  Surgeons. Founded in 1918 by 29 dentists, the organization has grown to  include more than 9,000 members today.   Oral and maxillofacial surgery is the surgical arm of dentistry.  These doctors are a critical component of the medical profession. They  practice in a variety of settings, including private clinical practice,  ambulatory surgery centers, and hospitals. They also provide service in  academia, the military, and the research industry. Many of these  surgeons reside and provide critical patient care in my home State of  Texas.   Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize the members of the American  Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons for their work, and I  offer my support for their mission to ensure excellence in patient care  by advancing, promoting, and preserving the specialty of oral and  maxillofacial surgery.                            ____________________
