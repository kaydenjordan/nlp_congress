 Madam Speaker, this week, the House will consider the  INVEST in America Act.   This bill is a critical and transformative component of President  Biden's bold action plan to invest in our Nation's infrastructure while  creating good-paying American jobs and rebuilding our economy as we  continue to navigate through the pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased the bill includes several of my  provisions that make significant investments in building resilient  infrastructure to withstand the impacts of climate change, including  wildfires and floods, while at the same time putting the U.S. on a path  to achieving zero emissions in the transportation sector.   The INVEST in America Act provides us an opportunity to fix our  country's crumbling infrastructure while ensuring economic prosperity  for America's workers and their families.   I am committed to continuing to work with President Biden and all my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure these historic  investments in our future come to fruition now.   This is our moment.                            ____________________
