 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleague and  coanchor for the Congressional Black Caucus, Delegate Stacey Plaskett,  on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order hour  where we can reflect on the priorities facing the American public.   This week, this body will be voting on the topic of raising the  minimum wage and giving Americans a well-deserved raise and the impact  that that would have not only on the workforce at large but,  specifically, for Black workers and families across the United States.   Why is this so important as we touch on the issues of the day?  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is no  place in America where a full-time worker making the current minimum  wage of $7.25 an hour can afford a modest two-bedroom apartment.   Additionally, many working people, particularly working women and  Black workers, are still facing persistent and even, in some cases,  worsening wage gaps since 2000. The wage gap between Black and White  workers has grown significantly.   So for this hour, Mr. Speaker, we will discuss the issues affecting  American workers and why it is imperative that this House take up the  WAGE Act that we will be considering later this week.                                time  1945    I am honored to have with us here this evening several members of the  Congressional Black Caucus who will share their thoughts, concerns, and  priorities for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for  bringing forward her commitment and leadership on these important  issues and sharing her support for the Raise the Wage Act, which this  body will be considering later this week.   Just before we started this Special Order hour, one of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle came up and talked about the negative  impact of raising the Federal minimum wage. It is so interesting that  CEOs for the 350 largest U.S. companies on average were paid $18.9  million in 2017, which is a 17 percent increase from the previous year.  Meanwhile, wages for the average U.S. worker grew by 0.2 percent during  that time.   How is it okay that CEO pay can go up 17 percent, and the average CEO  for the 350 largest U.S. companies can, on average, be paid $19  million, and we can't afford to give America a raise?   On average, controlling for age, gender, and education, Black workers  are paid 16.2 percent less than White workers. According to the Census  Bureau--which is why it is so important for people to participate in  the Census, so that we have this vital data--in 2016, the average  household income for a White family was $80,720. For a Black family,  that number sat at $38,555, less than half of what an average White  family took home.   That affects every aspect of that family's life, from their ability  to afford housing to healthcare to being able to put food on the table  and put gas in the car so that they can make it to their work.   We believe that one job should be enough and that people should be  able to have a livable wage to take care of themselves and their  families.   I urge my colleagues throughout this body, particularly those on the  other side, that if they are going to come to this floor this week and  oppose giving Americans a raise, then they have to be able to explain  why they support CEO pay increasing more than 17 percent in one given  year while U.S. worker wages grew at less than 0.2 percent during that  same time.   Workers deserve a wage increase. Their wages have been stagnant for  far too long. That is why we are encouraging this body to bring up the  Raise the Wage Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans),  who is my good friend. He is a gentleman with whom I have the honor of  serving on the Ways and Means Committee. The Representative likes to  talk about the history of his great city, and I know he is here to also  talk about why the constituents of that great city deserve a wage  increase.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  and again thank him for his dedication and commitment on behalf of his  constituents in Philadelphia, in bringing their voice to this process.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of tonight's Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are led by a dynamic chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus, the Representative from California,  Congresswoman Karen Bass, and I had the honor of attending one of her  congressional field hearings this week. The CBC is dedicated on a  number of policy platforms, and this is among them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands  (Ms. Plaskett), my colleague, whom I am coanchored with this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and I appreciate, again, her work as a coanchor tonight  and bringing not only the increasing issues of wages for American  workers, but tying and connecting the point around housing and the  ability to really afford to live.   As we have heard time and time again from our constituents, people  are falling behind, and it is because they have seen stagnant wages for  far too long. While the other side is giving corporate tax cuts to the  wealthiest, 83 percent of the benefit of their $1.7 trillion tax going  to benefit only the top 1 percent, it has done nothing to help the  working poor and those who actually help build a strong economy.   For the past 40 years, Congress has failed to increase the minimum  wage to keep up with inflation, making it the longest period of time in  history without an increase. Today's minimum wage workers have less  buying power than minimum wage workers had in the 1960s. In the past 40  years, the Federal minimum wage, stuck at $7.25 since 2009, has lost 30  percent of its value.   What does this mean? It means the minimum wage is worth less today  than it was in 1960. The same wage can't buy you as much due to  inflation and wages not being corrected to match for inflation.   The person who has been leading the charge as the chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee, the person who has brought so much  perspective on so many issues, from criminal justice reform to voting  rights and now is making sure that this body considers the Raise the  Wage Act this week, is none other than Congressman  Bobby Scott.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman from the Education  and Labor Committee. It makes a big difference when he has the gavel  and the priorities that he has set as the chairman of that committee  and the fact that, as we have done from the beginning of this Congress,  the For the People Agenda has been focused on making a difference in  the lives of the American people that we represent.   The gentleman just pointed out that two-thirds of the minimum wage  workers in this country are women and that two-fifths--in fact, 38  percent of African Americans and one-third, 33 percent of Latinos-- would get a raise when we pass the legislation and the Federal minimum  wage is increased to $15 an hour.   It would also boost the economy. A 10 percent increase in the minimum  wage would increase sales by around $2 billion each year.   Now, I want to just take on a couple of the myths that have been out  there with this administration and my Republican colleagues who have  opposed the efforts of the House Democrats to bring forward this wage  increase.   One of the myths out there is around the Black unemployment rate in  this country. We hear often the President say that, among certain  racial groups, particularly African Americans, the unemployment rate is  at an all-time low.   And while it is, in fact, true that the unemployment rate is down and  it has been down and has been steadily falling since 2011, well before  Trump was sworn into office, that rate of decline has not gained  momentum since.   In fact, even at an annual rate of 6.6 percent, the Black  unemployment rate is still more than double the White unemployment  rate, which is at 3.2 percent.   What this says is that the Black unemployment rate has been about  double the White unemployment rate for more than four decades, making  this relationship more historically significant than any single  unemployment rate.   So, Mr. President, if you want to take credit for the low  unemployment rate among African Americans, then you need to be held  accountable for keeping the rate down and to propose a plan to close  the persistent 2-to-1 racial disparity that has existed for more than  40 years.   Another issue that I want to take on is the fact of the amount of  jobs that have been created since this administration has taken over.  We know that many of the jobs that have been created are, in fact, low- wage, low-paying jobs. Many of the jobs are in the gig economy, and  those individuals are not getting paid the same amount as traditional  workers.   We know that many employers are paying workers for less than full- time work, which means that they still cannot provide for their  families, that they are not being afforded healthcare, and, in fact,  the government is subsidizing many of these corporations--the same  corporations that give their CEOs 17 percent pay increases but then  want to tell the workers: ``You can't have a raise.''   And these are the myths that the other side wants to, again, put out  there to distract from the House Democrats and our agenda in giving  Americans a raise.   Now, I want to just touch on one specific point from my home State in  Nevada. Recently, our Governor, Governor Steve Sisolak, the first  Democratic Governor to be elected in Nevada in 20 years, signed into  law a $12 minimum wage increase, following 10 years of wage stagnation  for working-class families in Nevada.   In fact, the last time we raised the minimum wage in Nevada was when  I was serving in the State Senate. So, elections do have consequences.   But, with the help of our legislative leaders, Speaker Jason Frierson  and Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, the Nevada legislature  increased the Nevada minimum wage to $12. But that raise won't go into  effect until 2020, and, for now, one in five workers in Nevada are  making under $12 an hour, less than $24,000 a year--$24,000 a year.   What is a family supposed to do? How are they supposed to make ends  meet on $24,000 per year?   Mr. Speaker, $12 for Nevadans is a step in the right direction, but  we need to be working to provide equitable wages for all Nevadans.   The Raise the Wage Act would work toward a $15 minimum wage by 2024,  as the chairman from the Education and Labor Committee indicated.   A pay increase will benefit 127,000 workers in my district alone.  Specifically, it will raise wages for 18,800 Black workers, more than  any other congressional district in Nevada.   So, the Raise the Wage Act is an important measure. It would give up  to 27 million workers a raise, lifting 1.3 million Americans out of  poverty and boosting economic growth by putting money into the pockets  of workers, who will spend that money in growing the economy, not like  the corporate tax cut that was given to big corporations where they  simply just bought up more shares of their own stock.   They didn't do anything to hire more workers or to help stimulate the  economy. They just made themselves more rich.   All Americans who work hard deserve to be able to afford a middle- class life and opportunities to get ahead.   I believe that one job should be enough and that it is time that we  set our children up for success by making sure that working families  have the wages that they need to provide for themselves and their  family.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman was talking about the  impact beyond just family incomes, which is important. And we want to  give all Americans a raise.   While the priorities on the other side were about giving corporations  and billionaires more wealth creation, we are laser-focused on putting  more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans.   But the question I have is around the recent research with States  that, following an increase in wages, we actually can see the rates of  suicides fall, consumer spending rise, and a more productive workforce.   There is no place in America where a full-time worker making $7.25 an  hour can support their entire family, let alone afford basic needs.   There is no place in America where a full-time worker making the  current $7.25 an hour can support their entire family.   And, as I said, the productivity piece--which, again, my colleagues  are always talking about the need to make America more competitive and  more productive. Well, in one study, researchers tracked 10,000 workers  at about 200 department stores and found that a dollar increase in the  minimum wage led a typical employee to sell about 5.4 percent more per  hour.   So, if we give workers the wage that they are deserving of, they will  put that extra money to work for the American economy, unlike giving  more tax breaks to the wealthy. For a worker earning the minimum wage,  the increase could be almost 20 percent.                                time  2030    Now, again, I have underscored repeatedly the impacts to the economy,  and we will take on that debate later this week when this bill comes to  the floor.   But the point I just wanted to ask my colleague about is that human  impact. You know, this is more than just numbers. This is the two- thirds of American workers who are women who are increasingly the head  of their household.   So can the gentlewoman relate to that impact and the constituents  that she serves and the stories that she has heard about the anxiety  that they go through every day and not being able to make ends meet?    Mr. Speaker, I know the affected workers that I hear  from in my district, they want this raise. This raise would provide on  the order of about $3,000 a year. That is enough money to make a  tremendous difference in the life of a preschool teacher, a bank  teller. We have got fast-food workers who, today, struggle to get by on  around $20,000 a year.   A $15 minimum wage by 2024 would generate $144 billion in higher  wages for workers and would also benefit the communities in which they  live.   So while corporate profits, as a share of our national income, are at  an all-time high, wages are at a 65-year low. So if we are not going to  give workers a raise now, when are we going to give it to them? They  have been waiting for far too long.   I want to commend the leadership of our Speaker, of course; the  chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, the chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee, it is because of their leadership, the  chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Hakeem Jeffries, and others,  that this is part of the For the People Agenda.  [[Page H5822]]    This is why we are laser-focused. And we are laser-focused on a lot  of priorities. We want to give workers a raise. We also want to address  housing affordability. We want to address the issues around healthcare  costs and the out-of-pocket expenses that so many Americans are dealing  with.   We know that more entrepreneurs want to start a new business, and we  want to give them the tools and the resources necessary for them to do  so.   We want to repeal some of the unnecessary tax burdens on Americans,  like the Cadillac tax on healthcare, which I know this body is also  going to be considering.   So these are among the priorities of the House Democratic Caucus in  the For the People Agenda that we are raising up and reminding people  that we need to deal with this congressional session.   So, just to highlight, again, the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 would  gradually raise the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024; and  here is how it would work.   As the chairman has indicated, it would raise the Federal minimum  wage to $8.55 this year and increase it over the next 5 years until it  reaches $15 an hour in 2024. After 2024, it would adjust the minimum  wage each year to keep pace with growth in the typical worker's wages,  something that we have not done for some time.   It would phase out the outdated sub-minimum wage for tip workers,  which has been frozen at a meager $2.13 since 1991. And it would sunset  the sub-minimum wages for workers with disabilities employed in  sheltered workshops, and for workers under age 20.   This is a commonsense measure, something that American workers and  our constituents have been demanding. In fact, 1 in 9 U.S. workers are  paid wages that leave them in poverty today, even when working full- time and year round. And so that is why this bill is so important, the  Raise the Wage Act.   I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to bring this  measure to the floor later this week, and to debate with my colleagues  on the other side where they stand and whether they will join with the  House Democrats to pass this legislation over to the Senate so that  they can also take action.   I also want to just touch on a point that my colleague was talking  about, dealing with home ownership in the Black community. Today, The  Wall Street Journal released a report that Black home ownership is at  an all-time low. It has fallen 8.6 percentage points since its peak in  2004, hitting an all-time low in the first quarter of this year.   Homes and neighborhoods with a concentration of Black homeowners, on  average, are worth less than 6 percent than they were in 2006. And in  the second quarter of 2018, Black home ownership stood at 41.6 percent,  down more than a full half percent from the first quarter rate.   Nationally, the Black home ownership rate is only 41.6 percent,  virtually unchanged from 50 years ago when the Federal Fair Housing Act  banned racial discrimination in housing. The national White home  ownership rate, by comparison, is 71 percent.   So these are really dire statistics that I wanted to bring to the  attention of this body. I know that the chairwoman of the Financial  Services Committee, Maxine Waters, and her Subcommittee on Housing are  working to tackle this problem as well.    But it is time that we address the 30 percent point gap in home  ownership between Black and White Americans, which is at its highest  point in the new millennium.   Why is this so important?   It is, because, for Black Americans, so much of our wealth is  accumulated in the equity of home ownership. And again, this is central  to the issue of giving workers a raise because they need that raise in  order to afford the higher cost of housing, the higher cost of  healthcare, the higher cost of food, the higher cost of gas. Everything  is going up but their pay check, and that is what I hear from my  constituents, from those who are earning a minimum wage.   Under the Raise the Wage Act, it would increase by almost 20 percent.  So I am looking forward to, again, debating my colleagues on this  important issue when we come to the floor later this week.   As we have talked about here tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus  is laser-focused on making sure that Americans get a raise. We know  that giving Americans a raise would give up to 27 million workers the  benefit of increased take-home pay. It would lift 1.3 Americans out of  poverty. And it would boost our economic growth by putting money where  it belongs, in the pockets of workers who will spend that money in the  economy.   Unlike what was done with the corporate tax cuts that were given,  where 83 percent of the benefit of the $1.7 trillion tax cut went to  benefit just the top 1 percent, we are focused on helping everyday  Americans get the money they need in their pocket.   Now, I asked a question at the beginning of tonight's Special Order  hour dealing with the 350 CEOs from the largest U.S. companies who  earned an average pay, in 2017, of $1.89 million. That is a lot of  money.   I have no beef with CEOs getting a fair pay, but that pay increase  amounted to a 17 percent increase from the previous year. And just  before we started the Special Order hour, one of my colleagues came to  the floor and said that increasing the Federal minimum wage would be  devastating to our economy.   Well, what does he say about the CEOs who are getting record pay and  record bonuses, and the fact that all of the corporate tax cuts that  they provided went to just buying more stocks in those companies?   Meanwhile, the wages for the average U.S. worker grew at .2 percent  during that same time. This is a fundamental question that I honestly  would like my colleagues to be able to answer, and I will seek them out  during this week, because I want them to join with us to pass this  bill.   This really should not be a partisan issue. Giving Americans a raise  is something that we all should agree on benefits all of our workers.  My colleagues on the other side have low-wage, low-paid workers in  their district just like I have low-wage, low-paid workers in my  district.   The Raise the Wage Act of 2019, which proposes raising the Federal  minimum wage in six steps to $15 an hour by 2024, will result in a pay  increase for 38.1 percent of all Black workers and 23.2 percent of all  White workers.   This disproportional effect on Black workers comes not just because  they are more often employed in jobs that currently pay less, as we  have discussed tonight, than the proposed minimum wage, but also  because they are less likely to work in States or localities that have  passed a State minimum wage that is higher than the Federal minimum  wage.   So that is why it is time for Federal policy to set the standard so,  regardless, of where you live, you can earn a decent, livable wage to  provide for yourself and your family.   We believe that one job should be enough. It should be enough to  provide for you and your family. It should be enough to put a roof over  your head. It should be enough to make sure that you can pay for the  copays and the prescription drugs that you need in order to stay well.   It should be enough so that we can address food insecurity in this  country; and it should be enough so that your children can be set up  for success in their future.   I encourage each and every one of my colleagues this week to study  this bill; to think about the constituents back home in their district;  and to ask themselves, what were we sent here to do; to help the well- off and the well-connected, or to give voice to those who deserve to be  heard in this body?   I am honored to be a Representative from Nevada's Fourth  Congressional District; and I know my district is not exactly the same  as every other district, but I have rural parts and I have urban parts  of my district, covering 52,000 square miles.   The commonality in my district is that there are struggling people  throughout every corner of my district. And so when I vote this week in  favor of giving workers a raise, I will be voting to give a raise to  every single worker throughout Nevada's Fourth, and throughout this  great country.   I thank my colleague, the coanchor, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett,  the  [[Page H5823]]  chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Scott, and  each and every one of my colleagues who have spoken here tonight.   I thank the Speaker for giving us this hour to bring about the issues  that are important.   I yield back the balance of my time.
