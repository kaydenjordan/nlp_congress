 Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day.   I am reminded that 17 years ago, I got elected to Congress,  campaigning on tax reform and campaigning on the fact that it is not  our money, it is our constituents' money.   Today we are giving the money back to our constituents. To Bob and  Betty Buckeye in Ohio, it is more wages in their pockets.   The bill also includes an initiative that I worked on with Mr. Kind  that is bipartisan, called the Investing in Opportunity Act,  cosponsored by Mr. Neal. This bill, authored by my friend in the  Senate, Tim Scott, will help areas that haven't seen economic recovery  to allow private investment in poor rural and urban areas. Thanks to  Mr. Scott, the bill was in the Senate version and in the conference  committee.   Mr. Neal knows that incentives like that, the low-income housing tax  credit, the new markets tax credit, and the historic tax credit will  help those in communities that have been left behind with more money in  working families' pockets.   I urge adoption of the conference report.
