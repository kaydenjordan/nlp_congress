 Mr. President, this past October, the young women who make  up the Burlington High School girls soccer team in Burlington, VT, made  a statement: The time for equal pay is now. All they are looking for is  for their leaders--leaders like us in Congress--to show the courage to  make it happen.   It all began one Friday night in October, when, after scoring a goal  to put them ahead in the closing minutes of a game against neighboring  rivals South Burlington, four exuberant members of the soccer team  removed their jerseys to reveal T-shirts emblazoned with this simple  phrase: ``#EqualPay.''   The reception to their silent statement was reminiscent of that  moment when the U.S. Women's National Team made history in July,  winning its second consecutive World Cup title. After a thrilling win  over the Netherlands, the stadium in France was filled with chants of  ``Equal Pay! Equal Pay!''.   One Friday in October, the stands--though smaller--in Burlington, VT,  erupted in the same way. The result? Yellow cards for the offending  players, issued by a referee bound by the rules of the league.   The young women of the Burlington High School soccer team became  overnight sensations. Within a matter of days, they had sold more than  2,000 of their now iconic simple white T-shirts, raising more than  $30,000 to support the Greater Burlington Girls Soccer League. Men were  invited to pay an extra $4 for the $25 T-shirt: 16 percent of the cost,  to represent the pay gender pay gap in Vermont. Their story was  reported by local outlets like VTDigger and the Burlington Free Press,  and it was featured on ``Good Morning America'' and on CNN. It even  reached across the pond, where the UK's Daily Mail featured the team's  advocacy. I ask unanimous consent that the report from VTDigger be  printed in the Record following these remarks.   The lesson here is simple, and the voices could not be clearer: Equal  pay for equal work should not be controversial, nor should it be  challenged. Yet today in Vermont, a woman makes $0.84 for every $1  earned by a man. In some States, the gap is as wide as 70 percent. It  is inexplicable. It is inexcusable. And it needs to stop.   Marcelle and I are proud to support the young women of the Burlington  High School soccer team. We proudly wore our #EqualPay shirts outside  the U.S. Capitol, standing in solidarity with these young Vermonters  and with women everywhere who are simply demanding what should be  theirs: equal pay for equal work.   Earlier this year, after the U.S. Women's National Team's inspiring  victory at the World Cup, I reintroduced a simple resolution calling  for the Federation Internationale de Football Association, FIFA, to  immediately eliminate gender pay inequity and treat all athletes with  the same respect and dignity, regardless of gender. It is  straightforward. It is common sense. And it is past due.   Following the October game, the referee who issued the yellow card  bought one of the team's #EqualPay shirts for himself. I find in that  action a simple metaphor: There is simply no longer support for arcane  practices that never should have existed. We should heed the call of  the next generation and end these discriminatory practices, not just in  sports but across the workforce. Equal pay for equal work should be the  right of every person. It is as simple as that.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the VTDigger, Oct. 22, 2019]      Burlington Girls Soccer Team Makes Waves With Equal Pay Activism                             (By Aidan Quigley)         Burlington.--When Burlington girls soccer midfielder Helen       Worden knocked in the take-the-lead goal during the team's       Friday night game against South Burlington with under five       minutes to play, her team burst into a celebration.        Team members took the opportunity to lift their jerseys up       to reveal #equalpay T-shirts underneath, with a few removing       their jerseys to show the full #equalpay shirts.        While four members of the teams received yellow cards for       removing their jerseys, the celebration--and team's efforts       for gender pay equality--went viral over the weekend, with an       appearance on ``Good Morning America,'' coverage on CNN and a       slew of supportive messages.        The team was inspired by the U.S. women's national soccer       team's campaign this summer during the World Cup. Members of       the national team filed a federal lawsuit alleging gender       discrimination against U.S. Soccer which stated the women's       team generated $20 million more in revenue than the men's       team while earning a quarter of what the men were paid.        Klara Martone, Burlington's senior goalie, said that the       players were working hard in school and wanted to bring       attention to the pay gap in society.        ``The idea that we could work this hard and still make less       money just based on our gender is incredible to me,'' Martone       said. ``We want to live in our adult lives in a world where       we don't have to worry about making less money.''        The girls have sold 2,000 T-shirts and raised a total of       $30,000 as of Monday afternoon.        Worden went to France this summer and witnessed the United       States win the World Cup. A chant after the win stuck with       her.        ``People were cheering `equal pay,' and it was super       inspiring,'' Worden said. ``So I came back and talked to (my       teammates) about it, and said we should contribute in some       way.''        Martone said that the team originally planned on wearing       ``equal pay'' T-shirts for a dress-up day near the start of       the season. But the idea gained steam, and the team decided       to open up T-shirt orders to the community.        Junior right back Ruby Wool said at the start, having the       boys soccer team wear the T-shirts was a ``big victory'' for       the team.        ``Those small little steps we were taking were so big to       us, and with each thing everything is getting bigger,'' Wool       said. ``As of right now, I don't think it's going to get       smaller for a while.''        The team was ``fuming'' when they received yellow cards at       Friday's game, Worden said.        As four of the girls received yellow cards, the crowd       chanted ``equal pay.''        ``The good thing about the card was hearing everybody had       our back,'' senior center back/mid Maggie Barlow said. ``That       was one of the moments we were like, `wow, we have such a big       support system.' It was worth it because that was amazing to       hear.''        Coach Jeff Hayes said some members of the South Burlington       team came over the referees and requested that they not card       their opponents. The cards were an exciting moment for the       team, he said.        The four players who received yellow cards had to be       temporarily taken out of the game and were not able to check       back in before South Burlington equalized minutes later. The       game ended in a 1-1 tie.        The effort was applauded by Brandi Chastain, a longtime       member of the U.S. national team who famously removed her       jersey in celebration of her penalty kick goal which won the       1999 World Cup.        ``Thank you @bhsgirlssoccer for standing up, celebrating       and taking your jerseys off for #equalpay Proud of you!       #rolemodels,'' Chastain tweeted Saturday.        Removing a jersey as part of a goal celebration--a popular       goal celebration--is an  [[Page S6884]]       automatic yellow card under the regulations of FIFA, soccer's       worldwide governing body.        Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy tweeted a photo of himself and       his wife, Marcelle, both wearing the #equalpay jerseys.        ``Marcelle and I stand with you!'' Leahy tweeted.        The team has worked with Change The Story VT, a nonprofit       initiative which works to address the wage gap and advance       economic opportunities for women in the state. Women in       Vermont earn 84 cents to every dollar earned by men,       according to Change the Story.        Jessica Nordhaus, director of strategy and partnerships for       Change the Story, said the organization has been helping the       team with logistics and strategy. She said it has been a good       opportunity to talk to young people about the wage gap, which       isn't on track to close until 2048.        ``They're doing the math and thinking, `How old will I be       in 2048?' '' Nordhaus said. ``We've just been so thrilled to       see them take this issue on and do some of the activism that       raises awareness about pay inequity.''        The team is selling the jerseys for $25, with a looser fit       ``men's'' style jersey for $29.80. The men's jersey is 16%       more expensive, which is meant to even the wage gap.        The jerseys have #EqualPay on the front with the BHS       Seahorse logo and Change The Story logos on the sleeves.        Funds raised in the sales will go to a local youth soccer       Greater Burlington Girls Soccer League. The players are       hoping the funds raised can help with outreach across the       city and help make participants in the soccer league more       reflective of the demographics of the city.        ``We want them to be able to give scholarships to girls who       aren't able to play,'' Barlow said. ``We're working on       widening access for all different kinds of people and making       sure GBGSL has the means to fund that.''        The team finished its regular season with a 9-4-1 record,       receiving the fourth seed in the Division 1 playoffs.       Burlington will face off with 13th seed Brattleboro Wednesday       in the first round of the playoffs.        Hayes said he is excited for the playoffs and that the       activism is bringing the team even closer together.        ``It just brought this team so together,'' Hayes said.       ``They're so cohesive when they are using their voices.       They're making waves in the community, and they're good       waves.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, for 50 years the Inter-American Foundation,  IAF, has partnered with grassroots organizations and underserved  populations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean to advance U.S.  interests by helping to improve the lives of the hemisphere's poorest  people, supporting civil society, and strengthening democratic  institutions. I want to take this opportunity today, on IAF's 50th  anniversary, to comment briefly on the foundation's accomplishments and  on the unique value of small-grant, community-led development.   In 1969, Congress established IAF as an independent development  agency charged with identifying and investing in community-led  development solutions. IAF awards small grants, averaging $280,000 over  4 years, directly to local organizations, eliminating costly  intermediaries and ensuring programs are led and implemented locally.  IAF also requires grantees to contribute or mobilize their own cash or  in-kind resources, helping to ensure sustainability and local  investment in project success. On average, such counterpart investments  mobilize $1.31 for every $1 invested by IAF.   According to IAF, in fiscal year 2019 alone, it awarded $18.5 million  to 97 grassroots organizations in 24 countries and mobilized $20  million in grantee counterpart resources. IAF grantees created more  than 2,500 partnerships with other organizations to share experiences  and advance their missions, trained more than 200,000 people in new  leadership and technical skills, and contributed to the creation of  11,000 new or improved jobs.   IAF's development model illustrates that if modest resources and  technical support are provided directly to communities and their  grassroots organizations so they can define their own needs, design  their own solutions, and invest in their own communities, then local  ownership, self-reliance, and sustainable development are possible.   IAF's small-grants model also enables it to be nimble and responsive  to changing conditions on the ground, including natural and man-made  disasters. In recent years, IAF has used its network of grantees in  Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to support thousands of displaced  Venezuelans and the communities where they have relocated.   After the signing of the Colombia Peace Accords in 2016, IAF launched  the Colombian Peacebuilding Initiative and invested nearly $2 million  in 23 local Colombian organizations to support community-level  peacebuilding and reconciliation.   In Central America, IAF has 98 projects addressing the causes of  migration in areas likely to be targets of criminal gangs in order to  help families and communities resist such violence. And since June  2019, IAF has awarded $650,000 in grants to civil society organizations  across the Eastern Caribbean focused on strengthening community-led  disaster mitigation and preparedness planning.   IAF's successful approach to development is why we increased funding  in the fiscal year 2020 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations  bill, which was reported unanimously by the Appropriations Committee in  September. Increased funding would enable IAF to support a greater  number of meritorious grant proposals, as the foundation was able to  fund only 7 percent of the almost 800 proposals received in fiscal year  2019.   Regrettably, this model of donors directly supporting small-scale,  local initiatives to design, implement, and sustain their own  development solutions is more the exception than the rule. I hope IAF's  50th anniversary serves not only as an opportunity to commemorate its  many accomplishments, but also to reflect on the need to expand IAF's  approach to development across the U.S. Government.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
