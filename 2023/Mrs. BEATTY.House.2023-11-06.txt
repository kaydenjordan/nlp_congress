 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Quigley for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my en bloc amendment filed with my  colleague, Congressman   John Garamendi, which highlights the  importance of the HOME Investment Partnership program to meet  affordable housing needs in the United States.   For 30 years, Mr. Chair, HOME has proven to be one of the most  effective locally driven tools to help States and communities address  their most pressing housing challenges; whether that is new affordable  housing construction, rehabilitation of existing buildings, homebuyer  assistance, and tenant-based rental assistance, including veterans, as  we approach Veterans Day, persons with disabilities, seniors, and  persons experiencing homelessness.   We cannot slash or cut these funds because we know slashing the funds  for the HOME program from $1.7 million to $500 million--the lowest  allocation since the program was established in 1992--at a time when  the Nation, and as we all know in all districts, is facing an  affordable housing crisis, with record lows in housing inventory and  soaring rents and construction costs, slashing such an essential  housing program by nearly 70 percent is unthinkable.   Every American deserves access to safe and affordable housing, and  every single one of my colleagues in this Chamber ought to support the  HOME program to be fully funded to achieve that purpose.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  urge them to support the robust funding for the HOME program.
