 Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend, the ranking  member, Mr. Nadler, for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this bill.   Many of my colleagues may not remember when the Civil Rights Act  became the law of the land in 1964, but I remember. I was there. As a  matter of fact, I gave a little blood during the sit-ins, during the  Freedom Rides.                                time  0930    I remember the struggle, the fight, and the sacrifice of so many to  protect the dignity and the worth of every human being. I was here  serving in this very Chamber when the Americans with Disabilities Act  became the law of the land 26 years later. Yet today, it is  unbelievable; it is unreal; we are considering a bill that turns the  clock backwards and strikes a devastating blow in the fight for civil  rights.   Mr. Chair, I want to make it crystal clear for the record: there is  no place in our country for the burden to be placed on those whose  rights have and will be violated time and time again.   Mr. Chair, this bill is wrong, it is mean-spirited, and it is a shame  and a disgrace that we would bring it to the floor. I urge each and  every one of my colleagues to oppose this bill.
