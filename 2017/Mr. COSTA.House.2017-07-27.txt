 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to our  Nation's infrastructure. I am talking about our roads, our bridges, our  rail corridors, our waterways and dams, the investments that over two  centuries have made America great, the greatest economy in the world.   We have a long history of investing in the infrastructure in America,  starting with the canal and rail systems in the 19th century, the  highways and air transportation systems in the 20th century. However,  over the last 25 years, we have lived off the infrastructure  investments our parents and grandparents made in the previous  generations.   Why? Because there has been a lack of political will here in  Washington, D.C., to make new investments. But Congress, working with  the President, must face this challenge head-on.   I believe there is bipartisan support for infrastructure investment,  having been part of a bipartisan conversation this year with Members of  Congress and with the administration. There is an attempt to offer a  proposal to make major investments in our Nation's infrastructure.   We are talking about four different areas. First, there needs to be  an incentive component. I strongly support incentivizing States and  local governments to provide their own funding for these efforts. We  know infrastructure projects move forward most effectively when local,  State, and the Federal Government all do their part.   In the San Joaquin Valley in my district, Merced, Madera, and Fresno  Counties have all increased their local sales tax to pay for critical  transportation projects. Earlier this year, California enacted a bill  to increase State gas tax and vehicle fees to provide over $52 billion  over the next 10 years in California for much-needed transportation  projects. And while more needs to be done in California, we know that,  if we provide incentives across the country, States ought to come up  and do their part as well.   The second focus of the administration's action is to support  projects in rural areas. On Wednesday last week, the Agriculture  Committee held a hearing in which we discussed strategic infrastructure  investments in rural areas with a goal of increasing opportunities. The  importance of investing in our rural areas cannot be overstated. Too  often, rural America gets left behind in the infrastructure and  development conversation. I know because I represent a large part of  rural America in the San Joaquin Valley in California.   The third focus is transformative projects, projects that make  creative and dramatic changes. I have always supported and will  continue to support these projects, such as high-speed rail in  California, California WaterFix.                                time  1030    Water is so critical to the West, especially in the San Joaquin  Valley. Water provides the food that we have on America's dinner table  every night. It is a national security issue.   These projects support deeper, systemic change, and they can have a  large-scale and lasting impact on the future development of our Nation.  They are investments in our future, like those our parents and  grandparents made in the past.   Lastly, the administration talks about a loan program. These can be  helpful.   Overall, I support these four components. But first we must not pick  winners and losers when improving our Nation's infrastructure. This is,  of course, very challenging. We need to have a policy that must rank  priorities and decide how much we spend and where we spend.   We also must establish criteria to ensure infrastructure decisions  promote fair distribution and cost effectiveness, doing the most good  in critical areas.   Second, while I support public-private partnerships, they should not  provide subsidies to projects that the private sector would already  finance themselves.   Sound infrastructure is literally and figuratively the foundation of  our Nation's economy. It is what has made America the greatest economy  in the world. Countries around the world are making investments in  their infrastructure while the United States sits on the sidelines  engaging in a political debate that does not reflect the reality of the  policy choice we have and the decisions we must make.   Mr. Speaker, we must come together as Democrats and Republicans to  address these serious problems of our Nation's infrastructure, and as  Americans in a bipartisan way because no transportation system, no  water infrastructure system, no improvement in our energy grid, and all  the other elements of our infrastructure are Democratic or Republican.  They are the basis of an investment in America, and that is what we  should be doing as Members of Congress with this administration.   So let's act as legislators. Let's act and show that we can work  together in a bipartisan fashion. Let's show some profiles in courage.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the American Dream and  those who need protection who are striving to fulfill it. These are  individuals who have come to this country as children, as infants,  through no fault of their own, and America is the only country they  have ever known. In essence, they are Americans.   Recognizing these realities, the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals program was created in 2012, otherwise known as DACA.   Since that time, DACA has granted hundreds of thousands of young  immigrants the stability and the protection needed to pursue a college  degree and seek employment, to be a part of America's future.   If we eliminate DACA, these students could see their pursuit of the  American Dream swept away beneath them. In California's San Joaquin  Valley, this could happen to over 500 students at the University of  California, Merced, who I represent, as well as over 1,000 students at  Fresno State University.   Some here in Washington plan on trying to eliminate DACA in coming  months, and I stand here to say we cannot let that happen.    I urge the administration and those to stand with those of us who  want to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and  allow these folks to pursue the same American Dream that our parents,  grandparents, and previous generations were able to do. Let's keep  DACA.                            ____________________
