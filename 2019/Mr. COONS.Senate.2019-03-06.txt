 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize a  true public servant, an individual who has been by my side since my  first year as a Senator, someone who will be dearly missed, not only in  my office but by this institution as a whole as he moves on to his next  chapter this week: my deputy chief of staff and senior policy advisor,  Franz Wuerfmannsdobler.   Franz has had a great impact on this institution, on the staff  members who served here over the last two decades, and on me. His sage  advice, his patience, his incredibly calm demeanor, his willingness to  mentor and guide others, his respect for this institution, and his  knowledge borne out of 20 years of experience in the Senate have  contributed in countless ways to the meaningful work we have been able  to do here for the people of Delaware and our country.   Today, I want to recognize and thank Franz for his remarkable and his  selfless career. I want to thank him for what he has done for me, for  my office, for the people of Delaware, and pay tribute to the legacy he  leaves.   It is a remarkable legacy. He has been on the frontlines of events  and policy battles that have quite literally shaped the history of our  country over the last two decades--from 9/11 to the passage of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, from energy and appropriations  efforts to sustained concerns and engagement around bipartisanship.   Franz's career in the Senate began in 1998 when he served as a  legislative assistant for the late, great Senator Robert Byrd of West  Virginia, who was himself a giant of this body. For 8 years, Franz  handled issues from energy to environment, to climate change and  natural resources. It was also in Senator Byrd's office that Franz cut  his teeth on the complex appropriations process, learning from the  master appropriator himself.   Franz's career then took him to the office of former Senator Byron  Dorgan of North Dakota, where he was a trusted senior energy policy  advisor, and then on the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations  Subcommittee before finally joining my own office in March of 2011.  [[Page S1695]]    Franz's list of legislative accomplishments is long and impressive  and reflects his deep grasp of policy and the mechanics of politics. He  helped to shape elements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. He was central to  establishing reformed fuel economy standards for our Nation's  automobiles and played a key role in the Recovery Act, a massive effort  that helped pull our Nation out of the depths of a recession.   Franz is a person of ideas and vision. His vision for our country has  led to policies that have made our Nation cleaner, more innovative, and  more secure. Likewise, his vision in my Senate office has made our team  more efficient, more effective, and more successful. Franz has played a  key role in shaping my office early on, helping to create a team-based  structure and the positive culture of our legislative staff.   He also introduced me to the valuable concept of having an office  built around and relying on expert legislative fellows, including, in  particular, fellows from the American Association for the Advancement  of Science, whose incredible expertise and deep knowledge in scientific  matters has been invaluable in advancing technology and science policy  in my last 8 years. In total, Franz has mentored more than 15 fellows  during his time in the Senate--13 of them are AAAS fellows in my own  office, and they have attested individually and collectively to the  reach, scope, and power of his guidance and mentorship to them.   Franz is also a master of appropriations--an arcane process that even  the most seasoned legislative veterans should admit that they don't  completely understand. He brought his wealth of experience to our team,  taking the reins of the Federal budget and appropriations process and  building from the ground up the complex and detailed appropriations  system that we use to this day. There is no question that Franz's  expertise and the time he dedicated to building this meticulous system  has made me a more effective member of the Senate Appropriations  Committee and led to countless wins for the State of Delaware--from  funding for critical transportation improvements and investments in our  first responders to support that has helped to establish and enhance  the NIIMBL manufacturing institute of the University of Delaware and to  fully fund science and R&D projects around the country and in my home  State.   Beyond Franz's technical expertise, nothing better exemplifies his  character than the patience and dedication with which he has taught  others about the appropriations process. Each year, Franz hosts  ``Appropriations Bootcamp 101`` to teach new staff members the ins and  outs of this riveting and complex process. He takes the time to explain  it, to get into the weeds, and to answer question after question. Franz  has also taken his show on the road in my home State of Delaware,  meeting with State, local government, and community stakeholders to  explain the appropriations process and help to secure more funding for  our State. He has even developed a legendary method for teaching staff  about appropriations by using bags of marbles to explain funding  allocations for each Appropriations subcommittee. For the record, the  legislative branch gets just one marble.   Franz's patience extends far beyond the annual appropriations  process. He always maintains his cool and has a striking and calming  presence, even in the most trying of circumstances. One of those more  trying circumstances occurred at a staff outing just a few years ago.  Franz had driven a couple of other members of our team, and on their  way home, his car broke down. The group decided to push start the car,  going down a hill to get momentum, while a junior staffer manned the  wheel. Unfortunately, the lack of power steering made it impossible to  turn the wheel. After a good strong push, the car rolled right down the  hill and into a tree. Franz very calmly said: Don't worry about it. It  is not a problem; it is all going to be fine--even when the front end  of his car was unrecognizable. Franz's response to that situation, his  cool and calm demeanor, is characteristic of the grace he has imparted  on all of us, even in some of the most tumultuous times here in the  Senate.   One of the unique things about Franz is that whenever you meet  somebody who knows him or has worked with him, they talk about the ways  in which he has gone out of his own way to help them and mentor them  over the years. So many people in the Senate view Franz not just as a  friend or colleague but as someone who they know has helped them in  their careers and someone who has shown them the ropes and invested  time in supporting them and helping them succeed. One member of my team  described it this way:         Franz has an uncanny ability to take the time necessary to       help. He enables us to do our jobs and do them well. We get       meaningful things done, and that's because of the wisdom       Franz has imparted.''    In an environment here in the Senate that is at times fast paced,  Franz takes the time to invest in younger people. He sees potential in  staff and imparts knowledge and experience, even when there is more  than enough to keep him busy just meeting his own commitments. For  example, Franz took it upon himself to create a manual for the new  fellows who work in my office every year. The manual, which should be  required reading for every new Senate staffer, describes how to write a  bill and important things about the process of working in the Senate.   He also maintains the Capitol Hill Urban Dictionary, which he shares  with new staff and interns to help them decode internal Senate jargon,  including oft-used, but rarely explained phrases like ``en bloc'' or  ``move the needle.'' It explains, for example, what to do when asked:  Do you have language on that.   Franz embraces the importance of teaching the next generation of  Capitol Hill staff how to do their job well. I think that is truly his  greatest legacy--the remarkable diaspora of younger staff members he  has believed in, invested in, and helped to train who are now working  everywhere from the Senate to the House, to the Department of Defense,  to running a nonprofit in Kenya.    Each year, Franz and his wonderful wife Lisa host an annual gathering  at their home for a growing community of current and former fellows  and, literally, dozens of colleagues--folks who have shared  experiences, who care about policy, who like a good geeky joke, and who  enjoy helping each other and developing and sustaining each other's  careers.   That is just the kind of person Franz is. He has impacted so many  people--something that was never more evident than at his wedding to  Lisa a few years ago, which I was deeply honored to have the chance to  officiate. In addition to their friends and family, guests that day  included former Senator Dorgan, folks who had mentored Franz early in  his career, dozens of individuals he mentored himself, and people from  all walks of life who support Franz and Lisa and care about them. It  was a testament to the community they have created, both inside and  outside the Senate.   Franz cares deeply about this institution. He cares about policies,  and he cares about people. He is always looking for ways to bridge the  partisan divide and make this broken place work better. It hasn't  always been easy. Like many of us, Franz has struggled with the slowing  pace of legislative progress in the Senate in recent years and its  increasingly divisive nature. It says so much about him and about his  faith in us and in this institution that he is leaving his Senate  career to go work on these very issues, helping to lead the Bipartisan  Policy Center in advancing bipartisan policy solutions to address the  challenges facing our Nation and the institution of the Senate.   He has made such a mark that he is known throughout this institution  by a single name. Few people are known by just one name--Bono, Noah,  Cher, Franz. With Franz's leaving the Senate, I promise to continue to  do my part here to bridge what divides us where we can and to do the  important work required of us. That includes passage of the Master  Limited Partnerships Parity Act, important bipartisan legislation that  will level the tax playing field for clean energy, which Franz has  worked on for Congress after Congress as long as I have been here--work  that I intend to finish.   While I am sad today to see Franz leave my office in the Senate, he  will be deeply missed by everyone on my staff and everyone who has  benefited from his wisdom, but I am also excited  [[Page S1696]]  to see the inspiring things he will accomplish in his next chapter.   I want to thank Franz for his dedication, his leadership, and his  expertise. I want to thank his family for sharing him with us these  past 8 years in my office and these 2 decades here in the Senate. He  inspires me every day to be a better and more thoughtful, more careful,  and more caring legislator. He leaves a deep and positive impact on all  of us that we will not soon forget. Thank you, Franz. You will be  deeply missed.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
