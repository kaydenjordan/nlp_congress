 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and ranking  member for their great leadership.   Mr. Speaker, imagine a mother crying in despair while holding her  child in her arms, a child who is gasping for his last breath, an  innocent victim of a barrel bomb filled with sarin gas dropped on his  school.   The situation in Syria is the worst humanitarian crisis since World  War II. President Assad's brutal regime has killed half a million  innocent victims and displaced 14 million more, with millions fleeing  into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and over Europe, straining their  resources, threatening regional stability, weakening European  institutions, and undermining United States economic and security  interests.   We must hold Assad and his supporters responsible for their  atrocities. American leadership is needed more now than ever. I urge my  colleagues to support the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, I fear that one day we will look back and we will ask:  Why did we not do more?
