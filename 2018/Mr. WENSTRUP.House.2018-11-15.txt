 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is with both sadness and pride that I rise to honor  Damon Nelson. America lost a great patriot at too young of an age.  Damon dedicated nearly his entire life to public service and always put  service above self. He understood that freedom comes at a high price,  and he dedicated his life to defending freedom for the next generation.   He believed that our country is worth sacrificing for and that  freedom is worth fighting for. As Mr. Holding said, he served in the  U.S. Air Force as an in-flight refueling specialist and was a veteran  of the Persian Gulf War where he earned the Air Medal and three Air  Achievement Medals.   Damon began his service on Capitol Hill working for his home  district, the 22nd District of California. I know Damon for his  exemplary service as the staff director for the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence. Damon helped guide our committee and indeed  our country through a tumultuous time with an unfailing commitment to  seeking the truth and doing the right thing.   His calm leadership approach is an example to all of us. At moments  where it seems like things may be falling apart, Damon was there with a  joke and a laugh to hold the group together. He often used sarcasm with  us when we needed it most, and he was a statesman when we needed it  most. His kind and patient demeanor earned Damon the respect of  everyone he knew. In a political climate that is often difficult, he  kept sight on the fact that we are all Americans.   Indeed, all of us who knew Damon will sorely miss his strategic mind,  warm personality, and genuine concern for others. My heart is with  Damon's wife, Dana, and his family. I pray God's healing grace will be  with them during this difficult time.
