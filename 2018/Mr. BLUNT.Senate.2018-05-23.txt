 Mr. President, I join my colleague from Georgia. I also  join Senator Hoeven in mentioning the incredible leadership that  Senator Isakson has shown for veterans and the way we deal with  veterans' concerns. We honor their service.   The Senator from North Dakota just mentioned that Monday, of course,  is Memorial Day. On Memorial Day in 1983, President Reagan said:         I don't have to tell you how fragile this precious gift of       freedom is. Every time we hear, watch, or read the news, we       are reminded that liberty is a rare commodity in this world.    President Reagan's words from 35 years ago are every bit as  significant today as they were then. The willingness to pay the price  for freedom has been paid by every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine,  and every person in the Coast Guard, the National Guard, and the  Reserves. So on Memorial Day, we honor their willingness to do that.   This is a good time also for us to discuss the things Congress has  been doing to try to honor that service as we continue to look at the  challenges that veterans face. I have spoken before about the HIRE Vets  Act, which was signed into law last year. The bill established the HIRE  Vets Program within the Department of Labor to provide tiered  recognition of what employers do based on their contributions for  veteran employment. Some of the criteria were things like these: What  percentage of the new hires are veterans or what percentage of the  overall workforce is veterans? What types of training and leadership  development opportunities are made available that veterans have unique  opportunities to take advantage of? What recognition is given to skills  that veterans learn while serving? What other benefits and resources  are offered to veterans--things like tuition assistance?   Creating a national standard will help vets narrow down their  employment options and focus on their job search efforts.   The HIRE Vets Program is up and running. This year, over 300  employers have signed up to participate in the pilot program, and we  will see how that pilot works. I hope it works as well as those of us  who sponsored and voted for the legislation thought it would--as a way  to begin to give the recognition to employers that they deserve when  they go beyond saying: Of course, we like to hire vets. HIRE Vets shows  just exactly how much you like to hire vets and what difference it  makes when you hire those vets.   The second program that is getting started this year is the Military  Family Stability Act. It was signed into law last November. We have the  most powerful military in the world, the most well-trained military in  the world, and a military that we have invested money, training, and  energy in like none other. But the real strength of the military,  according to military leader after military leader, is military  families.   In the Military Family Stability Act, we have created a new  opportunity for families, because of education reasons or work reasons,  to leave earlier than the spouse who is serving has been assigned for  or to stay a little later if school is going to start before you  otherwise were going to get there or school is going to be out a couple  of weeks or a couple of months after the serving spouse had to leave.  We have given families that option for the first time, where the family  residential support money stays, and I think lots of families are going  to take advantage of that. Families in the past could do that if  everybody up and down the chain of command agreed. Now families get to  do that because they think it works for their families.   Secretary Mattis and Chairman McCain are very supportive of this  program, as was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General  Dunford, and we are looking forward to seeing how families are able  this year, for the first time, to look at that next assignment and  decide when it is the right time for the family to move to that  assignment.   I have talked to lots of families, many of whom saw that moment as  the moment they decided to leave the military or the moment they looked  back and saw it as their most challenging time, when a spouse's job had  to needlessly suffer or that last month of school couldn't be completed  just because they didn't have that flexibility.   Now, President Trump has just nominated Acting Secretary Robert  Wilkie to head the VA. We look forward to his leadership there. The  President and the acting head of the VA just signed a contract with  Cerner, a Kansas City company that will modernize the VA's healthcare  IT records, the records that healthcare providers in the whole system  can access. Cerner was already in the process of coming up with a  system that worked for the active Defense Department. So it only made  sense for them to be the company that also makes that transition into  the even bigger VA health system--a system that works.   Almost 2 million veterans have used the Veterans Choice Program.  Senator Isakson has talked about how the bill we will be voting on  improves that program. The Senator from North Dakota just spoke about  some of the obstacles that, frankly, the VA system had put in the way  of veterans who wanted to take advantage of the program.   I have had people from Missouri in our office lately who are looking  at VA health. We had a great discussion with the hospital  administrators in our State about how it not only helps them but  particularly helps small community hospitals, if they can identify  something that a community hospital does better than they do and they  are able to assign that work to be done there.   The bill expands, as Senator Hoeven just mentioned, the caregivers  program and makes the eligibility for caregivers greater than it has  been before.   Senator Blumenthal and I had a bill that was incorporated into the  program, the Veteran PEER Act, which just simply turns to peer group  veterans and lets them become part of the emotional and mental support  team for veterans who are being challenged. I am glad to see that  legislation in the MISSION act that has gone through the process.  Certainly, Senator Isakson and Senator Boozman and others on the  Veterans Committee--the people who have served on that committee in  many cases in the House and Senate--realize what needs to be done here.  Nearly 40 veterans service organizations, like the VFW and the American  Legion, support this legislation.   Together with the VA MISSION Act, the electronic health records  system contract that is now being performed by Cerner, the HIRE Vets  Act, and the Military Family Stability Act, I think what we see here is  that when we think we have done everything we need to do to honor our  veterans and, then, we look more closely, we find that there are still  things that we can do, that we will do, that we clearly are willing to  do. We owe veterans that.   We recognize veterans in many ways over the next few days, but the  Veterans' Administration has a job to recognize veterans every day and  fulfill our obligation to veterans every day. I look forward to seeing  the implementation of this well-thought-out addition to the veterans  health system.   I see my friend from Arkansas, Senator Boozman, is here, and he is  next on our list.
