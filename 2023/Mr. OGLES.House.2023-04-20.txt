 Mr. Speaker, you would hope that during a time of high  inflation and energy prices, that the U.S. Treasury Department would  focus on promoting economic policies that support the American  taxpayer. Unfortunately, common sense is not a common trait with the  Biden administration.   Instead, the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people are being  spent by the Treasury Department to promote garbage, exclusionary, and  profoundly racist DEI ideology. This evil and grotesque concept  threatens to tear our country apart, and this President clearly  couldn't care less.   Efforts to promote so-called equity and diversity have already  contributed to the failure of businesses and banks in the private  sector. We have just seen that. Yet, this administration is unfazed and  as focused as ever on pitting fellow citizens against each other on the  basis of race. The Democrats' woke, radical agenda is hurting our  children, it is hurting our families, and is destroying the American  economy.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better. Woke garbage is  not--I repeat, is not--a substitute for fiscal policy.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am grateful that the House of Representatives is taking a stand to  protect women and girls in this country and to ensure that they  continue to have access to athletic opportunities at school. I strongly  support the Protecting Women and Girls in Sports Act.   My amendment strengthens the underlying bill by protecting schools  from a weaponized bureaucracy and frivolous lawsuits as they work to  comply with the intentions of the bill.   Many schools provide a wide range of programs and activities to  support their student athletes. This amendment ensures that schools can  continue to provide a range of resources exclusively or preferentially  to members of an athletic team without worrying about activist  bureaucrats or opportunistic trial lawyers targeting them with  disingenuous arguments about what constitutes an athletic program or  activity.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, no woman or girl in our country should be  forced to lose competitions to biological men. No school in our country  should be punished for fighting to preserve the integrity of women's  sports.   We cannot pass up an opportunity to protect schools from adverse  actions accusing them of discrimination when they provide a tutor to a  team or they let athletes move into a dorm early or accommodate a  practice schedule.   We know Democrats will work to pursue every loophole imaginable to  undermine this bill, and we should take this opportunity to stop them  before they can start.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reiterate that no woman or girl should be  forced to lose competitions to biological men. I say that as a father  of a daughter who is an athlete. I say that as a father to two sons who  are athletes. Girls should play girls' sports, and boys should play  boys' sports.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Edwards) having assumed the chair, Mr. Flood, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 734) to  amend the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide that for purposes of  determining compliance with title IX of such Act in athletics, sex  shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and  genetics at birth, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
