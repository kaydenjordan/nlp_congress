 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on two important amendments  that have been included in this en bloc.   Michigan has been hit very hard by this PFAS contamination. It is in  our drinking water, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and ponds. We can't eat  the fish that are being caught.   These harmful chemicals are found in way too many places, and they  are discovering more contamination sites each day.   Just today, 100 new PFAS contamination sites were identified, with  many sites registering PFAS levels above 100,000 parts per trillion.  EPA's nonenforceable health advisory is 70 parts per trillion. And the  more we test, the more we find.   There are two amendments here. I was proud to work with Fred Upton,   Dan Kildee, and Tim Walberg on legislation that is included in this en  bloc that would require the Department of Defense to enter into  cooperative agreements with States to mitigate PFAS contamination  resulting from their facilities.   Unfortunately, firefighting foam was used at more than 100 military  bases and has impacted them and the surrounding communities across the  country. We need an all-hands-on-deck response to the growing PFAS  contamination at military facilities.   Also included is a bipartisan amendment to protect our servicemembers  from ever being exposed to harmful PFAS chemicals in MREs, Meal, Ready- to-Eat.   MREs are carried by our servicemembers in the field of operations or  when engaged in training exercises. Our warfighters depend on MREs for  their survival, so it is critical these food packages are completely  safe. Currently, there is no prohibition on the use of PFAS chemicals  in MREs, and they are in there.   This bipartisan amendment would proactively correct this and simply  prohibit the Defense Logistics Agency from using any food contact  substances with PFAS to assemble or package MREs.   I thank Chairman Smith for including both of these amendments.
