 Mr. President, I rise to address the nomination of Neil  Gorsuch. I will start by noting that just moments ago the majority  leader was on the floor and did something that has never before been  done in U.S. history; that is, on the first day--indeed, in the first  hours of debate on a Supreme Court Justice on this floor, the majority  leader filed a petition, called a cloture petition, to close debate. So  here we are on the first day, just hours into the debate, and the  majority leader has said: Enough. We do not want to hear any more about  this topic. We are going to shut down debate.   The rules provide some protection for this, and that is that it  cannot be voted on until Thursday. So there is time between now and  Thursday for us to air our views. Historically, often debates went on  for a substantial amount of time--a week, some for many weeks--with no  cloture petition being filed, with no closing of the debate. Certainly,  never before has the majority leader shut down debate, filed that  petition on day one in his trying to ram this nomination through.   This is just a continuation of firsts--first events that do  absolutely no credit to this institution, no credit to the Supreme  Court, no credit to our Nation. In fact, they pose a substantial  danger.   It was February 13, a little over a year ago, that Supreme Court  Justice Scalia died. Almost immediately, the majority leader indicated  that when the nomination came down from President Obama, this Chamber  would not exercise its responsibility of advice and consent under the  Constitution in that it would not provide an opportunity for Merrick  Garland to be able to appear before a committee and answer the  questions of the committee members, the questions of Republicans and  the questions of Democrats, so that they could assess whether that  individual was appropriate to serve in a Supreme Court seat.   The majority leader made it clear that there would be no committee  hearing and no committee vote and no opportunity to come here directly  to the floor, bypassing the committee. In other words, he closed off  every opportunity for the President's nominee to be considered. This is  the first time--this is the only time that has happened in our Nation's  history when there was a vacancy in an election year.   What is the essence of this extraordinary and unusual action when  this Chamber fails to exercise its advice and consent responsibility  under the Constitution? Were we at a time of war, like the Civil War,  in which the Capitol at times was under assault? Were we at a moment in  which the building was aflame and we had to flee or there was some  other significant threat to the functioning of this body? Was there  some extraordinary set of circumstances--perhaps a massive storm headed  for the Nation's Capital--that led the Senate for the first time in  U.S. history to say that it could not take the time to exercise its  constitutional advice and consent responsibility? There was no storm.  There was no fire. There was no threat. There was no earthquake. There  was nothing that would have prevented this Chamber from doing its  responsibility.   The President has a responsibility under the Constitution when there  is an open seat, and that is to nominate. He proceeded to consult with  Members on both sides of the aisle, and he nominated an individual,  Merrick Garland, who had an extraordinary reputation and who  essentially was considered to come straight down the Main Street of  judicial thought, with opinions that were neither labeled  ``progressive'' nor ``conservative.'' They were straight down the  middle.   The President made that nomination on March 16, which was a month and  3 days after the seat became vacant, but that was the last action to  occur, the last action this Chamber took. A few individuals did  courtesy interviews, knowing that it would lead to no committee hearing  and no committee vote because the majority team in this Chamber decided  to steal a Supreme Court seat. Again, such a theft never, ever has  happened in the history of our Nation.   There have been a substantial number of seats that have come open  during an election year--16. There have been a substantial number of  individuals who were confirmed to those 16  [[Page S2223]]  seats, and there were individuals who were turned down by this Chamber.  Yet, in all of the 15 cases that preceded the death of Justice Scalia,  the Senate acted. The Senate exercised its responsibility.   But this time was different. This time, the majority said: We intend  to pack the Court of the United States of America--not by adding seats  to it; that would not work under a Democratic President who could then  nominate more individuals--to pack the Court by taking a seat, failing  to exercise the responsibility that each of us has under our oath of  office of advice and consent, and send it in a time capsule into the  next administration, hoping that time capsule would be opened by a  conservative President who would nominate someone who was very  conservative, indeed, to create a 5-to-4 bias. What was that bias the  majority was looking for? It was not a bias toward ``we the people'';  it was a bias toward the powerful and the privileged.    If you take a look at our Constitution, that initial opening of our  Constitution, it does not say ``we the privileged'' and ``we the  powerful.'' It lays out a vision of a form of government with checks  and balances to be designed to function of, by, and for the people. The  majority was afraid that Merrick Garland would be just that kind of  judge, one who would call the balls and strikes under the Constitution  in support of the constitutional vision of ``we the people.'' They did  not want a judge who would call the balls and strikes under our  Constitution; they wanted someone who would find a way to twist a case  in favor of the privileged and the powerful.   Tonight, I will lay out a lot of how they knew that was important  both from the perspective of the decisions of the 5-to-4 Court that  preceded the death of Justice Scalia and also Merrick Garland's  writings and decisions, who found every opportunity to take a case and  find some word, find some phrase, find some idea--``to operate is not  to operate,'' ``to drive is not to drive,'' which is just language from  one case--in order to find some way to find in favor of the powerful  over the people. Merrick Garland's nomination lasted 293 days. That is  the longest time in Supreme Court history.   Now I am going to turn and go through the election-year vacancies  because I do not want folks to take my word for the case that the  Senate has always done its job. For more than 200 years, it has done  its job--until now. Let's take a look at those vacancies.   There were a couple of cases--three cases in which there was an  election-year nominee and the vacancy occurred after the general  election. This happened when President Adams was in office, when  President Grant was in office, and when President Hayes was in office.  So there was very little time left in the Presidents' terms. In a  number of these cases--all three--the President did not change office  until March of the following year, but the Senate did not even need  those extra 2 months that it had before we amended the Constitution.   President Adams nominated John Jay. He nominated him 3 days after the  vacancy occurred in the year 1800, and the Senate confirmed the  nominee. Here is an interesting twist: The nominee then declined the  position. You do not see that very often in the history of the Supreme  Court.   Then you go to 1872 when President Grant was President. He had a  vacancy occur on November 28, which was just a month before the end of  the year and a few months before the Presidency would turn over. It was  following the election. He nominated Ward Hunt. The Senate acted in a  little more than a week, and they confirmed him. They vetted him. They  exercised their advice and consent responsibility, and they said: Yes,  this individual is appropriate to serve on the Court.   Then there was President Hayes. A vacancy occurred in December 1880,  and he nominated William Woods. Here we have a nominee being put  forward very shortly afterwards and confirmed.   Those were the first three. That is the set of cases in which the  vacancies occurred after the November elections in election years.   Let's look at the next set of vacancies. In these cases, the vacancy  occurred before the elections, but the nominees were not nominated by  the Presidents until after the elections. So, again, the Senate had a  relatively short period of time in which to act.   We have the August 25 vacancy of 1828 with President Adams. He  nominated quite a few months later--almost 4 months later--John  Crittenden. In this case, the Senate acted, but they acted to table the  nomination, so he was turned down.   Then we have President Buchanan in 1861, who nominated Jeremiah  Black. This is a little strange to us because we think of the  Presidency as changing in January, but the Presidency did not change  until March. The nomination occurred in February, and the motion to  proceed was rejected by the entire body. So that nominee was rejected.   Then we turn to President Lincoln. The vacancy occurred in the month  preceding the election. President Lincoln nominated Salmon Chase just  after the election, and the Senate said: There is plenty of time. We  will review that. And he was confirmed.   Then we can turn to Eisenhower. Once again, the vacancy occurred in  the month before the election, just 3 weeks before the election.  Eisenhower didn't put a nomination to the Senate until January, but the  Senate said: We have a responsibility of advice and consent. We will  review it, we will vet the nominee, and we will vote. And they voted to  confirm.   That is the second set of nominations. Those are 7 of the 16  nominations, so there are still 9 to go. Let's take a look at those.   In this case, the Senate had more time to act. The vacancy occurred  before the general election. The nomination occurred before the general  election.   Before I go through them, let me just note that of these nine, the  Senate acted to confirm in 1804, to table in 1844, to table in 1852, to  confirm in 1888, to confirm in 1892, to confirm in 1916, to confirm  again 6 months later--still before the election; two in the same year-- and then finally, in 1932, the Senate confirmed a nomination made in  February. On February 15, the Senate acted.   Of these nine individuals, we have six who were confirmed and two  were tabled. But I have left one out. There is one more nomination that  occurred in an election year--just one more--and that happened last  year. President Obama--we go back to Antonin Scalia dying on February  13 and Merrick Garland being nominated on March 16. So of those 16 we  have looked at, the previous 15, the Senate acted each and every time  because they had taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitution  that has a requirement that the Senate participate in advice and  consent. But this time, no action. No action. No committee hearing, not  a set of committee hearings, not even one. No vote in committee. No  effort or acceptance of moving the nomination to the committee of the  whole, which would be here on the Senate floor. For the first time in  U.S. history, the Senate stole a seat from one President in order to  pack the Court.   I have to tell my colleagues that it isn't just a clever new tactic.  It isn't just an excessive exercise of partisanship. This is a crime  against our Constitution and the responsibilities of this body. This  effort to pack the Court is a major assault on the integrity of the  Court.   For every 5-to-4 decision that we see in the future, everybody is  going to look and say: Five-four. How would that be different? And it  will always be different if the stolen seat and the judge who fills it  is on the right side because that side would otherwise have lost. The  tie goes to the lower court's decision.   So what this does is not only change the trajectory of our  Constitution from one where it is designed for ``we the people'' to a  different vision of government by and for the people--it doesn't just  change that trajectory, but it draws into question everything the Court  does in the future.   Wouldn't it have been incredible if President Trump's nominee-- knowing the constitutional responsibility for the Senate to act,  knowing that the Senate seat had been stolen from a previous President,  knowing that it would bias all the outcomes of the Court in the  future--had stood up and said ``I will not participate in this crime  against the Constitution'' and declined the nomination? Wouldn't that  have been an act of integrity? Well, we  [[Page S2224]]  didn't get that act of integrity from President Trump's nominee, so  here we are today, on the first day of the Senate deliberation on this  nominee, and just moments ago was the first time in U.S. history that  the majority has exercised a petition to close debate on the first day  of a Senate debate on a Supreme Court Justice. Why is the majority in  such a rush? Why is the Senate majority determined to push this through  so quickly, in contravention of the tradition of due deliberation on  this floor?   I know that if the circumstances were reversed and the Democrats had  participated in stealing a seat from a Republican President, my  colleagues would be screaming on this floor, and they would be fully  justified. I am proud that my colleagues on this side of the aisle have  never participated in such an assault on our Constitution or a failure  to exercise our responsibilities under our oath of office or a theft of  a Supreme Court seat or an effort to pack the Court, but if we had, my  colleagues across the aisle would absolutely be standing and saying  what I am saying tonight--that this is wrong, this is destructive, this  is damaging, and we should stop and rethink this.   There is really only one nominee who would be a legitimate nominee  for President Trump to make--only one way to heal this massive wound,  this massive tear and rip in the heart of our Constitution, this  massive failure of this Senate body to do its job. There is only one  way to heal that, and that is for President Trump to nominate Merrick  Garland and for him to get that committee hearing, for him to get that  committee vote, for him to get that deliberation here on the floor.  Maybe he would be approved and maybe he wouldn't, because that is what  we see every time the Senate has acted. It has not always been to  confirm a nominee, but it has acted and deliberated and voted and  decided, as the Constitution calls upon it to do. That would be a  healing of the wound. It would be a healing of the wound if the  Senators were to vote the same way they would have voted last year had  there been a completely legitimate, ordinary consideration. Then we  could go forward without this damage.   So I call upon my colleagues, who I know have--each and every one of  them--considered that it is their responsibility to build up and  strengthen our institutions of government, not to tear them down.  Therefore, I call upon them to reverse this deed before the dark act is  completed of stealing a seat and packing the Court.    I wish to turn to consider another piece of this puzzle. If the seat  had not been stolen and we were simply considering President Trump's  nominee under ordinary circumstances, what would we find? We would find  a far-rightwing judge completely outside of the mainstream.   Why is it that throughout its history, this body has honored the rule  of having a supermajority needed to close debate on a Supreme Court  Justice? It has been to send a message to the President that you must  nominate someone who is in the judicial mainstream, not way out in one  direction or another, with bizarre findings that would undermine the  integrity of the Court, not a pattern of attempting to twist the law so  that we the people lose and we the powerful win time after time after  time--no, someone in the middle of the judicial mainstream.   Well, that is certainly where Merrick Garland was, but that is not  where Neil Gorsuch is. He is a lifelong conservative activist,  rewriting the law to make it something that was never intended to be. A  Washington Post analysis of his decisions that have been considered by  the Supreme Court found that he would be, by far, the most conservative  member of the Court--not where Scalia was, not where Justice Thomas is,  not where Justice Alito is; he would be the most conservative member of  the Court, to the right of Justices Alito, Thomas, and Scalia.   Quote:         The magnitude of the gap between Gorsuch and Thomas is       roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and       Justice Kennedy. In fact, our results suggest that Gorsuch       and Scalia would be as far apart as Justice Breyer and       Justice Roberts.    That is the Washington Post. It is a pretty big gap, way to the  right.   Let's take a look at some of the cases that lead to this conclusion.  There is a case known simply as the frozen trucker case. Alphonse  Maddin, the trucker, was fired for refusing to freeze to death. After  waiting more than 3 hours with a disabled trailer on the side of the  road, he unhooked the trailer and he started up the cab and he went to  get warm before he could return to meet the repairman for the truck.  Now, why couldn't he just carry the trailer with him? The brakes were  frozen. Why was he himself freezing? Because the heater on the truck  was broken. He fell asleep for some hours, woke up, and his body was  numb. He became concerned about his life, so he unhooked the trailer,  went to get warm, and came back to meet the repairman.   The Labor Department determined that under the Surface Transportation  Assistance Act, he was wrongly fired because that act is designed to  say that if you refuse to operate a truck in a fashion that is unsafe  for you, the driver, or unsafe for others, you can't be fired for that.  Safety comes first. The whole message of the act: Safety comes first.  But in this case, Neil Gorsuch dissented. He wasn't writing the  majority opinion. He went out of his way to write the minority opinion.    The Tenth Circuit upheld the fact that he was correctly operating the  truck, leaving the trailer behind. You could ask, Was he operating the  full truck or part of the truck? The point is that the Tenth Circuit  said yes; the firing was wrong. They upheld the Labor Department under  the surface transportation act, and said: He did exactly what the act  had intended. You have to restore his job. The Tenth Circuit said yes,  absolutely. But Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to write a dissent,  saying no. It is completely taking words out of context and twisting  them. I encourage others to read it for themselves because it is truly  a bizarre opinion, an effort to find a way--some way, some path--to  find for the company instead of the trucker, who was protected by the  laws written and passed in this Chamber and the House and signed by the  President. That is how far out of common sense and theory of the law  Neil Gorsuch is.   Let's turn to a case often referred to as the autism case, Thompson  R2-J School District v. Luke P. This case says a great deal because in  this case Judge Gorsuch tried to rewrite a law referred to as the IDEA  law--Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--to effectively  invalidate the law. The law written here was to ensure that individuals  with disabilities were provided an education by the school district,  not babysitting but an education. Neil Gorsuch rewrote that law to say  that babysitting is OK.   Despite years of special education in a public school, Luke P. wasn't  showing any progress at home. His parents enrolled him in a private  school that specializes in autistic children, where he made advances-- because the school district was only babysitting him. They fought to  get the school district to reimburse them. Gorsuch ruled in favor of  the school district. The standard he put forward was the standard that  babysitting is OK, even though the law was written to do the opposite.   This decision that Gorsuch wrote is so far out of the mainstream, it  is so far out of common sense, it is so contrary to the law written  here in this Chamber that the Supreme Court--yes, our Supreme Court,  our eight-member Supreme Court--proceeded to say, 8 to 0: That is  absurd and wrong, Neil Gorsuch. And they reversed him.   When have we had a nominee reversed 8 to 0? When have we had cases  like the frozen trucker case and the autistic child case, where he went  to great lengths to find for the powerful over the individual?   We can turn to the Utah en banc request in a case called Planned  Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert. ``En banc'' means that the  entire bench hears a case. Neil Gorsuch was such an activist, so  committed to undermining an organization--Planned Parenthood--that he  took the extreme step of initiating, himself, an en banc review of a  decision to block a Utah defunding effort. Governor Herbert of that  State had used the cover of false and misleading videos to strip Utah's  clinics of their funding. The Governor later made clear in testimony  that he was in fact punishing Planned Parenthood for its  constitutionally protected advocacy and services and that the  organization had not done anything wrong.  [[Page S2225]]    The Tenth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction against Utah for  violating the organization's--Planned Parenthood's--constitutional  rights. The Tenth Circuit decided this, but Neil Gorsuch--ever the  activist judge, rewriting law to make it say the opposite of what was  intended--sought to have a review by the entire bench. Let me explain,  that is not normal. Other people may call for an en banc review because  they don't like the outcome, but to have a participating judge on the  Tenth Circuit initiate it is unusual. It is a message to the world:  Everyone, pay attention to me. I am an activist, far-right judge, and  if you like that--someone who is going to find for the powerful and the  privileged over ordinary people--pay attention. That is who I am. It is  kind of like trying out for a future Supreme Court opening.   Gorsuch's entire adult life has been a mission to revoke a lot of the  norms we have come to embrace in our pursuit of the transitions in our  society and in our government as we pursue that constitutional vision  of equality under the law, protections to vulnerable populations, to  workers and to kids and to women and to minorities. But Neil Gorsuch  doesn't like that arc of seeking to provide the protections our  constitutional vision laid out. As far back as college, he was an  ideological warrior who championed a severely reactionary worldview.   In a conservative newspaper article, he characterized efforts to  fight racism as ``more a demand for the overthrow of American society  than a forum for the peaceable and rational discussion of these people  and events.'' That is a very strange way to characterize efforts to  fight racism. Racism, discrimination, is to slam the door of  opportunity on American citizens because of their gender, because of  their race, because of their ethnicity, because of their sexual  identity--slam the door and disrupt that opportunity for each and every  citizen to be treated equally under the law.   He also used the opportunity to advocate for social inequality,  saying that ``men . . . of different abilities and talents to  distinguish themselves as they wish, without devaluing their innate  human worth as members of society,'' and arguing that a responsible  system required a governing class of men of exceptional political  ability to make the big decisions for society. Well, there is not much  equality and opportunity in that statement.   As a judge, in case after case, he finds expansive rights for  corporations at the expense of their employees, consumers, and the  public interest. We have talked about the frozen trucker case and the  autistic child case. There is also the electrocuted mine construction  worker case. A worker started at a project a week after it begun and  wasn't trained on how this should be done. It was a training that was  really required because of the highly dangerous circumstances. When you  are operating equipment near power lines, that is just a setting that  everyone in the construction industry knows is extraordinarily  dangerous. If you connect that equipment to the power line, perhaps  somebody has their hand on the side of the equipment, and the next  thing you know, they are electrocuted. The worker mistakenly brought a  piece of equipment too close to that overhead power line, and it was  the worker himself who was electrocuted and killed. The Occupational  Safety and Health Review Commission fined the employer for not properly  training the worker under these dangerous circumstances. The Tenth  Circuit took a look at it and said: Yes, the company failed to do the  proper training, and the result was that someone lost their life. But  Judge Gorsuch dissented. He said that there was no evidence the company  had been negligent. Really? Failure to train in a highly dangerous  situation that results in loss of life--there is no problem there. Why  should we require companies to train people in dangerous circumstances?  Again, there was a complete lack of common sense, a determination to  overturn what a review board had found, what the circuit court had  found.    We can turn to the Hobby Lobby case. In this case, Neil Gorsuch found  that closely held, for-profit corporations have the right to choose the  contraception coverage, or lack thereof, for their employees if doing  so conflicted with the corporation's religious beliefs. Now, we didn't  actually have corporations--in the sense that we have them now--when  our Nation was founded. There were some charters, but not the modern  corporation in the sense that we have. Yet Neil Gorsuch said: We will  just give this corporation personhood, and we will let the corporation  exercise religious beliefs that overrule the religious beliefs of the  individuals. But it was the individuals the Constitution was written to  defend. It was the individuals' religious beliefs the Constitution and  the Bill of Rights were laid out to protect--not a corporation. But in  a never-ending quest to find for the corporation, to find for the  powerful, to find for the privileged, Neil Gorsuch twisted the law,  found that path, and laid it out.   In writing a brief as a lawyer in 2005, Neil Gorsuch urged the court  to ignore the statutory and legislative history of the Securities  Exchange Act, advocating that the court limit the ability of those  defrauded by corporations to band together to seek redress. This really  goes to the difference between ``we the people'' and ``we the  powerful.''   We have a nominee before us right now who doesn't like the idea of  individuals being able to operate with a class action suit against the  predatory actions of a powerful corporation. In an article about the  case, he launched into an attack on the lawyers for providing the  ability for individuals to challenge the very powerful corporation, and  he said these are frivolous claims--frivolous claims--that take an  enormous toll on the economy. They put a burden on every public  corporation in America. I will quote: ``frivolous claims that impose an  enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public  corporation in America at one time or another and costing business  billions of dollars in settlements every year.'' He didn't like this  burden on corporations to respond when they were challenged for  predatory practices.   Often, the transactions between a company and an individual are quite  small. Maybe they involve a monthly fee to access telecommunications  services. Maybe they involve a purchase of a single consumer item that  costs $50. But the corporation misrepresented what that item was or  didn't disclose that it had dangerous paint on it or some other  feature. The only way that ordinary people, ``we the people,'' can  challenge the predatory practice of a powerful corporation is to put  their cases together in a class action suit so that everybody--the  thousands of people who bought that $50 item--can say: You are doing  something wrong. You are selling something dangerous and not telling  us. You are selling something our children will choke on and not  telling us. You are defrauding us in any of a whole series of  possibilities. Perhaps it is in stock cases or other financial  transactions. Perhaps it is the way mortgages are constructed. But the  individual couldn't possibly take on the powerful companies' roomful of  top-notch lawyers to reclaim that $50 or that small modest sum, so a  class action is the tool through which the people, ``we the people,''  proceed to take on the powerful, and Neil Gorsuch doesn't like that.   He doesn't like workers having the chance to confront corporations on  the issues of sexual harassment.   In Pinkerton v. Colorado Department of Transportation, Judge Gorsuch  joined an opinion discounting Pinkerton's evidence of discrimination  and concluding that Pinkerton's performance--not discrimination-- resulted in her termination. Judge Gorsuch dissented from an opinion-- by its very nature saying dissent--where the majority found a different  path, holding that Pinkerton provided ample evidence that she was  regularly outperforming her male colleagues yet was treated less  favorably than them. The list goes on and on--removing Federal  Government protections in a variety of cases.   But there is a third big problem with the fact that we are here  tonight considering this nomination. The first big problem was that the  seat was stolen by the Republican majority. That is the first time a  theft like that has happened in the history of our Nation in an effort  to pack the Court. That is a big deal. The second is that Trump  nominated somebody completely outside the judicial mainstream. The  third is something that should give every American pause, and that is  that at this very moment, investigations are taking place into the  conversations, into the meetings between the Trump campaign and the  Russians.   Now, we know it is very public that the Russians conspired to affect  the outcome of our Presidential election. We know the tactics they  used. They wrote false news stories. They proceeded to have a building  with hundreds--I am told a thousand people in a  [[Page S2226]]  building--doing social media commentating to try to have people in  America see those comments and go: Oh, my goodness, isn't that  Democratic nominee terrible? Look at what happened. It was an effort to  give, in other words, some sort of validation to the false news stories  that they were creating and to spread those false news stories via  social media.   We know that Russia used a series of bots--basically, computers-- around the world designed to reply automatically on social media and  Facebook and to do so in order to make it look like there were more  than a thousand--millions of people out there--commenting on how  terrible the Democratic nominee was.   So they amplified this message with the goal of causing the  algorithms used by companies like Facebook--affecting those algorithms  so Facebook would start streaming the false news on their Facebook  site. You see that and go: Oh, my goodness, it must be true; it is on  Facebook. That was the core strategy the Russians used.   I am not sharing with you anything that is classified. I am also on  the Intelligence Committee. All of this is in the public realm, the FBI  is investigating not whether all that took place--they continue to look  to see what else there is and the details of that--but whether there  was coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign in how they did  this.   Let's be clear. The investigation is not concluded. We don't know the  answer. We don't know if the Trump campaign coordinated with the  Russians. But let's also be clear about this: Anyone on that campaign  who collaborated with the Russians to affect the outcome of the U.S.  elections has committed a treasonous act.   So we have this cloud of this investigation over us right now. We  find out in a few weeks if there were treasonous acts that completely  delegitimize the election that put Donald Trump in the Oval Office.  Will we find that? We don't know. We don't know the answer to that.   What we do know is that we have a risk of being in a situation where  a swing vote on the Supreme Court is coming from a team that is being  investigated. Let's get to the bottom of that and, therefore, know  whether there is an issue of illegitimacy before we complete this  conversation about filling this Supreme Court seat.   There is an enormous amount of evidence that the Trump campaign was  familiar with the efforts of a foreign power to alter the outcome of  the election. The names have come up with the press. Paul Manafort,  Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, and other figures in the Trump orbit are  under scrutiny for that--several of them. The communications have been  articulated where and how, and that cloud is very real.   We had the unusual event a week ago Monday in which the Director of  the FBI came here to Capitol Hill to talk to the House and to say that  it is not normal to confirm that our investigations are under way but  that he thought, under this circumstance, it was appropriate that he do  so.   So those are the three big issues that we are facing. It is why every  Senator who values this institution, each Senator who has pondered  their responsibility under advice and consent and the theft of the  Supreme Court seat last year recognizes that the administration is  under a big cloud and that cloud has not been resolved in terms of the  legitimacy of the election or whether there was collusion with a  foreign power.    I said that if there was collusion, it was a traitorous act. Here is  why. Attacking the integrity of our elections, as Russia did, is an act  of war on the United States of America. It is attacking the fundamental  institutions of our democracy, of our democratic Republic. We must  never let this happen again. We must work with other democratic  republics to make sure that Russia isn't able to do it in other  countries, which we know they are attempting to do in other elections.  But we should absolutely get to the bottom of it before this Chamber  takes a vote on whether to close this debate or before it takes a vote  on whether to confirm the Justice.   So that is the very broad presentation of the three big reasons we  should pull the plug on this nomination or at least put it in deep  freeze until such a time as the Russia investigation is completed. And  we have already considered Merrick Garland. That is what we should do.   I am going to spend considerable time going into more detail about  these three issues because in my time in the Senate, there has not been  an issue that has had such grave consequences for the integrity of our  Nation, the integrity of our Senate, the integrity of the Supreme  Court, and, quite frankly, the integrity of the Presidency, as well. It  affects all three branches because this crime of stealing a seat  couldn't be completed without the direct involvement of the executive  branch's nominating Neil Gorsuch. So I will go back over each of these  in much greater detail.   I was pondering why I feel so strongly about this--apart from the  reasons I have already laid out--and it is that for generations to  come, this Chamber will be compromised. For generations to come, the  Supreme Court will be compromised. If we act together, if we hit the  pause button, perhaps we can prevent that.   So I feel more compelled to be here, to raise my voice, and to call  for those who care about our Nation to stop the insanity of this  judicial nomination discussion here on the floor of the Senate. That is  why I am going to go on for some time exploring this.   I think back to when I came here in 2009. When I came to the Senate,  my memories were of the Senate from the 1970's and 1980's, which now  makes me really an old guy. I was able to come here as a 19-year-old,  as an intern for Senator Hatfield. At that point in time, there wasn't  a camera on the floor of the Senate and there wasn't email, and it  wasn't easy to get a document across Capitol Hill in a short time.  Interns were put to work running paperwork around the Hill. But I will  tell you that the institution was in a very different place.   So I came here. I was the third of three interns to arrive that  summer of 1976, our bicentennial summer. The most recent intern is put  to work opening the mail each morning.   So I came in early. We had about 100 letters in envelopes. You would  run them through a machine that sliced the envelopes opened. You would  stack up all the letters, start going through them, and say: This one  is on this topic, and this goes to this legislative correspondent. This  one is on this topic, and it goes to that legislative correspondent. I  think there were three or four in the office of Senator Hatfield. You  would go through those 100 letters and put them on the desk of the  legislative correspondent.   Those correspondents had the newly developed electronic memory  typewriters. They had written paragraphs to respond to different  topics, and they would mark on the letter the different paragraphs that  should go here. This is the introductory paragraph we will use. We need  to address this issue in this letter and use paragraph 56 from the  memory bank, and we use number 84 to address another issue.   Then, those letters, all marked up, would go to the typing team that  would run those memory typewriters, and get responses out before the  day was over. I saw a lot of it that summer. It was possible to  actually get mail to come directly in because we didn't worry about  white powder being inside the envelopes.   Now if you write an actual physical letter to a Senator in this  Chamber, it goes through a warehouse. It goes through a warehouse where  they have to examine it and check it for poisons before it can be  delivered to Capitol Hill. It will take weeks. People knowing this  often choose to write by email. So a lot of the mail--most of the  mail--comes in electronically.   But that summer, one of the legislative assistants was leaving for an  extended period for a vacation in South America. He was looking to have  someone take over the Tax Reform Act of 1976. I was asked to take over  working on that act. So what that involved was that you would look at  all the mail that came in on that tax topic. You would research those  issues and you would draft responses. Those draft responses would go up  and be approved or modified by the legislative director and by the  Senator. Then you would make sure those got into the database and  people got their questions answered.   I learned a lot about taxes that summer of 1976. I must say, when I  was  [[Page S2227]]  first asked to work on taxes, I was kind of disappointed because I  thought: Well, it will be really interesting to work on education; it  will be really interesting to work on healthcare; it will be really  interesting to work on the environment; it will be really interesting  to work on jobs policy. Taxes? Not so interesting.   So the next few days, as I threw myself into responding, drafting  responses to these issues being raised in letters, I was transformed in  my opinion about working on tax issues because the taxes affect  everything in our body of law. Taxes have environmental consequences,  or they may be an environmental incentive, such as the provisions we  have in the Tax Code to encourage people to insulate their homes or to  drive a non-fossil-fuel burning car. They affect health, such as the  provisions we have in the Tax Code that proceed to say that if your  employer provides health insurance, it is not considered taxable  income. It affects job incentives. It affects everything.    There were farmers writing in about tax issues that were being  raised. There were teachers writing in. The teachers were concerned  that there was a home office deduction that was on the chopping block.  What this means is if you used a bedroom in your home or a study in  your home as your office to work as an elementary teacher or a high  school teacher, you could deduct the cost or the value of that portion  of your house as a work expense.   Well, often, when there is an opportunity like that, some people  expand the definition of the office to a point in which it is  ridiculous, and there were some individuals who were saying: Well, now  my entire home is my office. I will deduct the entire cost of my home,  which was never the intention.   But teachers were concerned that, in the course of correcting that,  that they might lose the deduction that was a legitimate work expense.  There are dozens and dozens of these things. So the bill happened to  come up on the floor of the Senate, in this Chamber right here. Because  I was working that bill, I was assigned to come over and follow the  debate. I was up in the seats up above. We considered amendment after  amendment after amendment. Now, there was no negotiation between the  two sides over what amendment would come up next.   Once one amendment was finished, there would be a group of Senators  trying to get the attention of the Presiding Officer. Whoever got that  attention first, whoever was fastest or loudest and was called on,  their amendment was next. They presented it, and the staff hovered  around following it and tried to get a copy of it and tried to analyze  it. Then we would run down when the vote was called and meet our  respective Senators coming out of those elevators that are just through  those doors right there--those beautiful double doors of the Senate.   I would stand there, and out would come Senator Church, and out would  come Senator Goldwater, and out would come Senator Humphrey, and out  would come Senator Kennedy and Senator Inouye, and then my Senator  could come out. I would say: OK, here is the story. Here is the  amendment. Here is what it does. Here is what people have said about  it. He would come in here and vote.   That was a very lucky set of circumstances that I had, but it allowed  me to sit up in the Chamber and watch this Senate. You did not have a  cloture petition on anything--a cloture petition meaning a petition to  close debate. Now, there was mutual respect. There was a determination  of this body to give people a chance to say what they wanted to say,  but very rarely did people go on at length, and more rare than that  would be a case where a petition was filed to shut down debate.   You know, the principle, the idea that originated with our original  Senate, was that there is time for everyone to make their views known  to each other so we can benefit from their insights, so that we can  benefit from their life experience, and then we can make the decision.  So it was a mutual courtesy among Senators at the very start of our  democratic Republic. I saw that courtesy here on the floor as an intern  41 years ago.   What a difference it is today, where today, for the first time in  U.S. history, the majority filed a petition to shut down debate on the  first day of a debate over a U.S. Supreme Court seat, under  circumstances that are more complex and more disturbing than virtually  any circumstances we have seen in more than 200 years over the  nomination of a Supreme Court justice.   It is the first time in U.S. history that a nominee in an election  year was not accorded any consideration, the first time a seat was  stolen, perhaps the first time that a cloud hung over a nominating  President--President Trump and his team--because of the way the  campaign was conducted and the possible collaboration with Russians.  Certainly, it one of the first times.   Since the analysts have found that the views of Neil Gorsuch are to  the extraordinary far right, that too adds a certain change from the  tradition of the supermajority of the President nominating from the  judicial mainstream.   So we have these complex sets of circumstances that should be  thoroughly vetted. This should be a situation where no Member of this  Chamber would even think about filing a petition to close debate and  would not even consider the possibility of trying to cut off debate.   Debate has gone on for Supreme Court folks for weeks and weeks and  weeks without a petition being filed. Sometimes, that nominee was  confirmed and sometimes the nomination was withdrawn, and in the course  of it, the American people learned a great deal, and they were riveted  to that conversation.   But this time, the majority said that 200 years of history--that 200  years of developed comity here in the Senate Chamber, the traditions  that were still here when I was an intern 4 decades ago--we are going  to wipe that away. Well, that is a great concern. After I was here for  a summer, I was very intrigued by the beauty of what we do on Capitol  Hill, the profoundness of what we do on Capitol Hill.   We can make a policy that can destroy home ownership for literally  millions of families, or we can make a policy that creates the  opportunity of fair home ownership for millions of families. That is  the power of the discussions that take place on this floor of the  Senate, of this Chamber, and the Chamber on the other side of Capitol  Hill.   So, during that summer, I was wrestling with a question, and that  question was: My talents are in math and science. But is there a way to  pursue a career dedicated to making the world a better place? Is there  a way to actually pursue public policy as a career? I didn't know the  answer to that question. I went back to college for 1 trimester out in  California.   At the end of that trimester, President Carter was going to be  inaugurated in January of 1977. I thought: You know, it will be very  interesting to see what a new President does. Let's see what policies  he puts forward, how he builds his Executive team, how he delivers his  ideas to Capitol Hill, how he works with Capitol Hill.   So in January, I took a Greyhound bus across the Nation. I arrived  here and proceeded to work on a variety of internships while also  waiting tables and washing dishes. I worked as a hotel desk clerk up on  14th Street on Thomas Circle. I worked washing dishes and waiting  tables for a Lums Restaurant, which is kind of a sit-down hamburger  joint.   But it was all so I could be here and see the magic of public policy  and the work done that could affect millions of lives here in this  Chamber, the work done on the far side of Capitol Hill that would  affect millions of families--to the better or to the worse. In the  course of that year, I interned for a group called New Directions. It  was an environmental nonprofit working on the Law of the Sea.   There was a question on the outside of our territorial boundaries:  Will the nations cooperate so that we don't destroy the resources in  the international space of the oceans? How far should our national  space extend? How do we write those rules so that our Continental Shelf  is clearly under our control? These are the sorts of questions  considered. That treaty, the Law of the Sea Treaty, has never made it  here to Capitol Hill. Every time there is a new Presidency coming in,  someone says: Hey, remember that treaty  [[Page S2228]]  from four decades ago? It might really strengthen U.S. control of our  offshore areas, and maybe we should bring it up for discussion. It  still hasn't been discussed here.   But I also went door to door for a group called Virginia Consumer  Congress. They were working to create attention to consumer protection  issues in the State capitol in Virginia. They would go door to door.  They would have a team go door to door. You would proceed to explain  the issue that you were working on--the bill you were working on, that  the organization was working on--and ask ordinary citizens to sign a  petition in support of that bill being considered at the State capitol.   You would ask: Would you like to support the work of this  organization so we can keep doing it? If they made a donation, that  helped strengthen the organization. This was the model that became the  Public Interest Research Group model, or the PIRG model.   Specifically, the issue we were working on as we went door to door  was to say: We can save consumers a huge amount of money if we can  simply implement peak-load pricing.   Now, what is peak-load pricing? What it means is that you have a  meter so that when there is a huge demand for electricity, it charges a  higher price. By so doing, it alerts the consumer: Hey, don't use  electricity now; use it at another time.   Now, why would that save consumers millions of dollars? Well, here is  why. The electric power company wanted to build a nuclear powerplant to  meet just the peak load. So they wanted to build a very, very expensive  nuclear powerplant, which they would then charge all the utility  customers for, and a lot of utilities--it is kind of written in the  law--receive an automatic 8-percent return on whatever they invest. So  there is an incentive for them to invest more. The more they invest,  the bigger their revenue stream is. That revenue stream is paid for by  the citizens who buy electricity.   So few could convince the utility, instead of building a nuclear  powerplant, to put in meters that would tell people: Hey, don't use  your dryer now because it is more expensive, and shift that peak load.  Then everybody benefitted. You did not have to have the risk of a  nuclear powerplant.   At that point we had a lot of concerns. We had had a lot of  difficulties in some of our plants with near meltdowns. The idea that  you could have a radioactive cloud or a China syndrome occur somewhere  near a metropolitan area was a very scary thing. So you simultaneously  greatly improved public safety while saving people a huge amount of  money.   So that is what we were petitioning people for door to door. It was  my first introduction to a legislative process that was happening  outside the national legislative process. I must say, when you go to  door to door, you have so many interesting experiences. You never know  what is going to happen when you walk through that door and start to  explain to people what you are fighting for and they start sharing  their stories.   The president of the board of VEPCO, Virginia Electric Power  Company--I went to his and his wife's house. I did not know it was  their house at the time--a huge, huge house in suburban Virginia. The  wife greeted me. She talked with me about these issues. She said: You  know, my husband is president of the board of VEPCO, but, as to the  issues you are raising, I never hear them raising those issues, and  these are good points you are making. So I want to buy the Virginia  Consumer Congress newsletter. It was a $15 donation. That was the  biggest donation at the door I ever had while I was working there.  There were many, many other conversations.   But the reason I came back to be here for those first 9 months of the  Carter administration was to continue to see: How does Capitol Hill  work? How do nonprofit advocacy groups work? How does a new  administration work? How does the Senate work? The Senate was so near  and dear to my heart after the internship with Senator Hatfield.   In the course of that year, I came to believe that there was a path  to work on public policy. Specifically, I decided to work on third- world economic development. Part of the reason that I choose that area  was that, when I was in high school, I had a chance to be an AFS  exchange student in Ghana, West Africa. There were only six exchange  students sent to Africa outside of apartheid South Africa.   Of those six, five went to cities and one went to a modest town with  a family of very modest means. I was the student who was sent to that  very modest town to the family of modest means. The experience was such  that I was surrounded by people barely able to afford to eat or  sometimes not able to afford to eat.   My host family was middle class. My host father was a schoolteacher,  and my host mother was also a schoolteacher. One was in a public  school, and one was in a private school. Because of the connection to  the public school, my host father, who, if I recall right, had a sixth  grade or ninth grade education--that was enough to be a teacher because  they didn't have enough people who were high school graduates or  college graduates.   He was afforded a government-built house that had three concrete  rooms and screens over the windows to keep out the mosquitoes. There  was electricity in the house, an outlet. The family had one appliance,  and that appliance was an iron to iron clothes. Every night, my host  father would take the clothing that had been washed that day and he  would iron the clothing. Nobody else could touch that iron because that  was an incredibly valued appliance.   They had one other thing that was considered a real amazing thing for  a family to have, and that was a bicycle. They had a bicycle. I wanted  to borrow the bicycle to go outside this town and visit some very tiny  villages. My host father was so afraid that I was going to break this  bicycle, that I wasn't going to be careful, that I was going to go  through potholes, that I was going to dent the rim, because it was such  a valued commodity to the family.   I decided in college, after my time here in 1976 and 1977, that I  would work on economic development overseas because I had seen the  families who surrounded my host family often earning just a dollar a  day and trying to feed a family of six or seven. The children couldn't  go to school because they had to go down to the main street, running  through town to try to sell things through the windows. The only way  for the family to eat was for every child to be working.   (Mr. ROUNDS assumed the Chair.)   Well, I tell you this because it is all tied in to how I view the  sanctity of this room, this Senate Chamber, because the events that  were to transpire unexpectedly brought me back to Capitol Hill after  graduate school.   I pursued that path of working on third-world economic development,  and I thought I was going to spend my life overseas. When I graduated  from college, I was hired for a job to work for the United Nations in  the Philippines. My job was going to be going throughout the region to  evaluate U.N. development projects. What a perfect position, to be able  to be in multiple countries--it would have been in Malaysia, the  Philippines, Vietnam, a whole host of nations--to evaluate projects on  the ground, giving reports on what was working and what was not working  and why. It was a 2-year post. I was so excited about doing this. It  just seemed like all life had come together. I was going to have a job  after I got out of college, and I could start repaying those student  loans. I felt like I was landing on my feet.   I went down to the organization, the nonprofit at my university that  would set up these jobs. The individual who ran it said: Jeff, come  here. I have a letter for you to read.   The letter said: The United Nations has just eliminated the position  to evaluate those projects in the Philippines. So suddenly, before I  ever got on the plane, my job was gone. I didn't get to go. Again, I  was very worried. Well, what am I going to do after I graduate?   I proceeded to go down to Mexico and work in a village with the  American Friends Service Committee. Then I went to New York and worked  an internship with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I  worked on a variety of international issues. Then I decided to join a  friend, and we went and bought the cheapest bus available from  California to Costa Rica. We proceeded to go through country after  [[Page S2229]]  country--Mexico and Guatemala, Honduras. We bypassed El Salvador. We  got off the Pan-American Highway because in Salvador, in 1980, people  were being pulled off of the buses and shot. The other nations were in  turmoil. It was the year after the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua.   In Guatemala, there was an army group who was going from village to  village killing the young men. There was a war between one group and  another group. There was a lot of chaos there. But we went all the way  through to Costa Rica. Then I worked in a village again on an  environmental project. I had a chance to work in India.   I expected the whole time that I was going to be going overseas for  my life. You never know what door is going to close and what door is  going to open.   After I got out of graduate school and was ready to go fulfill this  vision that I developed back in 1977 when I extended my stay here in DC  and was doing these internships, I was at the World Bank. I was hired  at the World Bank, but I didn't want to be at the World Bank for long  doing mathematical modeling. I was doing the shadow pricing of  petroleum products.   If that doesn't sound very interesting, well, it kind of is,  actually, if you love how numbers can give you a vision of what is  going on and how the imports and exports of oil products were right or  wrong and expensive. By understanding shadow pricing, you could  understand the challenges various developing nations faced. Still, it  was working with mathematical formulas and data here in DC, and I  wanted to be in the field. So I was preparing to go to southern Africa,  where I had not been. In that preparation, I was also applying for a  Presidential fellowship in foreign relations. One of those openings was  at the Office of the Secretary of Defense.   Each year, the Office of the Secretary of Defense would have 5  openings for Presidential management fellows, and there were 12  finalists for this. They called us in, and they had this big kind of  arc of the high-ranking folks, civilian and uniform, from the team of  the Secretary of Defense. Then they had a chair in kind of the middle  of that arc. I just remember thinking it felt like we were going to be  interrogated, and it was kind of an interrogation.   This is the first question I was asked: We see here that you interned  for Senator Hatfield, and he votes against all of the defense  appropriations. You worked for the American Friends Service Committee.  They are an arm of the Quaker Church, and the Quaker Church has a peace  testimony. Why would we ever hire you here in the Office of the  Secretary of Defense?    I thought that was a very good question. I was kind of surprised that  I was a finalist for a position, but I responded that national security  is so much broader than simply military money, that it involves an  understanding of culture, an understanding of history, an understanding  of economic dynamics, an understanding of the things that trigger  dissent and how it might be responded to, an understanding of  alliances, and that all these things put together enable us to have a  foreign policy that is part and parcel of our national security. Well,  I probably said a more complex version of that, but that was the gist  of it, and they hired me.   The reason I took that job rather than heading off to Africa was  because at that moment, the biggest threat to the world was nuclear  power--not nuclear power electricity but nuclear weaponry, atom bombs.  The fact is that we were concerned that there might be a nuclear war  that would destroy the planet as we knew it--certainly destroy the  Soviet Union and the United States. Since that was the biggest threat  to the world, I felt compelled to pivot from third-world poverty to  work on nuclear weapon policy, and I did that through the 1980s, first  for the Secretary of Defense and then for Congress, which now completes  why I was telling you that story, because that brought me back to be in  regular contact with this Senate, with this Chamber, with the folks who  work here, who are trying to figure their way through a series of  difficult issues involving nuclear weapons.   Outside of this Chamber, in the path walking between the Russell  Office Building, a curved path, and coming into the outside doors that  are outside of these double Senate doors, there is a tree. That tree is  known as the peace tree. It is directly connected to the work that was  being done in this Chamber on nuclear weapon policy.   Senator Hatfield and Senator Kennedy were working together. A  Republican and a Democrat were working together to try to address the  risk of nuclear weapons. Well, in 1985, there was an intern walking  with Senator Hatfield. He liked to walk outside on that curved path  back to the Russell Office Building. It is a path on which I have had  the chance to walk with him a number of times. He talked about the  different trees along the way. I remember in particular his lecture on  the ginkgo tree. There are several ginkgo trees out there between here  and the Russell Office Building.   I was relaying this to a 1985 intern of Senator Hatfield's named Sean  O'Hollaren. Sean said: You know, I had those same walks with Senator  Hatfield, and he gave me the same stories about the tree. He was  interested in that.   Sean O'Hollaren said to Senator Hatfield--Sean O'Hollaren obviously  was much quicker to seize the moment. It never even occurred to me. He  said: Senator Hatfield, you love these trees so much, why don't you  plant one?   Senator Hatfield said: Sean, that will be your intern project.   So Sean worked on that.   Senator Hatfield wanted to plant a tree that doesn't fit the Olmsted  plan for the landscaping of the Capitol. The problem is that the  Olmsteds, who had designed Central Park and Forest Park in Oregon and  much of the DC landscape here on the Capitol grounds, had in mind  broadleaf trees, not the type of tree Senator Hatfield wanted to plant.   What did he want to plant? There is a very interesting story here  because in the Pacific Northwest--of course Oregon is part of the  Pacific Northwest--there used to grow millions and millions of a cousin  of the grand sequoia and the coastal redwoods. This cousin was  different in that it lost its needles during the winter. It went  extinct. It was out-competed by the cedars and the Douglas firs and the  regular redwoods and so on and so forth. It went extinct, but its  fossils are everywhere in the Northwest.   How could Senator Hatfield plant this tree when it had been extinct  for millions of years in North America? He could plant it because in  the late 1940s, a small grove was found in China of this particular  tree--the only place on the planet where it still existed. So he  arranged to get one of those trees. He was going to plant it there.   At that moment, as they were getting ready to plant, his team saw  Senator Kennedy's team and said: Senator Kennedy, you should come out  and join Senator Hatfield.   They went out by this walkway between here and Russell. Senator  Kennedy said: In honor of the work we are doing together, this  bipartisan work on nuclear weapons, this should be known as the peace  tree.   They were working on the zero option, the nuclear freeze movement-- let's not add any more nuclear weapons to the world; they are already  dangerous enough. They did a lot of work on nuclear weapons, and I must  say I was reminded of it.   When I came here, John Kerry and Dick Lugar--a Republican and a  Democrat--were working on New START together. They considered that  treaty here on the floor of the Senate, but it became much more  difficult now than then to have this sort of bipartisanship work.   At any rate, please take a walk, if you are here in DC and on the  grounds of the Capitol, and take a look at that peace tree. That peace  tree is just on the verge of becoming the tallest tree on the grounds.  It is now 32 years old. Let's hope that as it becomes the tallest tree,  it will have kind of a Biblical influence and bring more peace to a  world in desperate need of it.    We need more of that peace tree influence here in this Chamber. That  influence is sorely lacking. The type of cooperation between Democrats  and Republicans that existed doesn't exist today, and we are here at  this very moment on a tragic course to destroy the centuries-old  tradition of a 60-vote, bipartisan majority to proceed to approve a  nominee to the Supreme Court.  [[Page S2230]]  That tradition ensures that Presidents don't nominate extremists and  hopefully ensures that the folks who serve will serve the Constitution,  the ``We the People'' Constitution, not some ideological extreme to the  right or to the left.   So I want to go back to the core premises of why I am here tonight  talking to the Chamber, sharing these thoughts with all those who are  watching the Chamber, and that is we must recapture the type of  cooperation and bipartisanship that made this Chamber able to address  the problems facing America. Mahatma Gandhi said that to simply operate  by the premise of an ``eye for an eye only . . . [makes] the whole  world blind.'' Well, if we operate on the premise of the Senate that we  are never going to work together to solve problems because we are of  different parties or a different party than the President, and we want  to make sure the President doesn't get any credit for having helped  improve a situation, then all of us suffer from the broken existing  policies, the dysfunction of existing policies, the poison of the  superpartisanship.   Let's go back to the basic premises that we need to address--the  three premises. The first is that this seat is a stolen seat--and if we  could put up the chart with the nine Justices. Here is the story in a  nutshell: 16 times in our history there was an open seat during an  election year, 15 times the Senate acted, 12 of those times they  confirmed the Justice, and 3 of those they rejected the Justice. But  the point is, in 15 out of 15 times before Antonin Scalia died and  Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama, the Senate acted.  Here are nine of those. These are the nominations that occurred, like  Merrick Garland's, in which the vacancy and the nominations occurred  before the election. So they are most similar to the situation of  Merrick Garland.   Then there were another seven under more difficult circumstances  where the nomination did not occur until after the election, and the  Senate had very little time in which to vet and make a decision, but  they did make a decision in each and every case until last year, when  the majority said: We will not consider the President's nominee. We  will not hold a hearing, we will not hold a vote, we will discourage  folks from even talking to him, and we will not exercise our advice and  consent responsibility. That is the first big issue.   The second big issue is that the nominee himself is from the extreme  right. There is a chart that shows--and we don't have it with us; maybe  we will have it later tonight. There is a chart that shows the  distribution of decisions, and it has basically two curves with a big  kind of bell curve with a big gap in between. So it goes up, it comes  down, and it goes up and it comes down, and it reflects the ideological  division of the Court from decisions they have made. On this chart the  folks analyzing these decisions said: Where would Neil Gorsuch be?  Would he be in the ``we the people'' bell curve of decision making?  Would he be in the ``we the privileged and powerful'' bell curve? They  found that not only would he be in the ``we the powerful'' bell curve,  but his position on the curve would be to the far right of the curve.   I mentioned earlier the analysis by the Washington Post. This is an  individual who was rated by the professional analysts as being more  conservative than anyone who serves on the Court. I went through a  series of cases, and I will be going through them again as the night  wears on, in which he twisted the law to find for the powerful over the  individual time and time and time again. Someone who is way outside the  judicial mainstream and who twists the law to find for the powerful  over the people doesn't belong in the Supreme Court of America. So that  is the second big problem.   The third big problem is that the President's team is under  investigation for collaborating with the Russians interfering in our  November general election. This is a very serious question. There is a  very dark cloud over the legitimacy of the election and therefore the  legitimacy of this President. If President Trump worked to conspire  with the Russians or his team conspired with the Russians at his  direction or his knowledge, that is traitorous conduct because the  Russians attacked the fundamental institutions of our country. Trying  to delegitimize and change the outcome of our election and conspiring  with a foreign power to attack the foundation of our Democratic  Republic--that is traitorous conduct. We have to get to the bottom of  it, and we shouldn't be considering on this floor a nominee under that  set of circumstances. Let's complete the investigation, find out what  went on, and if the cloud clears, then we can proceed.    So those are the three substantial issues for why we should not be  here considering this nominee.   The stories I was sharing with you about how I first came to the  Senate as an intern for Senator Hatfield and then came back to Capitol  Hill working for a think tank sponsored by Congress, the Congressional  Budget Office--my responsibility was to analyze the impacts of various  potential strategies in the development and deployment of our strategic  triad, our nuclear triad. We have air-delivered and ballistic missiles,  land-based ballistic missile delivered weapons, and marine weapons-- that is the triad. That was my job, to consider the implications of the  path we might go to. What were the budgetary implications, what were  the performance implications, what were the implications for deterrence  or the circumstances that might trigger a nuclear war. So I was back  here on Capitol Hill in that capacity. What I saw was a Senate  fundamentally different than the one we have today.   I was reminded of this when, back in 2013, I was working to bring a  bill to the floor called the Employment Non-discrimination Act. This is  an act that Senator Ted Kennedy had sponsored, and if I recall right,  it was first sponsored in 1994. Then, 2 years later--I believe it was  in 1996--it was considered on the floor of the Senate, and it lost by  one vote. It lost 50 to 49. The Senator who was missing, it was  believed, would have voted for it, and the Vice President breaking the  tie would have voted for it, but people felt, well, it will be back up  before the Senate soon enough.   The point here is that the vote was a simple majority in that  setting, and the filibuster was reserved for very rare circumstances.  This happened to be a bill related to ending discrimination for our  LGBT community in employment, and anything involving what some may  construe as a social issue is one that many people have politicized  greatly. This was simply an issue of fairness in employment, but nobody  required a simple majority to close debate. They reserved the simple  majority for profound principles. It was so that this body can function  because it was primarily a simple-majority organization.   When I was covering the Tax Act of 1976, the issues on these  amendments came up one after another--what seemed like every hour--were  simple-majority votes with a lot of bipartisan cooperation. We have  become so polarized, we have become so divided, and this nomination and  this hearing right now are going to reverberate through the decades to  come as the lowest point, the biggest failure of this institution. We  do have the power to prevent that from happening because we haven't yet  voted on closing debate. Yet we have just a short period of time to set  this nomination aside.   Set it aside. Tell the President we need to heal this institution and  the Court by nominating Merrick Garland. Set it aside because the  nominee, Neil Gorsuch, is from the radical rightwing fringe, out of the  tradition of having mainstream Justices. Set it aside because there is  an enormous cloud over President Trump as to whether he is a legitimate  President, given the investigations into the conspiracy with Russia.  For all those reasons, set it aside.   Also set it aside because never before has a majority leader tried to  shut down this debate with a petition to close debate on the very first  day. It takes 2 days for that petition to ripen. There are folks who  have said that almost never is a Supreme Court nominee filibustered.  Well, it gets a little confusing because what does filibuster mean?  Does it mean deliberation at length? In this case, we have had a lot of  nominees filibustered because they have been deliberated at length.  Does it mean that we vote on a petition to close debate? Well, that  really changes the analysis because we have rarely had a petition to  close debate on a Supreme Court nominee, and we have never had a  petition to close debate filed on the first day of debate because  [[Page S2231]]  of the mutual respect that all the voices would be heard, and with  someone who was controversial enough for people to want to talk for  days and days and days, this body heard them out. The American people  heard that conversation and responded to it, and trends developed.  People said: Do you know what? No, this person really is suitable. And  they were confirmed. Sometimes they were withdrawn by a President. The  point is, in rare cases was a petition filed to close debate. Yet here  we have for the first time in U.S. history--it just happened a couple  hours ago--shutting down the debate as fast as they can. That is the  opposite of a deliberative body.   When I was back here as an intern, we had that age-old saying about  the Senate being the world's greatest deliberative body. I saw that  body. I saw people here on the floor talking to each other, listening  to each other, holding a debate, voting on amendments and immediately  going to the next amendment.   I remember on one occasion--I mentioned that once an amendment was  done, there wasn't another one negotiated between the Democrats and  Republicans, so there were long periods of silence, the way we operate  now. No, it was the next person recognized by the Chair, and the Chair  heard a lot of people at once, probably working to send one amendment  to the left side of the Chamber and one to the right side of the  Chamber, one to a senior Member, maybe one to a more junior Member, but  eventually, because of the expeditious consideration, everyone got to  have their idea considered and pretty much voted on by a simple  majority.   How different that is from what is happening right now at this moment  in this Chamber when we are at the very peak of pointed partisanship  coming from my colleagues across the aisle. They have stolen a seat for  the first time in U.S. history. They have proceeded to put it on the  floor and, for the first time in history, they have filed immediately a  petition to close debate. Every 5-to-4 vote from here on until who  knows when--our children's children--will be looked at, and people will  ask: Is this a decision because of the stolen seat? Would this have  been a ``we the people'' decision rather than a ``we the powerful'' if  not for that stolen seat? That is a huge erosion of the legitimacy of  the Court.    Do Members of this Chamber really want to do that kind of profound  damage? They will do that profound damage if the current direction  continues over the next couple of days, and that is a place in which I  do not want us to be. Therefore, this is kind of my own, personal  protest of where we have come, and it is my own request that we change  direction. I plan to keep speaking for quite a while longer, as long as  I am able. That will, hopefully, be, at least, a couple of more hours.  I am going to go into more depth about these issues that I have laid  out, and I am going to start by going through each piece in a lot more  detail.   Where do we start?   This journey began with Justice Scalia's death on February 13, which  was a little over a year ago. Then it was a month later that the  President fulfilled his responsibility under the Constitution and  nominated Merrick Garland. There were still 10 months left in the  administration at that time.   Earlier, I heard the majority leader say that no one has ever  filibustered a Supreme Court nominee. That is not quite true. There  have been some filibusters, more or less, if I can find them. Yet what  happened last year was a 293-day filibuster of Merrick Garland by my  Republican colleagues. It was not just an ordinary filibuster but a  special sort of failure to exercise their constitutional responsibility  of advice and consent. It was the first time in our history that a  nominee was not acted on when the nominee was being considered for a  seat that came open during an election year.   There are a few of my colleagues who like to say that the former Vice  President, Joe Biden, gave a speech and said--it was theoretical  because there was not an open seat--if a seat comes open in the summer  of an election year, maybe we should not consider it until the  intensity of the campaign has passed, meaning after the election.   We saw earlier, when we put up the chart--and I will put it up  again--that there were seats that opened up before an election. On  these seats here--these four seats--the vacancies were before the  elections. They were in August, May, October, and October. The  nominations did not come until after the November elections--in  December and February or in December and January. Yet the Senate acted  in those situations.   No matter how you slice it, 15 times there have been open seats. Some  occurred after the elections, and the Senate acted on the nominees.  Some occurred before the elections, but the nominations did not occur  until after the elections. The Senate acted in these cases. Then there  were another nine cases in which the nominations opened up before the  elections.   Biden made the simple point that, if the seat opens in the heat of  the summer, before the November election, maybe it would make sense to  hold off considering the nominee until after the election. That is  completely consistent with our history. My colleagues tried to twist it  into something else--as an argument that we should not consider a  nominee during an election year. Of course, that is not what Biden said  at all. It was not even close.   Let me tell you, when you have to try to find one sentence from 20  years ago from one of the people who has served in the Senate and when  that is the only evidence you can find to back up your case, you are  not just on thin ice. You have fallen through the ice and into the  pond. Your argument is that weak and that terrible. Whenever you hear  my colleagues ask: Didn't the Vice President, when he was a Senator,  suggest a theory that we should not consider a nominee during the heat  of the campaign right before an election? Yes, he said you should wait  until after the heat of the campaign. It was one sentence, 20 years  ago, from one Senator. If your argument is that weak, please try to  find some better argument to make.   We are not here considering something of small importance. We are  here, considering an issue that has profound consequences for the  integrity of the Senate because it is the first time in U.S. history  that a Supreme Court seat has been stolen. It has a huge impact on the  integrity of the Supreme Court because this is a court-packing scheme.  If the Court is packed, it delegitimizes its decisions. Let's not pack  the Court. That is why I am here, speaking tonight.   On February 13, the very same day that Antonin Scalia passed away,  the majority leader came to the floor and released a statement that  read, essentially: We intend to steal this seat.   Here is what Majority Leader McConnell said:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until after we have a new President.    He reiterated opposition to any Obama nominee on the day that  President Obama fulfilled his constitutional responsibility by standing  in the Rose Garden and nominating Merrick Garland. When our majority  leader reiterated his opposition, what did he quote? He quoted the one  passage that was taken out of context from Biden's speech from 20 years  ago.   That was the foundation on which he based a proposition to forgo our  responsibility as a Senate to provide advice and consent under the  Constitution--one sentence out of context. He turned the meaning on its  head of a former Senator from 20 years ago. That is how weak the case  was that the majority leader presented for failing to perform our  constitutional responsibility. That was how weak the case was that he  presented for stealing a Supreme Court seat in a court-packing scheme.   He said to give the people a voice. The American people voted  overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. She won by more than 3 million  votes. She would have won by a lot more if it were not for voter  suppression. We have one party that generally believes in voter  empowerment--that the foundation is ``we the people'' and that part of  citizenship is to vote. We have one party that has resorted to trying  to prevent people from voting--voter suppression, gerrymandering,  changing the shape of a district to deprive people of having a voice  here in Congress, changing the dates in which early voting can occur so  that people have less of an opportunity to vote, changing the locations  of precincts, which is where your voting takes place.  [[Page S2232]]    Some of the voter suppression tactics involve things that are just  misinformation--false information--and telling people that the vote has  already occurred or the location has been moved when it has not or that  the votes are going to close earlier than they are actually scheduled  to close--or a whole host of things.   The majority leader said to give the people a voice. The people voted  overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. So it would follow that the  majority leader would come to this floor and say: The people voted  overwhelmingly, by 3 million votes, and it would have been a lot more.  So we will now consider Merrick Garland because he was the nominee from  a Democratic President--the seat he stole. The people have spoken. The  majority has said that we do not want the Republican, that we want the  Democrat. So we will go ahead and hear the Democratic nominee, and we  will vet and vote on Merrick Garland.   But it is a funny thing in that that did not happen because the goal  was not to give people a voice. The goal was to steal the seat and  deliver it to a Republican President who would nominate someone from  the extreme right and pack the Court, undermining ``we the people'' in  favor of ``we the powerful and the privileged.''   The Democrats did not politicize the Court. The Republicans  politicized the Court. The American people did have a voice in  Garland's nomination. They had a voice by their voting twice for  President Obama. Throughout our entire history, the Senate has  considered the nominee from the President in power, when the vacancy  occurs--even when it is an election year--because that is what the  Constitution tells us to do--not to steal the seat, not to pack the  Court.   This politicization, this gamesmanship, this hypocrisy is so extreme  and so dangerous. I heard that some of my colleagues were asked if they  would want their election year rule to apply to President Trump--that  he could not fill a seat that would come open in the fourth year of his  Presidency. That was the principle they advocated for last year. Their  answer was no because there was no principle to the position. It was a  warfare tactic of partisanship to pack the Court. It was the end  justifies the means even if the means violates the core premise of the  Constitution and does deep damage to the Senate and does deep damage to  the Court.   Just this past Sunday, while speaking to Chuck Todd on ``Meet the  Press,'' the majority leader began to walk back his past statements  that a Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled in an election year.   Todd asked:         Should that be the policy going forward? Are you prepared       to pass a resolution that says: In election years, any       Supreme Court vacancy will not be filled, and let it be a       sense of the Senate resolution that no Supreme Court       nominations will be considered in an even numbered year?    The majority leader responded:         That is an absurd question.    Why is it an absurd question given that it is the principle that  election year nominations should go to the next President? I will tell  you why it is absurd. It is absurd because it is contrary to the  Constitution.   Mitch McConnell, the majority leader--my majority leader, the  majority leader of the Senate, the top person in charge--was right when  he said it was absurd because, of course, we should not abandon our  constitutional responsibilities. It is an absurd argument to make  today, and it was an absurd argument when he made it last year. If it  were only absurd and not deeply damaging, then we could all perhaps not  be so deeply, deeply concerned about the situation.    Merrick Garland's record. Judge Garland had more Federal judiciary  experience than any Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history. So  the nominee put forward by President Obama had more Federal judiciary  experience than any nominee in our Nation's history. He graduated summa  cum laude and valedictorian from Harvard College.   After graduating, he clerked for Judge Henry J. Friendly in the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He clerked for Justice William  Brennan, Jr., in the U.S. Supreme Court. He was in private practice at  Arnold & Porter, focusing on litigation and pro bono representation of  disadvantaged Americans. He left his partnership for a low-level  prosecutor position in the administration of George H.W. Bush.   In 1993, Merrick Garland went to the Justice Department as Deputy  Assistant Attorney General in the criminal division, and that is where  he oversaw prosecutions in the Oklahoma City bombing, helping bring  Timothy McVeigh to justice. He helped oversee prosecutions in the case  against Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, and the Olympics bombing  committed by Eric Robert Rudolph that killed 1 person and injured 111.   He made a name for himself in these cases by being a strictly by-the- book prosecutor. He insisted on obtaining subpoenas, even when  companies volunteered to hand over evidence. He insisted on keeping  victims and relatives informed as the cases developed. He served for 19  years on the DC Circuit Court.   That is a lot of experience. And all that happened before he was  nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1995 for the DC Circuit Court.   He received a confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee  in December of that year, but Republicans did not schedule a floor vote  on his confirmation because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.  So President Clinton renominated Merrick Garland for the circuit court  on January 7, 1997, and he was confirmed on the Senate floor by a vote  of 76 to 23 that year, in March.   At the time of the consideration of Merrick Garland on the floor, my  colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, had very flattering things to say  about Merrick Garland. He said:         To my knowledge, no one, absolutely no one, disputes the       following: Merrick B. Garland is highly qualified to sit on       the D.C. circuit. His intelligence and his scholarship cannot       be questioned.    He continued:         I do not think there is a legitimate argument against Mr.       Garland's nomination, and I hope our colleagues will vote to       confirm him today.    Then he said:         In all honesty, I would like to see one person come to this       floor and say one reason why Merrick Garland doesn't deserve       this position.    The Senator went on to suggest that his colleagues who were blocking  the confirmation vote were trying to obstruct his confirmation and were  ``playing politics with judges.''   I so respect the statement that my colleague from Utah made in 1995,  admonishing his colleagues to quit playing politics with judges.   But what has happened between 1995 and 2017, over these last 22  years? A huge amplification of playing politics to the point that when  Merrick Garland came back before this body, only a couple of  Republicans were willing to stand up and say: Let's quit playing  politics. And they were quickly silenced.   During his 2005 confirmation hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts  remarked about serving on the Circuit Court with Merrick Garland: ``Any  time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you are in a difficult area.''   So here is the Chief Justice, considered one of the conservatives on  the Court, who is saying that if you disagree with Merrick Garland, you  are in a difficult area. You have to go and figure out why you would  disagree because he is so good at working his way through the law and  coming to a position of calling the balls and strikes.   That is the type of respect there was for Merrick Garland. And this  respect and admiration continued right up to his official nomination on  March 11, 2016. Five days before his nomination, my Senate colleague-- my colleague from Utah--told a reporter that if President Obama named  Judge Garland, ``who is a fine man,'' to fill Scalia's seat, he would  be a ``consensus nominee,'' and there would be no question of his  receiving a bipartisan confirmation--five days before the President  nominated Merrick Garland.   The President recognized that the Senate was controlled by the  Republican majority. He consulted on both sides of the aisle. He chose  a nominee admired on both sides of the aisle.    Standing in the Rose Garden on March 16 of last year, President Obama  officially nominated Judge Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin  Scalia, and President Obama called Merrick Garland the right man for  the job: He deserves to be confirmed.  [[Page S2233]]    His nomination had endorsements from a broad range of organizations  and individuals. The American Bar Association, the Hispanic National  Bar Association, eight former Solicitors General, including Neal  Katyal, Gregory Garre, Paul Clement, Theodore Olson, Seth Waxman,  Walter Dellinger, Drew Days, and Kenneth Starr. You recognize some of  those names. Some come from the right side of the spectrum, some from  the left. The point was that eight former Solicitors General--Ken  Starr, 1989 through 1993, and Drew Days who followed him, and  Dellinger, who followed Days, and Waxman, who followed Dellinger, and  Olson, who served from 2001 to 2004, and Clement, who followed Olson,  and Garre, who followed Clement, and then Neal Katyal, who served in  2010 and 2011.   Endorsement from the American Bar Association Standing Committee on  the Federal Judiciary rated him ``well qualified'' as a Supreme Court  nominee, the highest rating they can give, and their evaluation of his  record stated that Judge Garland ``meets the very highest standards of  integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.''   So there we have our President, President Obama, last year consulting  in a bipartisan fashion, choosing a nominee who had been highly  complimented by Senators on both sides of the aisle, seeking to find  someone straight down the judicial mainstream, and what was the  response of the majority leader of our body, our assembly here? His  response was: We are going to steal this seat. It doesn't matter that  this nominee is highly qualified. It doesn't matter that Democratic and  Republican Senators have complimented him highly and have high respect  for him. It doesn't matter that the Chief Justice has enormous respect  for his judicial thinking. We are going to steal this seat in hopes of  being able to pack the Court. That is what happened later in the day,  after Merrick Garland was nominated.   The Senate has always functioned by cooperation, with a big element  of tradition thrown in. A defining feature of the Senate is a  commitment to the traditions of fair play, allowing us to continue  functioning to solve America's problems in politicized circumstances.  This is enormously important to the success of this Chamber.   I had heard when I was running for the Senate in 2007 and 2008 that  something terrible had happened with this Chamber in the years that I  had been back in Oregon and that a group had decided that they would  use this Chamber as a weapon against any Democratic President rather  than as a forum to solve America's problems. I didn't believe it. I  didn't believe that the Senate I saw as an intern in 1976; that I saw  when I was volunteering for organizations and working here in DC,  washing dishes and waiting tables in 1977; that the Senate I saw when I  was a Presidential fellow with a Republican Defense Secretary, Caspar  Weinberger; that the Senate I saw when I worked for Congress in a think  tank on strategic nuclear weapon policy for the Congressional Budget  Office--I couldn't believe that a group of Senators had decided to use  this Chamber as a weapon against the executive branch, if the executive  branch happened to be from the other party. I didn't believe it. I  dismissed the commentary I was hearing about what was occurring in this  Chamber.   Then I arrived in 2009, and I quickly saw that I was wrong; that the  stories about this Chamber being taken over by an urge to use it as a  weapon against Democratic Presidents had, in fact, been true. We all  were nearly knocked over when the majority leader announced that his  goal was to make sure--his top goal, his determining vision--was to use  this Chamber to prevent President Obama from being reelected. And we  are sitting here going: Let's work together on healthcare policy. Let's  work together to make a fair tax system. Let's work together to develop  the infrastructure that is so needed because the infrastructure our  parents built is wearing out. Let's work to develop that infrastructure  because we have new demands of a different economy. We need better  bridges and better railways and better ports and better electric  transmission lines, and we certainly need better broadband, or at least  broadband of some kind, as a starting point in rural America. Those are  the challenges we face. Let's work together.   And then I watched as a key issue was turned into a political weapon  against the President, rather than working to solve problems here in  America, and that issue was healthcare.   In April 2009, I was handed a brief written by Frank Luntz, who was a  strategist for the Republican team, and that brief said, Whatever ideas  that the Democrats work to pursue on healthcare, here is our strategy:  Don't cooperate; call it a government takeover--whatever they do.   I came to the floor of the Senate, and I gave a floor speech in 2009.  I waved around the Frank Luntz memo, and I said: This is what is wrong  with America. We have millions and millions of people without access to  healthcare in America, and instead of working together, the Republican  strategist is saying, Whatever ideas to improve the healthcare system  they come up with, oppose them and call it a government takeover.   Democrats said: You need bipartisan cooperation to get a healthcare  bill through here. So they held 5 weeks of hearing in the HELP  Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I was  assigned to that committee. Senator Ted Kennedy had assigned me to be  on that committee, in partnership with Majority Leader Harry Reid. I  was so happy to be on that committee. For 5 weeks around a square  table, I saw idea after idea presented as amendments were discussed,  debated, and voted on. Approximately 150 Republican amendments were  adopted. Imagine a committee adopting today, under the control of the  Senate, 150 Democratic amendments on a major bill--adopting, not just  considering. Democrats went through every title, with television there  and all of America watching for 5 weeks.   That was just for the HELP Committee. Then there was a whole other  process with the Finance Committee in which Senator Baucus led a group  with Senator Grassley, if I am not mistaken. They had three Democrats  and three Republicans, and they worked on the finance side to come to a  bipartisan conclusion. But eventually Frank Luntz's vision won out:  Whatever is suggested, oppose it and call it a government takeover.  That would do the most damage to the President. That was the strategy.   Democrats said: Well, it looks like we are going to have to take the  Republican healthcare plan.   What was the Republican healthcare plan? The Republican healthcare  plan was to use a marketplace in which private companies would offer  their insurance. Compare the insurance, one policy to the other, to  find out which one best suited your family, and then based on income,  you could get tax credits to be able to afford to acquire that  insurance policy, so that essentially we would have a pathway to  healthcare for every American citizen, for the millions and millions of  people who didn't have that pathway. That was the Republican plan. It  came out of the American Enterprise Institute as the marketplace  solution for healthcare. It wasn't a public option. It wasn't, let's  lower the age of Medicare. It wasn't single buyer. It was the  Republican marketplace plan. It was already one that had been tested by  a Republican Governor in Massachusetts. It was known as RomneyCare. So  it was a Republican think tank plan and a Republican Governor-tested  plan.   Democrats said: OK, let's go that way. We think there are better  pathways, but we will go with that because we need to be able to bring  this Chamber together.   But my colleagues across the aisle, under this vision of using the  Senate as a weapon against a Democratic President, decided they were  going to oppose it just like Frank Luntz laid out in those first few  months of 2009.   We see that same profound partisanship in this first-ever theft of a  Supreme Court seat. We see that same profound partisanship in the  strategy behind that theft, which is to pack the Court. We see that  same profound strategy in the action that happened a couple hours ago.  That was the first time in U.S. history a motion to close debate was  filed on the first day of a Senate debate.  [[Page S2234]]    So turn the clock back to those first 13 States and 26 Senators  trying to figure out how the Senate would operate. They weren't really  planning on it being a public forum, but they did have this sense that  it would be wrong to close debate before every Senator had shared from  their experience. So they had a rule. In their initial rules of the  Senate, they had a rule to close debate. They never used it. They never  used it, as far as we know, not once, because they wanted to give  everyone the chance to be heard. Of course, the Senate was only a  quarter of the size--26 Senators instead of 100 Senators.   When they rewrote the rules of the Senate, they said: We don't need  to have a rule for closing debate by simple majority called to  question, if you will. We don't have to have it because we are going to  hear everybody out before we vote. So that kind of launched that  tradition of hearing each other out.   Later, when the Senate restored a rule in which a supermajority could  close debate, it took a supermajority. At another point, the Senate  said: We need to have a little smaller supermajority.   The reason that triggered, going back to having a strategy for  closing debate--and I know historians will correct me if I have this  wrong--in World War I, the President wanted to put military defenses on  some of the commercial ships to fend off the threat from the Germans.  There were Senators who said: This will draw us into war. We are not in  the war yet. This will draw us into war by weaponizing our commercial  ships.   There was a date set for the Senate to adjourn. They proceeded to  keep talking until that time arrived so the Senate could not act to  pass that law, which the vast majority of the Senate thought was  appropriate.   They said: Well, we can't have just a small group, which basically  would be the tail that wags the dog. That denies our ability to make  decisions. So we will have to have a strategy for closing debate.   So they established that strategy. The general principle behind it  was most of the time you hear people out here in the Senate rather than  closing debate. But what we saw tonight for the first time in U.S.  history--a cloture petition filed on the very first day.   James Madison, speaking to the Constitutional Convention, remarked  that the Senate was a necessary fence to protect the people from the  transient impressions into which they themselves might be led. It was a  reason for the longer terms for the Senate. They have 2 years in the  House; we have 6 years in the Senate. The Senate rotates so a third are  elected every 2 years for 6-year terms.   There is a saying attributed to President Washington--as far as we  know, he never said it, but still it was clever enough that it has  reverberated on down through the centuries--that the Senate would be  the cooling saucer, so that you had your tea and it was too hot, and  you poured it into the cooling saucer until it was just right. You  don't act impulsively because you have 6-year--longer--terms and a  smaller body who can ponder the issues more carefully.   So here is the Senate, intended to be the cooling saucer, but what do  we have right now? We have the stove turned up to the highest possible  temperature. There is no stepping back from this course of undermining  the integrity of the Senate and the integrity of the Court. It is full  steam ahead. File the petition on the first day of debate so we can  close this debate and have this vote done by Friday, the majority  leader said. Vote on Thursday. Somehow we are going to maybe change the  rules and vote on Friday if there are not enough votes to close debate.   Back in 2013, there was an enormous blockade using the advice and  consent power to obstruct both executive branch nominees and judicial  nominees. This enormous blockade was used by colleagues across the  aisle as a weapon against the judiciary and executive branch.   When the conversation occurred back among the Founders, they said:  Advice and consent power won't have to be used very often to turn down  a Presidential nominee because just the very fact that the Senate can  serve as a check on a Presidential nomination will cause a President to  make wise appointments.   They had actually wrestled with how to construct this situation. How  do you construct this check and balance?   Some said: The executive branch--why don't we have the President head  it but have the positions filled by Congress?   Others said: That is not such a good idea because one Senator's  friend will be nominated for this position in exchange for another  Senator's friend being nominated for that position, and the people will  never really know who, where, why. There is no accountability.   That is what it came down to.   So we will have a single person--the President--nominate for the  executive branch. Plus, that way the President can nominate people to  help fulfill the vision the President campaigned on, which makes a lot  of sense. The people didn't just elect a name; they elected a vision  for the country. And the person responsible for helping to implement  that--the executive branch--the President, should have a team who can  go forward with that vision.   Then the crafters of the Constitution said: But what if the President  goes off track and starts nominating people who don't actually have the  skills to fill the positions to which they are nominated? What if the  President nominates people because they have done some favor for the  President in the past, so that there is a conflict of interest? What if  the President nominates someone of poor character? Shouldn't there be a  way to put a check on a deeply misguided nomination?   The founders said: Yes. We will create an advice and consent power  for the U.S. Senate to be a check on misguided nominations.   So here we are looking at that original philosophy of the Senate and  the responsibility to stop misguided nominations through advice and  consent, and we have had two profound betrayals of that responsibility  last year and this year. The betrayal last year was that the Senate  refused to exercise its responsibility at all. It stalled the seat. It  sought to pack the Court. Now we have a deeply misguided nomination  before us, an individual who is from the extraordinary right, not from  the mainstream, who has twisted the law time and time again to find for  the powerful and the privileged over ``we the people,'' and yet that  nomination is here on the floor, not a single vote in the Judiciary  Committee from across the aisle.   This chart reflects the distribution of Federal judge ideology. If we  had been putting up this chart decades ago, we would have probably seen  a single bell curve. There would be folks on the right and folks on the  left. But now we have the twin peaks chart of judicial decisionmaking.  So the decisions are falling more and more into a ``we the people''  camp that says ``Let's fulfill the vision of our Constitution'' and a  ``we the powerful'' camp that says ``Let's turn the Constitution upside  down and run this country by and for the powerful.'' Where does this  nominee fall? Not into the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution  and not even within the left side of that ``we the powerful'' twin peak  but to the right side of it. That is where we are.   The supermajority to close debate--commonly referred to as the  filibuster--is a power we have sustained in order to have nominees who  are not from the ideological extremes. But now we have one. We have one  who, when a trucker was protected by the law--because of his personal  safety, and he was freezing in subzero temperatures and had to go get  warm and come back, and the law protected him from getting fired--he  got fired. The court said: Absolutely, you can't fire someone for  protecting their safety or others. Judge Gorsuch found a way to turn  that on its head.    When we wrote a law to say that you have to provide an education to  disabled children, Judge Gorsuch said that babysitting is fine, as long  as there is basically--not exact words, kind of mere fringe of  advancement--something that was essentially equivalent to babysitting.  And the Supreme Court, all eight Justices occupying both of those  peaks, said that was absurd, and they overturned Judge Gorsuch, 8 to 0.   We have this role from our Founders of being the cooling saucer. We  have  [[Page S2235]]  this role of being a check on the abuse of or misguided Presidential  nominations, and we failed it last year by not doing our job. We fail  it this year by considering anyone other than Merrick Garland. And we  certainly fail it in the context of closing--considering the  possibility of closing debate. That is the conversation that the  majority leader has been invested in--that if this judge is so extreme  as to not to get the 60 votes to close debate, we will change the  rules.   Well, how about we change the nominee? How about we save the  integrity of the Senate? How about we save the integrity of the Supreme  Court? Change the nominee. Ideally, put Merrick Garland up, because  that way we solve the problem of the stolen seat--this enormous court- packing plan that is unfolding right before our eyes. And if the  schedule on which the majority leader has said he wants to complete  this court-packing occurs by Friday, it will be too late. We will have  done the damage.   George Washington shared his view of the Senate's role. The story  goes that Thomas Jefferson returned from France to take on the duties  as our first Secretary of State. He was having breakfast with President  Washington and called for the President to account for having supported  an unnecessary legislative Chamber in the Senate of having this  conversation. That is when that conversation came up. We believe it to  be apocryphal, but still the response, as written down at some later  point in time, was that Washington asked: Why did you now pour that  coffee into your saucer before drinking?   Jefferson responded: To cool it. My throat is not made of brass.   Washington said: Even so, we pour our legislation into the Senatorial  saucer to cool.   Is there a way that we can avoid what is unfolding now, this tragic  miscarriage of the Senate's responsibilities?   Whether that conversation took place, as I mentioned, is not actually  known, but the fact that the story is still here means that it had some  power behind it, whether it took place or not. And that was that for  200 years and counting, the government has counted on the Senate to  pause, to not give acceleration to the momentum of the day, but to  pause and be thoughtful in considering the integrity of our  institutions. And that integrity, that moment when we need to be the  cooling saucer, is now.   Unanimous consent has been a tool that the Senate has used. Many  times, if you are watching the Senate, you will hear ``unanimous  consent'' to do this or that. Earlier, the majority leader came and  spoke. He said: ``I ask unanimous consent,'' and he laid out a plan for  tomorrow about how this debate would proceed. That unanimous consent-- each and every one of those represents a form of cooperation, often the  last vestige of cooperation. It also goes to this observation that the  Senate is about hearing each other and working together.   Robert C. Byrd once remarked:         That is what the Senate is about. It's the last bastion of       minority rights, where the minority can be heard, where a       minority can stand on its feet. One individual, if necessary,       can speak until he falls.    Well, you can't keep speaking if a cloture petition has been filed.  So come Thursday, the phrase is the ``petition ripens,'' which means  that it will be voted on, and generally it is 1 hour after we convene  after an intervening day. So tomorrow, Wednesday, is the intervening  day, and the vote will occur on Thursday. That is the opposite of what  Senator Byrd was referring to because at that point, anyone who wants  to be heard, can't be heard.   The tradition of having weeks and weeks of conversation about a  nomination that creates complexities or has complexities behind it-- that is being destroyed. That comity permeated many controversial  debates the Senate has had over time. That willingness to hear each  other and to vote is something that was embedded in the Senate as I saw  it four decades ago and later in my life when I was working for  Congress.   There is no denying that the Supreme Court nominations have always  been subject to a certain level of politics, but there has also been a  certain level of cordiality to the process. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in  a debate on the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg back in 1993, said:         [The Senate] is perhaps most acutely attentive to its duty       when it considers a nominee to the Supreme Court. That this       is so reflects not only the importance of our Nation's       highest tribunal but also our recognition that while Members       of the Congress and Presidents come and go . . . the tenure       of a Supreme Court Justice can span generations.    We are not here on the floor debating who will serve in some office  in the executive branch for the next couple of years. We are here  debating the nomination for the highest Court that could ``span  generations,'' in the words of Daniel Patrick Moynihan.   So what else would we consider more important than a Supreme Court  nomination to adhere to the traditions of the Senate and to honor the  60-vote requirement in our rules? We don't always like the nominee the  other side has selected. We question them vigorously in confirmation  hearings, and we end up voting against them. But until the situation  last year with the death of Antonin Scalia, every vacancy in an  election year for which a President proposed a Justice who has made a  nomination--every time, the Senate did its job. It confirmed most. It  rejected a few, but it did its job.   Over the course of our Nation's history, there have been a total of  164 Supreme Court nominations; 124 of those were confirmed, roughly 3  out of 4, including elevating current Justices to Chief Justice. There  have been 112 individuals who have served on the Supreme Court, and 39  Presidents to date have appointed at least one Supreme Court Justice.  But only once--last year--has the majority conspired to reject its  responsibility to consider a nominee for a position that opened in an  election year. Only once has the majority conspired to steal an  election-year Senate seat and send it to the next President and pack  the Court.   The action last year is different from anything that has occurred  before. There were some individuals--some colleagues across the aisle-- who advocated for the Senate fulfilling its constitutional duty in the  case of Merrick Garland and for continuing the traditions of this great  institution.   One of my colleagues told a townhall audience last year--one of my  Republican colleagues said:         I can't imagine the President has or will nominate somebody       that meets my criteria, but I have a job to do. I think the       process ought to go forward.    Another colleague sat down and met with Judge Garland, even knowing  that the Republican leadership was saying that he would not get a  hearing. That colleague declared, and I quote, that colleague was  ``more convinced than ever that the process should proceed. The next  step, in my view, should be public hearings before the Judiciary  Committee.''   So I pause to thank my Republican colleagues who worked to stand up  for the integrity of the Court and the integrity of the Senate and for  due deliberation on a Presidential nomination during an election year.  Thank you to my colleague from Kansas. Thank you to my colleague from  Maine.   There may have been others I didn't hear about, and I imagine there  were because I think Members of this body take their responsibility  extremely seriously. They take their oath of office seriously, and they  were put in an impossible position when their leadership asked them not  to exercise their advice and consent responsibility under the  Constitution. That is where we were last year.   Here we are, on the brink of doing devastating damage to the Court.  Shouldn't we pause and be the cooling saucer? Shouldn't we send this  nomination back to the President and ask for him to put forward Merrick  Garland or someone who basically is on the same path that Merrick  Garland was on--the path that was so honored and complimented by  Senators on both sides of the aisle?   Shouldn't we address this before we set the precedent of a stolen  seat? Think about what this precedent means going forward. A few years  from now, there may well be another vacancy, and this vacancy may be  under a Republican President, and maybe the Democrats control this  Chamber. At that point, do they say: We are going to rectify the wrong  in the past and restore the integrity of the Court by taking that seat  and forwarding it to the next President, hoping that it will be a  [[Page S2236]]  Democratic President, and there will be a nominee who will restore the  integrity of the Court because there will be a nominee more like  Merrick Garland? Or will there be future leadership that says: Hey,  their team stole a seat that occurred--an opening that occurred in  January of election year. Let's steal one that happens in October the  year before the election to balance it out. If you can steal it for 12  months, why not steal it for a few more? Where does that end? What good  does that do to our institution? What honor does that give to the 5-to- 4 decisions of the future?   That is where we are headed. We are headed to a place that is  breaking two centuries' worth of tradition and establishing a precedent  that will do enormous damage to the Senate and to the Presidency and to  the Court. That is why I am here addressing it at length tonight. I did  find that when the majority leader didn't want to put into a resolution  that the same rule he advocated for last year should apply to this  President, it was clear--as clear as you could possibly make it--that  what happened last year had no principle in it; it was an issue of  partisan tactics to amplify the strength of one party and one vision-- that of government by and for the powerful--at the expense of the other  vision. Don't we owe more in our role as Senators, especially on  something as important as the Supreme Court and the integrity of the  Court, than just another partisan strategy?    I will tell you, I think about why it is that we are at this place  right now. There are a couple of things that are very, very different  from the Senate I first saw four decades ago and the America of four  decades ago. One of those is that Senators four decades ago lived here  with their families. They had a Monday-to-Friday workweek. They had  evenings to build relationships, and they had weekends to do things  with other colleagues across the aisle. They took a lot of bipartisan  congressional delegations. They all knew each other well as friends.   But now the Senate comes in on Monday night for a vote at 5:30 p.m.  and we leave after a vote at roughly 3:30 p.m. on Thursday. So it is 3  days--Monday afternoon to Thursday afternoon. We don't have the time in  the evenings because of that compressed schedule. We don't have the  time on the weekends because we are back in our home States or  traveling somewhere else. So we don't have the relationships. We just  don't have the common activities.   There used to be lunches where the Democrats and Republicans ate  together. Now there is a partisan Republican lunch, three out of three  lunches and two out of three for the Democrats. We don't have that meal  together to get to know each other, so you have to work extraordinarily  hard to set up a meeting to try to work with a colleague on a topic. If  it is something larger than you can discuss here during the middle of a  vote, it can take a month to get a 20-minute meeting to ponder with a  colleague how we might work together on a problem.   So that is a change in this Chamber, but there is another big change.  That second big change is related to the role of the media. We had big  issues in our country decades ago, but we also had community  newspapers, and we had three network television stations that  essentially provided a foundation of information. We might have had  different views about that information and different views about what  we should do in the future, but we had a common foundation of  information. Now we don't have a common foundation of information.  Information flows in every possible direction, much of it made up.   I was very struck when--I hold a lot of townhalls. My first summer as  a Senator--2009--I was out holding townhalls. I do one in every county  every year. Folks said: You know, why are you supporting this Senate  healthcare bill that has a death panel in it? That was one of those  false news stories.   What was the real story? The real story is that a Republican Senator  from Georgia had proposed--a Republican Senator had proposed that we  pay doctors for the time they spend with their patients informing them  about how to do a living will so that if they were incapacitated in the  future, their desires would be followed, not someone else's desires-- not a death panel, their desires would be followed. That is as American  as apple pie.   We were going to make sure that we could control, each of us, our own  future. It was a Republican proposal, a good proposal, a proposal that  made a lot of sense so that people could have control over their future  medical decisions if they were incapacitated. But for partisan  political reasons, a candidate had twisted that into a death panel and  turned it on its head, that someone else would make the decisions  instead of you making the decisions for yourself, which is what it was  all about.   So I was at this townhall, and a constituent, an Oregon citizen,  raised this issue.   I said: You will be happy to know that they don't exist. You will be  happy to know that the idea from which the false news story began was  about empowering you to make your own decisions. Don't you feel better  now knowing that the conversation in the Senate was about you  controlling your own destiny?   The woman said to me: I don't believe you.   I said: Well, you don't have to believe me; I have the text right  here that was proposed.   I had heard about this issue, and so I wanted to make sure that  people knew about it and that I could answer if asked. So I shared the  text with her.   She said: Well, I don't believe you. Who am I going to believe--a  U.S. Senator or a television policy analyst?   She meant Glenn Beck. Glenn Beck and others were simply making stuff  up and putting it on their television show or their radio show,  designed to infuriate people by setting up this false story--this false  story that there was a government takeover and this false story that  there was a death panel.   If you want to understand what happened 2 weeks ago in the House when  the House failed to pass a healthcare bill to replace ObamaCare, it is  a story about false news. It is a story about partisanship over policy.  It is a story about a year-plus of bipartisanship being trumped by  Frank Luntz's vision of whatever is proposed, call it a government  takeover. Even if--his memo didn't say this, but as it turned out, even  if it was the Republican strategy of having a marketplace for people to  get their health insurance, call it a government takeover.   So when the Republicans said they were going to replace ObamaCare,  the problem was that ObamaCare was the Republican plan, so they did not  have anywhere to go. They could either tear down healthcare completely  and put 24 million people on the ice--that is, out of reach of  healthcare--by the way, not just individuals but rural healthcare  institutions because the rural clinics were powerfully strengthened  through the Affordable Care Act. The rural hospitals were powerfully  strengthened through the Affordable Care Act. There was so much  uncompensated care previously that hospitals and clinics had to give  away for free, and now they were getting paid because people had  insurance, so they were much stronger. So it was about 24 million  people, but it was also about a vast healthcare infrastructure in rural  America that the Republican plan would destroy.    But they could not propose their own plan because their own plan had  been adopted in 2009--marketplaces with private companies competing  against each other, tax subsidies, tax credits so people could afford  to buy those policies. That was the American Enterprise Institute plan.  That was the Republican Governor's plan. That was RomneyCare. So where  do you go if your plan has already been enacted into law? If 150 of  your amendments were accepted as part of that process, where do you go  when you have used a false story, a false commentary to the American  people year after year after year saying that something is some  terrible thing that it is not? Well, where you go is the process blew  up. That is where it went because it was based on a false foundation,  the entire 8 years of attack on the Affordable Care Act--a false  premise just like Sarah Palin's death panels were a false attack.   We can't keep going through this extreme partisanship and save the  Senate at the same time.   Another challenge we have--in addition to the fact that the  friendships that cemented the Senate together are not as developed as  they were decades  [[Page S2237]]  ago because we are not here and we don't spend enough time with each  other--another problem is that we have all of these false stories being  generated continuously to make people angry with each other. Those are  certainly problems, but we have another big problem, and that problem  is the concentration of campaign money, the dark money, the Citizens  United money that is corrupting our political system.   I can't convey how much damage this has done. Let's just review the  biggest example of this strategy. The Koch brothers decided in 2013  that they wanted to have a legislature that would support their  extraction and burning of fossil fuels. There was this pesky little  problem threatening the entire planet called global warming in which  the burning of those fossil fuels was polluting the air, raising the  temperature of the Earth, and having profound consequences.   So people were talking about, how do we transition off of fossil  fuels?   The Koch brothers said: Well, that is our business. We can't let that  happen. We have to have control of the House and Senate.   So the story with the Senate is they decided to spend a vast sum of  money on the campaigns of 2014. The result was that they influenced the  elections and had a positive outcome, from their point of view, in  Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, in Iowa, Colorado, and Alaska.  There were a few other States that they came to that year, including  Oregon, my home State. So they won most of those campaigns. They put  the Republican majority into office so they would have a Senate that  would not be discussing the biggest threat to our planet--carbon  pollution and global warming--and instead would have one that would  sustain tax breaks to accelerate the extraction and burning--the  profitability of extracting and burning fossil fuels.   Then they did something that should be recorded as a significant  moment in U.S. history. In January, as the Senate was coming in with  this new Republican majority, they did not say: Well, that is great. We  have a Republican majority, and now we have folks who will support our  fossil fuel extraction and combustion. We will make a lot of money.  They will keep the tax breaks in place for us.   No, they didn't say that. They said: Pay attention.   This was January 2015, 2 months after the election, and we were just  coming in. The Republican majority was just coming in.   The Koch brothers said: Pay attention. We are committing to spend the  better part of $1 billion in the next election 2 years from now.   I don't know that such a statement has ever been made by a body in  the United States, a similar statement. Next election--we had just had  this election--next election we are going to spend almost $1 billion.   They wanted everyone in this new Republican-majority Senate to know  who was in charge. The Koch brothers are in charge. They paid for the  third-party ads that put your election in the victory column.   You will pay attention--at your own risk if you don't.   A number of my colleagues shared that this was a very real threat,  that the Koch brothers would be happy to find a primary opponent and  not just undermine them in the general election or fail to fund them in  a general election--and the first bill up was one of the Koch brothers'  top priorities, the Keystone Pipeline. So we now have a body about  which, at least, you can say that a very significant behind-the-scenes  force of this body is the Koch brothers. Well, how does this tie in  with what happened in 2016 when Antonin Scalia died and there was an  open Senate seat?    Here is how it ties in: You had a 5-to-4 Supreme Court that had  decided that it was OK for groups like the Koch brothers to spend  billions of dollars in dark money, third-party campaigns, eviscerating  the opponents on the other side of the issue.   Four Justices had said no. In our ``we the people'' Republic, having  that concentration of power is a corrupting force. It is an attack on  the very design of our country, but you had five others who said: No,  no, no, it is OK.   That makes me think about a letter that Jefferson wrote. Jefferson  was writing to a friend, and he said: There is a mother principle, a  mother principle in our design of the government. He said: That is that  decisions will only be made in the interest of the people if each  person carries an equal voice.   He recognized in using the term ``voice,'' something broader, more  powerful than just a vote. That is why I said ``voice.''   What has happened with Citizens United, with respect to the five  Justices, is that it is OK to have some individuals who have a voice in  our campaign that is equal to thousands or tens of thousands or even  100,000 other citizens.   We didn't have such a way to amplify one's voice--not anything close  to that amplification when the Founders designed our government. Yes,  you could put an article in the newspaper. Yes, you could hand out  pamphlets. But with the growth of radio and television and now the  internet and all the strategies through social media and internet  advertising, through all of that, money can amplify one's voice. You  can have the equivalent of a stadium sound system that drowns out the  voice of the people. That is the opposite of Jefferson's mother  principle, Jefferson's principle that we will only be a government that  pursues the will of the people if each citizen has an equal voice.   Now, granted, we all know that vision was flawed. Women weren't given  the vote. Many minorities were excluded. But we have worked overtime  toward that vision of inclusion, opportunity, and equality, and we have  come a long way. But in one case, we have gone in the opposite  direction, and that is the Citizens United concentration of money  corrupting our elections, undermining the legitimacy of this Chamber  and undermining the legitimacy of the House Chamber. Instead of being  elected to do government of, by, and for the people, it is the product  of an enormous concentration of power by and for the few. You can see  it in the policies that are pursued.   Three decades after World War II, we had an economy that worked  really well for working America. American workers participated in the  wealth that they were creating, and the result was that families had a  leap forward.   My parents have lived under humble circumstances. I had a grandmother  who at one point had lived in a railroad car. I had a grandfather who  put all the children into a car and drove from Kansas to Arizona with  all of the individuals in the family and their possessions in a single  car, going west, trying to find work and find a future. Those were  incredibly hard times. Folks were living in shacks.   Then, after World War II, we had these three decades when we had this  big leap forward in the standard of living, as workers shared in the  wealth they were creating.   From about the time I got out of high school, which was 1974, in the  middle of that decade--let's call it 1975--and in the next four  decades, virtually all of the new income in America has gone to the top  10 percent, which means that 9 out of 10 Americans have been left  behind in this economy.   I live in a blue collar community, the same community I have lived in  since third grade. I was there from third grade through graduating from  high school. I moved back into that community the year my son Jonathan  was born 20 years ago.   It is a blue collar community. It has changed over time. It has  become much more of a diverse community. There are many ethnicities  from all over the world, and a lot of languages are spoken in the  school. It is a blue collar, working community.   Folks there say: My parents were able to buy a house in this  community, but the only way I am going to own a house in this community  is to be able to inherit it from my parents because of the  disappearance of living-wage jobs.   That is what has been going on in this economy. We provide these  enormous, enormous tax breaks for the best off in our society.   Well, there is a concept referred to as the Buffett rule. Warren  Buffett said: Why should I, a billionaire, be taxed at a lower rate  than my secretary? Why does my secretary pay a higher rate than I do?   So every now and then, we have had on the floor of the Senate an  effort to  [[Page S2238]]  correct that and say: Hey, a billionaire should pay at least the same  tax rate as the secretary or the janitor. But we haven't corrected it  because the vast influence of funds in this Chamber are working on  behalf of the privileged and the powerful.   So here we are, trying to figure out why last year we had, for the  very first time, a majority leader who engineered the theft of a  Supreme Court seat from the Obama administration to another  administration. It was the first time in U.S. history. To understand  2016, you have to understand 2014, when the Koch brothers invested this  vast sum in all the campaigns so they could control the Senate. You  have to understand that in January 2015, the Koch brothers sent a  message that you had better pay attention. You have to understand that  the Koch brothers' strategy is based on the dark money, third-party  campaigns that Merrick Garland might possibly have voted against--a 5- to-4 Citizens United decision that Merrick Garland might have found 5- to-4 in the other direction. We don't actually know where he stood on  this.   He was so square down the middle and so complimented by people on the  right as well as the left. We don't know how he would have voted on  that. But in order to ensure that the dark money could continue, in  order to ensure that decisions would be made by and for the powerful,  to ensure that the fossil fuel companies could be swept clear of  regulations that would diminish the amount of fossil fuels they could  extract out of the ground and sell for combustion, in order to ensure  the profits of the Koch brothers, that drove this unique case of the  theft of the Supreme Court seat last year.   There was that effort to pack the Court by sending that seat to the  next President in the hopes that it would be a conservative President  and then to have that nominee say: I will only nominate somebody who  comes off a list from two conservative groups on the far right--boy.  That was exactly the vision. It has unfolded exactly as--I guess you  could say--those in that powerful group wanted it to unfold.   We have a different responsibility. We don't have a responsibility to  a ``we the powerful'' vision. We don't have a responsibility to a ``we  the privileged'' vision. We have a ``we the people'' Constitution.   We have Jefferson's mother principle that says: We should be in a  situation, if we want the will of the people to be enacted, in which  people have an equal voice. There is this third-party, dark money that  is corrupting America, our fundamental institutions, our election  institutions. It is corrupting this institution--both sides, the House  and the Senate. That is why I hope there is a Supreme Court that  eventually says this is wrong; this is out of sync with our  constitutional vision.   The Court said: We think transparency will do the job. They kind of  assumed that there would be transparency in where the money came from  and where it went.   It used to be that colleagues on the right side of this Chamber would  say: Oh, we love transparency. Transparency will be the sunlight that  disinfects the potential corruption of campaign donations. We love  transparency.   Many of those who opposed McCain-Feingold caps on donations said: We  love transparency, the sunlight, the disinfectant. Won't that be  wonderful.   Then, we had a transparency bill on the floor and said: People have  to know where every donation comes from so there is not this dark  money, unidentified money surging through the veins of the American  campaign system, surging through the arteries. Suddenly they say: Oh,  wait; we don't like transparency so much because that might hurt the  prospects for the powerful folks who got us elected.   So then you have the picture of why this unique circumstance occurred  and why we are where we are and how much damage it is going to do and  how it undermines the legitimacy of the Court.   Merrick Garland's treatment is unprecedented in the history of  Supreme Court nominations. There was a hastily fabricated pretext that  we shouldn't do a normal process under our advice and consent  responsibilities in the final year of a Presidency or the fourth year  of a Presidency.   Now, you can read the Constitution from one end to another, but you  won't find that principle in the Constitution--that suddenly we can  ignore our responsibility in the fourth year of a Presidency.   The responsibility to be here in the Senate Chamber doesn't end in a  fourth year. No other responsibility ends.   The responsibility of the President to nominate for empty positions  doesn't end, but that pretext was one which was so quickly concocted.  The foundation was so quickly destroyed, and it was just revealed for  the destructive partisan tactic that it was--this Court-packing tactic.   One colleague said: We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming  Supreme Court Justices in an election year. That is an exact quote.   One colleague came to the floor--a colleague, by the way, who ran for  President--and said: We have 80 years of precedent not confirming a  Supreme Court Justice in an election year. Wrong. There have been 15  vacancies in an election year, and 15 times the Senate acted, and in  most of those cases, it was to confirm the Justice. We could even look  at the fact that there were some vacancies that occurred before an  election year and were confirmed in an election year, just like the  nomination of Anthony Kennedy--who sits on the Supreme Court today--in  1988.   To my colleague who said we have 80 years of precedent of not  confirming a Supreme Court Justice in an election year--that is his  exact quote--not only is that not true, if you look at history, at  every single nomination vacancy that occurred in an election year--and  most were confirmed, but the Senate always acted--it is simply not  true, if you look at Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sits on the Court a  few yards from here, who confirmed just a few years ago--in 1988-- within the memory of most Members who serve in this Chamber.   If you go back just one more election--let me put it differently.  Until Merrick Garland's nomination last year, we hadn't had an  election-year vacancy for a sizeable period of time. That is why I am  going to have these three charts put back up. If we look at these  charts here in this situation, these are some vacancies that occurred  in an election year.   Look at this group here--in 1928, 1860, 1864, and 1956. Well, 1956  was a good period of time ago. That was about 60 years ago, 61 years  ago. That is quite a while.   Let's look at the next chart. Well, vacancies in an election year-- year 1800, year 1872, year 1880. They happened a long time ago.   How about the last chart of nine. Again we see a lot of 1800s--1804,  1844, 1852, 1888, 1892, in 1916 twice, and 1932. The point is taken  that it has been quite a long time since we have had a vacancy in an  election year.   So if you concoct a premise within an hour or two of a Supreme Court  Justice dying and get it wrong--but then there is also a colleague who  had the time to look up the facts who got it wrong as well.   In the 1932 election between Franklin Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover,  we did have an election of a Supreme Court nominee. Hoover nominated  Benjamin Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes. On February 24, 9  days later, the Senate confirmed Cardozo. That was the last time we had  a Supreme Court seat open up in an election year, except for the  Eisenhower occasion.   Why don't we go back to Eisenhower. The seat opened up 1956, an  election year, and it was the following January that he was confirmed.   So we can look to the fact that the Senate acted on all 15 of the 15  election-year vacancies, confirming most of them. Here we see two out  of the four confirmed, and of these eight before Merrick Garland, we  see six of the eight confirmed. Then the other group of three were the  folks where the vacancy occurred after the general election, but the  Senate still confirmed all three, whether up or down.   So if you look to history, my colleague who said that we were in a  situation where we had been in the tradition of not confirming people  during an election year, 80 years of precedent not confirming a Supreme  Court Justice in an election year, well, that is a phony, phony,  incorrect, fallacious--insert your own adjective here--argument because  in our entire history, every single seat that became vacant in an  election year was actually done by the  [[Page S2239]]  Senate before the next President took office.   Three vacancies occurred after the general election. We saw the three  in this chart here. John Jay in 1800, with the Adams administration,  was nominated to be Chief Justice on December 18 after Chief Justice  Oliver Ellsworth retired. Jay was the first Chief Justice but retired  in 1795 to serve as the second Governor of New York for two terms.  After that, Jay's nomination was confirmed in the Senate, and he ended  up declining the position and retiring from public life instead.   For those of you who are thinking about political trivia, who was the  election-year nominee confirmed by the Senate? The vacancy occurred  late in December. He was confirmed 3 days later and declined it. Now  you know the answer. It is the nominee John Jay, who had served as  Governor of New York for two terms.   Adams was more successful when his second choice, John C. Marshall,  was confirmed on January 27. That confirmation happened after the term.   In 1872 Ward Hunt was nominated by Ulysses Grant a month after easily  winning reelection, on December 3, 1872, to replace the retiring  Justice Samuel Nelson. Hunt was confirmed by the Senate 8 days after  being nominated.   William Woods was nominated by Rutherford Hayes in 1880. He was  nominated to replace William Strong, who was stepping down while still  in good health at the age of 72. That set an example for several infirm  colleagues who refused to do the same. I hope his influence was  substantial because that is one of the challenges of having a lifetime  appointment--sometimes the Justices stay in office beyond their ability  to exercise clear reasoning. It is a good example that William Strong  set.   As a member of the U.S. circuit court, Justice Woods was easily  confirmed by the Senate 39 to 8 on December 21, 1880. He was the first  person to be named to the Supreme Court from a former Confederate  State. So there is another little bit of Supreme Court trivia.   There were four vacancies that occurred before the general election  but the nomination didn't occur until afterward. Why did Presidents  delay until afterward? This probably is a different story in each case.   We see basically a four-month delay with J.Q. Adams. We see it  delayed another 9 months with President Buchanan. There was a delay of  a couple months by Lincoln and 3 months by Eisenhower. One reason might  have been to clear from the heat of the election season. That would be  interesting because that is essentially what Biden referred to when he  said if a vacancy occurred in the heat of the election season in the  summer, we should perhaps wait to act on it until after the election  season is over, until after the election.   John Crittenden was nominated in 1828 by John Quincy Adams. In 1828,  a month after losing his bid for reelection, President Adams nominated  Mr. Crittenden to replace Justice Robert Trimble, who had died in  August from malignant bilious fever. On February 12, the Senate voted  to table his nomination, but they acted. They acted in their advice and  consent role, unlike what happened last year. Although President Adams'  nominee was not confirmed, he did receive a fair shot when the Senate  voted on his nomination on the Senate floor.   Jeremiah Black was nominated in 1961 by President Buchanan. On  February 5, 1861, President Buchanan nominated his Secretary of State,  Jeremiah Black, to fill the seat of Justice Peter Daniel, who had  passed away at the end of May. On February 21, 16 days later, the  Senate rejected Mr. Black's nomination, and they rejected it by a  single vote. They did so not by tabling the nomination but by rejecting  the motion to proceed to the nomination.   There has been a change in Senate rules in regard to that motion to  proceed to a nomination. But again, even though his nomination was  rejected by a single vote, Jeremiah Black still received the treatment  of the Senate. The Senate acted. They considered and they acted.   Salmon Chase in the Lincoln administration, 1864. Chief Justice Roger  Taney passed away October 12, 1864, and 2 months later, on December 6,  1864, after winning his reelection in a landslide, President Lincoln  nominated his Treasury Secretary, Salmon Chase, to fill Chief Justice  Taney's seat. Well, in this case, on the same day he was nominated,  December 6, 1864, the Senate confirmed him and confirmed him by a voice  vote. Well, I don't think we are going to see another Senate or another  Supreme Court nominee confirmed by a voice vote for a very long time to  come.   William Brennan, Jr., was nominated by President Eisenhower in 1956.  On October 15, just 2 weeks before the general election, Justice  Sherman Minton stepped down because of his declining health. On that  very same day, Eisenhower named William Brennan, Jr., as his nominee.  Then on January 14, the recently reelected Eisenhower officially  nominated Justice Brennan to the Supreme Court. First he was nominated  as a recess appointment--another interesting piece of Supreme Court  trivia--but then in January he was renominated as a regular nominee to  be considered by the Senate. The Senate was back in session, and his  nomination--that is, the President's nomination--did face opposition  from the national news. They were worried that, as a Catholic, he might  rely more on religious beliefs than on the Constitution. That is an  interesting conversation that is hard for us to identify with today.   Justice Brennan was opposed by Senator Joseph McCarthy because he  made a speech decrying the overzealous Communist investigations as  ``witch hunts.'' But on March 1957, Justice Brennan was confirmed by  the Senate almost unanimously. The only ``no'' vote was Senator  McCarthy.   Let's take another look at those vacancies that occurred before the  general election where the nomination also occurred before the general  election.   We have William Johnson in 1804, who was nominated by President  Jefferson. On January 26, Justice Alfred Moore had stepped down because  of declining health, and 2 months later, President Jefferson nominated  William Johnson. Two days after that nomination, he was confirmed to  the Senate by a voice vote.   Then we turn to a couple of nominations the Senate considered, but  they rejected them through votes to table the nomination. President  Tyler nominated Edward King in 1844. Justice Henry Baldwin passed away  on April 21, and on June 5, President Tyler nominated Edward King to  fill the seat. But the Senate did deliberate on that nomination and  decided to reject it. They tabled it. Later that year, Tyler  renominated King to fill the vacancy, but the Senate again voted to  table the nomination. They said: What was said before still goes.   Mr. King did not make it to the Supreme Court, but he did have the  opportunity to present his case and have the Senate act on his  nomination, not once but twice.   In 1852 Edward Bradford was nominated by the Fillmore administration.  Edward Bradford was nominated on August 16, about a month after Justice  John McKinley passed away. He too had his nomination tabled by Members  of the Senate--by the full Senate--voting and saying no, but they did  act. They did vote--Melville Fuller under Cleveland. Now we get into a  whole series in which the Senate said yes, not only in reacting but in  ``we think you are qualified to serve on the Court.'' They made it not  just from the advice stage but to the consent stage.    (Mr. SCOTT assumed the chair.)   Justice Morrison Waite passed away in March of 1888, and President  Grover Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to fill the vacancy on April  30. Over the course of his nomination, Fuller faced opposition because  he had avoided military service during the Civil War, and he had tried  to block wartime legislation as a member of the Illinois House of  Representatives.   Those were the flaws that the Senate found as they vetted his  nomination. He did not receive every vote in the Senate, but the Senate  did act. The Senate voted, and they voted 41 to 20, by a 2-to-1 margin.  The Senate looked at his record and said: Yes, it has flaws, but on  balance, it is qualified and appropriate. And they confirmed him.   President Harrison nominated George Shiras in 1892. Earlier in the  year, in January, Justice Joseph Bradley had died, but it was not until  July  [[Page S2240]]  19 that Harrison nominated George Shiras to fill that seat, which was  still before the election. In spite of the 6-month period between the  vacancy and the nomination, Shiras was confirmed, yet again, by a voice  vote in the Senate one week after being nominated.   Now we turn to the 20th century, the 1900s. President Wilson  nominated Brandeis. This seat was open because, in January, Justice  Joseph Lamar had died. Because Brandeis' nomination was bitterly  contested, it became the first time in American history that the Senate  Judiciary Committee had held a public nomination hearing. Today, we  think of the fact that nominations have always gone to the Judiciary  Committee when, in fact, the Senate used to serve as a Committee of the  Whole. The nomination came to the floor and was considered by the  entire Senate--debated by the entire Senate--without there being a  previous committee action, committee hearing. Brandeis was the first  for whom the Judiciary Committee held a hearing. He was denounced by a  number of folks because they argued that he was unfit to serve. There  was, by many people's estimations, a heavy dose of anti-Semitism at  work. Despite that, Justice Brandeis was confirmed by the Senate by a  vote of 47 to 22.   Then we turn to John Clark--also in 1916. Justice Charles Hughes had  resigned from the Court in June of that year in order to run for  President against the sitting President, Woodrow Wilson. He is the only  Supreme Court Justice ever to resign from the Court and run against a  sitting President. In fact, as far as I know, he is, perhaps, the only  one to resign from the Court and run for President at all. A month  later, on July 14, Wilson nominated John Clark to fill the open seat.  On July 24, 10 days later, the Senate confirmed him.   This brings us to Benjamin Cardozo in 1932. Benjamin, prior to  Scalia's dying, was the last of this group of nominees who had the  vacancy occur before the election and the nomination occur before the  election. Benjamin Cardozo was nominated on February 15 by President  Herbert Hoover to replace retiring Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.  Because he was a Democrat who was appointed by a Republican President,  his nomination is considered to be one of the few Supreme Court  appointments in which one could find no trace of partisanship. On  February 24, 9 days after the nomination, Justice Cardozo received a  unanimous voice vote by the Senate.   So there are the 15 times that there has been a vacancy in an  election year, and in all 15 times, there was action by the Senate  until last year. That brings us to 2016 when the vacancy occurred, the  nomination was made, and the Senate chose not to act.   We certainly have entered new territory with this decision to amp up  partisan tactics to pack the Court by stealing a Supreme Court seat. No  one in this Chamber should be comfortable with that. For any of my  colleagues who are feeling comfortable with it, just pause for a moment  and ask yourself: Would you feel comfortable if the parties were  reversed? If this were a Democratic majority stealing a Supreme Court  seat from a Republican President, I ask you: Would you feel comfortable  if the tables were reversed?   I think, probably, every Member on the Republican side of the aisle  would say it would be outrageous if the Democratic majority stole a  seat--a tactic never before used in our history--to deliver it to a  future Democratic President. That would be unacceptable. That is the  ability to walk in someone else's shoes and to look at an issue from  the viewpoint of our obligation to the institution rather than from  simply advancing the desires of the short-term political rewards, if  you will.   For 293 days, no action was taken on the nomination. It was a  complete break with Senate tradition, with Senate precedent, with U.S.  history. There were 16 nominations to fill a Supreme Court seat that  became vacant in an election year, and only one seat was stolen--the  seat that opened up when Antonin Scalia died and Merrick Garland was  nominated.    Among the hastily crafted pretexts for stealing this seat--and I  mentioned this earlier, but I will mention it again--some raised the  so-called ``Biden rule.'' There is no such rule in our rules, and there  is no such speech that presented a rule. There was a speech in which  Vice President Biden said that if there is an open seat, the Senate  might be wise in an election year not to consider it in the heat of the  election. That is simply a statement of respect for the Senate's  ability to be the cooling saucer, to have thoughtful dialogue that  maybe could not take place in the final months of a Presidential  campaign.   I think most of us would say, if we had a nomination and we were  coming together in September or October of an election year to consider  it, maybe it would be better to wait until after the election in  November to be able to have that thoughtful dialogue then. That is  really merited by the importance of a Supreme Court vacancy and  nomination.   Virtually everyone here would agree with the comment that Senator  Biden made, but recognize this: His comment was in the abstract. There  was no open seat. His comment was in the context of a speech in which  he went on to say shortly thereafter, with regard to his theoretical  situation in which he would consult with both sides of the aisle, if  the President were to nominate somebody in the mainstream, he would  probably win his vote, which was conveniently left out by my colleagues  who referred to this.   The idea that we try to depoliticize and thoughtfully consider, which  was the gist of Biden's comment, is one we should all respect. If you  have to go back to a comment that was made in a speech many, many years  ago by one Senator in order to justify the stealing of a Supreme Court  seat and if you ignore history, ignore precedent, and ignore the  Constitution in order to do so, you really know that your argument is  not just on shaky ground, but it has no grounds.   I will read a little bit of what this was all about. These are the  remarks I have that were given back then.   It begins:         Given the unusual rancor that prevailed in the (Clarence)       Thomas nomination, the need for some serious reevaluation of       the nomination and confirmation process and the overall level       of bitterness that sadly affects our political system and       this Presidential campaign already, it is my view that the       prospects for anything but conflagration with respect to a       Supreme Court nomination are remote.        In my view, politics have played far too large a role in       the Reagan-Bush nominations to date. One can only imagine       that role become overarching if choices were made this year,       assuming a Justice announced tomorrow that he or she was       stepping down.        Should a Justice resign this summer . . . actions that will       occur just days before the Democratic Presidential Convention       and weeks before the Republican Convention, it is a process       already in doubt in the minds of many and would be become       distrusted by all. Senate consideration of a nominee under       these circumstances is not fair to the president, to the       nominee, or to the Senate, itself.    There it is. Depoliticize the debate that we are to have. Move that  debate outside of the context of the heat of a campaign.   He went on to say:         President Bush should consider following the practice of       [some] predecessors and not . . . name a nominee until after       the November election is completed.    Get the nominee out of the heat of the political campaign. That was  actually something that we saw in a couple of these nominees. These are  cases in which the vacancies occurred before the elections, and the  Presidents waited until after the elections to name the nominees. That  is the essence of what Biden was referring to: Get the nomination out  of the heat of the campaign.   I do think that you have such an imbalance in this argument to anyone  who opens his eyes to the conversation. You have, on the one side, our  history of 15 vacancies during an election year, when the Senate acted  on all 15 before Antonin Scalia died. On that same side of the scale,  you have our constitutional responsibility to provide advice and  consent. On the other side of the scale, you have a comment by former  Senator Biden, then Vice President Biden, who was saying, actually,  take a nomination out of the heat of political passion for it to be  considered, which is completely consistent with our history.   It is the Constitution and our history versus an out-of-context  comment made by a former Senator, in a theoretical situation, but he  actually did  [[Page S2241]]  not say what folks said he said. It is clear where the weight of this  argument lies. That is what makes it such a transparent transgression  against our Constitution, a transparent transgression against the  integrity of the Senate because the majority leader asked the Senators  not to do their constitutional responsibility to provide advice and  consent, a transgression against the Supreme Court because we now have  a stolen seat and a precedent that will haunt the legitimacy of the  Supreme Court for decades to come should we proceed down this route,  should we continue with this conversation, should we have a vote, and  should we--and I so hope we do not conclude with this theft being fully  accomplished this week. It is such significant damage to everything-- our institutions, the credibility of the Court, our responsibilities.    Well, some have said: Why filibuster? Every time I say ``filibuster''  it gets very confusing because it is hard for people to think--what  does ``filibuster'' mean? Is it speaking at length? Well, yes, it is.  In some historical context, speaking at length has delayed action. It  was the set of speeches when Woodrow Wilson wanted to arm commercial  ships before World War I that prevented the Senate from acting to  approve that. Those speeches were around the clock.   By the way, the term ``filibuster,'' where does it come from? What  does it mean? Well, it is, I guess, an evolution of the word  ``freebooter.'' A freebooter was a pirate, so I guess you could say  piracy. The folks who spoke at length to stop consideration of putting  arms on our commercial ships took over the Senate and didn't let it  act. But that is one way to view it.   Another way of viewing it is that we had the courtesy of hearing  everyone in the original Senate. The Senate got rid of the direct  motion to close debate because they didn't need it, because they wanted  to hear from everyone. It is a tradition of letting everyone be heard  and protecting that tradition.   So now that we have restored this motion to close debate, where the  Senate rules require a supermajority, they were basically saying most  of the time we are going to hear everybody out. It will take the large  bulk of the Senators to close debate. That was used in a very few  circumstances--almost never on a motion to proceed, almost never on an  amendment, and rarely on final passage of a bill because it was  considered that the Senate needs to act. It is a legislative body. On  the other hand, we don't want to have this place be paralyzed.   To use the analogy of George Washington's cooling saucer, he said the  Senate should be a cooling saucer, not a deep freeze. But too often,  the abuse has resulted in the Senate being unable and paralyzed to act.   So here we stand with this concept that it is hard to put your hands  around, and many of us are saying we should not close the debate on  this nominee, if such a debate--if such a vote is held on Thursday, we  should vote against closing debate. In the modern Senate rules, that is  what a filibuster is; you are voting against closing debate. It comes  down to this: 60 Senators have to be supportive for someone to be on  the Supreme Court. That is to protect the integrity of the Court so  that you don't have nominees from the extreme edges. The President,  knowing that the Senate might not have 60 votes for someone from  extremes, is thereby encouraged to produce a nominee that is someone  from the mainstream. That is the power of the supermajority. And having  people from the mainstream of judicial thought sustains the integrity  of the Court in the eyes of the citizens. That is why many of us  believe that we should vote against closing debate.   If we close debate on Thursday--and let me repeat again that this is  the first time in U.S. history that the majority leader has filed a  petition to close debate on the very first day of debate, the first  time another of this stream of incredibly partisan tactics designed to  pack the Court--the first time in U.S. history.   It takes two days before the vote can actually be held. The majority  leader announced to file the petition earlier today, and the vote  cannot be held until Thursday. When that vote is held, there will be at  least 41 Senators who say we should not close debate. In other words,  there will not be a supermajority of 60 necessary to close debate. That  is what I am predicting. That is what my crystal ball says.   Why do I believe that there will not be 60 Senators to vote to close  debate? Well, I will tell you now that I can say that is very likely  because at least 41 Senators have announced that they will vote against  cloture. They have made their announcements.   Turn the clock back to when I first stood up and said: This seat is  stolen, and we should not vote to close debate. We must filibuster,  which means the same thing under the rules of the Senate. I said this  in order to stop the theft of Supreme Court seat-stealing. If this  theft is successful, it will damage the Court forever, and it will  result in not just the integrity of the Court being damaged, but the  different decisions--a different set of decisions because, while we  don't know exactly how Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch would vote on  any individual case, we know from their records that one is straight  down the middle and the other is on the very, very far right from a  list vetted by two rightwing Republican organizations.    So we can ask: Did the President ask the nominee how they would vote  on this case or that case?   Take, for example, the right of a woman to reproductive health that  she feels is correct, keeping the politicians out of the exam room.  Well, what we know is that the nominee before us at this moment came  through a process of rightwing vetting through two organizations before  being put on a list that was sent to the President. So we have a pretty  good idea of how the nominee is going to vote on this issue.   The nominee wouldn't answer any questions before the Judiciary  Committee. It was pretty much what you would call a farce: a question  asked, a question not answered; a question asked, a question not  answered; a question asked, a question not answered.   A number of my colleagues went into that Judiciary Committee hearing  feeling they were really open to hearing the judicial thought and  seeing if this nominee was really as far off the charts as everything  else indicated. And the fact that he refused to answer a question over  a week of hearings basically said to them, yes, now we know; now we  know the answer.   So it is to protect the integrity of the Court that we must not close  this debate on Thursday. That is why we want to insist on keeping the  60-vote standard. That is why the 60-vote standard exists.   There are some who have said: Hey, maybe we should try to figure out  a way that we can preserve the 60-vote standard by not really using it  as a tool for this particular nominee, and by not making it an issue,  we have a tool for their future. It is kind of like coming into a  confrontation and a person has a confrontation and they pull out their  swords, and then say: I am going to lay down this sword and let you  have your way until next time because that way I will still have my  sword when I come back again. So you come back again next time: Oh, I  have to lay down my sword again.   What are they confronting? Why are they saying we should perhaps  consider not honoring the tradition of utilizing the 60 votes when  there is a cloud over a nominee--not utilize the filibuster? There is  this goal of saying: Well, that way maybe we keep the rule as it is.  And why are they worried about that? Because the majority has said that  they will consider changing the rule.   Well, many of us have a message for the majority--a message based on  the way the Senate has acted over hundreds of years. If you don't have  the votes, change the nominee, not the rule. That is the way it has  been done time after time after time. On those 15 occasions when there  was an open seat prior to Antonin Scalia passing away, the Senate  didn't approve every nominee; they rejected several of them, but they  considered every single one. And when they were rejected, they didn't  change the rule; the President changed the nominee. That is what should  happen in this case.   Some have said: Well, we have seen such disrespect for the  Constitution. We have seen the urging of the majority leadership to not  exercise our advice and consent responsibility under the Senate last  year, and they made it happen. They enforced it. We have seen  [[Page S2242]]  the first-ever filing of a cloture petition to close debate on a  Supreme Court nominee on the first day of a Senate debate; it has never  happened before, to ram this through in a way never seen before in U.S.  history. And is it too much to imagine that the Senate majority would  also, instead of following Senate tradition when a nominee doesn't have  the votes and telling the President to change the nominee, would  instead change the rules? Yes, it is possible, when you look at that.  But that is a decision that we can't control on our side.   When we looked at the tremendous obstruction that was being used for  executive nominations and lower court nominations, we had to find a way  to quit having advice and consent being used as a tool of legislative  destruction against the other branches of government.   Our whole Constitution was founded on three coequal branches of  government, but you can't have three coequal branches if one branch  wields a tool--a tool that was intended to be used very rarely--of  rejecting nominees when nominees weren't suitable, using it as a  wholesale power to destroy the executive branch and undermine the  judiciary. So we addressed that in 2013, but we left in place the  supermajority for the Supreme Court. In some ways, you can think of the  fact that, well, we tolerate a wide range of positions coming out of  the lower courts. There is a check and balance there. It is called the  Supreme Court. But there is no check to the Supreme Court. They are the  final decision maker. That is why you leave in place the supermajority  requirement to tell a President: Do not nominate from the extremes.   We have a President who likes to, well, I would say run counter to  tradition. So that is maybe part of the appeal and why he is in the  office. He looked at the power of the Senate, and we don't know if he  even actually understood any of the background as to why we had a  supermajority to close debate, why we had a 60-vote requirement. He  said that he didn't care; he was going to nominate from the extreme  anyway. And having nominated from the extreme, now the same groups that  want extreme rulings for the powerful and the privileged are pushing  tremendously hard, just as they did last year, for the majority to  steal the seat in the first place.   But aren't we 100 individuals who could possibly set aside those  tremendous pressures from those powerful dark-money interests and  actually do the right thing for the Constitution and the Senate and the  Supreme Court? Don't we have the ability, the soul, the insight to  defend this institution at this moment? What everyone here must  understand is that when people look back--if the decision this week is  to destroy the 60-vote requirement that tempers the nominations to the  final decider about what our Constitution needs--this is stripping away  a key element in protecting the integrity of the Court, and it will be  looked on as a very, very dark moment in which the Senate failed in its  responsibility.   Let us not fail. Let's have some Senators who will remember that they  stood up on that podium and they took an oath of office, and that had  to do with advice and consent which was violated last year. Embedded in  that was the responsibility to protect this institution and the rest of  the other two branches of government, so they could function in a way  our Founders intended them to.   I know that come Thursday, if there is a motion to change the  interpretation of the rule--the way this works is that the majority  won't actually change the rule. They will change the interpretation of  the rule. For all practical purposes, it is basically the same thing.  At that moment, we are going to be put to the test.   The reason it is called the nuclear option is because changing a  rule--a basic function of the Senate, designed to protect the integrity  of the Supreme Court--and undermining and damaging the integrity is  like blowing up the institution. That is why it is nuclear. It is the  big bomb. It is the most destructive weapon known in the legislative  arsenal.   There will be some Members, I know, who will hesitate, some from the  viewpoint that they have a responsibility to protect the institution.  There will be others who will hesitate from political expediency. They  will say: Yes, this is a pretty good deal to get the justice in place  that our backers want. But on the other hand, the shoe might be on the  other foot in 4 years. There may be a Democratic President, and maybe  that President gets three nominations. If we blow up this rule, there  will be nothing to temper the type of appointment made by that future  President. That is something I am sure people will consider.   Apart from the out-of-context, standing-on-its-head example from Vice  President Biden's speech, the other argument was: Well, let's let the  American citizens decide. That was the second excuse for stealing the  seat. Well, the people did speak. They spoke when they elected Barack  Obama in the first election, and they spoke again when they elected him  for the second election. They didn't elect him to serve 3 years out of  4, but to serve 4 years out of 4. They didn't elect him to execute his  constitutional responsibilities 3 years out of 4. They elected him to  serve his responsibilities, including nomination responsibilities, for  4 out of 4. He won that second term by a margin of over 5 million  votes. That is a big margin. President Trump lost the citizens' vote by  a margin of over 3 million votes. That is a pretty big disparity. It is  an 8 million vote disparity between Obama's victory and Trump's loss of  the citizen vote. So if we want to have the people have a voice, they  have weighed clearly and President Obama considered his nominee. As to  the fact that they wanted the people to weigh in, they weighed in and  said they trusted Hillary Clinton more than Donald Trump to execute the  responsibilities of office. That is the citizen vote by more than 3  million.   When the President campaigned, he said: I am going to drain the  swamp, I am going to take on Wall Street, and I am going to help out  workers. We have seen quite the opposite. The very first action he  made--the very first action--was to make it $500 a year more expensive  for families of modest means to buy a house. How does that possibly fit  with fighting for working Americans? How does that possibly fit with  that?   Then he put forward a plan on healthcare--TrumpCare--in partnership  with Ryan. Ryan wants it to be called TrumpCare; Trump wants it to be  called RyanCare. Neither one wants their name on it because it takes  away healthcare from 24 million Americans. It makes healthcare out of  reach for working Americans. That certainly wasn't fighting for working  Americans, stripping healthcare. It is, basically, a weapon that hurts  in two ways: If you don't have access to healthcare, you are worried  that your loved one won't get the care they need. Then you are worried  that if you do find access by basically paying much higher rates than  anyone with insurance has, you will be bankrupt, and America had this  vast number of bankruptcies.   So Trump, who campaigned on helping workers, said: I am going to  strip away your healthcare. I am going to take away your peace of mind  that your loved one will get care. We are going to return to a world  where, if you do find care, you will be bankrupt. How do you like that  plate of potatoes? Working America didn't like it. They called Capitol  Hill and said: Stop this diabolical plan to undermine healthcare. Stop  this plan. They said it on phone calls, they said it on emails, they  said it at the townhalls, and the House abandoned the plan due to the  outcry of workers across America who had finally--finally--found access  to healthcare, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.   Then President Trump sends his anti-worker budget--what they called  the skinny budget, the outline of the budget--over here to Capitol  Hill. I was out doing townhalls in rural Oregon, and I think I got much  the same reaction that probably everyone else did across the Nation.  This wasn't America first. This was rural America last, including rural  workers--especially rural workers.   The President campaigned for workers. He makes buying a home more  expensive. He tries to strip away their healthcare, and, then, he hits  them with a budget in rural America that will devastate their  communities. You have a challenge with affordable housing? I am going  to take away a good share of the housing grants used as a  [[Page S2243]]  flexible tool. You have other challenges in your community that you use  community development block grants for. We are going to strip those as  well.    Your rural county has a lot of Federal land? This is probably more  true in the West, where I come from, than in many other States. Your  rural county has a lot of Federal land so you are compensated through  Payment in Lieu of Taxes, the PILT Program? I am going to devastate  that program.   Your rural community has essential air service? Well, we don't need  that. Let's take that away. We don't need air service in rural America.   It made me think about the airport in Klamath Falls, in my home  State. Klamath Falls is not on an interstate. I-5 goes down through  Medford and goes through Ashland. So it travels further west, on into  California, not through Klamath Falls.   We have some very substantial manufacturing capability in Klamath  Falls. We have an F-15 base. Both of those are essential to the  community. But to keep that manufacturing there, to keep those  companies there, to keep that airbase there, we have to have a  functioning airport. The company that was servicing that town stopped,  moved their assets somewhere else, and left that town stranded.   I immediately called the mayor and called the House Member  representing that district and said: We have to get air service back.  The managers of the manufacturing capability in doors and windows are  not going to want to have their operation in a place they can't fly  into. Flying into Medford and driving a dangerous, winding mountain  road for well over an hour--often impassable or very dangerous in  winter--is not going to cut it. We have to restore that air service. We  went to work and we teamed up. We teamed up with colleagues across the  aisle. Why did we undertake this? Because air service was essential to  that economy. So here is President Trump, sending a ``rural America  last'' budget which devastates rural air.   Let's talk about the Coast Guard. Oregon is a coastal State. My  colleague presiding is from a coastal State. Our Coast Guard is pretty  important to our States. But President Trump said: Let's savage the  Coast Guard. Here is the thing. The Coast Guard actually stops a lot of  bad things from happening along our coastlines. They save lives, and  they stop drug traffickers. Ere is Trump's anti-worker budget: Let's  take away the wall along the ocean--the Coast Guard--which stops drugs  and other bad things from happening, and rescues people, and spend it  on a wall on the southern border. What? I thought, Mr. President, you  said the wall on the southern border was going to be paid for by some  other country--that country on the southern side of the border, not the  American taxpayers. You are going to essentially take away that virtual  wall of defense along our coastlines in order to build this wall on the  southern border?   I went down on a congressional delegation to meet with Mexican  officials in Mexico City. We met with the Attorney General. We met with  the head of their economic policy. We met with a whole group of Mexican  senators, and we heard a lot. But what I found even more interesting  was going to the border on the American side and talking to the  American experts on the border. We asked them: How do drugs come across  the border?   They said: Well, they come through freight. There is so much freight  moving. You can tuck drugs into a freight truck. We find some of them  but not most of them.   They said: Second of all, it comes across in tunnels. The tunnels are  very expensive to build. They are often very long, well-engineered, and  very expensive. You don't use them for people because they would be  easily detected then and shut down and you would lose your investment.  You use them to bring drugs into the country.   The point the border experts made is that the wall will be useless  against stopping drugs from coming into our country because the drugs  come through freight and they come through tunnels, but they don't come  through backpacks. OK. That was interesting for the President to argue  that was something he was going to address, to stop this massive inflow  of people coming from Mexico to the United States. We looked at  statistics, and it turns out that over the last 8 years, the net flow  has been out of our country to Mexico, not into our country from  Mexico--by a million people.    So that is really a situation where you have the triple threat  against workers that President Trump is applying--making home ownership  more expensive, proceeding to take healthcare away from millions of  American families, and putting forward a budget that savages rural  America in method after method after method. I am sure my colleagues  will work on both sides of the aisle to stop the savaging of rural  America, but clearly that is the President's vision. That was the  worker part.   Then you had the ``I am going to take on Wall Street'' part. What did  he do? He put the economy under the control of Wall Street. He had  attacked a colleague here in the Senate from Texas during the primary  campaign for his ties to Goldman Sachs. He attacked his general  election opponent, Hillary Clinton, for ties to Goldman Sachs. Then he  puts Goldman Sachs in charge of our economy, Treasury Secretary,  strategic adviser. The list goes on and on. So much for taking on Wall  Street.   Then there is the ``drain the swamp'' proposition. Well, big,  powerful, fabulously rich folks deeply connected to those interests-- that is the Cabinet. So you have Big Oil and big banks and  billionaires. That is the Cabinet. That is the swamp Cabinet.   So all three promises the President made, after he lost by 3 million  votes, he has gone on to devastate over the last few months. That is  the foundation for saying ``Let the people speak''? The people spoke  against--they voted majority against this President. They voted vastly  for the election of Barack Obama, and the vacancy occurred on Obama's  watch. This is a seat stolen from one Presidency and shipped to another  with the packing the Court and a flimsy excuse from a quote from Biden  taken out of context, a flimsy excuse of ``Let the people speak.'' When  the people spoke, they supported President Obama by this vast number of  popular vote. And Trump lost. So I guess the people did speak, but they  spoke to the opposite side. So much for the foundation for this crime  against our Constitution.   Speaking of the President, it is unacceptable that we are considering  this nomination at this moment. At this moment, when the Trump campaign  is under investigation--an investigation being conducted by the FBI,  another investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, and another  investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee--it is unacceptable  that we are considering this nomination at this moment when there is a  cloud over the Presidency because of the conduct during the campaign.   We know some things, and we don't know others. We know that Russia  sought to influence the U.S. election. We know they used an  extraordinarily intense, carefully crafted strategy to influence the  American election. What we don't know is the full extent of the  conversations between the Trump campaign and the Russians who sought to  get Trump elected. We don't know that. That is why we are having  investigations.   If those investigations find that there was collaboration between the  Trump campaign and the Russian Government, that is traitorous conduct-- conspiring with an enemy to attack the institution at the foundation of  our democratic republic, our elections. That is a very big deal, and  that is why this debate should not be here on the Senate floor until  that issue is fully addressed. We should not have the sitting  President's nominee debated with the potential of being put on the  Supreme Court when many questions remain about whether they conspired  with a foreign government to undermine and tip the election we held in  November.   Then there is the fact that the nominee is an extreme far-right  nominee, even further right than Justice Scalia or Justice Thomas.   Analyzing the opinions of the Tenth Circuit since Judge Gorsuch  joined in 2006, the Washington Post found that Gorsuch's actual voting  behavior suggests that he is to the right of both Alito and Thomas, and  by a substantial margin. The magnitude of the gap between Gorsuch and  Thomas is roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and  Justice Kennedy during  [[Page S2244]]  the same time. In fact, our results suggest that Gorsuch and Justice  Scalia would be as far apart as Justices Breyer and Chief Justice  Roberts.   Gorsuch has advocated far-right conservative positions--not ``we the  people'' positions, ``we the powerful'' over the people positions-- positions even Scalia has opposed.   This nomination matters. Are we going to have decisions that reflect  our Constitution, ``we the people'' decisions, or decisions that turn  our Constitution on its head and create a government of, by, and for  the powerful? We have a 4-4 split--the analysis of decisions to concede  the twin peaks. Decades ago, we would have probably seen a single bell  curve, not twin peaks, but what used to be here has migrated. Half of  the Court migrated over there, as the Court has gotten further and  further away from the fundamental vision of the five-vote majority. The  Court now, without Scalia, is split 4 to 4, so this nominee will change  the balance of the Court.   There is certainly an opportunity to put in somebody who is straight  down the middle. We didn't really know exactly where Justice Merrick  Garland would end up, and by all counts, it was anticipated he would be  right down the middle. We know something different about Neil Gorsuch.  The Court is split 4 to 4 now, and this nomination will change that  balance. That is a very important reason that accentuates why this  nomination should be set aside until we know if the President's team  conspired with the Russians. We should clear up that cloud first.   I am going to go back and review some of the cases that give us  substantial concern. I am going to try to locate more details.  Meanwhile, I will just share a little bit about the record of 5-to-4  decisions.   Senator Whitehouse has proceeded to do an analysis--or shared an  analysis done by others--to look at 5-to-4 decisions of the Court and  what has happened in recent memory. Were those decisions designed to  accentuate the ability of powerful special interests that changed the  makeup of the body? Was it that sort of interference? Was it  interference that favored corporations or decisions that favored  corporations over people? If I can get the details, I will go through  it in detail.   What this analysis found was that the previous decisions of the Court  with Scalia on it made campaign finance decisions and other decisions  related to things like the Voting Rights Act that made it harder to  have the elections that really reflected the voice of the people.   Let me give some context. The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965.  It was passed because different groups around America were messing with  the elections to try to keep people from voting. There were elements of  this that went way back in our history. There were tests that were  applied, constitutional tests. African Americans might try to seek to  register to vote and would be given a test that was an impossible  question to answer. The same test would be given to White voters. There  were all sorts of strategies to try to bias the election process.   So it was a big deal in 1965, and the Senate and the House said: No,  we are not going to allow these types of tactics to be developed and  utilized because they are an attack on the rights of Americans--the  fundamental right to vote, to have a voice, and to help direct the  direction of our country by campaigning and voting for those who have a  better vision of where we are going to go.   So Congress acted and did so by saying: If you have new strategies  for how you are going to control the elections, you are going to have  to get those strategies preapproved because the record in your  particular State has been that you abused those strategies to suppress  the fundamental right of individuals to vote.   So one of those decisions was to say by a 5-to-4 decision: We are  going to take away the power of the Voting Rights Act--which is almost  unexplainable. The argument was more or less a version of, we don't  need this anymore. We moved past that. We don't have the same problem.  So we should have the same rules for all the States.   But what we immediately saw with the lifting of the Voting Rights Act  was that those States that were under the Voting Rights Act immediately  started working to do voter-suppression tactics--efforts to prevent  individuals from voting in all kinds of ways--phony ID strategies, all  sorts of manipulation of the precincts.   (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)   So it matters. The fifth seat on the Court matters a great deal. We  have six decisions that have flooded the elections with special  interest money and affected access to the ballot. In these 5-to-4  decisions, the people have lost in all six cases. So I am going to  share those. Then there are 16 cases in which there have been 5-to-4  decisions. In all 16, the 5-to-4 Court ruled in favor of the  corporations over the people. So in terms of campaign shenanigans, we  have lost in 5-to-4 decisions 6 to 0. When I say ``we,'' I am talking  about the American people who care about the integrity of elections  have lost all six times under the Court that Scalia was on. On  corporations over people, we have lost 16 to 0. I will start sharing  these cases to show how much this matters.    Let's look at the issue of unleashing corporate spending. Citizens  United v. the FEC in 2010. Under the First Amendment, donations and  political contributions are considered free speech. The government does  not have the right to keep corporations from spending money on  political candidates. Money may not be given directly to candidates but  instead may be spent on any other means necessary to persuade the  public.   The decision held that political speech is crucial to a democracy and  that it is equally as important when coming from corporations. So it  essentially said: Look, if we translate that, what that means is that  you have a group who was designed to take small amounts of investments  from many, many people and combine them together to create the ability  to take on larger commercial enterprises. That is a corporation. They  sell shares. People provide funds through those shares. They provide  those funds to the corporation by buying the shares, and the  corporation can take on the big projects.   Out of those sometimes hundreds of thousands of shareholders, there  is a small group, a board who decides how that money is spent. So you  don't have the shareholders deciding how that money is spent; you have  the small board. They aren't spending their own money; they are  spending other people's money without asking their permission.   Are you kidding me? This entity didn't exist in this form. The  Constitution didn't say that corporations are people and that these  entities that really didn't even exist then have the same rights of  ``free speech.'' The Constitution didn't say money is speech. No.  Remember Jefferson's mother principle, which was that we will only make  decisions and be successful as a democratic republic if each citizen  has its equal voice. Citizens United is the opposite. It says: Those  who sit on the board of gazillion-dollar corporations get a voice that  is a gazillion times larger than the voice of an ordinary citizen. It  is a complete contravention of the Constitution, and it is deeply  corrupting and damaging our Nation. That is the 5-to-4 Citizens United  case.   Then there was the American Tradition Partnership v. Bullock case in  2012. That overturned a Montana Supreme Court decision that banned  corporations from spending money on political candidates and campaigns  and found that political speech is protected regardless of the source,  even when it comes from a corporation. In other words, Citizens United  applies to this case as well.   The four dissenting judges did not believe that the Court was ready  to review the same issues as discussed in Citizens United in spite of  the fact that Montana's Supreme Court had noted the extreme power of  corporations in politics.   OK, what is the story behind this? Montana was controlled by the  copper kings. Back about 100 years ago, the people said: Enough. We  want Montana to be controlled by the people of Montana, not by this  vast concentration of special interest money that is making all the  decisions.   So they passed a law, and they kept corporate money out of their  elections to restore the integrity of elections. The Supreme Court  turned a deaf ear on that case.  [[Page S2245]]    How about McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission in 2014, which  eliminated aggregate campaign limits. The decision found that aggregate  campaign limits are invalid under the First Amendment because they  restrict political expression. Aggregate limits do not further the  government's interest in preventing the appearance of corruption--one  of the main goals under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.   They also found that corporations cannot be limited in the number of  political candidates they donate to, as this restricts the influence of  the corporations which they were equating to free speech.   So this was another erosion of the effort to have the vision  Jefferson spoke to, the mother's principle that the government would  express the will of the people. That is the same basic idea that  Lincoln had when he phrased it in his famous address and said  ``government of the people, by the people, for the people.'' But if you  allow this vast concentration of money to be spent on campaigns to  corrupt those campaigns, it is not government of, by, and for the  people. It is like the copper kings. It is the fossil fuel kings. It is  the Koch brothers running it.   In the Copper King case in the State of Montana, which Montana  shrugged off and reclaimed and restored their government--versus the  situation we have at the national level now with a similar parallel-- the fossil fuel kings, the coal kings, the oil kings putting vast sums  in--to Citizens United.   There was a case that had to do with whether laws were OK that  restricted judicial candidates from directly soliciting donations for  their campaign. My memory is that the Court said: You know what, it is  OK to restrict judges who are directly soliciting donations because  that would affect and bias their decisions and it would create the  appearance of bias. So there was the reality of bias and the perception  of bias. In other words, it would corrupt the courts.   So on an issue involving Justices, that ``we the powerful'' group-- Roberts, Alito, Thomas, Scalia, Kennedy--that group said: Do you know  what? No. No, we can't let money corrupt the election of judges.   But none of them have served in the Senate or the House, and they  couldn't translate the fact that they wanted to defend the integrity of  judges and that that was important under the Constitution and allow  restrictions on how campaigns were done--they couldn't translate that  to the bias and the corruption of what happens here.    I mean, anyone looking at the United States can see that a few years  ago, we had a whole host of Republican environmentalists who cared  about the next generation and the generation after and fought for clean  air and fought for clean water. It was President Nixon who put forward  the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. It was President Nixon and  the Republicans who proceeded to create the Environmental Protection  Agency.   But what happened when the fossil fuel money fueled the campaigns  that created the new Republican majority in the Senate? All concern for  the environment was gone. That is corruption, plain and simple.   The Supreme Court--five Justices--proceeded to rubberstamp that it is  OK to have that corruption--the complete opposite of the vision of our  Constitution. They understood it when it was for judges, but they found  for the powerful and the privileged and supported the corruption when  it came to this body and the House.   Then there is the suppression of access to the ballot box. The Shelby  County v. Holder decision of 2013 struck down section 4 of the Voting  Rights Act, which included a suspension on many of the prerequisites or  tests to vote. The Court held that this part of the Voting Rights Act  no longer reflects the current conditions of voting. The formulae for  determining whether a State can change its voting laws should no longer  be federally reviewed, the Court said.   The decision declares that this section puts undue burden on local  government during elections. Really? We saw how the fundamental right  of citizens to vote was savaged in these States before the Voting  Rights Act, and we have seen how those practices have returned after  the Supreme Court struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. That  is why it matters.   Let's take a look at Bartlett v. Strickland in 2009, a case that  affirmed the North Carolina Supreme Court decision that the State's  redistricting plan does not violate the Voting Rights Act section 2.  State officials do not have to ensure that minority voters have the  opportunity to join with crossover voters to elect a minority  candidate.   In this case, the Court found that the vote would not be diluted  because the minority was comprised of less than 50 percent of the  voting population. Due to the fact that the African-American minority  was only 39 percent on the voting population, State officials had no  requirement to redraw district lines.   What are we talking about here in real terms? Is gerrymandering OK to  change the outcome of the congressional delegation? And the Court said  it is OK.   Then there was Vieth v. Jubelirer--redistricting of a Pennsylvania  congressional delegation from a Republican-controlled State legislature  to favor Republican congressional elections. The Pennsylvania General  Assembly was challenged by Vieth--that is the name of the challenger-- that the redrawing of the lines was political gerrymandering, violating  Article I and the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment.   The opinion of the lower courts was affirmed, and Scalia wrote the  four-member plurality which dismissed the case due to the fact that the  Justices could not agree on an appropriate remedy for political  gerrymandering. Scalia wrote the four-member plurality. Kennedy wrote a  concurring opinion--so it is 5-to-4--but sought a narrow ruling so that  the Court would still seek a solution.   Well, the bottom line is that in a 5-to-4 Court, that fifth vote  matters. In these six cases, the decisions were all in favor of undoing  the vision of voter empowerment and supporting the strategy of voter  suppression, undoing the restrictions on gerrymandering to change the  makeup of the congressional delegation or the makeup of State  delegations and supporting such bias being written into the system.   These 5-to-4 decisions were all about allowing the most powerful,  richest people to have a voice equivalent to a stadium sound system  that drowns out the people in a position completely contrary to the  equal-voice premise that Jefferson called the mother's provision, the  foundation for whether or not our government would be able to make  decisions that reflected the will of the people.   Then there is a set of decisions 5-to-4 opinions that were relevant  to corporations over individual rights, and some of those overlap:  Citizens United, McCutcheon, the American Tradition Partnership v.  Bullock that we have already covered. Let's look at some of the others.   How about Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. Fighting to require corporations to  provide female employees free access to contraceptives violates the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Court held that Congress  intended RFRA to be applied to corporations. Corporations face a  significant burden if they are forced to fund an action that goes  against the corporation's religious beliefs. So let's give corporations  a soul that has a religious belief. So not only has the Court extended  the vision to corporations that they are somehow the equivalent to a  super-rich bazillionaire individual, but they also have a soul and a  religious belief. So concentrating this fantastic concentration of  power and realizing that if the corporation made the decisions on the  basis of the stockholders, with all of them having, essentially,  input--but they don't because that is not the way a corporation works.  You have a very difficult time trying to influence the thinking of a  board of directors. You can make efforts. Rarely you might have a  successful vote by a group of shareholders who take something to the  annual meeting. But in general, that board operates in a world all its  own, and they are spending the money--not their own money; they are  spending the money of the stockholders without disclosing it to them.  They actually steal the political speech by using the money in  political speech without disclosing what it is. But that was the  decision in Burwell  [[Page S2246]]  which gave a corporation the ability to follow its religious choices-- that is, the board's religious choices--over the workers' religious  choices in an area as sensitive as women's access to reproductive birth  control.    Let's turn to Walmart v. Duke in 2011, a class action lawsuit brought  by six women against Walmart claiming that Walmart policies resulted in  lower pay and longer time for women to acquire a promotion--lower pay  and longer time to get a promotion.   The Supreme Court found that the six women who were applying could  not represent a class of the 1.5 million women employed by Walmart.  They found that the employment decisions for this large number of  people did not have enough commonality to be represented in one case--a  5-to-4 decision.   In a class action lawsuit, you have principals, and they represent a  class of folks who have been treated similarly. Certainly this is an  example of where in general you would expect that the experience these  women had could represent the experience that women were getting at  Walmart as employees, but the Court turned them down 5-to-4. Four said  these women and other like-treated individuals deserve a hearing, and  the majority of five said: No, no, no, let's protect Walmart.   Let's look at American Express Company v. Italian Colors Restaurant.  Several merchants of the American Express credit card company brought  individual cases alleging that the company's card acceptance agreements  violate antitrust laws. The Supreme Court found that the American  Express clause prohibiting class action lawsuits is enforceable. The  high cost of bringing cases forward on an individual basis, which is  impossible for an individual to do, was not a sufficient reason for the  Court to override the company. Federal antitrust law does not guarantee  a cost-effective process.   So here you have a 5-to-4 decision in which, again, you have  individuals who have been on the receiving end of bad practices or at  least alleged bad practices by a financial company saying: We were  shorted a few dollars or maybe a few hundred dollars, but we can't  possibly take on this powerful company's enormous office building full  of lawyers unless we have a class action where we have everyone who has  been similarly affected able to bring their case at one time, with one  set of representatives, so that maybe there will be a little bit of a  fair playing field.   You can't hire lawyers. It will cost you $1 million to hire lawyers  to pursue a $100 issue. So unless there is a class action, there is no  justice. It is justice denied and a green path for predatory practices  by the large and powerful. Five-to-four decisions matter.   Comcast Corporation v. Behrend. SCOTUS ruled that a district court is  not allowed to certify a class action lawsuit without acceptable  evidence that the damages can be measured on a class-wide basis. They  found that the lower court failed to properly establish the impact of  the damages on all of the plaintiffs. Courts must find that the model  to prove damages are class-wide and quantifiable.   Let's translate this. What does this mean? The Court, on a 5-to-4  basis, is setting very high standards for establishing the legitimacy  of a class action lawsuit. You have to be able to prove that the entire  class is affected, not just probably, and it is quantifiable. So they  are making it very difficult.   Four Justices said: No, that is ridiculous. That is absurd. That is a  standard that makes no sense. But the five ruling for the powerful and  privileged said: OK, we can tighten this up and make it harder to  challenge predatory actions by large corporations.   We have AT&T v. Concepcion. Customers of AT&T brought a class action  claiming that the company's offer of a free phone was a scam because  they were still charged the sales tax on the new phone. It wasn't free;  they had to pay a tax.   SCOTUS found that the Federal Arbitration Act displaces State law  stopping companies from offering contracts that do not allow class  action lawsuits. Therefore States cannot make laws that allow companies  to prohibit their customers from bringing forward class actions. But  the bottom line is that the way this was framed, it had an impact of a  5-to-4 decision with corporations over people.   Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative Traders in 2011.   Most folks didn't even know there were these many cases affecting  powerful corporations and their predatory practices and the ability of  ordinary people to take them on, but here they are one after another.   Janus Capital Group created Janus Capital Management as a separate  entity from Janus Capital. The plaintiffs claimed that JCG should be  held liable for misleading statements by JCM regarding various funds,  most notably the market timing of the fund's practice of rapidly  trading in and out of a mutual fund to take advantage of inefficiency  in the way the funds are valued.    This was not permitted. The Fourth Circuit Court found in favor of  the plaintiffs because the investors would have inferred that even if  JCM had not itself written the alleged statements, JCM must have  approved the statements. After all, JCM was created by JCG. But SCOTUS  reversed the circuit court's finding that the false statements were  made.   So each of these cases involved efforts to tighten or narrow the  channel through which ordinary people can challenge the conduct of the  powerful. The powerful can use a series of strategies--in this case,  creating a subsidiary--to bypass responsibility for misleading  statements.   Ashcroft v. Iqbal in 2009. The case concerns the arrest and  subsequent treatment of Javaid Iqbal at the Metropolitan Detention  Center in Brooklyn, NY. Iqbal and several thousand other Arab Muslim  men were arrested as a part of the investigation into the then recent  September 11 terrorist attacks. Upon his release, Iqbal brought suit  alleging discrimination and 21 constitutional rights violations by the  Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, and FBI. The defendant argued  that their official government roles protected them from suit.   The U.S. district court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss-- that is, protected the ability of the suit to be brought--and supported  their qualified immunity defense. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Second Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling with one exception:  They ruled that under the defendant's qualified immunity defense, it  was not a violation of due process given the context of the terrorist  attacks' unique circumstances. The Supreme Court then upheld the  finding of the Second Circuit.   Again, each case is a narrowing and a finding of individual against a  corporation or a larger entity in a 5-to-4 decision.   These cases--I don't think I will go through all of these remaining  six cases, but I think you get the general idea. The bottom line: In 5- to-4 opinions, corporations won 16 times and ordinary people won zero  times.   So I want to go back to the fact that Gorsuch himself is an extreme  judge, and I think it is important to talk about the cases he was  involved in directly. What I have just been laying out is that a 5-to-4  Court makes an enormous difference. Is the Court going to look for  every possible way to deny the opportunity for ordinary citizens to  take on the powerful and the powerful to get away with predatory  practices, or are they going to honor the vision of government of, by,  and for the people? That is the fundamental question in a 5-to-4 Court.  And Gorsuch fits right into that because the vision of honoring the  ability of people to take on the powerful in a system of justice versus  a system that perpetrates injustice by allowing the powerful to get  away with predatory practices against ordinary people and constrains  the right of individuals and expands the rights of corporations--that  turns corporations into predator superhumans with more money than any  one individual and more power than any one individual and more campaign  cash than any one individual. In fact, a corporation will often have  more cash to be spent in a campaign than the rest of America--perhaps  the entire rest of America put together.   When the Koch brothers said in January 2015 that they were going to  spend nearly $1 billion in the next election, do you think there were  many Americans who said: Well, well, I can do that. No. That would  represent the political spending by virtually all the rest of America.  That is the challenge of the concentration of power in our country.  [[Page S2247]]    We have seen that there are a whole series of cases that allow  gerrymandering and voter suppression and campaign spending and dark  money designed to corrupt the ``we the people'' elections, the  foundation of our democratic Republic. We saw a whole series of cases  that involve finding for the powerful corporations in restricting the  rights of people to band together to challenge them through class  action lawsuits. That is the difference between these two parts of the  judicial decisions, and Neil Gorsuch is way to the right.   So let's look at the preamble to our Constitution: ``We the People of  the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish  justice''--those are the next words, ``establish justice.'' What kind  of justice is there if the Court continuously allows the corruption of  our elections? What kind of justice is there if the Court continually  restricts the power of ordinary people to bring a case against a  predatory practice of a powerful institution? That is the question.   Our Constitution that starts out with those three beautiful words  that I quoted many times tonight, ``We the People,'' also has a vision  of establishing justice. How is it that this group of Justices has  forgotten that our Constitution was about establishing justice? Well,  that is a big concern.   However, what we find is that Neil Gorsuch is coming to his court  decisions and to his writing from a viewpoint of how to arrange the  details to help the powerful come out on top.   (Mr. STRANGE assumed the Chair.)   Let's look at the frozen trucker case. Anphonse Maddin was  transporting cargo through Illinois when the brakes on his trailer  froze because of subzero temperatures. Maddin did the responsible  thing: He didn't move the trailer anymore because without brakes, he  would have been endangering the lives of everyone on the road. So to  protect others, he refused to operate the truck. After reporting the  problem to the company, he waited 3 hours in freezing temperatures for  a repair truck to arrive. He could not even wait in the cab of his  truck to keep warm because the auxiliary power unit was broken.    After waiting 3 hours in subzero temperatures, his torso went numb,  and he began having difficulty breathing. He could not feel his feet.  He felt his life was at risk. He unhitched the disabled trailer with  its frozen brakes because he thought it was absolutely dangerous to  drive with a full load without brakes, and he drove the cab to a place  where he could get warm.   Even as he was driving away, even after he had reported his numbness  and difficulty breathing, the company was still radioing Alphonse  Maddin to wait in the dangerous, frigid condition or to drive with a  full load and frozen brakes. The company wanted him to drive with  frozen brakes. The company wanted him to drive in those temperatures,  with ice on the road, and with a full load. Help arrived about 15  minutes after Maddin made the decision to leave. As soon as he heard  that, he turned around, and he returned to the trailer, but TransAm  Trucking fired him for leaving the trailer unattended.   The argument that TransAm Trucking had used for firing Alphonse  Maddin was, instead of remaining in the dangerous, freezing conditions  and refusing to drive because of there being a disabled trailer, he  drove away without the disabled trailer. In the company's mind, Maddin  had two choices: one, freeze to death or, two, drive the disabled  vehicle with the frozen brakes and trailer attached, putting other  people's lives at risk. He had two choices: Put his own life at risk or  put everyone's life at risk.   The Department of Labor looked at this and said that the truckdriver  was fired in violation of the Surface Transportation Act's protections  and that he should be reinstated with back pay.   The case made its way up to the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit  said: Absolutely, the law is written so that truckdrivers will not  operate under dangerous conditions in order to protect their safety and  the safety of the public. That is the way the law is set. The Tenth  Circuit said: Yes, that is the way the law is set. That is what is  written in the law.   Judge Gorsuch wrote a dissent. He twisted and strained the statute.  He wanted to find ways to minimize the word ``health'' and the word  ``safety'' and stated that the finding for the driver was improper  because it used the law as a springboard to combat all perceived evils,  which is a quote: ``as a sort of springboard to combat all perceived  evils.''   No, the law was designed to protect against a specific evil, which is  people operating vehicles in a manner that endanger themselves or  others. You cannot be fired as a truckdriver for operating a vehicle in  order to protect the lives of others. The truckdriver, who was  operating responsibly--Alphonse Maddin, who was operating responsibly-- said: I am not going to endanger others.   He was fired for it. The Department of Labor said: No, you cannot  fire him. That is why the law is written that way. The Tenth Circuit  said: No, you cannot fire him. That is why the law is written that way.  Yet Neil Gorsuch found some way of twisting the words to say: Huh,  let's find a way to make this work for the corporation rather than the  individual.   Even the law says that you are protected from being fired for  refusing to operate a truck that endangers yourself or others. Even the  law says that. Let's find a way to go the other direction and find on  the side of the company.   Gorsuch wrote that his employer gave him the very option the statute  it must. Once he voiced safety concerns, TransAm expressly permitted  him to sit right where he was and wait for help. They gave him two  choices: Sit and freeze in the cab, even though his torso had gone numb  and at his own risk to his own health, or drive the trailer and  endanger everybody's life--a lose-lose proposition. Gorsuch ignored the  side of the statute that involved the safety of the driver as well as  of the people.   He dismissed the Department of Labor's view in saying that there is  simply no law that anyone has pointed to us giving employees the right  to operate their vehicles in ways their employers forbid.   Yes, there is. The law says that you cannot fire someone for driving  or for refusing to operate a vehicle in a manner that endangers other  people's lives.   The majority of the court that supported the Labor Department's  reasoning called Gorsuch's reasoning ``curious.'' That is the polite  way of saying that we have no idea how he could possibly have twisted  the law in this fashion. If Gorsuch had gotten his way, there would  have been no justice for Alphonse Maddin--a pure decision of the frozen  trucker, a decision devoid of common sense, totally detached from the  law as written. That is the frozen trucker case.   Let's look at the autistic child case of Thompson R2-J School  District v. Luke P. Because he is a youngster, his last name was not  used. It was a 2008 case.   Luke P., a young child with autism, began receiving special education  services in kindergarten at his public school. He had an education plan  that was specific to his needs as was required by the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA.   In early grades, he had made progress in skills related to  communication, self-care, independence, motor skills, social  interactions, and academic functioning, but he was not making progress  in generalizing his skills and applying skills learned in school to  other environments, such as his home life.   Despite the situation at school, there were a lot of problems in his  conduct, and the public school's inability to meaningfully improve  Luke's ability to generalize basic life skills beyond the walls of the  school posed significant limitations on his future.   The basic story is this: The school was failing to provide the type  of education that was necessary for Luke to gain the ability to operate  in life. They found a school that could provide that ability. They  said: To save our child, we will transfer him to that residential  school near Boston that specializes in serving children with autism. It  was a great opportunity for him to learn, and he got in and began to  flourish--a huge change.    Luke's parents, in their knowing that IDEA entitles children with  disabilities to a free education, applied to the school district for  reimbursement of the tuition. The school district refused.  [[Page S2248]]    The long and short of it is that, at a State-level hearing, Luke's  parents prevailed. The case went to the Federal district court, and his  parents prevailed under the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act. At each level, a hearing officer or judge determined that Luke was  not getting the help he needed at his public school. They concluded  that the school district had failed to provide him the free and  appropriate education that was entitled to him under the law.   You have decisions made at multiple levels that the school district  was not meeting the standard of the law. Each declared that only a  residential school could provide Luke with the education he needed.  Therefore, the reimbursement of the tuition to the family was necessary  and appropriate under the law.   The school district appealed all the way up to Judge Gorsuch on the  Tenth Circuit Court. In writing the opinion for the majority, Judge  Gorsuch--and they reversed the lower court's ruling--stated that the  educational benefit that was mandated by IDEA must be ``merely more  than de minimis.''   Here is the new judge's--Neil Gorsuch's--law. He is rewriting the  trucker law so that truckers can be fired for protecting their safety  and the safety of others. He is rewriting Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act so that, instead of having an education that is  appropriate to the student, in fact, all that is required is ``merely  more than de minimis.''   ``De minimis'' means the minimum--like nothing, like babysitting.  Gorsuch said that the benefit provided to Luke--essentially, the  babysitting--satisfied that standard. In effect, Judge Gorsuch argued  that, under IDEA, all the school system had to do was to provide  disabled children with the bare minimum, which is an incredibly low  bar.   I will tell you that the whole intent of IDEA--the whole debate held  here in the Senate, the whole debate held in the House, the signing,  the whole framework for this act--was that we have to do right by our  disabled children. Therefore, schools were mandated to provide  appropriate education. The whole of Gorsuch's finding was to say: No, I  am rewriting the law--minimal, babysitting, ``merely more than de  minimis.'' It is merely more than nothing when translated.   What would be enough? It is as if the whole debate had never occurred  over the vision of requiring schools to provide an appropriate  education to students.   This is not just an example of some narrow reading of the law. This  is judicial activism--rewriting the law to a completely different thing  than it was intended to say.   How could Judge Gorsuch argue putting disabled children like Luke in  a room and giving him nothing other than merely more than nothing after  having met the standards of a substantial act of Congress that was  fully designed to give an appropriate education for disabled children?  How do those things even come close to equating? ``Merely more than  nothing'' versus ``you must provide an appropriate education''--how do  you square those two things? How do you have a judge completely rewrite  the law and say that he is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court?   We can tell you that the High Court disagreed completely with Judge  Gorsuch. We can tell you this because, just this year--just a few days  ago--the Supreme Court ruled on this case, and they overturned Judge  Gorsuch. They did so not by 5 to 3; they did so by 8 to nothing--8 to  zero.   Eight Justices--four conservative, four liberal--looked at this and  said that the law says ``appropriate education.'' Judge Gorsuch said  ``merely more than nothing.'' That is not the law as written. That is  rewriting the law to find on behalf of the powerful, the larger--in  this case, the school district--over the individual. It is a pattern we  see in his rulings time and time and time again.   That is why, if you do nothing about the fact that this seat was  stolen for the first time in U.S. history--a seat stolen for the  Supreme Court from one administration and sent forward in an effort to  pack the Court--and if you did not know anything about that and if all  you knew was this set of decisions, you would ask: How can we possibly  put on the Supreme Court an individual who rewrites the law to mean the  opposite of what it is written to say--that black is white and white is  black; that ``do something significant'' means ``do nothing'' or  ``merely nothing''; that protecting those drivers who operate in safety  for themselves or safety for the people on the road--Judge Gorsuch says  to strip away that protection.                            ____________________     Let's turn to Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v.  Herbert. In August of 2015, Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican Governor,  ordered the State to strip $272,000 in Federal funding from the Planned  Parenthood Association of Utah in response to a series of highly edited  videos that alleged that Planned Parenthood clinics were selling fetal  tissue, even though Utah's clinics were not in the video then.   By the way, those videos had been found to be completely doctored,  completely inaccurate, completely misleading. But despite the fact that  the videos were not authentic and despite the fact that they didn't  have any bearing in Utah, Governor Herbert stood by his ruling to carve  out and take away funding from Planned Parenthood. So Utah's Planned  Parenthood Association filed for a restraining order against the State,  saying that the State was not acting justly, so they asked the Court to  protect them from unjust action.   In spite of his continued claim that stripping the funding was not to  punish the organization for its stance on abortion but in response to  the videos--the doctored, inauthentic, discredited videos--the Governor  eventually admitted, while responding to Planned Parenthood's motion  for a preliminary injunction, that defense of the videos involved  different affiliates--not the ones in Utah--that there was not even an  accusation that Planned Parenthood in Utah had broken the law--not even  an accusation. The organization didn't participate in programs that  provided fetal tissue for research, so it was completely disconnected  from the operation of Planned Parenthood in that State.   The background of this is that medical institutions have utilized  fetal tissue and there have been charges related to the preparation of  that tissue. We could have a whole debate, and we should bring in the  medical professionals to understand the details. But in this case, it  is irrelevant to have that debate because Planned Parenthood in Utah  wasn't part of the fetal tissue research organization. So we don't have  to argue over whether fees they have charged for repairing the tissue  were fair or unfair because they didn't repair anything. This was all  about something else, which was the Governor's decision to launch an  attack on Planned Parenthood, punish Planned Parenthood for its  constitutionally protected advocacy.   This issue is one which I am sure we will be talking about for years  to come. But in the context of the law, a three-judge panel of the  Tenth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction on Planned Parenthood,  concluding that Utah's Planned Parenthood was operating lawfully and  that the Governor's personal opposition to abortion as a motivation for  blocking Federal funds and targeting the health organization did  violate its constitutional rights.   So when this was decided, neither Planned Parenthood nor the State of  Utah sought to have the Tenth Circuit rehear the case en banc, which  means all the judges that serve on the Tenth Circuit. So you had a  three-judge panel that made a decision. Neither side of the case--they  were like, OK, we are done with this. We are done with this. The  practice wasn't even relevant to the association in Utah, not just  because the videos were from different States, not just because the  videos were doctored and basically illegitimate, but also because they  were about a fetal research program that the organization in Utah  didn't participate in.   So from every possible direction, both sides said: Peace. The judge  has ruled, and we understand why. We accept their ruling. But did Judge  Gorsuch accept the ruling? No. He dissented from the court's denial and  wanted to grant an en banc review, not at the behest of any litigant,  just that Judge Gorsuch didn't like the outcome of the case and wanted  to have a full panel in hopes of getting the decision that would defer  to Governor Herbert, who wasn't seeking any review because he wanted to  strip the organization's funding, even though the organization had done  nothing wrong and didn't participate in the program at all. In other  words, Judge Gorsuch was willing to ignore court practice and custom  and a whole set of facts that showed that the whole decision the  Governor made was on the wrong basis--wrong basis on the facts because  the videos were doctored, wrong basis on the facts because it wasn't  even about the State of Utah, wrong basis on the facts because Planned  Parenthood of Utah didn't participate in this research program--wrong  on every level.   But Judge Gorsuch wanted to ensure that he could show a case backing  Utah's Republican Governor that eliminated funding for Planned  Parenthood. That is judicial activism. That is rewriting the law. That  is not a judge; that is a legislator. A person who wants to rewrite the  law in the frozen trucker case, a person who wants to rewrite the law  in the autistic child case, a person who wants to rewrite the law in  the Planned Parenthood case should run for office and legislate, not  use the courts as your personal strategy for judicial activism; that  is, to rewrite the law, the opposite of what the law says.   In the majority's opinion, Judge Mary Briscoe wrote separately to  highlight the troubling nature of Gorsuch's dissent. She noted first  how ``unusual'' and ``extraordinary''--those are words that she put  in--it would be for the Tenth Circuit, on its own motion, to order an  en banc review when neither  [[Page S2258]]  party to a litigation sought such a review. And then she went on, and  what did she say about Judge Gorsuch's proposal? She said he  ``mischaracterized this litigation and the panel decision at several  turns.''   Politics should be in this room, not taking your politics and trying  to change the law through judicial activism on the court by turning the  law upside down and saying it means X when it clearly states Y.   An unidentified judge--we are not sure who--requested that judges be  polled. Again, that would be an unusual situation, apparently, in this  context. Another judge in the majority pointed out that none of the  parties asked for a hearing within the time permitted, and there was no  justification for polling the court on that question at all.   These types of cases give you a sense of how Neil Gorsuch has used  his judicial position to rewrite laws. The law says protect the  trucker. If the trucker is seeking to pursue safety, he says don't  protect the trucker. The law says provide the disabled child with an  appropriate education; Neil Gorsuch says no appropriate education is  required.    The court says that Planned Parenthood's rights were violated because  they were singled out. That is not equality before the law, a very  important principle in American jurisprudence. Neither side contested  the outcome. It was kind of like, yes, OK, the court got it right.  Judge Gorsuch wanted to contest it so he could strip Planned Parenthood  of funding on a basis that the Court found to be unconstitutional. That  is yet another reason that this hearing, this review of the judge be  set aside.   You have these three fundamental reasons. First, for the first time  in our history, the seat has been stolen from one Presidency and  delivered to another in a strategy to pack the Court, causing  tremendous damage to the institution, as well as tremendous damage to  this institution, because it involved not exercising our advice and  consent responsibility.   By the way, one may wonder, why didn't the majority, rather than  stealing the seat, putting it in a time capsule and fast-forwarding it  into the next administration in hopes of packing the Court--why didn't  they just bring Judge Garland up and vote him down? The Senate has  acted to not confirm in roughly a quarter of the nominations that have  come forward to us for the Supreme Court. In those election year cases  that I put up earlier, the Senate acted in all 15 of the cases that  preceded the death of Antonin Scalia, but they didn't confirm in every  case; they turned several of them down. They tabled a couple of them.  They defeated a motion to proceed in another. But the Senate always  acted.   Why didn't the majority honor the responsibility under the law for  the Senate to do advice and consent, when there was plenty of time to  do so, when the entire tradition of the Senate had been to always do  so, when the written responsibility under the Constitution was to do  so? So why not just bring up the judge and defeat him?   The answer is in the quotation that I read earlier from my colleague  from Utah, who anticipated that if only the President would nominate  somebody like Merrick Garland, it would be a great thing, and we would  see a quick confirmation. Merrick Garland was that acceptable. He was  that down the middle. He was without the kinds of issues that raised  concerns. That was Merrick Garland.   So the majority said: We can't have a debate on him because the  Senate will approve him, because he is that qualified. He will get that  bipartisan support.   That is the principle of the filibuster; that is, that you don't  close debate unless 60 Members say you close debate. So if 41 say we  are not ready for whatever reason, you keep debating. That sends a  strong message for Presidents to do what President Obama did. He  consulted with the Democrats; he consulted with the Republicans and  chose somebody who would be acceptable to both sides. That is the way  it is supposed to work. And when a President ignores that and says: I  am going to support somebody from the extremes, I am going to nominate  somebody from the extremes, that is an invitation for the Senate to say  no. The reputation, the legitimacy of the Court matters, so we are not  going to approve this judge.   That is probably what is going to happen this week. The majority here  in the Senate may say they want to close debate, but will they have a  supermajority, a bipartisan majority? No. A few Senators perhaps, but  they will not have those 60 votes.   Obama's judges met the 60-vote standard--both of them that they put  forward before the third vacancy--and nobody filed a motion to close  debate. There wasn't a vote on a motion to close debate. And why was  that? Because everyone knew that they would have 60 votes to close  debate. So, still, even out of the context of having had a cloture  vote, you have the 60-vote standard there guiding the President and  guiding the selection of the nominees.   We should not go back in time to a world in which the copper barons  ruled Montana, not back to a time where the railroads and the oil  companies called all the shots. We need to recognize that we have come  a long way in terms of fulfilling the constitutional vision that our  Founders set out--this vision of equality under the law, this vision of  the pursuit of justice. But with the recent decisions of the 5-to-4  Court, we have gone backward. We have gone backward by allowing  gerrymandering, by allowing voter suppression, by striking down the  Voting Rights Act, and, most importantly, we have gone backward by  allowing this vast infusion of dark money from the very few to drive  election results.    I have been sharing the many reasons this debate should be suspended:  One, because the seat was stolen; two, because there is an enormous  cloud over the legitimacy of the President, and there are  investigations under way, and we need to get to the bottom of it before  a life-tenured position is filled by this President; and, three, a  judge who repeatedly has engaged in rewriting the law to find for the  powerful over the people, even when the law was very clear--even to the  point that the entire Supreme Court overturned him on his effort to say  doing merely more than nothing is acceptable under a law that says you  must provide an appropriate education.   But here is one more thing. Breaking news: A POLITICO report has just  come out which says that Judge Gorsuch committed plagiarism in a book  and in an academic article. Well, that is news I had not heard, so I  will read the article, and we can all learn about it at the same time.   This is a report from POLITICO entitled, ``Gorsuch's writings borrow  from other authors.'' It came out at 11:19, which would put it an hour  ago. Since I am here and since we are talking about Gorsuch, it is  probably appropriate to share this breaking news with you.         Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch copied the structure and       language used by several authors and failed to cite source       material in his book and an academic article, according to       documents provided to POLITICO.        The documents show that several passages from the tenth       chapter of his 2006 book, ``The Future of Assisted Suicide       and Euthanasia,'' read nearly verbatim to a 1984 article in       the Indiana Law Journal. In several other instances in that       book and an academic article published in 2000, Gorsuch       borrowed from the ideas, quotes, and structures of scholarly       and legal works without citing them.        The findings come as Republicans are on the brink of       changing Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch over the vehement       objections of Democrats. The documents could raise questions       about the rigor of Gorsuch's scholarship, which Republicans       have portrayed during the confirmation process as       unimpeachable.        The White House on Tuesday pushed back against any       suggestion of impropriety.    Here is what the White House said:         ``This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-      regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed,       professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch's scholarly       writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the       false attack,'' said White House spokesman Steven Cheung.       ``There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-      second smear of Judge Gorsuch: Those desperate to justify the       unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream       nominee to the Supreme Court.''    That was the comment from the White House. I must do a little bit of  editorializing here. Having a lengthy debate on a judge is not  unprecedented at all. What is unprecedented is, for the first time in  U.S. history, the majority leader filed a petition to close debate on  the first day of debate. That motion under our rules means, in 2 days,  we will have a vote to close debate. That  [[Page S2259]]  is what is unprecedented and never before done in U.S. history. Quite  frankly, when the White House says ``mainstream nominee,'' the analysis  by the Washington Post didn't find him to be a mainstream nominee. You  can call him that, but read his opinions; read his judicial activism;  find how he rewrote the law so that it means the case comes out the  opposite of the way the law is written. See how that happened in the  frozen trucker case. See how that happened in the autistic child case.  See how that happened in his pursuit of the assault on Planned  Parenthood, when everyone agreed there was a fair outcome and no one  was appealing the outcome, except Judge Gorsuch.   If we are going to talk about a filibuster and we want to think about  it in the longer sense, we aren't even allowed to continue talking to  keep this from being considered because the majority leader filed a  petition to close debate, so we have to have a vote on it. But last  year, for 290-plus days, the Republicans completely filibustered  Merrick Garland. If we are talking about the core heart of the meaning  of filibuster--piracy, freebooting piracy to take over the system--that  is what they did last year. They wouldn't allow even a committee  hearing or a vote also for the first time in U.S. history. That is  piracy. That is a violation of our responsibility. So the White House  certainly got some of this completely wrong.   The article goes on--after having cited the White House opinion that  this was an unfair attack--saying:         However, six experts on academic integrity contacted       independently by POLITICO differed in their assessment of       what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety       to mere sloppiness.        ``Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation       of academic ethics. I've never seen a college plagiarism code       that this would not be in violation of,'' said Rebecca Moore,       a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively       on the issue.        Elizabeth Berenguer, an associate professor of law at       Campbell Law School, said that under legal or academic       standards Gorsuch's similarities to the Indiana Law Journal       would be investigated ``as a potential violation of our       plagiarism policy. It's similar enough to the original       work.''    She continued:         ``I would apply an academic writing standard,'' said       Berenguer, who teaches plagiarism and legal writing. ``Even       if it were a legal opinion, it would be plagiarism under       either.''        The White House provided statements from more than a half-      dozen scholars who have worked with Gorsuch or helped oversee       the dissertation he wrote at Oxford University that was later       turned into his book. They included John Finnis, professor       emeritus at Oxford; John Keown of Georgetown University, one       of the outside supervisors for Gorsuch's dissertation; and       Robert George of Princeton University, the general editor for       Gorsuch's book publisher.        The experts offered by the White House asserted that the       criteria for citing work in dissertations on legal philosophy       is different than for other types of academia or journalism:       While Gorsuch may have borrowed language or facts from others       without attribution, they said, he did not misappropriate       ideas or arguments.        ``Judge Gorsuch did not attempt to steal other people's       intellectual property or pass off ideas or arguments taken       from other writers as his own,'' said George. ``In no case       did he seek credit for insights or analysis that had been       purloined. In short, not only is there no fire, there isn't       even smoke.''    The article continues:         The examples at issue make up a small fraction of published       works by Gorsuch, which includes hundreds of legal opinions,       academic articles, news articles and his book. POLITICO did       not conduct a full examination of the federal judge's       writings.        Yet a review of the documents provided to POLITICO shows       Gorsuch parroting other writers' prose and sourcing without       citing them. Instead, Gorsuch often acknowledges the primary       sources cited by those writers.        In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears       to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article       written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her.       Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982       Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known       pediatrics textbook, ``Rudolph's Pediatrics,'' and a 1983       article in the Bloomington Sunday Herald.        At one point, Gorsuch's prose mimics Kuzma's almost word       for word in describing a child born with Down syndrome.        Kuzma stated that--    Some medical terms here that I won't get right--         ``Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula       indicates that the esophageal passage from the mouth to the       stomach ends in a pouch, with an abnormal connection between       the trachea and the esophagus.''    Did everybody follow that?         Gorsuch wrote that ``Esophageal atresia with       tracheoesophageal fistula means that the esophageal passage       from the mouth to the stomach ends in a pouch, with an       abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus.''    That is pretty close to word for word.         Gorsuch also used similar language as Kuzma in describing       ``Baby Doe's'' first days.        ``Shortly after Baby Doe was born, a hearing was held at       Bloomington Hospital to determine whether the parents had the       right to refuse the surgery on behalf of their child. An       attorney was present at the hearing to represent the parents,       though no one was present to represent Baby Doe's potentially       adverse interests. Six physicians attended, three of whom had       obstetric privileges and three of whom had pediatric       privileges at Bloomington Hospital,'' Gorsuch wrote.    Kuzma, the predecessor from which it is being argued that he has  taken this virtually word for word, wrote:         ``Approximately twenty-six hours after Infant Doe was born,       a hearing was held at Bloomington Hospital to determine       whether the parents had the right to choose a course of       treatment for their child that consisted of allowing the       child to die. An attorney was present at the hearing to       represent the child's parents. No attorney was present to       represent Infant Doe's interests. Six physicians attended the       hearing, three of whom had obstetric privileges and three of       whom had pediatric privileges at Bloomington Hospital.''    I believe that last sentence was virtually word for word copied from  what Kuzma wrote.         Kuzma, a one-time aide to former Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.),       did not respond to an inquiry from POLITICO, but released a       statement through Gorsuch's team. Kuzma said she does ``not       see an issue here, even though the language is similar.''        ``These passages are factual, not analytical in nature,''       Kuzma, now a deputy attorney general in Indiana, said. ``It       would have been awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to       have used different language.''        But a 1983 Notre Dame Law Review article addressing the       same case did, in fact, use different, plainer language to       describe the issue than Kuzma or Gorsuch did. Author John M.       Maciejczyk wrote that the ``infant needed surgery to correct       a blocked esophagus.''        In several other examples provided to POLITICO, Gorsuch       follows the fact patterns and sourcing without acknowledging       them.    This article goes on for another several pages. I guess we have the  time to share it in its entirety. But let's not lose the fundamental  point at the start of the article; that is, the title, ``Gorsuch's  writings borrow from other authors,'' and an introductory comment here:         Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch copied the structure and       language used by several authors and failed to cite source       material in his book and an academic article, according to       documents provided to POLITICO.    To continue and to share the full text here, the article continues,  providing more details. Tomorrow many people will be going through  these because this is information that just came out an hour ago. It  makes you wonder, is the reason that we had a first-ever motion to  close debate on the first day of debate--the first time in U.S. history  this happened--because there is information that people are aware of,  and they want to get this nomination vote concluded before this  information becomes public? Is that why we are violating all the  constitutional norms here? Well, I hadn't thought of that possibility  until this article was put in my hands a few moments ago.    The article continues:         In several other examples provided to POLITICO, Gorsuch       follows the fact patterns in sourcing of other writers       without acknowledging them.        In describing euthanasia activist Derek Humphrey, Gorsuch's       book tracks closely with the 2003 book titled ``A Merciful       End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America,'' by Ian       Dowbiggin.        ``In 1989 Humphrey left his second wife, Ann Wickett, soon       after she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. During the       divorce, Wickett alleged that when Humphrey purported to help       her mother commit suicide, the resulting death was not fully       consensual,'' Gorsuch wrote.        Dowbiggin wrote--    In a parallel phrasing that preceded Gorsuch's writing--         ``In 1989 he left his second wife, Ann Wickett, shortly       after she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. Their       subsequent divorce was made messier by Wickett's allegations       that her mother had not died willingly when Humphry had       participated in the suicide of her own parent,'' Dowbiggin       wrote.        Gorsuch did not include an attribution to Dowbiggin in the       passage at issue, though he did cite the author at numerous       other points in the book. Dowbiggin listed his sources as       ``Deadly Compassion: The Death of Ann  [[Page S2260]]       Humphry and The Truth About Euthanasia,'' by Rita Marker, and       ``Last Rites: The Struggle Over the Right to Die,'' by Sue       Woodman. The same titles were cited as sources by Gorsuch.        In the same chapter, Gorsuch appears to rely heavily on a       2002 article by Paul Lombardo of the University of Virginia       about sterilization techniques used in that state in the       early 20th century. Lombardo writes that a woman named Carrie       Buck was sterilized after having a child and her mother was       institutionalized.        ``Even worse for her, officials at her mother's asylum       claimed that mother and daughter shared heredity traits in       feeblemindedness and sexual promiscuity,'' Gorsuch wrote.        Wrote Lombardo, ``Officials at Virginia Colony said that       Carrie and her mother shared heredity traits of       `feeblemindedness' and sexual promiscuity.''    There is a bit of an echo there.         Gorsuch did not cite Lombardo despite mimicking his       sentences and presenting them in virtually the same order,       according to an electronic search of Gorsuch's book.        Howard, the Syracuse University professor, said Gorsuch       engaged in a passage known as ``patchwriting''--essentially       patching together words, fact sequences and quotes from       another source, but occasionally changing up the phrases and       tenses.    It is a way to copy someone else's work while making it look like it  is your own.         In addition to ``heavy patchwriting,'' Howard said, Gorsuch       ``hides his sources, which gives the appearance of a very       deliberate method. I would certainly call it plagiarism.''        In a 2000 article in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public       Policy titled ``The Right to Assisted Suicide and       Euthanasia,'' Gorsuch's writing aligns closely with a 1985       Duquesne Law Review article about euthanasia in colonial       America. Gorsuch describes laws in colonial Virginia,       Massachusetts, Rhode Island, South Carolina, North Carolina       and Pennsylvania in the same order and with similar       quotations as the Duquesne article. But Gorsuch never cites       the article in that passage, instead only repeating the same       sources that it relied on.        Oxford's academic guidance for plagiarism states that       ``paraphrasing the work of others by altering a few words and       changing their order, or by closely following the structure       of their argument, is plagiarism if you do not give due       acknowledgement to the author whose work you are using.''        Christopher Sprigman, a New York University law professor       involved in building an online standard for citation in legal       scholarship, said he did not believe examples of Gorsuch's       questionable writing reflected ``mendacious'' acts on the       judge's part. Gorsuch's manner in attributing sources is ``a       choice that you might agree or disagree with,'' Sprigman       said. ``It's a little bit risky, but I wouldn't say it rises       to the level of a bad act. I think some people would say it's       sloppy.''    That is the conclusion of the article--again, information that just  came out about 1 hour 20 minutes ago. So I recommend that folks take a  look at the article. I am sure many people will be analyzing it  tomorrow.   Part of the point of the lengthy debates we often had over the  Supreme Court is to have a chance for all the facts to come out. And  the fact that tonight--well, that is, Tuesday night; it is now  Wednesday morning--Tuesday was the first time ever in our entire 200- plus years as a Senate that a cloture motion on a Supreme Court nominee  has been filed on the first day of debate. Maybe that motion should be  withdrawn given that there is more information now to analyze as of a  few minutes ago than we had before.   The challenge this institution faces is, how do we restore it to a  functioning legislative body, and how do we repair the deep divide in  America? This question goes far beyond just the issue of the nomination  of Neil Gorsuch; this issue goes to fundamental changes in how this  Senate operates, fundamental changes in how our society receives its  information. While I shared some of that previously, I think it is  probably now, many hours later, worth going back through a little bit  on this set of challenges the Senate faces.    When I was first here as an intern in 1976--41 years ago--the Senate  was here all week long, Monday through Friday. It had a normal  workweek. The Senate families were here, which meant that people had a  more normal family life. During the breaks, they returned to their home  States to share what they had worked on, what they were going to work  on, what the Senate was working on, and generally hold townhalls and  meetings and catch up on everything and then come back here after the  break. That structure of families living here meant that there were  connections not just between Senators but connections between them and  their spouses. There were connections between their children. There  were relationships formed over many evenings in which people  socialized, and they had activities on weekends.   There were a lot of connections that we don't have now, four decades  later, because we fly in and vote on Monday night, and then we vote on  Thursday afternoon and fly out. So we don't have the reenforcement of  our families being here to provide the kind of fabric in which the  legislative discussion occurs, and we don't have the time to get to  know each other. That is a challenge.   Plus, we have to spend a lot more time fundraising than folks in the  Chamber did four decades ago. When you realize that a single  individual, under the deeply mistaken decisions of the Supreme Court,  can now put as much money into a campaign attack against you through a  third party campaign--that they can write a check for more than the  total amount you have raised for your entire campaign, it means that  you are going to have to work very hard year after year to prepare for  the next battle because the opposition doesn't have to prepare for the  next battle. They simply have these massive amounts of funds that they  can deploy at a moment's notice: Let's put $5 million in that race.  Let's put $10 million in that race.   The result is, for example, in the case of the Koch brothers, that  when the Koch brothers used front groups to attack various candidates  across America, the candidates wrestled with whether to respond by  attacking the Koch brothers, and generally, they decided not to because  of the old adage ``Don't pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the  barrel.'' But the modern version of that is ``Don't pick a fight with  someone who has the most deeply funded super pac that exists in the  United States.''   So the Koch brothers carried their fight in 2014 into the Senate race  in Arkansas. They carried their battle into the Senate race in  Louisiana. They carried their battle into the race in North Carolina  and in Colorado and certainly in Iowa and in Alaska and my home State  of Oregon. They were funding front groups to attack me with a third- party campaign. This is what people fear. The Koch brothers can write a  $5 million check--they and their associates--and counter all the funds  you raised.   In addition to the fact that we are here only 3 days, a portion of  those 3 days from Monday night to Thursday night is given over to  fundraising. So instead of being able to go to dinner with colleagues,  you go to a fundraising dinner. Maybe you slip across the street to do  an hour of phone calls. If you are not raising for your own campaign,  you are raising for your party's Senate group--the Republican Senate  campaign committee or the Democratic Senate campaign committee--or  maybe you are raising money directly for your colleagues themselves,  helping to make calls for an event that is upcoming.   So you have an incredible shrinking of the Senate week, combined with  a huge expansion of the time dedicated to fundraising in order to  prepare for the attack that may well come from deeply funded super  pacs. That is not a good combination in terms of Senators getting to  know each other and getting to respect each other, developing projects  together.   I know that it not only damages the time people should be working  together, but it also delegitimizes what this group of 100 Senators  does. The minority feels almost compelled to fight the battle after  having been attacked so viciously by the other side in third-party  campaigns. To some degree, this probably goes both directions. So we  come here brutalized by the groups who are supporting the other side of  the aisle. You are not particularly in a mood to help them out.   This is why I keep coming back to this: It is easy to simply become a  pure partisan in this world in which deep-funded interests make up all  kinds of attacks and put them on television in an effort to elect  someone who will do their bidding, but if we do that, if we don't keep  coming back together with the philosophy of problem-solving, then  problems will never be solved. We will never have a better healthcare  system. We will never have a better public education system. We won't  have a better transportation system. We won't  [[Page S2261]]  have better deployment of infrastructure in rural America if all we do  is nurture the wounds of elections. But it also means that we need to  change the dynamic that creates those wounds. That is why the Supreme  Court seat matters, because the 5-to-4 Court has been doing a lot of  wound infliction on our system, making it easier to gerrymander, making  it easier for voter suppression, making it easier for dark-money  campaigns to corrupt the election process. So we have to attack it on  all fronts.    That experience of coming here 41 years ago as an intern and seeing  this place operate in a very different way gives me the hope that some  way, we could find our way back from the brink. I don't think we have  been anywhere as deep in the pit of partisanship--to mix metaphors--as  at this moment, with this stolen seat; at this moment, with a cloud  over our President and, therefore, a cloud over his nomination; at this  moment, with a nomination that disrespected the role of a  supermajority, the role being to help encourage Presidents to make  nominations from the mainstream, not from the ideological extreme. Here  we are, deep, deep into the pit.   If we don't solve the dark-money problem which is very related to the  Supreme Court, then we aren't going to come together to solve the other  problems because we won't have people who have been elected through a  ``we the people'' vision of America, where each citizen has an equal  voice, Jefferson's mother principle.   So that is the challenge that we face both on the Supreme Court side  of this nomination but also in terms of problem solving.   I think that article that just came out is one that should add to  this conversation--this article that says there is now yet another  issue, an issue that didn't come out in the Judiciary Committee  deliberations.   POLITICO has prepared a side-by-side comparison, which I have on this  multicolored chart so citizens can look that up and contribute to that.  But it is yet another reason we should probably go a different  direction.   Now I am going to turn to Gorsuch's views of expansive Executive  power.   Given the need for strong judicial oversight of this administration,  under the circumstances, this nominee is particularly ill-suited. He  has consistently taken the position that Executive power has very few  limits.   As a member of the Bush administration, Judge Gorsuch, according to  the New York Times, ``was at the center of both litigation and  negotiations with Congress'' regarding ``detainee abuses, military  commissions, warrantless surveillance and its broad claims of executive  power.''   As a lawyer at the Department of Justice, Judge Gorsuch defended  President Bush's enhanced interrogation methods.   In 2005 Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which was meant  to ensure greater human rights for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.  Judge Gorsuch, working as a Department of Justice lawyer at the time,  managed to weaken a provision in the Detainee Treatment Act permitting  a civilian appeals court to review decisions by military tribunals.   The original draft let judges scrutinize whether the tribunal had  applied the correct standards, but the revised language only let them  look to see whether the tribunal had applied standards set by the  Pentagon. That is quite a change.   After the legislation was passed, Gorsuch sent an email to a  colleague in the White House in which he said he needed cheering up. In  the email, he discussed successful efforts to weaken the legislation  stating: ``The administration's victory is not well known, but its  significance shouldn't be understated.''   After the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in June 2006 to find  that officials involved in the use of interrogations could be  vulnerable to prosecution for war crimes, Judge Gorsuch helped draft a  legislative proposal to address the issue, though he left before the  eventual bill, the Military Tribunal Commissions Act, was enacted.   It is clear that he played a significant role in the case of Hamdan  v. Rumsfeld, which former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger called  ``the most important decision on Presidential power ever.'' The case  was regarding the legal process being accorded to detainees at  Guantanamo Bay. His central role was made clear by a request from the  Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs that he, along with the  Solicitor General and his principal deputy, participate in a background  media call on the day the decision was to be announced.   The Department of Justice records show that Gorsuch had been very  involved in helping support the inclusion of language in the Detainee  Treatment Act and the National Defense Authorization Act and bolstered  the position that only the DC Circuit should be able to review  complaints about the Bush military commissions.   Gorsuch repeatedly asked several DOJ colleagues in November where we  stand on the legislative language and if there is anything we can do to  help.   In February, a Republican Senate Judiciary Committee staffer sent  Gorsuch a drafted amicus brief on behalf of Senators Kyl and Graham for  the administration's jurisdiction stripping arguments, a Congressional  Record excerpt supporting the claim. Fortunately, the Supreme Court  rejected the jurisdiction stripping Hamdan, but it was clear that  Gorsuch was trying his best to enact sweeping Bush claims to unilateral  authority and severe limits on judicial review.   Let me go back to the central premise here. As a member of the Bush  administration, Judge Gorsuch, according to the New York Times, was at  the center of both litigation and negotiations with Congress regarding  detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance, and  broad claims of Executive power.   I think all of us should be more than a little disturbed by getting  to the bottom line here, which is that Congress sought to ensure  greater human rights for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay and Judge  Gorsuch was working as a DOJ lawyer to weaken a provision in that  regard and these other pieces that I have referred to.    I will turn now to an analysis of ``The Dissents of Judge Neil  Gorsuch: Far to the Right and Out of the Mainstream.''   This analysis by People For the American Way goes through a number of  cases, setting out the picture, if you will, of just how far out of the  mainstream Neil Gorsuch is. I will just read this by Elliot Mincberg,  written last month:         Many, if not most, decisions by the Supreme Court and the       court of appeals are unanimous. Reviewing the cases where an       appellate judge has chosen to disagree with and dissent from       his or her colleagues, therefore, can be particularly       revealing. And that is precisely the case with Judge Neil       Gorsuch. Judge Gorsuch's dissents from his colleagues on the       Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals are consistently right-wing,       generally seeking to favor big business and other authority       and harm the interests of workers and those who have suffered       abuse by government officials. And this is on a court which,       until recently, consisted primarily of Republican appointees       like Gorsuch. For example:        In Compass Environmental, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &       Health Review Commission, Gorsuch dissented from a decision       to affirm a Department of Labor fine against a company that       failed to properly train a worker, resulting in his death by       electrocution. Gorsuch claimed that there was no evidence to       show that industry standards would have required more       training. But as the court majority and the agency found,       there was ``clear evidence'' to support the ruling.    Let me say that again. Gorsuch said there was no evidence. The court  majority basically found there was ``clear evidence'' to support the  ruling.         In particular, the company's own job hazard analysis found       ``fatal danger'' from the high-voltage power lines involved,       and recommended training for employees.    That was the company's own job hazard announcement. The company  itself knew: If you are operating a piece of equipment next to a high- powered voltage line and that metal equipment touches that line, you  create the possibility of an electrocution.   That training was given to some employees, but the employee who was  killed did not get that training because they didn't give it to him. So  the court majority said: Yes, you should have provided the training  that you knew was necessary for the operation of this equipment in that  setting with a high-voltage power line, but you didn't give it.  Therefore, you are in the wrong. But Judge Gorsuch saw it differently.         As a result of that negligence, the danger truly did become       fatal, and the fine against  [[Page S2262]]       the company was clearly justified. But Gorsuch disagreed with       his own colleagues--including one who, like Gorsuch, was       appointed by President Bush--and argued that the corporation       should pay nothing.    My father was a mechanic. He worked when he was first out of high  school for construction companies on highways in Arizona, and he did a  whole host of roles but mostly repairing the equipment of the shop.   In a few years, he became a journeyman, a mechanic. In the course of  that work on these big machines, you come to be aware that there are a  lot of hazards that need to be addressed. You know some of those  hazards for the operators, some of the hazards for working on the  machines themselves.   Companies know this as well. They know that if they are hiring a new  employee to work in a hazardous setting, they need to train the  employee so the employee doesn't get hurt.   The company didn't provide the training. The employee died. The  company is fined. And Gorsuch says: No, no, no problem here.   Really? Why did the rest of the court majority find otherwise? Why  did the Department of Labor find otherwise? Why did he disagree with  his colleagues in order to protect a powerful corporation that had  failed to provide the training that resulted in the death of a person?   That is what the requirements for training are all about--to protect  individuals from situations where they are at high risk. You eliminate  those risks.   (Mr. TILLIS assumed the Chair.)   The article goes on to address the issue of the frozen trucker who I  discussed earlier.   In TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Administrative Review Board, Gorsuch  dissented from a decision. Here again, the majority is finding one  thing, and, as you hear about this, you will realize that what the  majority found was very logical, and what Judge Gorsuch found was  standing everything on its head:         Gorsuch dissented from a decision to approve a Labor       Department determination that a large trucking company had       wrongfully fired a truck driver who had refused to drive       under hazardous conditions. The trailer's brakes had frozen       in subzero temperatures, and the driver waited over two hours       for repair help. He reported that he was ``having trouble       breathing because of the cold'' and that he ``couldn't feel       his feet.'' When help still did not arrive, he unhitched the       large trailer because of concerns about driving the entire       load under those conditions and began to drive away in the       cab. The company insisted by radio that he keep waiting in       the frigid conditions or drive with the full load, even       though the trailer's brakes had frozen. Although he returned       when help arrived in around fifteen minutes, he was fired;       the company claimed that the firing was proper because       instead of remaining in the freezing conditions and not       driving (which was his right), he drove off without the       trailer instead of the dangerous way the company demanded.       Gorsuch agreed with the company, claiming that finding for       the driver was improperly using the law ``as a sort of       springboard to combat all perceived evils in the       neighborhood'' and that the objective to promote health and       safety was just ``ephemeral and generic.'' The court majority       agreed with the agency, calling Gorsuch's reasoning       ``curious.''    If anyone missed the elements of this case when I spoke about it  previously, as I have several times in the course of the night because  I find it such an outrageous situation, you have a driver who is in an  impossible situation. The brakes had frozen on a truck in subzero  temperatures. Therefore, the braking ability on the trailer is  compromised. So it is dangerous to drive it. Then the auxiliary heater  in the cab had failed. So he is in subzero conditions in the cab, and  as this relates he had conveyed that he had gone numb. He was having  trouble breathing because of the cold. He couldn't feel his feet. So he  did the logical thing to protect his own safety. He drove somewhere  seeking to get some heat but didn't drive the trailer because to do so  would have been to endanger everyone else. The Court said this all fits  with the law. Gorsuch disagreed.         In Planned Parenthood Ass'n of Utah v. Herbert, a three-      judge panel had issued a preliminary injunction against       Utah's governor for unilaterally cutting off Planned       Parenthood (PP) funding.    This is a case that I referred to earlier where you have three basic  things. A Governor chooses to cut off funding, eliminating equality  under the law because of some doctor videos that were released--videos  that were completely discredited later on--but in this kind of  political campaign he chose to discriminate against Planned Parenthood.  The fact is that those videos weren't about Utah. They were about a  program that wasn't even utilized by Planned Parenthood of Utah. So at  every level, there was no basis for this discrimination. So the  majority of the full Tenth Circuit declined to rehear the case after  the preliminary injunction.         Gorsuch, however, wrote a dissent for himself and several       others, and argued for deferring to the governor. An       important issue in the case was the governor's intent in       cutting off funding, which the panel found was retaliation       for promoting access to abortion. On that issue in       particular, Gorsuch argued for deference to the governor in       the name of ``comity.''    In the name of comity? OK. Let's get this right. It is OK to violate  the equality under the law in order to make nice with the powerful  government. That is what Gorsuch argued? Well, the majority certainly  disagreed, noting that nobody party to the suit had asked for a  rehearing. This is where you seek a rehearing by a broader group of the  panel of judges. If the defendant doesn't dispute it, why would you  possibly do a rehearing except to score political points on the  rightwing of the universe? That is what Gorsuch did. It shows his lack  of regard for reproductive rights. It also shows that he wanted comity,  that he wanted to make nice with the Governor rather than defend the  rights of the organization that had been discriminated against. I think  this kind of deference to executive authority is certainly something  that in the context of our current situation is a dangerous tendency.         These are just a few of the dissents written by Gorsuch       where his disagreements with his own colleagues, including       other Republican appointees, show that he is far to the right       and out of the mainstream. Altogether, Judge Gorsuch has       written 35 dissents, which are in the following areas:       workers' rights, abuse of government official authority,       corporations and consumers, criminal law, and other       constitutional issues.    So let's take a look at each of these areas. So again, these are  cases where Gorsuch is disagreeing with the majority on a case.         Judge Gorsuch has written five dissents in cases concerning       workers' rights.    I am reading this analysis. This analysis that has been prepared by  Elliot Mincberg last month, titled ``The Dissents of Judge Gorsuch: Far  to the Right and Out of the Mainstream.'' So Elliot writes:         Judge Gorsuch has written five dissents in cases concerning       workers' rights. In all but one, the majority found in favor       of the worker, but Gorsuch argued for a result that would       have hurt the worker and helped a corporation or other       employer. These include the Compass Environmental and TransAm       Trucking cases discussed above.    Those we already talked about.         The two others are similarly troubling.    These are not my words. I am reading Elliot Mincberg's words.         In Strickland v. United Parcel Service, Inc., the court       majority ruled that a lower court had improperly dismissed a       complaint that UPS had committed sex discrimination against a       fired female employee and had also violated the Family       Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and sent the case to the district       court so that the plaintiff could try to prove her claims at       trial. Although Gorsuch agreed with the FMLA ruling, he       dissented on the discrimination claim and argued that the       dismissal of that claim should be affirmed. The majority was       critical of Gorsuch's argument, noting that he ``fail[ed] to       acknowledge'' substantial evidence that the worker was       treated differently because of her gender. That evidence, the       majority explained, included testimony from ``multiple co-      workers'' that she was treated differently than male       employees, including being required to meet 100 percent of       sales goals and being subjected to ``increased oversight''       such as frequent ``negative'' meetings that ``interfered with       her ability to do her job.''    Certainly, I think, in this day and age, we expect companies not to  engage in discrimination on the basis of gender. Here the court found  ``substantial evidence,'' including ``testimony from multiple co- workers that she was treated differently''--and not in a positive way-- ``than her male employees''--subjected to different sales goals,  subjected to different oversight, subjected to different special  meetings that interfered with her job. But Judge Gorsuch disagreed with  the majority and thought that this argument of discrimination should be  rejected.   The article continues:         Finally, in NLRB v. Community Health Services, Inc., Judge       Gorsuch dissented from a ruling last year that upheld a       National  [[Page S2263]]       Labor Relations Board (NLRB) decision that granted over       $100,000 in back pay to hospital workers whose hours were       illegally reduced, without deducting amounts that some earned       elsewhere during the period that the employees' hours were       improperly reduced. The Board concluded that such deductions       were improper because the outside employment was important to       help address additional hardship, encourage production and       employment, and prevent dilatory conduct by employers in       accord with law. But Gorsuch did more than dissent.    Again, I am reading now the words of Elliot Mincberg.         He excoriated the NLRB, a favorite target of many right-      wing Republicans, suggesting that the NLRB's decision could       have stemmed from its alleged ``frustration that it cannot       pursue more tantalizing goals like punishing employers for       unlawful actions.'' Interestingly, one of the judges in the       majority from which Gorsuch dissented was Chief Judge Tim       Tymkovich, also a Bush appointee who was on Trump's list of       21 possible Supreme Court nominees, but who obviously was not       selected.    You know the NLRB, or the National Labor Relations Board, exists to  protect workers by making sure employers abide by the law, and I find  that Gorsuch's language here that imputes that the Board was operating  not on the facts of the case but out of the frustration that it ``can't  pursue more tantalizing goals like punishing employers,'' really quite  bizarre.   I know that in the pursuit of protecting workers it is often  frustrating to companies that they get subjected to fines for their  conduct by the NLRB or are ordered to pay back pay, but isn't this now  the moment in which you have a President who said he was going to fight  for workers? Wouldn't he want to nominate a judge who actually wanted  to have the National Labor Relations Board be able to successfully  fight for fairness for workers, not someone who treated that as kind of  a frivolous thing: Oh, those workers, what do they need? They are just  constantly bothering our powerful corporations with things like asking  for fair treatment. How inappropriate is that? I mean, that is kind of  the tone of the Gorsuch approach here, and I think it is incredibly  important that we have an agency that says: If you proceed to bring  people in and you don't pay them for the hours they work, you must pay  them. If you are supposed to pay overtime and you didn't, you have to  make it up. Somebody has to hold people accountable to the law for  protection and for fairness to workers.   It is not as if workers in America have been doing very well. Over  the last four decades, workers have been getting the short end of the  stick. The wealth in America has soared and soared and soared, and the  workers, unfortunately, have received very little of that wealth. The  inequality in the Nation has expanded dramatically. One way of framing  this is that virtually all the new income in America has gone to the  richest 10 percent of Americans. So here we have an agency that is just  saying basic fairness: If you are supposed to pay overtime, pay  overtime. If you bring people into the job, pay them for the time they  work. If you are supposed to provide a break time, provide a break  time--basic fairness for workers. But instead of having this basic  fairness for workers, there is this campaign to take away the power of  the agency that provides that.   This came up in the context of the challenge we faced in 2013 when  the minority said: We are not going to allow anybody to be confirmed to  the National Labor Relations Board. They wanted it to be dysfunctional  so they couldn't protect workers. Now we have a President who was  running to help workers but he is nominating a Justice who treats that  like a frivolous goal--protecting workers.   Let me return to the argument here and to the topic of the ``Abuse of  Government Official Authority.''         Judge Gorsuch has written four dissents in civil cases       concerning claims of abuse of government official authority--      three involving law enforcement officials and one involving a       state's governor. In three out of four [of these cases], his       judicial colleagues found that such abuse had occurred or at       least the plaintiffs should have a chance to prove it. In all       three of those cases, Gorsuch dissented and would have       deferred to the government official.    We discussed already the most important of those dissents, which was  Planned Parenthood v. Utah.   Let's go forward to consider Cortez v. McCauley.         The full Tenth Circuit considered whether a couple whose       home was unexpectedly invaded by the police after midnight       could bring claims of abuse to a jury. In the case, a 2-year-      old girl for whom plaintiff Tina Cortez had baby-sat, said       that Tina's partner had molested her, which other later       investigation found to be untrue.        Based on that report alone and with no warrant, four police       officers burst into the Cortez's home after midnight. Among       their other actions, the police woke up the couple and shined       a flashlight into Ms. Cortez's face, grabbed her by the arm,       put her in the backseat of a locked police car, interrogated       her, left her there for about an hour, and searched the home       without a warrant even though the 2-year-old had not accused       her of any misconduct.        The couple was released and was allowed back into their       house after 2 a.m. after it became clear from investigation       elsewhere that the claims against Mr. Cortez were false and       there was no basis to proceed any further.        The majority and Judge Gorsuch were in substantial       agreement on Mr. Cortez's claims of improper police conduct,       but Judge Gorsuch wrote a dissent for himself and several       other judges from the decision of the majority, written by       another Republican appointee and joined by several others,       that Ms. Cortez should be able to present her claim to a jury       and that qualified immunity should not apply.        The majority criticized Judge Gorsuch because his dissent       ``comes very close to saying'' that the police conduct was       justified simply because the 2-year-old's claim was repeated       by a nurse and her mother and was then ``acted upon by police       officers,'' reflecting an extraordinary and improper degree       of deference to police officials.        Gorsuch also attempted to minimize the harm to Ms. Cortez,       describing it as simply a ``transient feeling'' of       intimidation. But as the majority explained, Gorsuch       ``disregard[ed] the emotional or psychological injury'' that       a jury could well find ``resulting from intimidation, fear       for personal safety,'' and ``loss of liberty and privacy'' as       a result of being ``removed from the residence in the middle       of the night'' and being ``locked'' in a police car and       interrogated ``for over an hour.''    To get a better grip on that case, this is setting up a situation in  which, on very minor information, police proceed without a warrant to  burst into a home after midnight, grab a woman, throw her in the  backseat of a locked police car, interrogate her, leave her there for  an hour, search the home without a warrant, and so forth. Gorsuch  described this as just a ``transient feeling'' of intimidation,  according to this article.   I think that if most of us were ripped out of our homes in the middle  of the night and were thrown into a police car and interrogated, we  would find it to be something more than just a minor transient feeling  of intimidation.   The point was the goal of whether she should be able to present her  claim to a jury. It was not even a finding on the legitimacy of her  case; it was just that she should have her day in court, that she  should be able to make her claim that how she was treated was  inappropriate. Gorsuch minimized the impact on her and wanted to strip  her of that ability to present her case in court.   Shouldn't citizens who have gone through what they believe to be  extraordinary experiences--and I believe being pulled out of your house  in the middle of the night and thrown into a police car and  interrogated is pretty substantial--have the ability to make their  case? Maybe the judge and jury agree with you and maybe they do not.  This is just a case of, do you get a chance to ask for justice? In this  case, Gorsuch said no, and the majority said yes, you should have a  chance.   There are issues here. There are issues of personal safety, issues of  loss of liberty, issues of loss of privacy.   In another case that Judge Gorsuch decided--and I return to reading  the article--Judge Gorsuch also dissented in Webb v. Thompson, in which  ``the majority affirmed a lower court decision saying that county  police officials were not entitled to qualified immunity from a  complaint by a man arrested at a simple traffic stop and treated  improperly by county police. This included being held in jail for 5  days when, according to county police, he should have been released in  no more than 48 hours.''   This was, again, a man who was arrested at a simple traffic stop and  was held in jail for 5 days when the policy was that he should have  been released in 2 days.         The lower court had found that there was a disputed issue       of fact as to whether three officers had helped cause the       delay, which all  [[Page S2264]]       agreed was improper, and therefore ruled that the victim was       entitled to present his case to a jury. But Judge Gorsuch       dissented from the majority's decision to uphold that ruling,       claiming that the officers did not have a personal legal       duty to ensure a prompt hearing. The majority easily       explained the flaw in Gorsuch's argument. Whether or not       they had an affirmative duty to act, the majority       explained, the officers were clearly liable if they, in       fact, ``caused the delay.''    Here you have an individual who was held after a minor traffic stop-- held for 5 days in jail. I do not know about any other Member of the  Senate, but if a Member of the Senate were picked up on a traffic stop  and held for 5 days--and while we do not have the full context of the  case here, under the rules, he should have been held no more than 2--it  would be pretty upsetting, and his family would be pretty upset.   Thus, there is the question of whether you get a chance to present  your case. Do you, as a citizen, get a chance to present your case? The  majority said: Yes, there is a reasonable basis here. You get a chance  to present your case.   Gorsuch said: No, we are going to strip the individual of a chance to  present his case.   It is quite a different approach, a continuous finding on behalf of  the powerful, but not always. So I return to reading the article.         In one case, A.M. v. Holmes, Gorsuch dissented in favor of       an individual. The primary claim in that case was against two       middle school officials who had asked an Albuquerque police       officer to remove a 13-year-old boy who had disrupted a       physical education class and rendered a teacher ``unable to       continue to teach the class.'' The student was suspended and       also arrested under a State law prohibiting interference with       the educational process.        When the mother sued, the lower court granted qualified       immunity, a 10th Circuit panel majority affirmed, but Gorsuch       dissented, suggesting that the severity of the officials'       reaction was not justified. The majority also was troubled by       the circumstances, but explained that it is ``not our place       to question or undermine'' the state's decision to       ``criminalize interference with the educational process.''    In this case, Judge Gorsuch did dispute a case and did so on behalf  of an individual, giving more substantial support to the mother, who  was suing.   I am reading from this article written by Elliot Mincberg. It is  titled ``The Dissents of Judge Neil Gorsuch: Far to the Right and out  of the Mainstream.''   The article turns to the issue of corporations and consumers.         Eight of Judge Gorsuch's dissents involved corporations,       consumers, or both, including one environmental case. One       dissent involved a case of two corporations pitted against       each other. In all but one of the seven others, Gorsuch       disagreed with his colleagues and wrote a dissent that       favored corporations, harmed consumers or other citizens, or       both. In the seventh, the corporation Gorsuch ruled against       was an adult bookstore. This is the case of Ragab v. Howard.        Ragab v. Howard concerned the increasingly important issue       of forcing individuals to go to arbitration, rather than the       courts, to resolve disputes with corporations. In this case,       an investment banking firm and a capital financing company       tried to compel arbitration of Sami Ragab's lawsuit for       misrepresentation and violation of consumer credit repair       laws in connection with agreements to help him obtain       financing for a new business.        Both the district court and the court of appeals majority,       including a Republican appointee, ruled against the       corporations. Judge Gorsuch dissented, however, arguing that       even though the six different agreements among the parties       contained conflicting language concerning the specifics of       handling arbitration, the fact that all six called for       arbitration of some sort was enough, and that the court       should do a ``workaround'' so that arbitration would take       place.        The majority strongly disagreed. The different provisions,       the majority explained, created such ``irreconcilable''       conflicts that it was clear that there was no ``meeting of       the minds,'' a basic principle of contract law. The majority       pointedly noted that it would be improper for ``courts'' to       effectively write in an arbitration requirement when the       agreements did not ``demonstrate the parties'' intent.    Let's talk for a moment about this issue of binding arbitration. This  is a situation in which consumers are involved in a transaction, and  there is some fine print that says: If we get into a dispute, you must  go to an arbitrator, and the outcome of that--whatever the arbitrator  decides--will be the only outcome you can get.   That sounds pretty good at first. An arbitration sounds like a  judicial process. Nothing about it sounds completely unbalanced. But,  in fact, it is not a judicial process; it is unbalanced. The  corporation hires the arbitrator.   Now, if you and I are in dispute and you are essentially hiring the  referee for that dispute, wouldn't you kind of figure the system was a  bit rigged, especially if there are a whole series of disputes and the  referee--that is, the arbitrator--wants the business of the corporation  and is only going to get that business if they find on behalf of the  corporation? So you are not going to get a fair hearing. You get an  unfair hearing.   The system is rigged because the individual being hired by the other  party will get business only if they keep finding in that party's  favor, so you enter the room knowing that you are going to be found  against, except in a rare circumstance. It is a completely rigged  system. It doesn't compensate at all. It doesn't replace any fair  adjudication, and it allows companies to get away with predatory  practices because there is no avenue through which to pursue fairness.  In this case, the majority said there is no clear arbitration, but  Judge Gorsuch wanted to write a requirement. He wanted to legislate.   We have seen these other cases where he wanted to legislate. He  wanted to change the way the law is written to protect truckers who  operate vehicles so as not to endanger others because he didn't like  that. He wanted to rewrite the law in Utah so that you could ban funds  for Planned Parenthood, even though it was unconstitutional to  discriminate against them, and so on and so forth.   The more I read his opinions, the more I think Neil Gorsuch should  run for office. He wants to change the law in case after case after  case. Run for office. Theoretically, that is what legislators do, not  what judges do. Judges call balls and strikes, not twist the law to  mean the opposite of what it was written to be. And in this case, he is  saying the court should do a ``workaround'' so that arbitration should  take place, and the majority said that is not possible. These are  irreconcilable conflicts between the different provisions of the  different arbitration requirements. There is no meeting of the minds.  It is the principle of contract law, and it would be improper for the  courts to write an arbitration requirement. But that is what Judge  Gorsuch wanted to do. He wanted to write an arbitration rule. He wanted  to legislate. Well, run for office; don't put yourself forward to fill  a stolen seat on the Supreme Court.   I know that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee followed these  cases during the hearings of the Judiciary Committee and looked at them  carefully. The more they saw, the more they saw not a judge but someone  who wanted to legislate, who wanted to rewrite the law to help the  powerful over the ordinary individual, in case after case after case.   Let's turn to another case. I will return to the article. This  article by Elliot Mincberg, titled ``The Dissents of Judge Neil  Gorsuch: Far to the Right and Out of the Mainstream.''   The article continues:         In Gorsuch's sole dissent on environmental issues, New       Mexico Off-Highway Vehicle Alliance v. US Forest Service, he       dissented from a ruling by two other Republican appointees       and argued that the Sierra Club and other environmental       groups should not be allowed to intervene in a lawsuit       contesting Forest Service rules that expanded the number of       trails and roads that were only for hikers and bikers.    So the lay of the land here: You have a really--by two Republican  appointees, and you have Gorsuch arguing the opposite side, saying that  the environmental group should not be allowed to intervene in a lawsuit  contesting Forest Service rules.   So then the article continues:         The Alliance, a nonprofit supported by Kawasaki and other       motorized vehicle companies, wanted to return to old rules       allowing motorized vehicles on more trails. Even though       neither the Forest Service nor the Alliance objected, the       district court ruled against the environmentalists'       participation in the case, and Gorsuch agreed in dissent. As       the majority explained, however, other 10th Circuit decisions       made clear that the environmentalists had strong reasons to       be involved in the case and ``should not have to rely'' on       the government to protect their interests, particularly since       the government did not object to the proposed intervention.       The majority specifically criticized Gorsuch for appearing to       rely on the opinion of just  [[Page S2265]]       three judges in a previous case involving all 13 10th Circuit       judges to try to reach a narrow and unfavorable result in the       case.    So I know that often Neil Gorsuch liked to say: I just apply the  precedents. So what does he do? He takes the opinion of three judges in  a case involving 13 Tenth Circuit judges. Well, you can see a clever  strategy as presented in this article, an effort to reach a narrow and  unfavorable result.   The article continues:         In WWC Holding Co. v. Sopkin, Gorsuch argued that a       wireless service carrier should be able to avoid the Colorado       Public Utility Commission's efforts to enact state-specific       consumer protection standards for wireless phone service       because the company was complying with relevant federal       rules. The majority in the case, including the Republican       appointee, disagreed and ruled that Colorado had the       authority to enact and enforce state-specific rules,       including requiring free calls at libraries, in school       districts, and in other community gathering places, under the       ``express statutory authority'' of federal as well as state       law.    So let's review that. Gorsuch wanted the company to avoid the public  utility commission's requirements, and the majority said: Wait, there  is express statutory authority for the State utility commission to be  able to require State-specific things such as free calls at libraries,  in school districts, and in other community gathering places.    This is another case where Gorsuch wanted to be the legislator. Well,  go and get elected and write a law rather than writing law as a judge  when you are supposed to be calling the balls and strikes.   The article continues:         Judge Gorsuch dissented in three other cases in which the       majority had found in favor of individual consumers.    So the majority says the individual is right, and Judge Gorsuch said:  Let me be clear. I want this case to come out on behalf of the  corporation.   The article continues:         Pace v. Swerdlow, where the majority reversed the dismissal       of a negligence case against an expert witness and ruled that       parents should have the opportunity to prove that the       expert's actions prevented them from receiving compensation       related to their daughter's death.    So the argument of the parents was that there was an expert witness,  and the expert witness's actions prevented them from receiving  compensation relating to their daughter's death, and the case should be  dismissed. So the majority reversed the dismissal, but Judge Gorsuch  dissented.   The article continues:         In Salmon v. Astrue, where the majority ruled that a       hearing examiner had improperly disregarded evidence       reporting a claim of physical and mental disability benefits       from the Social Security Administration, but Gorsuch argued       in dissent that the examiner's denial met the legal test of       being supported by ``substantial evidence,'' which he equated       with simply being within the ``bounds of reason.''    The majority said the examiner--just to review that--had improperly  disregarded evidence. Well, certainly, if I were having a family member  in that situation, I would not want a hearing examiner to improperly  disregard evidence related to a claim for mental and physical  disability benefits. But Gorsuch argued on the other side, against the  person on the minority side.         In Blausey v. Trustee, where the majority allowed a       bankrupt couple to appeal an unfavorable bankruptcy court       decision, the majority said the couple should be able to       appeal an unfavorable bankruptcy court decision rejecting the       petition, although it ultimately decided against the couple,       but Gorsuch would not have accepted the appeal in the first       place.    He would not have allowed that bankrupt couple to appeal an  unfavorable bankruptcy court decision. The majority said: We may not  find in her favor, but she deserves her day in court. Judge Gorsuch  said: No day in court for her. We are not letting her even argue her  case.   The article goes on to address another section involving criminal  law:         Most of Judge Gorsuch's dissents have been in criminal       cases, often raising constitutional issues concerning whether       people have been deprived of effective assistance of counsel       under the Sixth Amendment or of rights against unreasonable       search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. A number of       these were habeas corpus cases, in which the federal courts       undertake limited but important review concerning criminal       cases tried in state courts. Gorsuch has dissented in favor       of criminal defendants on five occasions. But in almost twice       as many, nine, he has dissented against rulings by       colleagues, many of them Republican, that vindicated       important constitutional rights.        Most troubling have been Gorsuch's four dissents in cases       where his colleagues found that Sixth Amendment rights were       violated because individuals, usually low-income people, did       not receive effective assistance of counsel. Perhaps the       clearest example is provided by his two dissents in Williams       v. Jones.        In the three-judge panel decision in Williams, two of       Gorsuch's Republican colleagues, including the very       conservative Michael McConnell, ruled that more effective       relief was required for an individual who, both the majority       and an Oklahoma estate appellate court agreed, was deprived       of effective assistance of counsel. In this case, the state       had offered Williams a plea agreement under which he would       serve 10 years in jail, which Williams wanted to accept but       was stopped by his counsel. The lawyer claimed that Williams       would be committing perjury if he accepted the agreement and       said that he would withdraw from representing Williams unless       the case went to trial; short of money, Williams agreed. The       trial resulted in a guilty verdict and a sentence of life       without the possibility of parole. The Oklahoma court of       appeals agreed that the lawyer's conduct was improper and had       harmed his client, but the only relief they granted was to       reduce the sentence to life with the possibility of parole.       The 10th Circuit accepted a habeas petition limited to the       question of adequacy of the relief provided by the Oklahoma       court.        The panel majority explained that in light of the egregious       conduct by counsel and the obvious consequences, the case       should be sent back to the state court to provide a remedy       ``tailored to the injury.''    What is the injury? Egregious conduct by counsel resulting in a  massive penalty.         The panel majority explained that in light of the egregious       conduct by counsel and the obvious consequences, the case       should be sent back to the state to provide a remedy       ``tailored to the injury,'' i.e. the loss of a ten-year       sentence as opposed to a life sentence. Gorsuch not only       disagreed, but would also have gone even further. He claimed       that there was no Sixth Amendment violation at all, because       Williams received a fair trial in which his lawyer       represented him well after the plea agreement failed.        The majority was extremely critical of Gorsuch's claim.       ``No federal circuit court,'' they explained, had accepted       Gorsuch's view that any pre-trial Sixth Amendment violation       is somehow cured if the later trial is fair. Gorsuch's claim       that the Sixth Amendment is essentially limited to what       happens at trial, the majority stated, has been ``rejected by       the Supreme Court'' and is ``incompatible with a right to       effective assistance of counsel in connection with the entire       plea process.''    Let me comment here that when a person is in court and has very  limited funds--unlike a very affluent person who can have a whole team  of lawyers--you really depend on your lawyer representing you in an  effective manner, not, as relayed here, in an egregious manner that  basically undermined your path.         But Gorsuch did not stop there. He dissented from a       decision by the entire 10th Circuit not to rehear the case,       which included several additional Republican-appointed       judges, this time also claiming that the effect of the       court's ruling was to overturn the later jury verdict that       had found Williams guilty.        One of the Republican-appointed judges on the original       panel made short shrift of Gorsuch's arguments in a       concurring opinion. It was not a federal court that had       originally pointed out the Sixth Amendment violation       requiring relief; it was the Oklahoma appellate court that       found Williams' lawyer's conduct ``highly improper'' and       ``deficient,'' and that Williams had ``indeed suffered       prejudice by his trial counsel's action.'' Gorsuch's view,       the concurrence explained, was ``impossible to square'' with       Supreme Court and court of appeals' rulings on effective       assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court denied review of the       case.    So the Supreme Court sided with the majority, essentially saying  Gorsuch got it wrong. This concept of effective assistance of counsel  is fundamental to the notion of a fair trial system. An ordinary person  can't represent themselves; they have to have effective assistance of  counsel if there is to be any possibility of a fair decision.   The article continues, saying:         Other dissents by Gorsuch on findings of Sixth Amendment       violations include:        Wilson v. Workman, in which the majority of the full Tenth       Circuit agreed, in a decision by Judge McConnell and joined       by other Republican appointees, that a death row prisoner       suffered a Sixth Amendment violation because his lawyer       failed to present important evidence of Wilson's poor mental       health and other problems that could have mitigated against       the death penalty. Gorsuch dissented and claimed that the       court should defer to the state appellate court that had       rejected the claims. But as the majority pointedly explained,       deference was inappropriate because the state court had not       considered available ``material, non-record evidence'' and       thus had not truly ``adjudicated that claim on the merits.''   [[Page S2266]]     So here is another case of the lack of effective assistance of  counsel, and all that counsel's representations were defective-- ``failed to present important evidence of Wilson's poor mental health  and other issues that could have mitigated against the death penalty.''  Gorsuch said it doesn't matter. A majority said of course it matters.  ``The state court had not considered available `material, non-record  evidence' and thus had not truly `adjudicated that claim on the  merits.' ''   Let's turn to the case of Hooks v. Workman. Again, I am reading from  this article:         Hooks v. Workman, in which another Republican-appointed       judge wrote a panel opinion finding that a death row       prisoner's lawyer had failed to present important mitigation       evidence, including concerning Hooks' brain damage, mental       retardation, and a history of abuse against him. Gorsuch       argued this time that even if that evidence had been       presented, the jury would have sentenced Hooks to death. As       the majority explained, however, the lawyer's work was       demonstrably ``deficient'' and ``prejudicial,'' and there was       clearly a ``reasonable probability'' that at least one juror       would have refused to impose the death penalty if the Sixth       Amendment violation had not occurred.    So here the majority--this is not Democratic or Republicans; it is an  Republican-appointed judge--found that a death row lawyer failed to  present important mitigation evidence regarding brain damage and mental  retardation and a history of abuse--all mitigating circumstances. The  failure to present that meant the jury sentenced him to death where  they might not have otherwise. The majority made it very clear that  ``the lawyer's work was demonstrably `deficient' and `prejudicial,'''  but Gorsuch dissented.   The concept of effective assistance of counsel as presented in these  cases seems to be one that Neil Gorsuch really doesn't grasp or, if he  understands the concept intellectually, doesn't want to, if you will,  honor the requirements of the Sixth Amendment.   Turning to motions to suppress.         Judge Gorsuch's record is mixed concerning dissents       relating to motions to suppress evidence because of alleged       constitutional violations by police. In U.S. v. Carloss,       Gorsuch argued in dissent that it was improper for police       officers to knock on a homeowner's doors as part of       an investigation into illegal possession of a machine gun,       without a warrant or exigent circumstances, when the       homeowner had conspicuously posted ``No Trespassing''       signs on his door and around the property. Gorsuch listed       this opinion as one of his ten most significant opinions       in his response to the Senate Judiciary Committee       questionnaire.        In three other cases not involving trespassing at home,       however, Gorsuch dissented from decisions that suppressed       evidence because of improper conduct by law enforcement. In       US v. Benard, he dissented from a decision to suppress       statements made by Benard after he had been arrested without       receiving Miranda warnings. Gorsuch argued that the error was       harmless, but the majority explained that they ``cannot       conclude'' that was correct ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' as       the law requires.        In US v. Nicholson, Gorsuch dissented from a ruling that       police officers had improperly stopped and then searched a       car for an alleged traffic violation, when there was no       violation at all because the driver's left turn was not       illegal. Gorsuch claimed it was a reasonable mistake, but the       majority explained that according to existing Circuit       precedent, ``failure to understand the law by the very person       charged with enforcing it is not objectively reasonable.''    To translate that, the police officer shouldn't stop somebody for  making a legal left turn when the left turn is legal.         And in US v. Dutton, Gorsuch dissented from a decision by       two other Republican appointees that a search warrant for a       storage unit contained a ``fatal flaw'' because the       application lacked ``any evidence'' that the unit belonged to       Dutton. Gorsuch called it a good faith error, but the       majority clearly disagreed.    So in these cases where he is dissenting, essentially the majority is  saying: You have to hold our public safety officers to a standard  required by law. And Gorsuch is saying: Well, it was good faith. It  wasn't an error. They didn't mean to do it. He is choosing to basically  say that the individuals will not be able to assert the error made on  the public safety side. It gives them a great big leash area, a big,  sizeable zone, and compresses the zone in which the individual is  acting. That is the pattern we see in this.         Other criminal issues.        In addition to Carloss, two of Gorsuch's other dissents       favorable to criminal defendants concerned prosecutions for       federal firearms violations. In US v. Ford, he argued in       dissent that prosecutors should have disclosed evidence       suggesting that the defendant was entrapped into purchasing a       machine gun, although the majority considered that evidence       not material to the defense. In US v. Games-Perez, Gorsuch       dissented from a decision not to rehear a case concerning a       federal law prohibiting possession of a gun by a felon.        Two other Gorsuch criminal law dissents that favor       defendants concerned unique issues. In US v. Nichols, he       argued in dissent that the full 10th Circuit should rehear a       case in which a sex offender was convicted of violating       requirements of the Sex Offender Registration and       Notification Act that he notify authorities when he travels       to another area. Nichols had been convicted prior to the date       of the Act, and Gorsuch argued that Congress had improperly       delegated to the attorney general wide authority to determine       to what extent the law applied to such offenders.    So apparently in that case the majority was pointing out that Nichols  had been convicted prior to the date of the act, and Gorsuch was  arguing that Congress had improperly delegated to the Attorney General  wide authority to determine to what extent the law applied.         Gorsuch also dissented in US v. Spaulding and disagreed       with a majority ruling that a lower court did not have       jurisdiction to set aside a criminal judgment that contains a       term of imprisonment.        In several other cases, however, Gorsuch dissented on the       merits from decisions by his colleagues that disfavored       prosecutors.        In US v. Rosales-Garcia, he dissented from a ruling that       the trial court judge had improperly enhanced the sentence of       an individual convicted of re-entering the country illegally       because of a prior conviction that resulted in a severe       sentence. The majority stated that ``we cannot agree'' with       Gorsuch's claim that the US Sentencing Guidelines could be       equally plausibly read to support the government's position.       As the majority explained, the sentence on the prior       conviction had been later enhanced because of the       individual's re-entry, not because of the original       misconduct, and thus should not qualify under the guidelines       as a reason to further increase the sentence imposed.        Gorsuch also dissented in US v. Raymond, in which one of       his Republican colleagues wrote an opinion affirming a lower       court decision to dismiss an indictment that violated a       previous plea agreement that prosecutors not bring additional       charges against Raymond arising out of conduct known to the       US Attorney before a specified date. Gorsuch argued that the       district judge had committed an error, but the majority       explained that ``we cannot disturb the district court's       factual finding'' that the US Attorney did have such       knowledge, based on specific testimony.    I am reading from a lengthy article prepared or at least issued under  the organization People for the American Way and titled ``The Dissents  of Judge Neil Gorsuch: Far to the Right and Out of the Mainstream'' by  Elliot Mincberg.   The article then turns to other constitutional issues. So I will  continue reading it. This article continues:         In addition to the criminal law and other cases discussed       above, Judge Gorsuch has written dissents from his       colleagues' opinions in three other cases related to       constitutional law issues: two relating to the Establishment       Clause and one relating to the Constitution's Guarantee       Clause. In all three, Gorsuch's dissent was significantly to       the right of even other Republican judges on the court or       raised other troubling concerns.        In Green v. Haskell County Board of Comm., a three-judge       panel of all Republican appointees had concluded that an       Oklahoma county's decision to approve the construction of and       maintain a Ten Commandments monument on its courthouse lawn       violated the Establishment Clause. Judge Gorsuch wrote an       opinion for himself and several other judges that dissented       from a decision by the full court of appeals, including       several other Republican appointees, not to rehear the case.       He argued that the panel's decision was inconsistent with the       Supreme Court's ruling in Van Orden v. Perry that upheld the       Ten Commandments monument in Texas, and suggested that the       court should not even use the establishment ``endorsement''       test to decide the case. As the panel decision explained,       however, the endorsement test remained the law in the Tenth       Circuit (and elsewhere), the monument clearly had the       ``primary effect of endorsing religion,'' and the Van Orden       decision did not apply because the case involving a monument       that has stood on public property for 40 years without       challenge, while the monument in Green was recently erected       and challenged. The Supreme Court denied review of the case.        Another panel of three Republican-appointed judges simply       ruled against the Utah Highway Patrol Association's       construction and maintenance of a series of 12-foot crosses       on public lands near roads to memorialize deceased officers,       explaining the crosses had the ``impermissible effect'' of       appearing to endorse the Christian religion. Judge Gorsuch       wrote an opinion for himself and other judges that dissented       from the decision of the full court of appeals, including       Republican appointed judges, not to not rehear the  [[Page S2267]]       case. Gorsuch again asserted that the ``endorsement'' test       should not be applied, and relied on a three-judge plurality       in another Supreme Court case, Salazar v. Buono, that allowed       a cross to remain on public property. As the panel explained,       however, the endorsement test clearly remained the law of the       Circuit, and the Buono case did not apply because it       concerned a cross that had been on government property since       the 1930s. The Supreme Court again denied review of the       case--    Which means they upheld the majority and did not uphold the position  that Gorsuch was taking--         Justice Thomas alone wrote a vigorous dissent, making some       of the same arguments as did Judge Gorsuch.        Finally, Judge Gorsuch and several others dissented from       the decision of the full 10th Circuit not to rehear a panel       decision in Kerr v. Hickenlooper. The panel had upheld a       district court decision to allow a claim by a number of State       legislators and others that the Colorado taxpayer bill of       rights, under which all tax increases must be approved in       advance by voters before legislative action, violated the       Constitution's Guarantee Clause. Under that clause, all       States are guaranteed a republican form of government where a       State legislature presumably makes such decisions. The panel       did not reach the merits of the claim, but agreed that there       was standing to go forward and the case should not be       dismissed as raising only a ``political question.''        Gorsuch argued that the issue was an unreviewable political       question because there were no ``judicially manageable       standards'' to decide it. The panel disagreed, pointing out       that no such standards existed in advance of the Supreme       Court's decisions on the Second Amendment. In addition,       Gorsuch ignored the fact, as one scholar has pointed out,       that the Supreme Court itself has ruled on the merits of the       Guarantee Clause claims as recently as 1992. Even more       importantly, Gorsuch's dissent suggested a particularly       troubling view on the subject of possible constitutional       challenges to partisan redistricting.    Continuing the analysis here as presented in this particular article:         In particular, in trying to support the argument to his       dissent, Gorsuch asserted that the Supreme Court had ``put to       bed'' in Vieth v. Jubilerer the question of whether the       partisan gerrymandering could be challenged constitutionally       because of the lack of manageable standards of review. As the       Campaign Legal Center has pointed out, however, that       statement is flatly wrong. Although some justices argued that       the issue cannot be reviewed, in his controlling opinion in       Vieth, Justice Kennedy recognized the corrosive effects of       partisan redistricting, and held the door open for       appropriate and judicially manageable standards in the       future. In fact, a recent decision from Wisconsin that       articulated such standards in striking down partisan       gerrymandering could well be reviewed soon by the Supreme       Court. Gorsuch's suggestion that he already agrees with the       justices in Vieth who claimed the issue should not be are he       viewed at all is extremely disturbing.    The article then has a short conclusion that reads as follows:         This review of Judge Gorsuch's dissents yields very       troubling conclusions. Consistently, he has argued in favor       of corporations and government authority and against workers,       consumers, environmentalists, and poor people, even when a       majority of his colleagues, including other Republican       appointees, disagree. In those rare instances when he does       not so argue, he has frequently sided with gun and       property owners. His views are clearly to the right of the       Supreme Court majority--even when Justice Scalia was on       the Court--on issues like the Sixth Amendment, partisan       gerrymandering, the non-delegation doctrine, and the       Establishment Clause. Measured against his own colleagues       on the Tenth Circuit including Republican appointees, he       is far to the right and out of the mainstream, and should       not be elevated to the Supreme Court.    So that is the article titled ``The Dissents of Judge Neil Gorsuch:  Far to the Right and Out of the Mainstream.''   Let's turn to an analysis of the ways that Neil Gorsuch threatens  women's rights. This is titled ``Extreme Far Right Judge'' from the  Center for American Progress. ``5 Ways the Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Threatens Women's Rights.'' It is from March 23, 2017.         The principle of equality is a cornerstone of American       democracy. From our nation's earliest history to the present       day, there has been a robust discussion about how to realize       the promise of equality and the everyday experiences of       people across the country. But equality in the United States       has come with an invisible asterisk: Its principles have not       been uniformly enjoyed across different segments of society.       Given this reality, people who face discrimination have       always depended on the courts to protect their access to       equal justice.    The article continues:         For women, the ongoing quest for equality has been a       deliberate--yet uneven--journey. The U.S. Supreme Court has       been pivotal in determining the pace and scope of this       progress. It is therefore critical that the next Supreme       Court justice has an unflinching commitment to an equality       that respects all women's dignity and autonomy, enables them       to participate fully in society, and empowers them to make       decisions about their lives that make sense for them.       President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court,       however, has a judicial record that suggests that he would       attack--not advance--women's equality if he is elevated to       the Supreme Court. A close look at Judge Neil Gorsuch's       record reveals that his appointment would likely threaten       women's rights in the following five ways.    The first area of the article addresses his putting employers'  preferences ahead of women's rights. And then it continues:         Gorsuch favors protecting the religious preferences of       employers at their employees' expense. If confirmed, he would       further erode women's ability to make sound personal health       decisions. In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, Gorsuch and his       colleagues on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled       that a closely held, for-profit corporation could refuse on       religious grounds to comply with the Affordable Care Act, or       ACA, requirement that health insurance cover contraception.       Judge Gorsuch wrote a separate concurrence to the court's       ruling, explaining the ACA mandate forced the corporations to       violate their religious beliefs. A divided U.S. Supreme Court       upheld the 10th Circuit's decision.        While conservative judges frame the case as a dispute about       religious freedom, Hobby Lobby was also a case about women's       equality and the rights of employees. The ability to control       fertility is one of the most personal decisions a person can       make; for women, it goes to the heart of whether they have an       equal right to participate in the workforce and start a       family. Yet, Gorsuch deems these interests secondary to a       corporation's religious preferences.    The second area the article addresses is refusing to support  protections from pregnancy discrimination.         Because many women will take time off from work at some       point in their careers for the birth of a child, the       Pregnancy Discrimination Act was enacted in 1978 to make       clear that discrimination based on pregnancy or child birth       constitutes sex discrimination. Yet, too many women continue       to confront discriminatory, outdated attitudes about their       ability and commitment to work simply because they are or       might become pregnant.        Two of Gorsuch's former students at the University of       Colorado Law School allege that, during a discussion about       maternity leave in Gorsuch's legal ethics class, he stated       that employers should ask female applicants whether they       intend to start a family. He reportedly argued that women       often manipulate maternity leave policies to take time off at       the company's expense before leaving the company.        When asked about this at his Senate confirmation hearing,       Gorsuch first denied making the comments, claiming he had       merely asked students a question from a teacher's text to       illustrate the prevalence of sex discrimination. But when       asked about his specific views on pregnancy discrimination       laws, Gorsuch raised more questions than answers. He declined       to say whether questioning a female and not male applicants       about their intent to start a family would violate the law.       Gorsuch's unwillingness to clearly affirm protections against       pregnancy discrimination is cause for concern. Women's       ability to participate fully and equally in the workforce       depends on fair treatment without regard to family       responsibilities.    I am reading from the article, ``5 Ways the Nomination of Neil  Gorsuch Threatens Women's Rights,'' March 23, 2017. The article now  addresses the issue of undoing Roe v. Wade.         Throughout the Presidential campaign, Trump promised to       nominate a Supreme Court justice who would ``automatically       overturn Roe v. Wade. Judge Gorsuch admitted he spoke with       President Donald Trump about abortion in his pre-nomination       interview but claimed their conversation was limited to the       issue's political impact.        Gorsuch has declined to discuss his views on Rowe at his       hearing, beyond acknowledging that it is ``precedent.'' But       his writings make his position clear. Gorsuch has argued       against the legal principles on which Roe is founded, both       indirectly in his opinions and more directly in his book       criticizing assisted suicide. He is critical of the right to       privacy and the substantive due process rationale used by the       Supreme Court in support of this right. Without this right to       privacy, there is no Constitutional right to make decisions       about sex, reproduction, or even marriage without State       interference. Moreover, preserving and protecting a women's       constitutionally protected legal right to access abortion is       critical to their individual dignity and autonomy.    That is another section in the article, ``5 Ways the Nomination of  Neil Gorsuch Threatens Women's Rights.'' The next section is  ``Eliminating women's access to health care.'' This will be the fourth  of the five sections.         Conservatives have relentlessly attacked women's access to       quality, affordable health  [[Page S2268]]       care, threatening their agency, health, and well-being. Among       the most vitriolic and inflammatory efforts: the push to       defund Planned Parenthood. Anti-abortion activists have       targeted Planned Parenthood because it provides abortion       services, even though those services are provided with       nonfederal funds and make up only a small percentage of the       services the organization provides. An estimated 2.5 million       people visit one of the 650 Planned Parenthood facilities       across the country each year. Eliminating funding for those       health centers would devastate entire communities and       dramatically reduce women's access to health care.        During Gorsuch's time on the 10th Circuit, the court upheld       an injunction to stop Utah Gov. Gary Herbert . . . from       defunding Planned Parenthood in response to misinformation to       doctored videos that falsely accused the organization of       selling fetal tissue. Gorsuch, however, took the unusual step       of pushing for a rehearing by the full court, even though the       Governor did not ask for a rehearing. When his colleagues       declined to rehear the case, Gorsuch dissented and attempted       to legitimize the governor's unsupported claims.    The fifth section in this article titled ``5 Ways the Nomination of  Neil Gorsuch Threatens Women's Rights'' is the section on ``Denying  women access to justice.''         No one can vindicate their rights if they cannot even make       it to court. Yet, in several cases, Gorsuch has shown a       conspicuous penchant for barring women from litigating       discrimination claims.        In Strickland v. UPS, Carole Strickland alleged that she       was discriminated against when she was held to higher       performance standards than her male coworkers, even as she       exceeded them in sales. The majority ruled that her case       could move forward, but Gorsuch filed a dissent arguing that       her evidence of discrimination, which included testimony from       multiple co-workers, was insufficient.        In another case, Weeks v. Kansas, former counsel Rebecca       Weeks alleged she was fired in retaliation for advocating for       colleagues who experienced workplace discrimination. Upon       review, Gorsuch openly ignored relevant U.S. Supreme Court       precedent because Weeks failed to cite it and denied her the       right to proceed with her claim. If Gorsuch is confirmed,       women may face new barriers to challenging discrimination in       court.        Judge Gorsuch could become a reliable vote against the       critical rights essential to women's equality and women's       progress--such as the ability to access reproductive health       care, including abortion, and challenge different forms of       sex discrimination in the workplace. Women deserve a Supreme       Court justice who will not turn back the clock on their       rights. The Senate should stand up for women and reject       President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.    The author, Jocelyn Frye, is a senior fellow at American Progress,  and coauthor Michele Jawando is vice president for legal progress at  American Progress.   Let's turn now to an article on money and politics. This article by  Arn Pearson appeared in the Huffington Post. It is titled ``Gorsuch  Would Move the Supreme Court in the Wrong Direction on Money in  Politics.''   The article starts out:         Who the Senate confirms to fill the current vacancy at the       U.S. Supreme Court will determine the nature of our elections       for decades to come.        The Court is closely divided on the issue of whether to       further open the floodgates for unlimited and undisclosed       political spending or allow limits designed to prevent       corruption and keep powerful special interests from drowning       out the voices of voters. The next justice will tip the       scales one way or the other.        While the court may be split on what to do about the       influence of big money in politics, the American people are       not.        Nine out of ten voters (93 percent) want ``a Supreme Court       justice who is open to limiting the influence of big money in       politics,'' according to recent polling. That includes 91       percent of Trump supporters, most of whom apparently believed       his populist rhetoric decrying the influence of big donors.        Unfortunately, that's not Neil Gorsuch.        Gorsuch hasn't handled many campaign finance reform cases,       but everything in his background and record strongly       indicates that he would favor fewer restrictions on political       spending by corporations and the wealthy, not more.        The son of two lawyers, Gorsuch has spent his life moving       in elite legal and corporate circles, and has been a strong       ideological conservative since his early days. He attended       Columbia University and Oxford, and earned his law degree at       Harvard. From 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch worked at a boutique D.C.       corporate law firm representing corporate clients--including       the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--in anti-trust, class action,       and securities lawsuits, before briefly joining the       Department of Justice under George W. Bush and being       nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.        The Chamber of Commerce spends more money to influence the       federal government than any other organization, and was one       of the top political spenders in 2016, making it among the       biggest beneficiaries of the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in       Citizens United that allowed corporations to spend unlimited       amounts on independent expenditures and electioneering.        Gorsuch hasn't exactly left the corporate world behind       since becoming a judge, and has become a millionaire in his       own right.        A recent story by the New York Times documents Gorsuch's       close relationship with secretive billionaire Phillip       Anschutz, who has amassed $12.6 billion in wealth through a       sprawling business empire. Gorsuch represented Anschutz while       in corporate law practice, and Anschutz played a key role in       getting Gorsuch nominated to the federal appeals court.    I am reading from an article entitled, ``Gorsuch Would Move the  Supreme Court in the Wrong Direction on Money in Politics.''         Gorsuch has been a frequently featured guest at the mogul's       annual dove-hunting retreat for the rich and powerful on his       Eagle Nest Ranch. At the 2010 retreat, Gorsuch spoke about       the importance of judicial nominations, ``especially when we       live in a system where judges have the last word'' on the       Constitution and are ``empowered to strike down       legislation.'' Gorsuch implored his elite audience ``to be       vigilant to all threats to our prosperity.''        Not surprisingly, Gorsuch's rulings as a federal appeals       court judge have consistently favored large corporations over       consumers and workers, and indicate a willingness to overturn       key Court precedents that have supported efforts to reign in       corporate power since the New Deal.        The big question is whether Gorsuch would use his seat on       the Supreme Court to further weaken anti-corruption measures       when it comes to political spending.        People for the American Way joined 120 other democracy       reform and advocacy organizations and 110 House members this       week--    This would have been March 17--       in calling on the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate       leadership to closely scrutinize Gorsuch's views on the       influence of big money in politics.        ``Will Judge Gorsuch's legal philosophy lead him to strike       down even more protections against the use of corporate or       personal wealth to influence elections, such as candidate and       party contribution limits, or will he permit sensible limits       on political money in order to ensure the voices and will of       all Americans are fully represented within the political       process?'' the groups asked.        In Citizens United v. FEC, the 5-4 majority decreed that       independent expenditures by corporations ``do not give rise       to corruption or the appearance of corruption'' and that       ``[t]he appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will       not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.'' In       reaching that conclusion, the Court assumed that those       expenditures would not be coordinated with candidates, and       that they would be disclosed.        Almost everyone in America thinks big money in politics is       a problem (94 percent) and that it ``empowers wealthy special       interests over everyday Americans'' (93 percent), according       to a recent poll.        Taken to its logical and legal conclusion, the reasoning in       Citizens United--that corporations have the same right as       people, that money is speech, and that laws can't distinguish       between speakers--puts the little that remains of our       nation's post-Watergate scandal reforms at grave risk. So       far, the Court has rebuffed challenges to the federal ban on       direct corporate contributions to candidates and to most       contribution limits, but Gorsuch's confirmation could change       that.        In one of his only campaign finance cases, Riddle v.       Hickenlooper, Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion that       suggests he would apply the highest level of scrutiny to       contribution limits that distinguish between types of       contributors. To date, the Supreme Court has applied a lower       level of scrutiny to contribution limits, including that       reasonable limits only impose a marginal restriction on First       Amendment rights.        Gorsuch's opinion signals that he might be willing to       strike down a ban on corporate campaign contributions on       Equal Protection grounds.        Relatedly, Gorsuch joined the majority in the controversial       Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius case, which relied heavily on       Citizens United to extend religious liberty protections to       corporations. Indeed, Gorsuch would like to have taken things       even further to hold that any individual owners of the       corporation could challenge laws that allegedly impinge on       their beliefs.        When viewed together, those two cases support the troubling       conclusion that a Justice Gorsuch would be more likely to       expand on Citizens United's anti-reform rationale than to       walk it back.        Outside spending has more than doubled since Citizens       United and our elections are awash in cash--most of it from       the super rich, and much of it secret.        According to a new study by Demos, the Supreme Court's       string of decisions deregulating campaign spending over the       past decade was responsible for $1.3 billion in spending on       the presidential race and 77 percent of the money flowing       into competitive races in 2016.        Campaign spending isn't charity. Most big donors have a       stake in government decisions and want something in return.       The result? Increasingly, concentrated economic power is       translating into concentrated political power, and the rest       of us are left on the sidelines.  [[Page S2269]]         By all appearances, Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme       Court would move the country further in that troubling       direction by granting corporations new rights and crippling       government's ability to protect Americans from the exercise       of increased corporate power. Yet three out of four voters       want Congress to reject any Supreme Court nominee ``who will       help the wealthy and privileged wield too much power over our       elections.''        It's not hard to connect the dots. Confirming Gorsuch would       take the country down a path very few of us want, with       damaging results for the health of our democracy.    So that is the completion of the article entitled ``Gorsuch Would  Move the Supreme Court in the Wrong Direction on Money in Politics'' by  Arn Pearson from March 17, 2017, in the Huffington Post.   This issue of money in politics is a huge one for the future of our  country. If we do not succeed in reversing the decisions that have  unleashed a flow of largely secret money concentrated in the hands of  the megawealthy into campaigns, then there is no way that you end up  with a House or Senate that reflects the will of the people.   The President seemed to campaign saying that he cared about workers,  about ordinary people, but he has nominated an individual who gives  every indication of fully supporting the ability of money to be  concentrated in campaigns by the most wealthiest individuals in our  country and in fact corrupting the outcome.   I mentioned earlier that you can see this corrupting power by looking  at the disappearance of the interests of my colleagues across the aisle  in the environment. It used to be that Republicans were often  expressing a lot of interest in the sustainable management of the  environment.   It was President Nixon who created the Environmental Protection  Agency and the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, and many colleagues  expressed a lot of interest in taking on one of the most diabolical  sources of pollution, carbon dioxide. But that interest has completely  disappeared since the fossil fuel industry put ``bazillions'' of  dollars into the Republican Senate campaigns--completely disappeared.  Isn't that exactly the type of corruption that the Supreme Court said  they didn't expect to see?   Let me tell you that we have seen this pollutant, carbon dioxide,  surge in the atmosphere. Going back 20 to 30 years ago, there was an  increase per year in the parts per million in the atmosphere of about  one per year. So you might go from 350 to 351 parts per million in 1  year, and 351 to 352 the next. Now what we see is that the rate of  pollution has increased, and we are seeing close to an increase of 2  parts per million. This is not at one location. This is dispersed  carbon dioxide pollution across the world. This pollutant is directly  the product of burning fossil fuels, coal, and gas and oil.   So we have been extracting and burning these fuels for 150 years, and  they have greatly magnified the amount of work that can be done by a  human. When we used to evaluate how much work you can do, we talked  about horsepower--1 horsepower, 2 horsepower.   I was working in a village once where I was asked to help a man whose  nephew plowed a field in a remote hilltop, and we had a 2 horsepower  plow. We actually had a horse and mule pulling that plow. The man told  me that that combination was very good because the horse responded to  commands better and got the mule to behave, and the mule was better at  pulling the plow. So that was the combination. That was 2 horsepower.  But when you burn fossil fuels, you create a tremendous amount of  energy. We don't talk about our cars with 1 or 2 horsepower; we talk  about 100 horsepower or 200 horsepower.   Burning fossil fuels has enabled us to transform the face of this  planet in a few generations. Sometimes that has been an extremely  positive development--better housing, better transportation systems.  But there is an enormous dark side to the burning of fossil fuels, and  that dark side is the product, the pollutant, carbon dioxide. As it is  accumulating in the atmosphere, it is providing the blanket that is  causing the Earth to warm, and that warming is a very destructive force  on our farming, on our fishing, and on our forests. We used to talk  about computer models and what might happen in the future. Now we  simply pick up a newspaper and every day there is a news story of some  impact of global warming.   In my home State of Oregon, we have a fire season that is two months  longer than it was 40 years ago, with more acreage of forests burning  and more heat doing more damage. We have the spread of insects like  pine beetles, which would have been killed by colder winters but are  not killed by the warmer winters. We have a snowpack in the Cascades  that, while it can go up and down year to year, in general has been  declining, meaning less water for streams. So we have warmer, smaller  trout streams, and we have less water for irrigation, and we have over  on the coast a challenge with our oysters that reflects another  consequence of the growing pollution of carbon dioxide. That carbon  dioxide is absorbed into the ocean. A significant amount of it is  absorbed into the ocean and converted into carbonic acid. This acid  then, having changed the chemistry of water, makes it much more  difficult for sea life to form shells.   At about the time that I was running for office--running for the U.S.  Senate in 2007, 2008--there was a problem encountered by the Whiskey  Creek Oyster Hatchery in that its baby oysters were not thriving, often  dying, and they wondered why.   They turned to researchers at Oregon State University. They thought  maybe that this was a virus, but it was not. They thought maybe this  was a bacteria, and it was not a bacteria. Finally, they found  something that had been staring them in the face, which was that the  water was too acidic. The water they were pulling through a big pipe  out of the ocean was too acidic because of the carbonic acid. The  result was that the baby oysters had difficulty in forming their  shells. It is not just the baby oysters, as coral reefs are being  profoundly impacted across the world.   There is a researcher from Oregon State University, Professor  Dickson, who has made studying coral reefs his life's work. He did a  briefing here in DC. It was probably 7 or so years ago--6 or 7 years  ago. He showed some slides of the coral reefs that he had been  studying--what they used to look like and what they looked like today.  He said: These reefs are my babies, and my babies are dying. They are  dying because the temperature of the water is warmer and more acidic.   You may wonder how this affects the corals. First, as with the oyster  shells, they have more difficulty in forming their bodies. Coral is an  animal, and it lives in a symbiotic relationship with algae. When the  changes occur in the water, the algae can multiply at a rate that is  not supportable by the coral, and the coral ejects them. This is  referred to as bleaching. If circumstances do not change quickly, the  coral will die because it has ejected its symbiotic partner on which it  depends in order to live. There are reports that, over the past few  years, 80 percent of the Great Barrier Reef, off of Australia, has  died.   So here we have this massive problem that is facing the planet-- carbon pollution. It is having a huge impact on our farming for  irrigation water. Certainly, in our fishing, it is affecting things  like coral reefs and oysters and in our forests, with there being more  intense forest fires. Yet we here are doing so little to face this and  address this.   Why are we doing so little?   We are doing so little because the coal and oil billionaires have  proceeded to invest so much money in third-party Senate campaigns to  elect one side of the aisle and defeat the other side. They become the  controlling power behind what happens here on the floor of the Senate.   Those interests, most prominently represented by the Koch brothers,  do not want us to take on this issue of global warming and carbon  pollution because to take it on means to transform our energy economy  from extracting and burning fossil fuels, which they own vast amounts  of, to clean and renewable energy, which does not create carbon  dioxide--solar energy and wind energy. This group of companies--the  Koch brothers and friends--is doing everything it can to make sure that  this body sustains the subsidies we give to it and not help the success  of the clean and renewable energy that might replace the fossil fuels.   Look at it this way: Imagine that you have a set of doctors and they  have  [[Page S2270]]  an enormous disease affecting a city, but the donors behind the doctors  have a big stake and do not want them--the doctors--to address the  illness. That is corruption, and that is what we have right here, right  now.   We have a Senate that is corrupted by Citizens United and dark money  that flows through the campaigns and causes Senators who were concerned  about the environment to decide that, if they want to stay in office,  they had better not talk about it and they had sure better not do  anything about it. In addition, this fossil fuel cartel wants to make  sure it has a corps that continues this corruption. That is why they  put so much pressure on Senators not to consider Merrick Garland when  he was nominated last year, in 2016.   For the first time in the history of our country, when there was a  vacancy during a campaign year--an election year--the Senate failed to  do its responsibility under the advice and consent clause of the  Constitution. There were 15 times when we had previously had a vacancy  during an election year, and 15 times the Senate had responded, but not  last year, not on turn No. 16. Why was that? It is because the oil and  coal cartel did not want Senators to consider a Justice who might,  actually, end this corrupt system of the funding of campaigns.   You can see that their influence comes on multiple levels in terms of  direct pressure on policies for those who sit in the Senate but also in  terms of determining who sits in the Senate to begin with. In this  article, Gorsuch would move the Supreme Court in the wrong direction on  money and politics. This is not just one issue among dozens of others.  This is a key issue as to whether or not we have a ``we the  people'' government, which we are in the process of losing. We are  fighting this nomination because we are fighting to keep this vision-- our constitutional vision.    Our Founders were well aware that the powerful want to have a  government that serves the powerful. They saw it throughout Europe.  They said: We are going to do it differently in the United States of  America. We are not going to have a government by and for the powerful.  We are going to have a government by and for the people.   This is where Jefferson was concerned about whether we could sustain  such a government--one that would make decisions that reflected the  will of the people. He noted that we must, in order to have that  happen, have individuals--each citizen--have an equal voice. But  Citizens United and the philosophy for the powerful of Neil Gorsuch is  the opposite of Jefferson's mother principle. It is the opposite of  ``we the people.'' That is why, when we come to a vote on closing  debate on this nominee, at least 41 of us are going to stand up and  say: absolutely not. We are going to stand for the integrity of the  United States. We are going to stand for the integrity of our  Constitution. We are going to stand for the integrity of the Senate,  and we, certainly, are going to stand for the integrity of the Supreme  Court. That vote should be 100 to zero to oppose closing debate, but at  least 41 of us care about this Constitution, and we will be doing all  we can to try to save our Nation.   I am going to share an article by Paul Gordon: ``Real People, Real  Lives: The Harm Caused By Judge Gorsuch.'' This article was written in  February of 2017.         When Donald Trump was running for president, he outsourced       his future selection of potential Supreme Court nominees to       two right wing organizations, the Federalist Society and the       Heritage Foundation. They provided him a list of 21 people       who were acceptable to them, Trump (the candidate) promised       to select a nominee from the list they gave him, and they and       their right wing colleagues agreed to support him. Neil       Gorsuch was nominated as the product of this political       arrangement.        So it is no surprise that Judge Gorsuch has a history of       regularly finding ways to put corporations and the powerful       first. In that way, he is much like his idol and role model       Antonin Scalia and the other far right conservatives on the       Supreme Court. And while this unbalanced approach to cases       might make for interesting reading, the courtroom is not an       academic paper. Each case involves real people with real       problems. While a judicial decision might be just another day       at work for some judges, it is often one of the most       important and impactful days in the lives of the people       involved. Below are some of the cases Judge Gorsuch has been       involved with and the people who have been affected by them--      people who have been victimized outside the courtroom and, to       the extent Gorsuch's view prevails, are victimized again.    (Mr. JOHNSON assumed the Chair.)   The article continues by turning to the case of Pinkerton v. Colorado  Department of Transportation, 2009.         How many men serving as Federal judges on circuit courts       have experienced increasingly blatant sexual harassment from       a supervisor over a period of weeks and months? Probably not       many. Perhaps that played a role when Judge Neil Gorsuch       joined Paul Kelly's opinion upholding the dismissal of a       fired woman's case alleging outrageous sexual harassment       and retaliation.        Betty Pinkerton experienced two months of escalating sexual       harassment from David Martinez, her supervisor, at her job       with the Colorado Department of Transportation. The       harassment began in December 2002 when Martinez asked her,       ``What does a divorced 52 year [old] lady do when she gets       sexual urges?'' As she unfortunately had to do several times       over the next two months, Pinkerton told him he was being       inappropriate in asking such personal questions.        The harassment continued through January and February.       Every time she made it clear that his comments were not       welcome, but the harassment continued.        So on February 19, 2003, she reported the harassment to the       office of the civil rights administrator and formally filed a       written complaint on February 24. About three weeks later,       Martinez was removed as Pinkerton's supervisor, and on March       21 he was formally found to have engaged in sexually       inappropriate conduct with her.        But six days later, Pinkerton was fired.        She sued the Department of Transportation, claiming it was       liable for the hostile work environment Martinez had imposed       on her. But in Pinkerton v. Colorado Department of       Transportation, Judges Gorsuch and Kelly uphold the ruling of       a magistrate judge that she had waited too long (two months)       to report the harassment and the claim could not go to trial.    But as the dissenting Judge, David Ebel, pointed out, there could  have been justifiable reasons for the delay. Perhaps she felt the  harassment wasn't sufficient enough to file a complaint until it  elevated to a certain point, or maybe she thought she could get her  supervisor to stop without the involvement of the civil rights office  and without possibly damaging her relationships with others in the  office.         In addition, although this was not mentioned in the       dissent, perhaps the judges in the majority had insufficient       personal familiarity with repeated sexual harassment to know       the many reasons a woman might not promptly file a complaint.       But instead of letting a jury decide the question of fact as       to whether she waited ``too long,'' Gorsuch and Kelly took it       upon themselves to be the jurors and decided this factual       issue on their own.        Pinkerton also claimed that the Department of       Transportation had fired her as retaliation for reporting the       sexual harassment, while her employer cited poor performance       as the cause, each side having supporting evidence. Here too,       Judge Gorsuch took the issue away from a jury. He joined       Judge Kelly's majority opinion in a detailed analysis of all       the evidence (like a jury would have done at trial), decided       that no reasonable jury would find the Department of       Transportation fired her for any reason but poor performance,       and therefore dismissed her retaliation claim.        That's the jury's job, not theirs. As Judge Ebel noted in       his dissent, each side presented evidence supporting their       position, and the case should have gone to trial so the jury       could do what it is supposed to do: Determine the motive for       the firing. Judge Ebel listed several factors that a jury       might consider to determine that the employer's rationale of       job performance was simply a pretext for her firing. For       instance:        The State Department of Transportation director testified       that the most serious error leading to Pinkerton's firing was       an allegedly mishandled call from an employee's daughter that       had happened about four years earlier.        The director tried to get Pinkerton another job with the       state Department of Transportation only months before she was       fired.        As Judge Ebel noted, ``It is a jury's function to determine       whether an employer acted with a retaliatory motive.'' But       Judge Gorsuch chose to join his colleague as the jury so that       Pinkerton would not have the issue decided by a jury of her       peers.    I am reading from an article called ``Real People, Real Lives: The  Harm Caused By Judge Gorsuch,'' by Paul Gordon, March 2017.   The article now turns to the case of Caplinger v. Medtronic in 2015.  The headline of this section is ``Medical Device Maker Pushes Misuse of  Product: Protecting a Corporation From Its Victims.''   It starts out saying:         Illness can be frightening. We turn our health and our       lives over to medical personnel and there are many devices of       healing. While the physician is highly trained in  [[Page S2271]]       medicine, the device manufacturers are highly trained in       selling their products to the physicians. Patricia Caplinger       learned this the hard way.        Suffering from a degenerative disc condition, Patricia       Caplinger and her doctor discussed her options. Medtronic had       developed the ``Infuse Bone Graft device,'' which stimulated       bone growth. The FDA had only approved its use for surgeries       entering the body from the front, but a Medtronic       representative recommended an ``off-label'' usage: Enter from       behind to use the Infuse device. Not knowing that Medtronic       had evidence that such posterior approaches could actually       cause serious complications, both Caplinger and her doctor       chose to follow Medtronic's advice. The company's       representative was even present for the operation.        The consequences of the company's recommendation were       terrible for Caplinger, because posterior use of the device       resulted in too much bone growth. Two or three months after       the procedure, her symptoms returned and worsened. She       developed foot drop as a result, which in turn led to a knee       ligament tear requiring surgery. The rapid overgrowth of new       bone in her spine led to additional surgery, but the       overgrowth continued nonetheless, requiring yet another       surgery.        Because of the harm she suffered, Caplinger filed a       complaint against Medtronic in court. In her lawsuit,       Caplinger presented evidence of the lengths to which       Medtronic went to facilitate off-label use of its Infuse       product. These included bribing doctors, paying kickbacks for       promoting such uses, and funding misleading scientific       studies that provided a false impression of the safety of       these off-label uses.        Nevertheless, writing for a split panel in Caplinger v.       Medtronic, Gorsuch agreed with the lower court that every       charge of Caplinger's state-law lawsuit was preempted by       federal law. The dissenting judge agreed in part, but       concluded that Caplinger's negligence and failure-to-warn       claims were not necessarily preempted. He wrote: ``My       disagreement with the majority opinion does not turn on the       substance of federal preemption law. Instead, our       disagreement turns on our respective characterization of       Caplinger's pleadings and understanding of the proper burden       at this stage of the litigation.''        All three judges seemed to agree that Caplinger's briefs       were not written very clearly to address all the facets of       the preemption issue. One judge was willing to interpret them       to give her another chance to make her case, but Gorsuch       chose to characterize Caplinger's pleadings in such a way as       to ensure her case would be dismissed.        The executives at Medtronic were very likely very relieved.    This article, ``Real People, Real Lives: The Harm Caused by Judge  Gorsuch'' now turns to address ``Gorsuch and Children with Autism:  Removing the Chance to Learn Lifetime Skills.''         When Congress passed the Individuals With Disabilities       Education Act, it was a major step forward in making sure       children with disabilities had a free and appropriate public       education. But Luke P., a child with autism living in       Colorado, was denied this right by Judge Gorsuch, negatively       affecting not just him but other kids throughout the Tenth       Circuit.        Luke was two years old when he was diagnosed with autism,       and when he entered school, he had an education plan specific       to his needs, as required by IDEA. Between kindergarten and       third grade, he made significant progress in skills relating       to communication, self-care (including use of the toilet),       independence, motor skills, social interactions, and academic       functioning.        But there was an enormous problem for Luke. He was       generally unable to transfer his skills into environments       other than school. So when he was home or otherwise out of       school, he continued to have significant problems.        Fortunately, his parents learned about a residential       private school specializing in educating children with       autism. If he could gain admittance, Luke would live at the       school for 44 weeks of the year, and he would be supervised       24 hours a day. It was a great opportunity to not only       advance in the skills learned in school, but to generalize       them so they weren't place-dependent. His parents enrolled       him there with updated education goals and a new plan to       achieve them. They then applied to the school district to       reimburse them (since IDEA promises a free education). But       the district refused. They were willing to accept Luke's       updated plan, but they insisted those goals could be met at       the public school he'd been attending.        His parents refused to send him back to a school that had       achieved some success but had also failed Luke in many       important ways and continued to seek reimbursement. A hearing       officer, an administrative law judge, and a federal district       court judge all agreed that Luke's inability to generalize       his skills demonstrated that the school district had failed       to provide him with the free appropriate public education       required by law. Only the residential program could do that,       meaning the district needed to reimburse Luke's family.        Then Judge Gorsuch stepped in, taking away Luke's       opportunities and risking his entire future.        Writing for a Tenth Circuit panel in Thompson R2-J School       District v. Luke P., Gorsuch ruled in favor of the school       district. They had met their obligation to Luke because all       they had to do was provide an educational benefit that was       more than de minimis. That is quite a low bar, one that could       easily prevent Luke and other children from acquiring the       critical lifetime skills they will need throughout their       school years and for the rest of their lives.        Fortunately, there is hope: This term, the Supreme Court is       considering a different case challenging the ``de minimis''       standard. A decision in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School       District is expected by the end of June. Luke's family and       families across the nation will be looking to the Supreme       Court to protect their children.   What this article doesn't note is that the Supreme Court just handed  down a decision 8 to 0 overturning the position Judge Gorsuch had in  this case. They ruled that the IDEA Act was intended to ``provide an  educational benefit that was more than de minimis.'' Merely more than  nothing, I believe, was Gorsuch's standard. Merely more than nothing-- if you have done that, you have met the test. The Supreme Court said:  No, the whole point of the act was to provide an appropriate education.  It wasn't one or two Justices rejecting Gorsuch's writing, his  interpretation of the law--basically, his decision to ignore the law,  which is what he did in his decision. They ruled 8 to 0. They basically  kicked that decision clear out of the field of common sense or a  rational interpretation of what the IDEA Act says. So that was a  powerful addition to that story.   Let me return to the article. This section is called ``No Leave  Extension for Leukemia Patient: Gorsuch's Cramped View of What Makes an  Accommodation Reasonable.'' This is the case of Hwang v. Kansas State  University, in 2013.         Grace Hwang, a longtime assistant professor at Kansas State       University, received frightening news in June of 2009: Her       doctors diagnosed her as having leukemia. Without aggressive       chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, she would die. She       had to spend six months in medical facilities, during which       time she was on a paid leave of absence. But she made sure       her work got done: She prepared the instructors who were       stepping in for her, including by sharing her teaching       materials, lesson plans, and syllabi. Even while she was       hospitalized, she consulted with the substitutes through       phone calls and e-mails.        In January, after her six-month ordeal, Professor Hwang was       looking forward to returning to work. But there was a severe       outbreak of swine flu on campus, and her physicians warned       her that, due to her compromised immune system, she should       stay away from campus. So she informed university officials       that she would need some additional leave--hopefully, a short       time, but potentially as long as the entire semester,       depending on the flu situation and her immune system.        But the university refused to grant her additional leave.       Their reason? Because they have a policy that caps a leave of       absence at six months, which she had used up. Professor Hwang       sued them for violating the Rehabilitation Act, which       requires employers to provide a reasonable accommodation for       someone's disability. She was unsuccessful before the       district court.        The Rehabilitation Act calls for accommodation requests to       be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Every situation is       unique, depending on any number of factors. That is why       Congress chose not to set a point at which a leave of absence       was no longer a reasonable accommodation.        But when Professor Hwang appealed to the Tenth Circuit,       Judge Gorsuch ruled against her in an opinion very much       focused on the length of time from its very opening (Hwang v.       Kansas Sate University (2013)). He set Professor Hwang up to       lose in the very first paragraph. He could have opened the       opinion in a neutral manner by asking whether extending her       leave would create an undue burden for the university.       Instead, he chose to frame the legal issue from the       university's perspective, casting the employer as the victim:        Must an employer allow employees more than six months' sick       leave or face liability under the Rehabilitation Act?       Unsurprisingly, the answer is almost always no.        Judge Gorsuch concluded that the professor simply could not       perform the duties of her job without being present on       campus, and an accommodation past six months was not       reasonable under the Rehabilitation Act.        The Rehabilitation Act seeks to prevent employers from       callously denying reasonable accommodations that permit       otherwise disqualified disabled persons to work--not to turn       employers into safety net providers for those who cannot       work.        Since Professor Hwang performed work while hospitalized to       ensure her classes were taught effectively in her absence, it       is hard to imagine that she could not do any work from home.       She was simply seeking a hopefully-short extension of her       leave so she could do her work in person without risking her       life. It is also difficult to see how her efforts to retain a       job she'd excelled at for  [[Page S2272]]       more than a decade was just an effort to turn her employer       into [as Judge Gorsuch termed it] ``a safety net provider.''        When Professor Hwang was first diagnosed, she probably had       no idea that her treatment would cost her her job.    These are stories from the article, ``Real People, Real Lives: The  Harm Caused By Judge Gorsuch.''   The next section is titled ``Excessive Force: Immunity For Police  Officer Who Kills Young Man Over Marijuana Plants.''         Wilson v. City of Lafayette (2013).        Wendy and Jack Wilson learned about Gorsuch's approach to       the law the hard way when they sought to hold police officer       John Harris accountable for needlessly killing their son       Ryan. Their son had been standing near an area known for       growing marijuana, and he admitted the plants were his. Then       he ran. Officer Harris chased him until Ryan reached a fence,       where he stopped. Officer Harris saw Ryan start to reach into       his pocket and warned him not to, in case it held a weapon.       As Ryan turned to run again, Officer Harris shot him in the       back of the head or neck with a Taser, killing him.        But in Wilson v. City of Lafayette (2013), Judge Gorsuch       concluded that Harris hadn't used unconstitutionally       excessive force, so the parents' case shouldn't even go to       trial. Another judge observed in her dissent that Gorsuch's       opinion        . . . fails to give sufficient weight to the fact that the       Taser used by Officer Harris on August 4, 2006, had a       targeting function, that Officer Harris fired at Ryan Wilson       from only ten to fifteen feet away, and the training manual       specifically warned officers against aiming it at the head or       throat unless necessary.        Given all this, the Wilsons certainly had a legal argument       of excessive force they should have been able to present at a       trial. But Gorsuch shut that possibility down. After losing       their son, they lost the opportunity to hold anyone       accountable for his completely unnecessary killing.        So much for ``And Justice For All.''    The next story in this article, ``Real People, Real Lives'' is  ``Worker Dies Due to Inadequate Training, but Gorsuch Tries to Rule for  the Company,'' the case of Compass Environmental, otherwise known as  the case of the electrocuted miner.         Chris Carder also died needlessly, but in this case it was       from a workplace accident in which he was electrocuted.       Carder worked as a trench hand at a mine site, which involved       using rubber and metal hose with a metal nozzle to dispense       grease. Since there was a live power line crossing over the       construction site, the safety training everyone received       warned trench hands and others to keep at least twenty feet       from the powerline. However, Carder started on the job a week       after everyone else and, in a decision that had tragic       consequences, this safety measure was not included in       Carder's individual training. An accident ensued when the       nozzle was too close to the power line, and Carder was       fatally electrocuted.        Looking into the accident, the Department of Labor's       Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC)       concluded that Carder could have avoided electrocution had he       been adequately trained by his employer (Compass       Environmental) about the highly dangerous situation he       faced--training that the other on-site employees had       received. OSHRC [Occupational Safety and Health Review       Commission] issued a serious citation against Compass for       inadequate training, and it imposed a financial penalty       against the company. This was upheld by a Tenth Circuit       panel, but with Judge Gorsuch in dissent.        While the majority in Compass Environmental v. OSHRC (2011)       criticized Gorsuch's case analysis, perhaps most striking was       Gorsuch's decision to open his dissent with an ideological       criticism of federal agencies in general:        Administrative agencies enjoy remarkable powers in our       legal order. Their interpretations of ambiguous statutes       control even when most everyone thinks Congress really meant       something else. Their regulations bind as long as they can       make the modest boast that they haven't behaved arbitrarily       or capriciously. Their factual findings rule the day unless       someone can show they have not just erred but clearly erred.        Gorsuch wrote that this was such a case, where the agency       had erred in finding Compass had violated the law. But the       superfluous ideological introduction cast a shadow on his       entire approach to the case and whether he analyzed it as a       disinterested judge or as an anti-government conservative       seeking to use his position on the federal bench to make a       political point. Either way, if it had been up to Gorsuch,       the company responsible for Carder's death would not have       been held accountable.    Well, it wasn't up to Gorsuch, because the majority of the panel  said: Yes, of course if you put a worker in a highly dangerous  situation, you have the responsibility to train them about that  situation. Somehow, Gorsuch managed to find the opposite conclusion: If  you put a worker in a highly dangerous place and don't train them, that  is OK, even if they die as a result.   I am reading stories from the article, ``Real People, Real Lives: The  Harm Caused By Judge Gorsuch.'' The next section is, ``Die or Be Fired:  The Case of the Frozen Trucker.'' I have relayed the facts of this  several times since I began speaking a few hours ago, so I will try to  do an abbreviated version of this.         TransAm Trucking v. Administrative Review Board (2016).        While Chris Carder died on the job, Alphonse Maddin was       fired for not dying on the job. He was a truck driver hauling       cargo in subzero weather, and the brakes on his trailer       froze. He stopped, called the company to report the problem,       then waited for a repair person. Unfortunately, the heater in       the cab of the truck was broken, wasn't working, so after a       couple of hours, his body became numb, his speech was       slurred, and he couldn't feel his feet at all. He called the       company two more times and reported his increasingly perilous       state; he was even having trouble breathing.        Maddin unhitched the trailer from the truck. With the       repair person still not there, he called the company to let       them know he was leaving to get help, but he was told not to       leave the trailer behind. He was given two choices: Drag the       trailer despite its frozen brakes (either impossible or       wildly dangerous), or keep waiting for the repair person in       the cold and put his own life at risk.        Rather than die in the cold, Maddin drove off in the truck       for help, leaving the trailer behind and returning with       assistance in about 15 minutes. A week later, the company       fired him for abandoning his cargo. The Labor Department       found that the company had violated whistleblower       protection regulations, since Maddin had reported a       problem, not obeyed an order relating to that problem that       could have killed him, and was fired for it.        Not surprisingly, . . . a panel of Tenth Circuit judges       upheld the Labor Department's actions. But Judge Gorsuch       dissented. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act protects       a worker from refusing to operate an unsafe vehicle.    I am now interjecting--which is what he did because he refused to  drive with that trailer attached with the frozen brakes, which could  have endangered many people on the road.   Now I will return to the article.       . . . a panel of Tenth Circuit judges upheld the Labor       Department's actions. But Judge Gorsuch dissented. The       Surface Transportation Assistance Act protects a worker from       refusing to operate an unsafe vehicle, but Gorsuch reasoned       that the driver wasn't ``refusing to operate'' anything at       all; instead, he was choosing to operate the vehicle in a way       that he'd been instructed not to. And that, wrote Gorsuch,       isn't covered by the law.    And that is how a person who wants to be a legislator turns the law  on its head, to reverse the outcome clearly laid out in the law to  begin with.   Back to the article.         So according to Gorsuch, a law passed to protect workers       from being forced to drive unsafe vehicles doesn't cover       workers who drive away to avoid the particularly unsafe       situation of death. The law empowers companies to make       workers choose between their jobs and their lives, according       to Gorsuch. Fortunately, Maddin survived his ordeal and       Gorsuch's analysis did not carry the day.    The next section of this article, ``Real People, Real Lives: The Harm  Caused By Judge Gorsuch''--the title is ``Defer to the Governor, Facts  Notwithstanding: Gorsuch Turns a Blind Eye to an Unlawful Effort to  Defund Planned Parenthood.''   This is also a case that I have read a fair amount about in the  course of the last few hours, so I will just summarize it.   The Governor of Utah said: Well, there is this video out, and it is  about a program in which Planned Parenthood sells tissue for research.  I don't like what they are doing, so I am going to refuse to provide  State funds to Planned Parenthood.   Planned Parenthood basically pointed this out: Well, first, the video  didn't have anything to do with Utah. Second of all, Planned Parenthood  in Utah is not involved in this tissue research program, so it had  nothing to do with us in that regard. And refusing to provide State  funds to us is unequal treatment under the law and unconstitutional.   The case was tried, and the judges found for Planned Parenthood for  all the reasons I just mentioned. Neither the Governor of Utah nor  Planned Parenthood saw any reason to appeal this. Planned Parenthood  had won, and the Governor recognized that there were seriously strong  arguments that had been made. But Gorsuch did something very unusual:  He asked the Tenth Circuit to reconsider the decision of the three- court panel en banc, which means with all the judges of the Tenth  [[Page S2273]]  Circuit. He essentially retried the entire case with a larger group.  Gorsuch accused the majority of not showing ``the sort of comity this  court normally seeks to show the States and their elected  representatives.''   Let's treat the Governor nicely. The job of the court is not to treat  the Governor nicely; the job is to determine whether someone's rights  have been violated or whether someone has suffered damage that needs to  be compensated.   One of the fellow judges in the majority criticized Gorsuch's  mischaracterization of the record, and he noted that Gorsuch  ``mischaracterizes this litigation and the panel opinion at several  turns.''   The article continues:         It would be hard to estimate how many women would have       become ill or died if Judge Gorsuch had been in the majority.    The next section of this article, ``Real People, Real Lives: The Harm  Caused By Judge Gorsuch'' is titled ``No Understanding of Another's  Perspective: The Department Of Motor Vehicles and the Rehabilitation  Act.'' This is the case of Barber v. Colorado.         Julianna Barber and her mother, Marcia Barber, learned just       how out of touch Judge Gorsuch could be . . . and the pain       that he would impose on people with disabilities and their       families. Fifteen year-old Julianna wanted to practice her       driving. Colorado law restricted her to driving with a parent       or guardian with a driver's license. Since her mother Marcia       was blind and therefore didn't have a license, she asked the       DMV for a reasonable accommodation: Let Julianna drive with       her grandfather. After consulting with the State attorney       general, the DMV refused, but suggested that Marcia could       give Julianna's grandfather some form of guardianship. She       refused to even discuss signing away her parental rights, and       the family sued under the Rehabilitation Act.    The Barbers lost in the Tenth Circuit with a panel consisting of  judges nominated by Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush  in Barber v. Colorado. The majority acknowledged that the State had  discriminated against Marcia Barber but ruled against her because she  refused to negotiate with the DMV over reasonable accommodation.         But Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurrence going even further:       Citing Colorado Revised Statute Section 15-14-102(4). Gorsuch       pointed out that the guardian for purposes of driving does       not have to be someone with full guardianship authority. He       also cited Colorado Revised Statute 15-14-105's provision       that a parent can delegate ``any power,'' however small,       ``regarding care, custody or property'' of a child to someone       else. Therefore, all Marcia Barber had to do was find a sheet       of paper and write that Julianna's grandfather had the right       to supervise her driving. She wouldn't need to file the paper       in court or go through any other formal process. According to       Gorsuch, this option is available to anyone, does not       discriminate against anyone based on disability.        The DMV wasn't even required to make a reasonable       accommodation for the family. At no point in the opinion is       there any suggestion that Marcia Barber understood that the       DMV was talking about anything but surrendering some of her       parental rights, so it was not surprising that she wouldn't       consider discussing it further. No reasonable judge can       expect a regular person to be sufficiently familiar with the       details of Colorado statutes to know everything about       guardianship that he cites. How would she know this?        Gorsuch's inability to comprehend the worldview of another       person is perfectly captured in the footnote to his       concurrence.    The article says it is worth quoting in full. Here is that footnote:         Plaintiffs argue that, in a February 23, 2005 letter, the       State misrepresented its Colorado law by asking Ms. Barber to       sign a document giving full, not limited, guardianship       authority to another person. The letter, however, simply       stated that, for the ``youngest of drivers just learning to       drive,'' State law required ``that they be under the direct       and immediate supervision of someone with full parental       authority.'' By definition, a limited guardian has full       parental authority, albeit for prescribed purposes, sometimes       even very modest purposes (such as the supervision of a minor       while driving). The State thus did not misrepresent to       plaintiffs the availability or nature of its limited       guardianship statutes.        Perhaps 95 to 99 percent of the Nation's population, like       Marcia Barber, would not know that someone with full parental       authority could include someone whose only authority is       permission to supervise her daughter's driving. A good judge       recognizes that different people can reasonably interpret the       same thing differently based on their different education,       upbringings, and life experiences.    I think if somebody told me that they wanted me to grant full  parental authority to someone else, I certainly would say: Hold on.  That is not happening.   What Neil Gorsuch points out is that full parental authority can  apply to a very small set of activities, but the phrase ``full parental  authority'' implies a broad range. How would an ordinary citizen  possibly know the point Neil Gorsuch is making? And therefore I think  virtually everybody would respond the way she did. Full parental  authority--I am going to pass that away? No, of course not. Why don't  they call it limited or special cause parental authority? Then maybe an  ordinary person might have some idea. But that was not the case.   The next section in ``Real People, Real Lives: The Harm Caused By  Judge Gorsuch'' is titled ``Sex Discrimination: Never Mind the  Evidence.''         Many of the appeals before the 10th Circuit involve       plaintiffs whose cases were dismissed before trial or jury       verdict because (the trial judge ruled) they had not       presented enough evidence to possibly support their legal       claim. That is what happened to Carole Strickland, a UPS       driver who was promoted to key account executive. She       presented evidence that she had been the subject of sex       discrimination at the new job and quit under pressure.        Her coworkers testified that supervisors treated her       differently than her male colleagues. Even though Strickland       met between 93 and 104 percent of her sales quotas and was       outperforming at least some of her coworkers on every       measure, only she was required to attend individual meetings       with the supervisors. Only she had to make written sales       commitments, even though no one was at 100 percent of every       sales quota. One of the men in her office had lower       performances than Strickland in almost every sales measure,       but he was not required to attend meetings to discuss       performance, was not denied assistance, and was not counseled       for failing to reach 100 percent in every sales measure.        At the same time, UPS pointed out that there was one other       woman in Strickland's office, and she did not report being       treated differently. In addition, there had been one man       among the staff whose treatment approached that given to       Strickland. The district court ruled that she didn't have a       case and dismissed it.        The Tenth Circuit panel of judges who heard her appeal in       Strickland v. UPS (2009) disagreed. While her employer's       evidence might have undercut Strickland's case, she had       nevertheless presented enough evidence for a jury to consider       her arguments, consider UPS's arguments, and conclude that       she had indeed been subject to unlawful sex discrimination.    That is what the 10th Circuit said.         Judge Gorsuch dissented, deciding for himself that       Strickland's supervisors were not motivated by sex       discrimination. Therefore, Gorsuch concluded, since no       reasonable jury could agree with Strickland about the cause       of her treatment, her case should be dismissed before she       could make her case to a jury.        Everyone deserves their day in court. Except for some       people.    In case after case that I have been talking about in the course of  the last few hours, we see that the judge said: No, we are going to  stop that person from ever getting their day in court. Generally, the  article attacked the conduct of a powerful corporation.   The next section of ``Real People, Real Lives'' is regarding ``The  Most Vulnerable: Children With Disabilities.'' This case is ``A.F. v.  Espanola Public Schools (2015).''         The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA,       ensures that students with disabilities are provided ``free       appropriate public education.'' Under the law, such children       have individualized education programs designed to provide       educational benefits. Congress included a requirement that if       a parent believes their child's needs are not being       addressed, . . . they must first exhaust the administrative       remedies IDEA makes available before they can go to court.       Congress has also passed other laws relevant to children with       disabilities, some of which have remedies that IDEA lacks.       They also require all IDEA administrative remedies to be       exhausted first before going to court.    A.F., a child with dyslexia, had her case heard on appeal by Judge  Gorsuch who read IDEA to limit parents' options to most effectively  address their children's educational needs. A.F.'s mother Christine  felt the school hadn't adequately assessed her daughter and created an  IEP [an Individual Education Plan] for her as IDEA requires. She filed  a complaint and reached an agreement in which the school recognized  that A.F. had a disability. Believing she had met the requirement to  exhaust IDEA's administrative remedies, she then went to court to  obtain remedies available under statutes like the Rehabilitation Act  and the Americans with Disabilities Act.         But in A.F. v. Espanola Public Schools . . . Judge Gorsuch       shut her down. Writing for a  [[Page S2274]]       divided panel, he ruled that she hadn't exhausted her       administrative remedies because she had reached a settlement       with the school district on her IDEA case. To pursue relief       available only through statutes other than IDEA, he       concluded, a parent must refuse to resolve the IDEA claim.        Judge Mary Beck Briscoe pointed out the bind Judge Gorsuch       was imposing on parents with children with disabilities,       against Congressional intent.    Judge Briscoe wrote:         [Judge Gorsuch's] interpretation is inconsistent with the       very purpose of IDEA. It forces a claimant to choose between       mediating a resolution to her IDEA claim . . . and thereby       obtaining some or all of the relief sought under IDEA . . .       ,or forgoing any relief at all and waiting (while the child       ages and potentially continues to receive something other       than the requisite ``free appropriate public education'') in       hopes of later filing suit and obtaining relief under both       IDEA and other statutes.    So his position just places the parent in an impossible situation and  obviously a good share of the panel disagreed. Of course there are  parallels there on that IDEA case to the autism case that we looked at  earlier. Certainly, in both cases, the judge was not sympathetic to the  role of the family seeking an appropriate education for their child. In  the autism case, the Supreme Court just recently overturned Judge  Gorsuch and the principle he asserted, which is basically all that was  required of the school district was ``merely more than de minimus,''  merely more than nothing. That is inconsistent with the whole purpose  of the IDEA, which is to provide a free appropriate public education.  So here again, we see much the same attitude being displayed, an  attitude of rewriting the law to be something that it clearly is not.   ``The Sixth Amendment: Undermining the Right to Counsel. Williams v.  Jones.'' I am reading another section from ``Real People, Real Lives:  The Harm Caused By Judge Gorsuch.''         Perhaps no government power is more awesome--and more       dangerously susceptible to abuse--than the right to imprison       someone, completely taking away their freedom. Because our       liberties require robust protection, the Bill of Rights       establishes certain requirements that the government must       meet before it is allowed to exercise its authority to lock       any of us away. Since the criminal law can be used mistakenly       or even inappropriately against anyone, these procedural       requirements are guarantors of our freedom.        The Founders recognized that unjustified imprisonment would       be less likely if each criminal defendant had someone       advocating for them who knew the law inside and out. Hence,       the Sixth Amendment guarantees that the criminally accused       ``shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of       Counsel for his defence.'' As a constitutional provision that       is part of the Bill of Rights, this indicates that, as a       nation, we believe that no one should be stripped of their       freedom just because they are not experts in the law.        But Judge Gorsuch appeared to disagree, as he showed in       2009 case of Williams v. Jones. In this case, Michael       Williams was being prosecuted for first-degree murder. The       prosecution offered him a deal which he would plead guilty to       a lesser crime (second-degree murder) and he would serve ten       years in prison. Williams wanted to accept. However, his       attorney said that if Williams accepted the deal, he       (Williams) would be committing perjury and the lawyer       would withdraw from the case.        Faced with this terrible legal advice and threat from his       attorney, Williams reluctantly rejected the plea deal and       went to trial. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and       sentenced to life in prison without parole.        At the Tenth Circuit, the panel majority addressed the       appropriate remedy for the unconstitutional ineffective       assistance of counsel. While the remedy was not an easy issue       to address, the majority had no difficulty whatsoever in       identifying the constitutional violation. Indeed, a state       court in Oklahoma had already found that there was a Sixth       Amendment violation in this case.        Judge Gorsuch dissented both from the panel decision and       from the whole court's decision not to reconsider the case en       banc. He found no constitutional violation in the first       place, because he claimed that the right to effective       assistance of counsel only covers the trial, not any pretrial       plea bargaining. Since the trial itself appeared to be fair,       Gorsuch concluded, Williams didn't have a case. He wrote that       ``due process requires a fair trial, not a good bargain.''    A little commentary here: What Judge Gorsuch was doing was saying  that the Sixth Amendment right to legal assistance is only in the case  of the trial, not in the legal work done before the trial starts. That  is what is being referred to by the panel majority as an ``extremely  cramped view of the right to counsel.''   So the article continues:         The panel majority harshly criticized this extremely       cramped view of the right to counsel, noting that it had been       rejected by the Supreme Court and was ``incompatible with       [the Supreme Court's precedents involving] a right to       effective assistance of counsel in connection with the entire       plea process.'' When the circuit without comment declined to       reconsider the case en banc, one judge wrote . . . a       concurring opinion solely to correct the errors in Gorsuch's       dissent. They cited the Supreme Court's prior holdings and       statements that would have made no sense if the Sixth       Amendment's right to counsel didn't apply at the pretrial       plea-bargaining stage.        The Sixth Amendment protects both the guilty and the       innocent. Judge Gorsuch's narrow interpretation is       particularly frightening in the age of Trump.    That concludes that section. But it certainly is disturbing that Neil  Gorsuch made a decision that completely disregarded the Supreme Court  precedents and made no sense because when you have a lawyer, that  lawyer is assisting you through the legal process. Part of that is the  negotiation that occurs before you are actually in court. It is all  part of the process of your case being considered. To try to put up a  wall and say the Sixth Amendment does not apply to any of the legal  work done, including negotiations over a potential plea, makes no  sense.   So you have Judge Gorsuch writing his own law, ignoring the Supreme  Court precedents, and being reprimanded, in essence, by the panel  majority.   Returning to the article, ``Real People, Real Lives,'' the conclusion  of the article reads as follows:         These are far from being the only people who have been or       could have been greatly harmed by the way Judge Gorsuch       approaches cases. When Gorsuch's view carry the day right       now, the damage he does is limited to States covered by the       Tenth Circuit; he has also been limited by the Supreme Court       precedent he may disagree with. Were he to be elevated to the       High Court, however, he would be in a position to overrule       precedents that have gotten in his way over the past 10       years, and the damage he would impose would be nationwide and       unreviewable.        Judge Gorsuch may be affable and have many friends, but       that is not at all relevant to whether he should be confirmed       to the Supreme Court. Few if any of the parties Gorsuch has       unfairly ruled against would feel better knowing that he is       reputed to be a great guy outside the courtroom.    So, that is the article ``Real People, Real Lives: The Harm Caused By  Judge Gorsuch.''   The next article is from the New York Times by Emily Bazelon and Eric  Posner from April 1, 2017. No, this was not an April Fools' article.  This is a serious article: ``The Government Gorsuch Wants to Undo.'' It  starts out as follows:         At recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court's open       seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland       and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little       ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes       up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to       upend with a filibuster.        But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial       philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the       structure of modern government--including the rules that keep       our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect       workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the       administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of       incendiary figures like the White House advisor Steve Bannon,       who has called for its ``deconstruction.'' The Republican-      dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to       severely curtail the power of federal agencies.        Businesses have always complained that government       regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some       regulations are ill-conceived. But a small group of       conservative intellectuals have gone much further to argue       that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly       functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that       is not constitutionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of       the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last       year, that the administrative state ``poses a grave threat to       our values of personal liberty.''        The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New       Deal. President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that the Great       Depression was caused in part by the ruinous competition       among companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National       Industrial Recovery Act, which allowed the president to       approve ``fair competition'' standards for different trades       and industries. The next year, Roosevelt approved a code for       the poultry industry, which, among other things, set a       minimum wage and maximum hours for workers, and hygiene       requirements for slaughterhouses. Such basic workplace       protections and constraints on the free market are now taken       for granted.        But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator       was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme       Court called into question the whole approach of the New  [[Page S2275]]       Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.A. was an ``unconstitutional       delegation by Congress of a legislative power.'' Only       Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices       said. Because Congress did not define ``fair competition,''       leaving the rulemaking to the president, the N.I.R.A.       violated the Constitution's separation of powers.        The court's ruling in the Shechter Poultry Corp. v. the       United States, along with another case decided the same year,       are the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever       struck down a federal statute based on this rationale, known       as the ``nondelegation doctrine.'' Shechter Poultry's stand       against executive-branch rulemaking proved to be a legal dead       end, and for good reason. As the court has recognized over       and over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome       body that moves slowly in the best of times, while the       economy is an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of       business as well as labor, the updating of regulations can't       wait for Congress to give highly specific and detailed       directions.        The New Deal filled the gap by giving policy-making       authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange       Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor       Relations Board, which oversees bargaining between unions and       employers. Later came other agencies, including the       Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and       Health Administration (which regulates workplace safety) and       the Department of Homeland Security. Still other agencies       regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks       open, help farmers and assist Americans who are overseas.       Administrative agencies coordinated the response to Sept. 11,       kept the Ebola outbreak in check and were instrumental in the       last financial crisis. They regulate the safety of food,       drugs, airplanes, and nuclear power plants. The       administrative state isn't optional in our complex society.       It's indispensable.    I am reading from the article ``The Government Gorsuch Wants to  Undo'' by Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner. It continues:         But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is       necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with       their large bureaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists,       could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that       concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act,       which ensured a role in the judiciary in overseeing rule-      making by agencies.        The system worked well enough for decades, but questions       arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to       deregulate. His EPA sought to weaken a rule, issued by the       Carter administration, which called for regulating       ``stationary sources'' of air pollution--a broad wording that       is open to interpretation. When President Reagan's EPA       narrowed the definition of what counted as a ``stationary       source'' to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an       environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court       held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council       that the EPA and any agency could determine the meaning of an       ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be known as the       Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous language in a       statute, courts must defer to an agency's reasonable       interpretation of what the words mean.        Chevron was not used as a left-leaning decision. The       Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration,       after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part),       and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative       icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he       declared himself a Chevron fan. ``In the long run Chevron       will endure,'' Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article,       ``because it more accurately reflects the reality of       government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.''        That was then. But the Reagan administration's effort to       cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that       the public often likes regulation--because it keeps the air       and water clean, the workplace safe, and the financial system       in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to       the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and the financial       crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.        Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the       federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years,       conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape       critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only       Congress--not agencies--can create rules. This is Shechter       Poultry all over again.        And Judge Gorsuch has fortunately joined in. Last year, in       a concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-      Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing       that the rule ``certainly seems to have added prodigious new       powers to an already titanic administrative State.''       Remarkably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chevron--one of the       most frequently cited cases in the legal canon--is       illegitimate in part because it is out of step with (you       guessed it) Shechter Poultry. Never mind that the Supreme       Court has not since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the       New Deal. Nonetheless, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of       Shechter Poultry, ``you might ask how is it that Chevron--a       rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to       regulate a lot more than chicken--can evade the chopping       block.''        At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he       might overturn Chevron without saying so directly, noting       that the administrative state existed long before 1984. The       implication is that little would change referring to the       E.P.A.'s or Department of Labor's reading of a statute.       Judges would interpret the law. Who would object to that?    But here's the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that Congress can  use broadly written laws to delegate authorities to agencies in the  first place. That can mean only that at least portions of such  statutes--the source of so many regulations that safeguard Americans'  welfare--must be sent back to Congress, to redo or not.         On the current Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas       seeks to strip power from the administrative state by       undercutting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and       discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in       opinions approvingly cited by Judge Gorsuch. But President       Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other       conservatives on the court have expressed some uneasiness       with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for       overturning it. What would happen if agencies could not make       rules for the financial industry and for consumer,       environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience       in the United States and around the world teach that the       administrative state is a necessary part of the modern market       economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be       one step closer to testing that premise.    That is the conclusion of the New York Times article ``The Government  Gorsuch Wants to Undo'' by Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner, dated April  1.   The next article I will share with you is an editorial from November  7, and I believe the other is from December 24 of 2016. This is by the  editorial board of the New York Times, and it reads as follows:         People don't usually remember it this way, but on December       13, 2000, Vice President Al Gore gave one of the most       important speeches in American history. Mr. Gore had       contested initial results of the Florida vote count and       prevailed in Florida State courts, but the Supreme Court had       voted 5-to-4 the day before to end the recount and       effectively hand the presidency to George W. Bush.        ``Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken,'' Mr. Gore said.       ``Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the       court's decision, I accept it.'' The frenzied battle over a       few hundred votes had spawned intense anger across the       country--but it had been resolved ``as it must be resolved,       through the honored institutions of our democracy.''        Mr. Gore's concession that night still stands as the most       powerful reaffirmation in modern times of the Supreme Court's       unique and fragile role in the American system of government.       Millions of people were furious in the justices' decision in       Bush v. Gore--many believed it was the result not of legal       reasoning but of rank partisanship--and yet virtually       everyone followed Mr. Gore's selfless lead, accepted the       court as the final arbiter of the dispute, and moved on.       There were no riots in the streets, no attempted coups, no       ``Second Amendment solutions.'' There was, instead, a       peaceful transfer of power: the hallmark of a civil society       operating under the rule of law.        Sixteen years later, the Supreme Court sits crippled,       unable to resolve the most pressing legal questions before       the country. Two events--the sudden death of Justice Antonin       Scalia in February and the unprecedented refusal of Senate       Republicans to even consider President Obama's pick to fill       the vacant seat--have converged to throw the court's future       as a functioning institution into doubt.        This scenario would have seemed unimaginable a year ago.       But Tuesday's vote--for president and for control of the       Senate--will determine whether the court remains short-handed       for months or, as Republicans are now threatening if they       hold the Senate, for years.        Last month, Senator Richard Burr, of North Carolina, told       supporters that if Hillary Clinton wins, ``I am going to do       everything I can to make sure four years from now, we still       got an opening on the Supreme Court.'' Senator Ted Cruz of       Texas suggested he was happy with the current situation, and       said, ``There is certainly long historical precedent for a       Supreme Court with fewer justices.'' Even Senator John       McCain, who once joined with Democrats in an effort to       depoliticize the judicial nomination process, recently told a       radio show, ``I promise you that we will be united against       any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were       President, would put up.''        Step back for a moment and consider the radical absurdity       of this position. Senate Republicans first justified their       refusal to hold hearings or a vote on Mr. Obama's nominee       before the presidential election because ``the people's       voice'' needed to be heard. That was always a transparent       lie. Now, apparently believing their candidate, Donald Trump,       will lose, they are acting as though the Supreme Court is the       property of the Republican Party.        This mind-set isn't just a matter of a few senators going       rogue. Leading conservative groups are embracing the       argument, happy to destroy a principle of American politics--  [[Page S2276]]       to privilege partisanship over the Constitution itself. Ilya       Shapiro, a senior fellow at the influential Cato Institute,       wrote two weeks ago that ``it would be completely decent,       honorable, and in keeping with the Senate's constitutional       duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee'' a       President Clinton would name. Last Thursday, the Vice       President of Heritage Action for America, a top conservative       think tank, said Senators McCain, Burr and Cruz were taking       ``exactly the right position,'' and that an effective, long-      term blockade of the court will require ``an immense amount       of willpower'' from Senate Republicans.        A small number of Republican senators have expressed       discomfort with this idea, but when was the last time public       interest won out in today's Republican Party?        The indefinite blockade not only hobbles the justices'       ability to resolve current cases, it takes open aim at the       court's legitimacy as the sole unelected branch of       government. Because the court ``has no influence over either       the sword or the purse,'' as Alexander Hamilton wrote in the       Federalist Papers, its legitimacy and authority depend       entirely on the shared public acceptance of its verdicts.        Today's Republicans are essentially saying the court is       nothing but another political body, and that justices should       be treated as ideological sock puppets of the president who       nominated them. Yes, the justices come with political beliefs       and backgrounds, but that makes it all the more important to       demand that they work harder than the rest of us to struggle       and preserve their independence. This is why, for instance,       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was wrong to comment on Mr.       Trump's candidacy--words for which she later apologized.        Until this year, no one disputed that the president should       have wide latitude in picking justices. In 1993, Senate       Republicans voted overwhelmingly in favor of Justice       Ginsburg, President Bill Clinton's first nominee. And even       though they voted in large numbers against Mr. Obama's first       two nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, they did not       try to block those nominations from going forward. Senate       Democrats voted unanimously to confirm Ronald Reagan's choice       of Justice Scalia in 1986 and allowed full votes on Robert       Bork and Clarence Thomas, both of whom they strongly opposed.        In 2016, Republicans have blown this delicate balance to       pieces, all to keep a conservative majority. Of course, the       court has had a majority of Republican-appointed justices for       nearly half a century, through the normal processes of advice       and consent. But now, Republicans want to maintain that       majority, even if that means tossing out all political norms.       This majority, they hope, would promote a world view where       fewer people have rights, where women do not have       reproductive choices, where lawmakers can make it harder for       minorities to vote, where religious people are free to       disregard laws protecting people they don't like. Such a       court could use a severe interpretation of the Constitution       to ensure that American politics can be flooded with       unlimited money, that reasonable gun restrictions are struck       down, that corporate interests prevail over those of       consumers, and that basic environmental regulations are       turned back.        Make no mistake: That is the court Americans would get       under a President Trump. Still, Senate Democrats would have       an obligation to consider and vote on his nominees, just as       Republicans would have that obligation to Mrs. Clinton's       choices. No doubt, there would be Democratic voices demanding       that their Senators mimic the Republicans' shameful example.       But the Constitution asks more of us than that. In the next       Congress, regardless of who wins on Tuesday, the very       survival of the court as an independent body will be at       stake.    I certainly agree that the very survival of the Court as an  independent body is at stake right now. That is why I am here on the  floor at 4:20 in the morning. It is because so much is at stake in  terms of the legitimacy of the Court.   This is probably a good moment to return to the central premise of  where we are. Where we are is that for the first time in U.S. history,  a seat has been stolen from one President and delivered to another in a  Court-packing scheme. If that were to succeed, it would set a precedent  that would haunt the Court for decades to come, and it will haunt this  body, the Senate, because if a theft succeeds, then it changes the  analysis of every future Supreme Court vacancy.   If there is a vacancy and it is an opportunity for the Democrats to  steal a seat back and deliver it to a future President who might be a  Democrat, will they do so, and would they be right in doing so--to  rebalance the Court after a seat has been stolen? We should never have  to ask these questions--questions such as, if you can steal a seat and  get away with it, when a seat becomes vacant a year before a President  leaves office, can you do it 2 years before the President leaves  office? Can you do it for 3 years? Can you keep a seat vacant for 4  years, as suggested by the article I just read and the comments of some  of my colleagues in that they would be determined to reject any nominee  put forward by Hillary Clinton? These questions are being asked because  of this crime against our Constitution--the crime of stealing a Supreme  Court seat in an effort to pack the Court.   The second big issue we are facing is the investigations underway of  the Trump campaign and its possible coordination with the Russians to  change the outcome of the election.   We know a lot about what the Russians did. We know they created false  news stories. We know they had a team estimated to be 1,000 individuals  in a building, doing social media to amplify the impression that  Americans were writing negative comments about Hillary Clinton. We know  they had a system of bots--a botnet, if you will--to use computers to  respond and add commentary on comments people were making on social  media so that it looks like there are far more people--far more  disgruntled individuals--who were criticizing the Democratic nominee.  We know that their strategy involved trying to influence the outcome in  terms of groups like Facebook, identifying something as ``trending''  and then putting it up as ``trending news'' so that the false news, now  being driven by the thousand social media folks in some building and  the botnet, is amplified to the degree that it is now scrolling on your  Facebook, looking like very legitimate news. We know the Russians broke  into computers to obtain information and worked to release it in a  fashion that was designed to damage the Presidential nominee from the  Democratic Party.    That is a pretty comprehensive strategy of fake news and fake social  media comments and botnet-generated comments and breaking into  computers to secure information and release it in a fashion to damage  the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. We will learn more about all  of those things, but that is a pretty good list of serious attacks on  the United States of America, attacks on the integrity of our electoral  system.   What we do not know--and why there are investigations underway--is  how much the Trump campaign communicated with and conspired with that  Russian operation. Each day, drip by drip, we hear more about some  contact. This morning, it was the media and the Seychelles that we did  not know about previously. Every day, it seems like there is one little  additional piece, and we do not know where it will all lead to, if  anywhere. Maybe it leads nowhere, but we must pursue it because if  anyone conspired with the Russians to undermine the integrity of our  elections and change the outcome of the elections, that is traitorous  conduct, and it must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.   Right now, we do not know a lot about how much communication and how  much potential collaboration or conspiracy there was, so we have  investigations to get to the bottom of it. The FBI has an investigation  into it, as well as the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate  Intelligence Committee, and we should not be considering this  nomination while those investigations are underway.   Of course, a third significant reason that we should not be pursuing  this is that the President failed to recognize the role of the  supermajority requirement--the 60-vote requirement--that anyone who  serves on the Supreme Court should be able to get bipartisan support  from 60 Members. Therefore, nominating somebody from the far right, the  extreme right, and all of the opinions we have talked about over the  last many hours are related to crushing the rights of individuals and  helping the most powerful. Certainly an individual who is at that far  point in the spectrum is not from the mainstream of judicial thinking.  It is another reason this should be set aside.   Then we have that information that came out at about 11 p.m., earlier  this evening, Tuesday time. Now we are 5\1/2\ hours later, but the  information was about the number of cases in which Neil Gorsuch had  lifted passages from others virtually word for word without giving them  credit. That is known as plagiarism. Hopefully, that issue will get a  fair amount of attention and be examined closely.   The next article I am going to read is in the Sunday Review, December  24,  [[Page S2277]]  2016, entitled ``The Stolen Supreme Court Seat.''         Soon after his inauguration next month, President-elect       Donald Trump will nominate someone to the Supreme Court,       which has been hamstrung by a vacancy since the death of       Justice Antonin Scalia in February. There will be public       debates about the nominee's credentials, past record,       judicial philosophy and temperament. There will be Senate       hearings and a vote.        No matter how it plays out, Americans must remember one       thing above all: The person who gets confirmed will sit in a       stolen seat.        It was stolen from Barack Obama, a twice-elected President       who fulfilled his constitutional duty more than nine months       ago by nominating Merrick Garland, a highly qualified and       widely respected federal appellate judge.        It was stolen by top Senate Republicans, who broke with       longstanding tradition and refused to consider any nominee       Mr. Obama might send them because they wanted to preserve the       court's conservative majority. The main perpetrators of the       theft were Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Charles       Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But virtually       all Republican Senators were accomplices; only two supported       holding hearings.        The Republican Party line--that it was an election year, so       the American people should have a ``voice'' in the selection       of the next justice--was a patent lie. The people spoke when       they re-elected Mr. Obama in 2012, entrusting him to choose       new members for the court. And the Senate has had no problem       considering and usually confirming election-year nominees in       the past.        Of course, Supreme Court appointments have always been       political, and the court's ideological center has shifted       back and forth over time. But the Senate has given nominees       full consideration and a vote even when the party in power       has opposed a president's choice. That is, until this year,       when Republicans claimed that though the Constitution calls       for the Senate's ``advice and consent,'' Senators aren't       obligated to do anything. This is a bad-faith reading of that       clause, even if there is no clear way to force a vote. It       certainly obliterates a well-established political norm that       makes a functioning judicial branch possible. As Paul Krugman       wrote in his column on Monday, institutions are not magically       self-sustaining, and they ``don't protect against tyranny       when powerful people start defying political norms.''        This particular norm is of paramount importance because the       court's institutional legitimacy depends on its perceived       separation from the elected branches--a fragile concept in       the best of times. By tying the latest appointment directly       to the outcome of the election, Mr. McConnell and allies took       a torch to that idea--an outrageous gambit that, to nearly       everyone's shock, has paid off. But while Republicans may be       celebrating now, the damage they have inflicted on the       confirmation process, and on the court as an institution, may       be irreversible.        The slope is both slippery and steep. If Republicans can       justify an election-year blockade, what's to stop Democrats       in the future from doing the same? For that matter, why       should the party controlling the Senate ever allow a       President of the opposing party to choose a justice? Indeed,       in the weeks before the election, Senate Republicans were       threatening, with the encouragement of leading conservative       thinkers, never to confirm anyone to fill the vacancy if       Hillary Clinton won.        Can anything be done to repair the harm? One step--as       obvious as it is unlikely--would be for Mr. Trump to       renominate Mr. Garland. Conservatives will scoff, but they       know he is as qualified for the job as anyone in the country.       When Mr. Garland was floated as a possible choice for the       Supreme Court in 2010, Orrin Hatch, the senior Republican       Senator from Utah, called him a ``consensus nominee'' and       said there was ``no question'' that he would be confirmed       with bipartisan support. That's partly why Mr. Obama       nominated him this time, and also why Mr. McConnell denied       him a hearing--he knew he couldn't prevent a Senate vote once       Americans saw an eminently qualified and reasonable jurist       testify on live TV.        At the very least, Mr. Trump could follow President Obama's       example and pick a centrist--someone who commands wide       respect and operates within the bounds of mainstream legal       thought. That would be an appropriate gesture from a man who       lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes and will       enter office with the lowest approval ratings in recent       history.        The shameful, infuriating actions of the Senate Republicans       won't be ignored in the history books. In a desperate effort       to keep a conservative majority in the court, they rejected       their own professed values of preserving American       institutions. There's little hope they will come to their       senses now, but they and Mr. Trump have the power and the       obligation to fix the mess they have created.    That is the article ``The Stolen Supreme Court Seat,'' an editorial  from the Sunday Review of the New York Times.   I do hope that there is a path in which this damage can be avoided  because it is enormously significant to confirm a Justice when the seat  has been stolen. It is enormously damaging to confirm a Justice when  the President's team is under investigation for possible collusion with  the Russians. It is enormously a big deal to confirm someone way out of  the mainstream of judicial thought in America.   So should this progress, should we find that there are 41 individuals  who will stand up for our institutions and block this nomination under  the filibuster tradition, the 60-vote tradition--60 votes required to  proceed--we will have the question of whether we are going to change  the rule or change the nominee. And always in the past, when the Senate  rejected in any fashion, including closing debate on a motion to  proceed, a nominee by tabling them--rejected a nominee by voting them  down--the answer was to change the nominee, to protect the integrity of  the Court.   I think the advice in the December 24 editorial, ``Stolen Supreme  Court Seat,'' which calls on the President to nominate a centrist, is  terrific advice because it may give a chance for healing to take place.  But there will be no healing if the seat is filled by Neil Gorsuch--a  seat that belonged to President Obama under the Constitution of the  United States of America, a seat that was stolen for the first time in  U.S. history. That dynamic will haunt us for a very, very long time.   This editorial is from January 31 from Time Magazine, entitled,  ``Sorry, Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court Vacancy was Already Filled,''  and written by Geoffrey Stone:         If Antonin Scalia died today, and Donald Trump thereafter       nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch as his successor, I might       support Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Although Judge Gorsuch       has not yet established himself as a jurist of any       distinction, he is generally regarded as a capable judge       with good character. Moreover, although he is a very       conservative jurist, he will be replacing a justice with a       similar ideological disposition. In such circumstances,       just as I supported the confirmation of Judge John Roberts       to succeed Chief Justice William Rehnquist, so too would I       be inclined to support the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to       succeed Antonin Scalia, even though I strongly disagree       with Gorsuch's very conservative ideology.        But Antonin Scalia did not die today. He died almost a year       ago, and President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick       Garland to succeed him. Chief Judge Garland is a jurist of       impeccable credentials and personal character who is widely       celebrated for his moderate approach to the law. President       Obama nominated Garland not only because of his distinguished       reputation as a jurist, but also because as a relatively       moderate judge, he should have been more than acceptable even       to the most conservative Senate Republicans. In typical Obama       fashion, Garland's nomination was an effort to compromise in       order to win the support of Senate Republicans.        Chief Judge Garland should have been confirmed easily.       Indeed, every Supreme Court nominee in living memory with       anything approaching Chief Judge Garland's impeccable       credentials and record of moderation has been easily       confirmed by the Senate, without regard to whether the Senate       was controlled by the President's party or by the opposing       party. This was true, for example, of such Republican       nominees to the Court as Warren Burger, Harry Blackmun, Lewis       Powell, William Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day       O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter. Even the       extremely conservative Antonin Scalia was confirmed by a vote       of 98-0.        But not Merrick Garland. In a completely unprecedented       abuse of power, Senate Republicans, under the ``leadership''       of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, refused to       confirm, or even to consider, Judge Garland's nomination.       This unconscionable maneuver was nothing less than a       dishonorable and dishonest effort to steal this seat on the       Supreme Court for the right wing.        Senator McConnell had the audacity to maintain that the       ``people'' should decide who should fill this particular       vacancy. By employing his duplicitous strategy, he managed to       shift this appointment from a President who had won the       popular vote by a margin of five million votes in 2012 to one       who lost the popular vote by a margin of three million votes       in 2016. This crass and unprincipled manipulation of our       democracy should not be allowed to succeed.        Anyone who cares about the proper and legitimate       functioning of our American democracy must oppose Judge       Gorsuch's nomination, not because he is necessarily       unqualified, but because of the undermining of our American       democracy by Senate Republicans. Anyone who cares about the       rule of law must oppose this nomination. If we fail to take       this stand, the Senate Republicans will have succeeded in       placing a justice onto our highest Court who has no business       being there. They will have undermined the credibility of the       Supreme Court as an institution, an institution that is       critical to the functioning of our Constitution.        Judge Gorsuch's nomination should be withdrawn, and the       President should nominate in his place a genuinely moderate       justice who is acceptable to Democrats and Republicans alike.       Only then can we move on  [[Page S2278]]       with a sense of institutional integrity. Short of that, every       decision of the Court decided by a margin of five-to-four       with Neil Gorsuch in the majority will justifiably be       castigated as fundamentally illegitimate.    That was in Time Magazine, by Geoffrey Stone, and op-ed opinion  editorial entitled, ``Sorry, Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court Vacancy  Was Already Filled.''   This commentary is from Rolling Stone, entitled, ``Grand Theft  Judiciary: How Republicans Stole the Supreme Court.'' It is subtitled:  ``Pray that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her fellow liberal justices stay  healthy and don't retire,'' by David Cohen, written in November of  2016.         The Republicans just pulled off one of the greatest heists       in American political history--they stole a Supreme Court       justice.        Since 1789, there have been 112 justices on the Supreme       Court. Having the opportunity to appoint a new justice is one       of the prize opportunities for a president. With the right       young justice, a president can influence American law and       society for decades to come. For instance, Anthony Kennedy,       the current ``swing justice'' on the Court, was appointed by       President Reagan. Since he sits in the ideological middle of       this current court, Kennedy's views on the law often       determine how American justice work. And for that, we owe       thanks to a president who was last elected 32 years ago and       has been dead since 2004. That's the power of a Supreme Court       appointment.        These opportunities are often completely unpredictable.       Justices are appointed for life, so they leave their position       only when they retire or die. Sure, a president can make an       educated guess about particular justices' life expectancies       or end-of-career plans, but knowing exactly when a justice is       going to leave the Court is out of the president's control.        When Justice Scalia died suddenly in February, President       Obama was gifted the opportunity to fill his third seat on       the Court. He had previously replaced David Souter with Sonia       Sotomayor and John Paul Stevens with Elena Kagan. Neither of       those appointments shifted the Court's ideological balance,       as in each case Obama replaced, broadly speaking, a judicial       liberal with another liberal. Replacing Scalia, on the other       hand, was going to be a monumental shift in the Court. Scalia       was one of the most conservative justices in the history of       the Supreme Court. An Obama replacement would give the Court       its fifth liberal and shift it to the left in historically       significant ways. President Obama and Democrats were       salivating at the opportunity.        The Republicans, though, were having none of it. Through       unflinching and unified obstructionism combined with       Tuesday's election of Donald Trump, they succeeded in       stealing a seat right out from under President Obama's nose.       It was a staggering case of grand theft judiciary.        This all started almost immediately with Scalia's death,       with the Republicans claiming a new theory that a president       should not be able to appoint a justice during an election       year; rather, the people should be allowed to speak and       decide on the direction of the Court, they said. Never mind       that justices have been confirmed regularly throughout       history in election years, and that presidents have       constitutional authority to appoint judges to the federal       judiciary in all four years of their terms, not just their       first three, and that the Court would have to (and continues       to) function with only eight justices. The Republicans       understood the stakes of shifting the Court's ideology, so       they put up a united obstructionist front and never wavered       in saying they would not confirm an Obama appointee this       year.        President Obama, as he often does, thought he could break       through the Republican wall by trying to appease them.       Instead of nominating a young liberal firebrand or a judicial       first, he nominated a well-respected but moderate, not-young       white male: Merrick Garland. Obama thought Garland, who had       been praised throughout his career by politicians on both       sides of the aisle, would be unobjectionable and would break       the logjam.        The president couldn't have been more wrong. Without any       interest group to cheerlead his cause, Garland was quickly       forgotten and faded into the distant background of American       politics. As a result, there was no movement whatsoever, and       Garland's nomination has lingered with no action longer than       for any nominee in history.        During the campaign, Democrats occasionally brought up this       issue, trying to paint Republican senators as obstructionist       and against good government. But the issue never stuck in       Senate races, and Hillary Clinton never really led the charge       over the Supreme Court either. As a result, according to an       ABC exit poll, of the 21 percent of Americans who said the       Supreme Court was the most important factor in their vote, 57       percent of them voted for Trump and only 40 percent voted for       Clinton.        Now that Trump is president-elect, he's going to have the       opportunity to fill Justice Scalia's seat; even though it       means the Supreme Court will remain short-handed for months       longer, there's no chance in hell Republicans will do       anything to move Garland's nomination between now and       inauguration day. They want their stolen prize, and they'll       wait for it.        Trump has given a list of 21 possible justices he would       nominate, all of whom have varying pedigrees as       conservatives. If he follows through and nominates someone       from that list, the Democrats could respond with a similar       blockade. Though the Republicans still control the Senate,       and thus would be able to move the nominee through the       judiciary committee to a floor vote, Democrats could try to       filibuster. A filibuster requires 60 votes to break, so the       52 Republicans in the Senate would not be able to stop it.        There are two problems with this plan, though. First,       Democrats have been less unified in the past when it comes to       opposition than the Republicans have been, and the Democrats       would need to make sure no more than seven Senators broke       ranks. With several Dems up for reelection in 2018 in very       conservative states, that's something that may be more       difficult than it should be.        Second, the Republicans may opt to get rid of the       filibuster altogether. This option, commonly referred to as       the ``nuclear option,'' would eliminate the filibuster as a       tool for Supreme Court nominees. Because of Republican       opposition during the Obama years, the Democrats eliminated       the filibuster for lower court justices when they controlled       the Senate. However, they kept it for Supreme Court       nominations because they understood just how controversial       and serious such a move would be.    The author continues:         I have no expectation that the Republicans would do the       same. They have been laser focused on wrestling this       nomination away from President Obama and are not going to let       the Democrats ruin their fun. The Senate rules allow the       filibuster to be eliminated with a majority vote, and the       Republicans will probably do so very soon after Trump       nominates his justice and the Democrats announce their       filibuster.        What will this mean for the Supreme Court? Filling this       seat will put a younger conservative in Justice Scalia's       seat. It will dash liberals' hope of a new progressive       Supreme Court and likely continue its recent history as one       of, if not the most, conservative Courts in American history.        However, the Court will still have Justice Kennedy as the       swing justice.    Obviously, this was written before the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. It  notes that if Republicans go nuclear, there is almost nothing the  Democrats can do to stop it. That is certainly true. We don't have a  mechanism that can prevent this body from reinterpreting the  application of its rules.   It happens in a very simple fashion. A Member asks for a ruling of  the Chair on whether the super majority provision to close debate  applies to closing debate on Senate nominees. The Chair consults with  the Parliamentarian and probably says: Yes, it does clearly apply. Then  the majority leader challenges the ruling of the Chair. If 51 folks  vote to overturn the ruling of the Chair, that is it. The precedent is  then set. The supermajority does not apply to Supreme Court nominees,  to closing debate on Supreme Court nominees. It is that simple. It is  not a change in the rules. The Senate rules require a supermajority to  change the rules. It has just not always been helpful. It has meant  that the Senate has not adjusted to the changing culture of the Senate  to keep it functional. A lot of the time, State legislatures are far  more functional than the U.S. Senate because when they have problems  develop as the culture changes or people develop new tactics for  obstruction, they adjust the way they operate in order to make sure  they can keep making decisions.   It is not unusual in my home State in Oregon for us--that is, the  body in the house or the senate in Oregon--to consider 8 or 10 bills in  a day. With a bill raised, everybody who wants to speak to it for 5  minutes or less gets to speak to it. Then there is a vote, it is  decided, and we go on to another. There is more conversation sharing of  viewpoints on the floor of the Oregon House in the course of a single  day than there is a sharing of views and debate on the floor of the  Senate in an entire year. We have, basically, completely lost anything  resembling a conversation about any issue before the Nation here on the  floor of the Senate. That is a tragic situation. It could be changed if  we changed the way that we operate.   (Mrs. ERNST assumed the Chair.)   The L.A. Times editorial board wrote an essay titled: ``It's not Neil  Gorsuch's fault, but we can't support his ascension to a stolen Supreme  Court seat.''   As we can see from this series of articles, no one will ever forget  that, for the first time in U.S. history, the majority is stealing a  seat from one President and delivering it to another in an audacious  effort to pack the Court. No one should ever forget that, and we should  come to our senses and end this  [[Page S2279]]  before the theft is completed by confirming the nominee to this seat.   This article in the L.A. Times, by the editorial board, says:         A decade ago, The Times urged the Senate to confirm John       Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court even though he was a       conservative judge nominated by a conservative president and       was likely to pull the court to the right for decades to       come. We backed him, despite our disagreements with his       judicial philosophy, because we believe that presidents--      Democrats and Republicans alike--are entitled to significant       deference when they nominate justices to the high court, so       long as the nominees are well qualified and scandal-free,       respect precedent and fall within the broad mainstream of       judicial thinking.        Under normal circumstances, that same reasoning would lead       us to support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch. Like       Roberts, he is conservative but competent, with more than a       decade of experience on the appellate bench and a ``well-      qualified'' rating from the American Bar Assn.        But these are not normal times.        Not after the outrageous obstruction of Judge Merrick       Garland's nomination for 10 full months by Senate       Republicans. That debacle began in March 2016, when President       Obama nominated Garland, a moderate and well-respected       appeals court judge, to fill the seat on the court that had       become vacant with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.       Instead of doing what the Constitution requires and offering       their advice and, if merited, their consent, Senate       Republicans refused even to engage in the process. They       denied Garland a confirmation hearing and in many cases       wouldn't even meet with him--on the hastily fabricated       pretext that a president in his final year of office       shouldn't be allowed to name a new justice because . . .       well, it was never really clear what the supposed principle       was behind this self-serving position.        They stonewalled the nomination until Obama was safely out       of office and a Republican had won the election. And now,       with Gorsuch subbed in for Garland, their cynical and       dishonorable strategy is about to deliver its rewards.        Some people think it's hyperbolic to suggest that a seat       was ``stolen.'' But how else to describe it? Republicans took       the opportunity to fill the vacancy away from Barack Obama       without justification and delivered it up instead to       Donald Trump. Gorsuch could now tilt the balance on the       increasingly polarized Supreme Court for the next 30 or       more years, influencing rulings on free speech, gay and       transgender rights, campaign finance, abortion and gun       laws, among other subjects. He may not be outside the       mainstream of judicial thinking, but he is a textualist,       an originalist and a likely ally of the court's       conservative justices.        The Republicans' underhanded ploy to subvert the Garland       nomination has put the Democrats in an untenable position.       They can now do what would ordinarily be the right thing do--      by going high after the Republicans went low. They could       grumble a little bit but then decline to filibuster, or they       could even vote in favor of Gorsuch--effectively capitulating       in the quixotic hope that an act of good faith would       encourage the Republicans to behave more honorably in the       future.        Alternately, they can go down kicking and screaming. We say       ``go down'' because no matter how hard they kick or how loud       they scream, they seem unlikely to win this battle. The       reality is that without filibustering, they don't have the       votes to defeat Gorsuch. And if they do mount a filibuster,       Senate Republicans can vote to do away with the filibuster       for Supreme Court nominees entirely. Under either scenario,       Gorsuch gets his job.        To be clear, Democrats and Republicans share the blame for       the long roll down the slippery slope of polarization and       dysfunction of the judicial selection process. (Some       Democrats have even suggested in the past that presidents       shouldn't fill Supreme Court seats in election years.) As       that selection process has become increasingly politicized,       the court itself has become more ideologically driven as       well. Although there are differences between Roberts and       Justice Samuel Alito, for example, on some important 1st       Amendment issues, it's also true that in recent years,       justices appointed by Democratic presidents have tended to       vote for ``liberal'' outcomes and justices appointed by       Republicans for ``conservative'' outcomes. That polarization       is a bad trend.        The judicial system works best when justices are neither       rigidly ideological nor biased along partisan lines. To get       there, we need a less highly politicalized selection process,       along with a measure of cooperation, compromise and civility       in Congress.        For the moment, though, it is imperative to remind the       world of what the GOP did. By all means, let's hear a cri de       coeur from Democrats, even if it is in vain. The Republican       misuse of power took partisan obstructionism to an       extraordinary new level and must not be ignored now as if it       never happened. President Obama's nominee was robbed of his       right to a hearing, and the Senate Democrats are under no       obligation to be complicit in the theft.    I do believe it is our responsibility to cry out from our hearts that  this is wrong. Stealing a Supreme Court seat is wrong. Having this  deliberation while the President is under a cloud for his team's  potential collaboration with Russians is wrong. And while this article  described Gorsuch as a bit more mainstream, as people have become  familiar with his opinions--opinions that were widely criticized by  other Republican jurists, and, in one case, overturned by the Supreme  Court on an 8-to-0 vote--they have come to the recognition that he is  way far out on the fringe, not in judicial mainstream.   So how do we fix this? We fix it by each Senator asking what they  would do if the tables were turned and the Democrats had stolen a seat.  The Republicans would cry out: It was wrong. They would ask Democrats  to join them in rejecting that theft. I invite my colleagues to go  through that exercise. How would you respond if a seat had been stolen  from a Republican President and delivered to a Democratic President?  How would you respond if that Democratic President was being  investigated for potential collaboration with the Russians to sway the  outcome of our elections? How would you respond if the nominee was not  from the mainstream, but from the far edge? I am quite confident about  how each person would respond because that situation would be  outrageous.   We must be able to step into each other's shoes and say: If we are  going to preserve this institution, we have to be willing to recognize  when it has gone off course, and it has gone dramatically off course  this last year.   This article is by Dawn Johnsen and is titled: ``Trump's Nominee  Shouldn't Get a Hearing Until Merrick Garland is Seated.''   There really is--as several of these articles have mentioned--a path  to righting this wrong, and that is to go back in time, to recognize  that Merrick Garland was not considered by the Senate, and that we need  to tell the President that we are not entertaining any person other  than Merrick Garland to be in the seat. We will debate whether he  should be in the seat. We will vote on whether he should be in the  seat, and thereby rectify this theft--this stolen seat theft that will  otherwise haunt this body and haunt the Supreme Court for the rest of  our lives and maybe well through our children's lives. But we haven't  committed the crime yet. This theft has not been completed. So we  should all be pondering how to prevent that from happening.   The article starts out:         As President Donald Trump's nominee for the vacant Supreme       Court seat receives public scrutiny in the coming days, it's       incumbent for us to remember one thing: This seat was not       Trump's to fill.        In fact, the U.S. Senate should refuse to confirm anyone       President Trump nominates to the Supreme Court--until Trump       renominates and the Senate confirms Judge Merrick Garland.    It then refers to a Senate filibuster as the only correct approach.         To recap: The Senate failed to fulfill its constitutional       responsibility with this unprecedented refusal even to       consider President Obama's nomination of Garland. Obama made       the nomination with about a year left in his presidency, but       from day one the Republican Senate leadership insisted it       would permanently block it.        No one ever questioned Garland's qualifications--an       impossibility for this brilliant, dedicated public servant.       The obstruction constituted an insulting challenge to Obama's       legitimacy, accompanied by calls for the people to decide via       the election of the next President. The Republicans       effectively have attempted to steal this Supreme Court seat.       If this effort succeeds--as has appeared likely ever since       Trump's surprise election--it will create a fundamental       imbalance in the third branch of our federal government, the       independence and integrity of which is vital to our       constitutional system. An essential role of the federal       judiciary is to check unlawful actions of the political       branches--Congress and the president. When political actors       conspire to distort the makeup of the court, as they did in       denying President Obama his basic constitutional role, we the       people must demand that the balance be restored.        The confirmation of Garland to the court would provide       perfect justice. This may not be quite so far-fetched as it       might seem initially. President Trump is likely to have the       opportunity to make more than one Supreme Court appointment.       As Trump is not nominating Garland this time, the Senate       should keep the current vacancy open until a second seat       becomes vacant. It should then confirm Garland, followed by       the consideration of the Trump choice. The only appropriate       alternative--given the constitutional stakes--would maintain       an eight-person or fewer court for four years.        I don't suggest this lightly: I experienced firsthand--    Again, I am reading this article. So the ``I'' is the author. The  author is Dawn Johnsen.   [[Page S2280]]              I don't suggest this lightly: I experienced firsthand the       personal toll of the Senate refusing to vote on my nomination       to head the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel       in 2009 and 2010. One Republican senator sought to reassure       me it wasn't personal; it was politics, how the game was       played: ``You do it to us; we do it to you.'' My husband, two       sons, and I spent more than a year in confirmation limbo, in       a rented house far from home, awaiting the Senate vote       repeatedly predicted for the next week, next month--but that       never came.        Of course, the politicization of a presidential appointment       is wrong. Each of the president's nominations ordinarily       should be assessed on its individual merits. Notwithstanding       Trump's awful first 10 days in office, the Senate should       continue to offer the president's executive branch nominees       this same fair standard of treatment. In particular, Trump's       nominee to head the Office of Legal Counsel--the office to       which President Obama nominated me and the same office I       headed for part of the Clinton administration--should be       confirmed expeditiously, as long as the nominee is personally       qualified. This president is in desperate need of good legal       advice.        But this Supreme Court vacancy is different. It exists only       as the result of the wrongful denial of the legitimacy of       Obama's presidency. It is the breakdown of the very function       of our democracy and a slap in the face to constitutional       norms. It is an attempted theft that, if permitted, would       bring longstanding consequences. Its end was to prevent the       court from having a majority of justices appointed by       Democratic presidents for the first time since 1969. That's       almost half a century with a court majority appointed by       Republican presidents, a striking imbalance that does not       reflect the presidential vote: Since 1961, Democratic and       Republican presidents have served equal numbers of years.        The flimsy and transparently specious argument Republicans       offered was: ``Let the people decide.'' Of course, the people       decided when they elected President Obama to a second four-      year term. And 3 million more Americans decided they       preferred Obama have a Democratic successor rather than Trump       make this appointment. Those who value an independent       judiciary, and a Senate committed to democracy, can fix this       constitutional problem by insisting on Merrick Garland's       appointment to the seat he already should be occupying. The       pick after that can belong to President Trump.    I think that accurately sums it up. There is an idea embedded in  there of saying: How about this? How about this, fellow Senators--that  we suspend the consideration of Neil Gorsuch at this point in time  until there is another Supreme Court seat that opens up, and at that  time, Merrick Garland gets at least considered for the first seat, the  seat that he was rightly nominated for. President Trump has his person  rightly considered for the second seat. That would be a way to heal the  mess that has been created through the theft of the Supreme Court seat:  We have stolen it, but we will not act on it, and so eventually we will  enable the same nominee to be considered for that seat. That is an  interesting idea, a face-saving idea, an idea that gives President  Trump the opportunity to make the nomination that corresponds to a seat  that comes open during his administration, and President Obama's  nominee to be considered for the seat that came open under President  Obama's control of the Presidency--his time in office.    The LA Times January 31 editorial said--the title kind of sums it up:  ``When the GOP stole Merrick Garland's Supreme Court seat, they set the  stage for a miserable battle.'' That is pretty much the situation we  are in. The previous article I read laid out an idea of a way around it  at this point, in which we leave the Scalia seat empty until there is a  second seat, and then Merrick Garland gets considered for the first  seat, and if the President wants his nominee to be considered for the  second seat, he would have to make that nomination, and then the  President gets his nominee considered for the seat that came up under  his administration, so suddenly there is no longer a stolen seat, and  we are on the path to a future in which the Supreme Court's integrity  is not completely decimated.   This article starts out as follows:         The outrageous obstruction of Merrick Garland's nomination       to the Supreme Court--the 10-month-long stonewall by Senate       Republicans that not only stymied the high court's ability to       do its job but effectively stole the nomination of a new       justice from President Obama--is now delivering its rewards       to the cynical politicians who carried it out.        Having denied Garland even a committee hearing from the       time of his nomination in March until Obama was safely out of       office, the GOP-controlled Senate is now smugly offering that       opening to President Trump to fill. The new president, who       has repeatedly promised to select a new justice in the mold       of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, has said he       will announce his nominee Tuesday evening.    This was written just before the President announced Neil Gorsuch as  his nominee. The article continues:         It's hard to express how head-shakingly unfair this is.       Trump will now have an opportunity to affect the balance of       the increasingly polarized court for the next 30 or 40       years--influencing rulings on abortion, the rights of gay and       transgender people, free speech, corporate and union spending       on elections, labor issues, the separation of church and       state, the ubiquity of guns, criminal justice reform and       endless other hot button subjects.        But Trump never should have been handed this opportunity.       The seat was Obama's to fill subject to Senate ``advice and       consent,'' and he fulfilled his constitutional responsibility       in good faith, only to be kneecapped by a body that would       neither advise nor consent but merely gummed up the machinery       in a transparent effort to preserve the court's conservative       majority. The GOP's feeble justification for its behavior--      that an appointment made by a duly elected president was       somehow illegitimate because he had only 10 months remaining       in office--was believed by no one.        The Senate's misbehavior affected more than just the court.       It also constituted a new low in the tit-for-tat cycle of       dysfunction in Congress, in which each side obstructs its       opponents wherever possible even if that produces a stalemate       that brings the operation of government to a halt. Working       cooperatively across the aisle to solve the nation's problems       has gone out of fashion.        The Democrats have been put in a terrible bind. Do they       take the Republican bait, declare the seat stolen and launch       a filibuster? Or do they roll over, brand themselves patsies       and allow Trump to appoint a Scalia clone? What message do       the Democrats send if they allow themselves to accept this       theft supinely without exacting any punishment? How should       they fight if the nominee is truly outside the mainstream?       And what if he or she is a conservative who is well-respected       and competent--what strategy makes sense then? It's an awful       predicament and it's hard to see how it ends well.        Frankly, the Democrats are not in a terribly strong       position. They don't have a majority in the Senate, and       though they can filibuster for a while, most Senate       Republicans would sooner do away with the filibuster for       Supreme Court justices than allow the seat to sit empty       indefinitely. That's the so-called nuclear option.        At the end the day--    Says this article--         Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will probably win       this round, thus ensuring the long roll down the slippery       slope of polarization and dysfunction continues at an ever-      accelerating speed. He should be, but presumably is not,       ashamed of that contribution to history. His obstructionism       exacerbated the weakening of governmental institutions and       continued the erosion of bipartisan cooperation and civility.       Yet if democracy is to work and the nation is to prosper, the       political system must allow for compromise and rationality       even among determined opponents.        For now, another Justice Scalia or someone even more       extreme will probably be enstooled, potentially endangering       the rights of women and non-whites, threatening backward       movement on same-sex marriage and abortion, offering more       protection for powerful businesses and less for the       environment. Even in these difficult days, this disgraceful       move by Senate Republicans to manipulate a U.S. Supreme Court       seat for partisan purposes stands out as sad and egregious.    Well, that was the LA Times article from January 31: ``When the GOP  stole Merrick Garland's Supreme Court seat, they set the stage for a  miserable battle.''   In the course of conversing about the dilemma we face, I have noted  that there are three big problems. The first is that the seat has been  stolen from one President and delivered to another in an effort to pack  the court.   The second is that the nominee from President Trump is way outside  the judicial mainstream. I have gone through many of the cases.   The third is that there is a big cloud hanging over this  administration. The Trump administration's connections to Russia during  the campaign and throughout the transition are numerous, and we keep  learning about pieces of the puzzle every day.   Contact between the campaign and Russians or dialogue in itself is  not necessarily wrong. But it is wrong if that dialogue was about how  to coordinate, to basically tilt the playing field in favor of Donald  Trump and against Hillary Clinton.   The Russian activity was designed to change the outcome of the  election. So, that in itself is a problem we have to pay a lot of  attention to. We have to understand every piece of how the Russians  operated. We have to convert  [[Page S2281]]  that knowledge into a strategy that prevents it from happening again.   We certainly have to work with our allies to make sure that we help  all of the democratic Republics of the world resist such meddling by  the Russians. So far, we have a pattern of a lot of contacts. That  pattern of Trump associates misleading the public about meetings and  relationships with Russian officials does raise red flags. If meetings  were innocent, why not be forthcoming? That is why we have to have a  strong set of investigations to get to the bottom of this.   We have to understand and recognize that what Russia did in their  strategy was equivalent to an act of war on the United States. They  were attacking our core institution, the bedrock of our democratic  Republic, our election system. That is unacceptable.   If anybody conspired with the Russians, that is treasonous conduct,  and we have to get to the bottom of it. We certainly should get to the  bottom of it before this Supreme Court seat conversation continues. The  subsequent handling of the investigation by the House Intelligence  Committee and the actions taken by the chair of that committee,  Representative Nunes, underscore how serious the situation is. We  definitely have to get to the bottom of what happened.   That fact only emphasizes how seriously the Senate needs to consider  slowing down, setting aside, pressing the pause button on the debate  regarding the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch. Until the FBI and  Congress complete the investigation of these contacts, the ongoing  coverup confirming President Trump's lifetime appointment to the Court  is premature.   On top of possible collusion, it is also worth remembering why it is  so troubling that President Trump has gushed about Putin's leadership  while turning some of our longest and most strategic relationships on  their heads. Putin operates a repressive regime, one that cracks down  on freedom of expression and whose opposition leaders frequently perish  in mysterious and suspicious ways. Someone carrying an item up to their  apartment magically falls and dies or is shot down near the Kremlin or  a whole host of different ways.    The actions of Putin are not the actions of a friend of America. The  actions of Putin are not actions that reflect the values shared by the  American people. They are not values honored in our tradition. They are  not values embedded in our Constitution.   The Putin strongman model is very contrary to our system of  government. There are no checks and balances. Those who rise up in the  streets are likely to be cut down in the streets. Those who cry out for  justice are likely to be silenced. Those who march to improve things  may well find themselves behind bars. That is Putin. That is Russia.   We should not have a significant improvement in our relationship with  Russia unless there is a vast improvement in the fundamental values of  a free and fair society within Russia.   There is an enormous amount of evidence that the Trump campaign was  familiar with and in conversation with Russia. If we pursue the  investigations aggressively, we will find whether there was collusion.   Paul Manafort, a Republican strategist and longtime Washington  operator, joined Trump's campaign team last spring. He was elevated to  be campaign manager after Corey Lewandowski was fired in June. But with  just 3 months to go until the Presidential election, Manafort resigned  amid questions over his campaign role and his extensive history of  lobbying overseas, particularly in Ukraine, where he represented a pro- Russian interest.   Manafort also worked as an adviser on the Ukrainian Presidential  campaign of Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions during the same  time span--from December 2004 until February 2010, the Ukrainian  Presidential election--even as the U.S. Government opposed Yanukovych  because of his ties to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.   Manafort was hired to advise Yanukovych months after massive street  demonstrations, known as the Orange Revolution, overturned Yanukovych's  victory in the 2004 Presidential race. According to a 2008 U.S. Justice  Department annual report, Manafort's company received about $64,000  from Yanukovych's Party of Regions over a 6-month period for consulting  services. That was in 2008.   In 2010, under Manafort's tutelage, the opposition put the Orange  Revolution on trial, campaigning against its leader's management of a  weak economy.   Returns from the Presidential election gave Yanukovych a narrow win  over Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, the leader of the 2004  demonstrations. Yanukovych owed his comeback in the Presidential  campaign to a drastic makeover of his political persona, and this  makeover is credited to Paul Manafort.   From 2007 to 2008, Manafort was involved in investment projects with  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash.  The Associated Press reported that Manafort negotiated a $10 million  annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in  politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States.  We are talking about 2005.   In 1980, Manafort, along with Roger Stone, were founding partners of  the Washington, DC-based lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone and  Kelly.   Roger Stone--what do we know about him? He is a former Trump adviser,  a self-described master of political dark arts, and has been labeled as  the dirty trickster of delegate fights. He has worked with the  campaigns of Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.   Stone repeatedly claimed throughout the final months of the 2016  campaign that he had back-channel communications with WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange, and he knew of the forthcoming document dumps, which  disseminated materials that were hacked by Russia from Democratic  computers.   He admitted in March 2017 that during August of 2016, he had been in  contact with Guccifer 2.0, who was believed to be tied to Russian  intelligence and was claimed to be behind the hack of the DNC.   August 10, Stone tells a local Republican Party group in Florida: I  have actually communicated with Julian Assange.   August 12, Stone says on a podcast that he believes Assange has  emails deleted by Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. He adds  that he knows he has them, and they should be expected to drop in the  next 3 months. ``In fact, I know [Assange] has them,'' Stone said,  ``and I believe he will expose the American people to this information  within the next 90 days.''   August 14, Stone engages in direct messages with the DNC hacker,  Guccifer 2.0, according to direct messages reported by the Washington  Times and the Smoking Gun. Stone tells the hacker he was delighted that  Twitter had reinstated his account.   A day later, Stone says that he has communicated with Assange, and  forthcoming material will be related to the Clinton Foundation.   A day after that, Stone tells radio host Alex Jones that he has back- channel communication with Assange, who has political dynamite on the  Clintons.   August 18, Stone says in an interview on C-SPAN that he has been in  touch with Julian Assange through an intermediary, someone who is a  mutual friend. WikiLeaks would later tweet in response: ``We are happy  to hear true information from everyone. But so far, we have not heard  from Mr. Stone.''   On August 21, Stone tweets that it will soon be Podesta's time in the  barrel. Stone later says his tweet was about Podesta's business  dealings. On the same day, Stone denies that Guccifer 2.0 is connected  to the Russians.   August 26, in an interview with Breitbart radio, Stone says: I'm  almost confident Mr. Assange has virtually every one of the emails that  the Clinton henchwomen, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, thought that they  had deleted, and I expect that he's going to drop them at strategic  times in the runup to this race.    On the 29th, Stone says on local Florida radio of Assange and the  Clinton Foundation: ``Perhaps he has the smoking gun that will make  this handcuff time.''   September 16, Stone says on Boston Herald radio that he expects  Assange and WikiLeaks to ``drop a payload of new documents on a weekly  basis fairly soon. And that of course will answer the question of  exactly what was  [[Page S2282]]  erased on that email server.'' Assange has been in touch with them  through an email intermediary.   October 1, Stone tweets: Hillary Clinton is done.   You go back to the comments he was making, where he seemed to know  what was going to happen before it happened, and we saw it happen. It  clearly suggests, from this public record, the appearance there--it is  hard to imagine with these conversations that there wasn't some form of  collaboration about what was going on. That is why we need to get to  the bottom of it. Was there collaboration? Those kinds of comments are  deeply, deeply disturbing.   We have Carter Page, who worked for 7 years as an investment banker  at Merrill Lynch. His biography said--took him to London, New York, and  Moscow for 3 years in the mid-2000s before Trump last year listed him  as a foreign policy adviser in response to a question from the  Washington Post.   Page has regularly espoused views at odds with much of the foreign  policy community in Washington in particular, questioning the U.S.  approach toward Russia and calling for warmer relations between the two  countries. He has expressed views in support of Vladimir Putin and  harshly criticized U.S. policy. He is frequently quoted on Russian  television as a famous American economist.   In September of 2016, U.S. intelligence officials investigated  alleged contacts between Page and Russian officials subject to U.S.  sanctions. Page rejected the accusations and said he would take a leave  of absence from the Trump campaign.   In January of 2017, Page's name appeared repeatedly in the leaked  Donald Trump-Russia dossier containing contract intelligence from the  former British intelligence operative Christopher Steele in the employ  of a private American firm.   In January of 2017, Page is under investigation by the FBI, CIA, NSA,  and ODNI. Page contends that he has done nothing wrong.   In February 2017, Page said that he had not met with Russian  officials in 2016, but 2 days later, he appeared to contradict himself  and stated he did not deny news reports that he met with Russian  Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in  Cleveland, OH.   This month, Page was called on by the Senate Intelligence Committee  investigating the links between the Trump campaign and Russian  dealings.   Michael Flynn attended a gala in Moscow in honor of Russia Today, now  known as RT, a Russian Government-owned English language media outlet  on which he made semiregular media appearances as an analyst after he  retired from U.S. Government service.   Flynn was paid $45,000 by Russia Today for the 2015 talk and provided  an all-expense-paid 2-day trip paid by Russia. National Security  Adviser Michael T. Flynn was forced to resign once it was revealed that  on December 29, 2016, the day Obama announced sanctions against Russia,  Flynn discussed the sanctions with the Russian Ambassador to the United  States. Flynn had earlier acknowledged speaking to the Ambassador but  not discussing the sanctions.   The New York Times, on March 2, reported that Kislyak had met with  Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner in December 2016 to establish a line of  communication with the Trump administration.   This is just a series of contacts. What we need to know is: Did these  contacts involve communications for coordinating campaign tactics? Did  Russia release information on Hillary at a time suggested by the Trump  campaign? Was there any form of coordination? That is why we need this  robust investigation now.   We have the investigation in the House Intelligence Committee. That  investigation has sputtered and has all the appearance of going  nowhere, and it has been compromised by the comments of the House  chair.   There is another investigation on the Senate side, with Senator Burr  as the chair and Senator Warner as the ranking member, and they are  working pretty well together. We hope that continues. I know that they  believe that we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of this  issue, and I know there are many Members on both sides of the aisle who  put a high priority on getting to the bottom of this issue.   I applaud the work the Senate committee is doing, but we all know  that the Intelligence Committee is a hard place to get information out  of. For example, when the torture report was completed, it was  extraordinarily difficult to get that into the public's hands. This  should not be the only strategy.   Certainly, we have another strategy with the FBI, and we had the  briefing on the Hill. The FBI Director, a week ago Monday, came to  speak to the House, and he shared a fair amount in terms of confirming  that the investigations are underway, and it is important that the FBI  use its talents and assets and connections to find out what really went  on in order to get to the bottom of this.   I would like to also see us have a special prosecutor who pursues  this, who puts together a team and specifically drills in to get to the  bottom of this. I would like to see a bipartisan commission--a  Watergate-style commission--so that some of this could be done in the  public realm and not hidden behind the veil of classifications. Of  course, I would like to see a robust investigation by the press--by the  fourth estate. If all of those things happen or if some do not happen  but the others are done well, we will get to the bottom of this--and  the sooner the better.   I am going to continue by sharing some comments that the Senate  Democratic leader made in a floor speech on February 16. These are  excerpts of Senator Schumer's floor speech:         The recent reports about General Flynn detailing constant       high-level contact between members of the Trump       administration and the Russian Government raise serious       doubts about this administration's competence in the realm of       foreign policy and national security and even graver doubts       about the sanctity of our democratic process.        We do not know all the facts, and in the coming days and       weeks, more information may well surface about these       disturbing revelations, but we already know that something is       rotten in the state of Denmark.        All of us can agree that right now what are required are       the facts. We have to evaluate the scope of Russia's       interference in our election and assess if agents of their       government have penetrated to the highest levels of our       government. Throughout the process, we have to avoid jumping       to conclusions or engaging in wild speculation. We must seek       the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Once       we have the facts at our disposal, Democrats and Republicans       alike can debate what to do next.        Senate Democrats are faithfully committed to keeping this       issue above partisan politics. The gravity of this issue       demands nothing less . . . I am very hopeful the other side       wants to get at all the facts, just as our side wants to get       at all the facts.        This is an issue on which patriotism must prevail over       politics because before we are Democrats or Republicans, we       are Americans, with respect for the rule of law.    Those are excerpts of Senator Schumer's floor speech on February 16,  and I certainly, passionately, agree with him.   This investigation of what went on in the election is one in which  patriotism must prevail over politics because, above all, we are  Americans with respect for the rule of law.   I will add that, as leaders in America, here in this Senate Chamber,  we have a huge responsibility to get to the bottom of this, to urge  forward the investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee to make  sure the results, as appropriately compiled and vetted to protect  confidential sources, are shared with the American public so that the  American public can know what transpired and so that we, then, act on  that information. If that information shows that there have been  treacherous acts of collaboration with the Russians to undermine the  integrity of our elections, we must pursue it to the full extent of the  law.   This next excerpt is from Senator Schumer's speech, on March 6, which  called for a special prosecutor:         So my Republican colleagues should understand that what       they know in their hearts is the right thing to do. Do a       strong, impartial investigation and get to the bottom of       this. That is where the American people want them to go. The       American people disagree with President Trump and want a       thorough and impartial investigation--even 43 percent of the       Republicans. They are right.        A special prosecutor is the best way to ensure that an       investigation proceeds impartially for several reasons.    In a conversation with POLITICO, our Democratic leader said on March  21:   [[Page S2283]]              You can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a       Democratic President was under investigation by the FBI the       Republicans would be howling at the Moon about filling a       Supreme Court seat in such circumstances.        It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a       Supreme Court Justice with a lifetime appointment while this       big, gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the       Presidency.    The Washington Post notes it is unseemly to confirm Gorsuch amidst an  FBI probe of the Trump campaign.   I would like to point out that it is the height of irony that  Republicans held the Supreme Court seat open for nearly a calendar year  while President Obama was in office but are now rushing to fill the  seat for a President whose campaign is under investigation by the FBI.  It is unseemly and wrong to be moving so fast on a lifetime appointment  in such circumstances.   On March 21, a report on the Hill by Jordain Carney said:         Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer is urging       Republicans to delay a vote on Neil Gorsuch, President       Trump's Supreme Court nominee, because of an ongoing       investigation into potential ties between Trump officials and       Russia.        ``It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming       a Supreme Court Justice with a lifetime appointment while       this big, gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the       Presidency,'' the Senate's top Democrat said, echoing       language used the day before by Republican House Intelligence       Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.        Schumer's request, which is unlikely to gain traction with       Republicans, comes as Gorsuch is into his second day before       the Judiciary Committee . . . but the New York Democrat       argued that it was ``the height of irony'' that the       Republicans blocked then-President Obama from filling the       Supreme Court seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia's death . .       . but are now rushing to confirm Gorsuch.    Just before I started speaking yesterday evening, the majority leader  came to the floor, gave a short speech, and said he was filing a  petition to close debate. That is the first time in U.S. history that a  petition to close debate has been filed on the first day of a Senate  debate. Generally, the Senate will, if people have more to say, go for  many days--go for weeks--without somebody's filing a petition to close  and shut off debate.   Why are we rushing into the completion of this nomination in this  extraordinarily inappropriate, condensed, accelerated fashion when  there is so much to consider?   This is not a nomination in normal times. This is a nomination for a  seat that has been stolen from one President and delivered to another.  It is the first time it has happened in U.S. history. This is a  nomination during a moment in which the President making the nomination  has a team that is under investigation for potentially conspiring with  the Russians to change the outcome of the Presidential election. That  is the big cloud that must be dispelled and resolved and should be  resolved before this conversation on the floor continues.   This is a nominee who comes from the far right of the spectrum, with  case after case after case--the frozen trucker case, the autistic child  case. There is case after case in which he finds a way to turn the law  to do the opposite of what the law was written to do.   As I have read through those cases over the course of the nearly,  roughly more than 11 hours, you will see the pattern of decision after  decision being made for the powerful and the privileged, of his writing  a dissent from the majority that says this decision by a labor board  was very reasonable and in compliance with the law because it exactly  fits the law. Yet Neil Gorsuch wrote a dissent because he wanted to  find a way to find for the powerful organization.   Here we have these three big factors. This is a time when there  should never be a petition to close debate because people have a lot to  say, and there are 100 Members of this body. When they expend their  energies and they are through with their conversations, then ask the  question: Are people ready to close debate? At that moment: Are there  60 votes for this nominee?   This effort to ram this through not only does not fit the tradition  of the Senate or fit the circumstances, but it raises a question: Is  there an effort to put this through before information comes to the  surface that might change the outcome?   At 11 o'clock last night, we got this posting--or, I guess, it was  posted at 11 p.m. and we got it at about midnight here on the floor--of  the article by POLITICO. It laid out a side-by-side comparison of  language that Gorsuch had used that was, essentially, lifted from other  people's writings without attribution. Several experts have said that  this meets the standards of plagiarism because the language was lifted  without attribution, and that is what plagiarism is. Others said maybe  not. Maybe it does not quite meet that standard.   Is this one of the reasons that we are trying to shove this  nomination through in such an extraordinary way when it is under such a  cloud to begin with? Is there more information like this that needs to  come out?   This is a guarantee that Senators would vote against closing debate  if there is the possibility that this is trying to be done fast--to  have a vote--before significant information is put into the public  realm.   (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)   The New York Times had an article on March 29, 2017: ``Senate  Intelligence Committee Leaders Vow Thorough Russian Investigation'':         Senators leading the investigation into Russia interference       in the November election pledged on Wednesday to conduct an       aggressive inquiry, including an examination of any ties to       President Trump, as they sought to distance themselves from       the flagging efforts in the House.        In a conspicuous show of bipartisanship during a fractious       time at the Capitol, the top Republican and Democrat on the       Senate Intelligence Committee vowed to forge ahead by       interviewing key players connected to Mr. Trump and pressing       intelligence agencies to provide all relevant information.        But their display of collegiality seemed intended primarily       as a contrast to the explosive and often bewildering       statements in recent days from the Republican chairman of the       House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of       California, whose perceived closeness with the Trump White       House has raised doubts about his ability to conduct an       impartial investigation.        The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard       M. Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and a supporter of       Mr. Trump during the campaign, suggested on Wednesday that he       would not retreat from a process that could damage the       reputation of a Republican President. ``This investigation's       scope will go wherever the intelligence leads,'' Mr. Burr       said during a rare joint news conference.        Asked later whether he had encountered any direct links       between Mr. Trump and Russia's interference, Mr. Burr was       stern. ``We know that our challenge,'' he said, ``is to       answer that question for the American people.''        The Senate investigation amounts to a credibility test for       Republicans under the Trump administration--a chance to prove       their willingness to ask uncomfortable questions of a       Republican President, even if the answers might weaken his or       the party's standing.        Democrats are skeptical. But they are also mindful that the       Senate most likely remains their best hope on Capitol Hill       for gathering information, making them disinclined to abandon       the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation. The F.B.I.       is also investigating.        On Wednesday, Mr. Burr and his Democratic counterpart on       the committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, offered some       evidence of what they had reviewed so far, saying they had       begun to schedule the first of at least 20 interviews.        Mr. Warner drew attention to reports of perhaps 1,000       internet trolls in Russia generating fake news stories and       targeting them in swing States like Wisconsin, Michigan, and       Pennsylvania. ``Russia's goal, Vladimir Putin's goal,'' said       Mark Warner, ``is a weaker United States.''        Mr. Burr noted that the Russians were now ``actively       involved'' in the French elections. On Thursday, the       committee will hold a public hearing on Russian influence on       campaigns broadly.        The two also left little doubt that they viewed the House's       unruly process as an afterthought, one that should not       reflect on their own efforts.    ``Let me set the ground rules real quick,'' Mr. Burr said, ``before  taking questions. We will answer anything about the Senate Intelligence  Committee's investigations. We will not take questions on the House  Intelligence Committee.''         Mr. Burr could not suppress a smirk. Mr. Warner laughed       outright.        But the drama in the House has already complicated the       Senate's task, according to Senate committee members, leading       the public to question congressional inquiries across the       board.        ``I worry that the chaos on the House side has affected the       public's view on whether Congress can credibly investigate       this matter,'' said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from       Maine and a committee member. ``I believe the answer to that       is still yes, and the Senate is the place.''  [[Page S2284]]         Lamenting the ``debacle'' in the House, Senator Kamala       Harris, Democrat of California and another committee member,       said she believed ``the public is now shifting to us.''        The Congressional investigations are not related, but their       focuses overlap, leaving the Senate panel to defend itself in       the face of Mr. Nunes's assorted claims. While a vast       majority of Republicans in the House have stood by Mr. Nunes       amid calls for him to recuse himself, his furtive       maneuvering--including bypassing the committee to brief the       White House about relevant intelligence--has placed House       committee members in a difficult spot.        And at least one Republican lawmaker, Representative       Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, suggested on Wednesday that the       Senate should take the lead on Congress's investigation into       ties between the President's orbit and Russia.        The Senate majority leader has long resisted calls for a       special prosecutor or select committee, saying the Senate can       do the job through regular protocol.        On the House side, a string of perplexing decisions by Mr.       Nunes has threatened to unravel the panel's investigation       altogether. Last week, he abruptly announced that he had       obtained information indicating that people associated with       the Trump transition may have ``incidentally'' been caught up       in legal surveillance of foreign operatives. He also bypassed       the committee's top Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff       of California, to brief Mr. Trump.        The President seized on the information, misleadingly, as       evidence for his thoroughly debunked claim that President       Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower--an allegation       dismissed not only by senior law enforcement officials like       the F.B.I. Director James Comey, but also by the heads of the       House and Senate investigations, including Mr. Nunes.        Another obstacle to bipartisanship came on Monday, with the       revelation that Mr. Nunes had viewed what he characterized as       ``dozens'' of reports containing classified information on       the grounds of the White House.        Democrats fumed, their suspicions fueled by speculation       that the source of Mr. Nunes's information was a Trump       administration official and that Mr. Nunes may have even       coordinated with the White House. While Mr. Nunes defended       him by saying he needed to be at the White House to view the       sensitive documents in question, one can peruse sensitive       information at the Capitol and at other spots around       Washington.    The story of the House investigation melting down continues, and it  really emphasizes how important the Senate investigation is. I have  been very impressed by Senator Burr and Senator Warner working together  to pursue that investigation. I feel that more needs to be done. Yes,  the FBI needs to investigate, and the Senate Intelligence Committee,  and the press, but we should also have a special prosecutor. We should  also have a bipartisan commission. But if each part of this puzzle  pursues their work aggressively and in good faith, we may get to the  bottom of what went on. It is so important to hold people accountable,  and if traitorous crimes have been committed, they need to be pursued  to the full extent of the law.   The article goes on:         Democrats have also chafed at Mr. Nunes's shuffling of the       hearing schedule. Earlier this month, with Mr. Schiff by his       side, he announced plans for three former officials to       testify, a group that would include Sally Q. Yates, who       briefly served as acting Attorney General and alerted the       administration that Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former       National Security Adviser, appeared to have lied about his       contact with Russian officials.        Last week, Mr. Nunes scrapped that public hearing, arguing       that the committee first needed more time to question       intelligence leaders. But on Tuesday he said this hearing had       been postponed as well--as the Washington Post reported that       White House officials had tried to stymie Ms. Yates's       testimony. Democrats have accused Mr. Nunes of trying to       stall not only the investigation but also the committee as a       whole.        Mr. Warner said on Wednesday he would ``like to see Ms.       Yates at some point'' before his committee.        At the same time, the Senate investigation has not been       blemish-free.    Well, this can be summed up by saying that each of them are saying  that they are partners and they are working on this together. And I  urge them to continue that work aggressively.         ``I'll do something I've never done: I'll admit I voted for       him,'' Mr. Burr said of Mr. Trump. ``But I've got a job in       the United States Senate.''    And we have a job to address. We are here at this critical moment,  wrestling with what to do with this stolen Supreme Court seat, knowing  that if we confirm a nominee to this seat and confirm and complete the  theft, it will damage the Court through the rest of our lifetimes. It  will set a precedent that will cause more turmoil, more politicization.  It will call into question every 5-to-4 decision of the Court. That is  our responsibility, to figure our way out of this.   One of the articles I read earlier suggested a path out of this. It  said to keep this seat empty. Set this aside until there is a second  seat, and then the nominee, Merrick Garland, who should have been  considered for the first seat, would be considered, and the second  nominee would be whoever President Trump wants to put forward, and  maybe that is the same nominee we have now. Maybe it is Neil Gorsuch;  maybe it is somebody else. But the point is you eliminate the stolen  seat syndrome.   Maybe there are other pathways out of this, but proceeding to the  completion of this week, in confirming Neil Gorsuch, that is where this  week ends. It is truly deeply damaging to the Supreme Court for the  balance of our lives. Let us not be partners to such a destruction of a  key branch of our government.   The damage won't just be to the Supreme Court. It is also to this  body. Because once this body conspired in the theft, the wounds here  are deep and will continue to cause tremendous acrimony as we go  forward, and it will lead to future acts in the Senate--perhaps  balancing out the first theft with a second theft--and so on and so  forth, in which nobody wins.   So let us come to our senses and not have this week end in the manner  in which it has been predicted that it will.   NPR wrote, or it has a piece done by Philip Ewing: ``4 Unanswered  Questions About the FBI's Russia Investigation,'' March 20.         FBI Director James Comey lit the fuse Monday on a political       time bomb and no one--including him--knows how long it will       take to burn or what kind of damage it may cause when it goes       off.        Comey confirmed to Members of Congress that his       investigators are looking into possible collusion between the       campaign that elected President Trump and the Russian       government. In fact, he said, the FBI has been doing so since       last July.        The signs had been there, from press reports to the       announcement by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Sessions       would recuse himself from any such probe. Now, Comey's       disclosure to the House Intelligence Committee removes all       doubt that the FBI believes there is sufficient evidence to       look into the connection between Trump's one-time political       aides and the Kremlin.        The case that Russia interfered in the presidential       campaign has been made. The U.S. intelligence community laid       out an unclassified version in December, and then President       Barack Obama responded by expelling a group of Russian spies       and sanctioning some of its key officials.        But details about the role Trump's team might have played       in the making of that mischief still are murky, and Monday's       hearing did not include much explosive new information. In       fact, the panel's chairman, California Representative Devin       Nunes, who served on Trump's transition team, and his fellow       Republicans, spent as much of their time as they could       drawing the focus away from the Russian collusion narrative.        The real outrage, Republicans argue, is the leaking of       classified information to the Washington Post and other       newspapers, especially the identity of former lieutenant       general Mike Flynn as having been swept up in U.S. Government       surveillance of Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.    I am sure I will be corrected on that later, with the correct  pronunciation.         Flynn resigned after a brief stint as Trump's National       Security Adviser and has since retroactively registered as a       foreign agent for his work representing Turkish interests.       Democrats revealed on Friday that Flynn had also taken more       than $50,000 in payments from Russian government entities.        Democrats, led by ranking member Adam Schiff, also of       California, used their time on Monday to put Trump and the       Russians together as closely as possible, including in an       extended opening statement by Schiff that laid out his theory       of the case.        Much of Schiff's statement, however, relied on information       that is already publicly available, which has been called       into question. Monday's session did not include major new       details about the alleged ways that the Trump camp may       have worked with the Russian intelligence services.        But it did raise new questions about the imbroglio--some of       which lawmakers may answer at a second session now scheduled       for March 28, and some of which might not be cleared up until       the FBI announces the results of its investigation.    The first question:         1. How much evidence is still to be discovered? And how       reliable is what's now public?        Schiff crafted a narrative about the Russians' first       exploration of the presidential candidates to a critical       period from July to August of 2016. If Moscow began by trying       simply to learn more about the potential next U.S. president,       it shifted to trying to hurt the likely Democratic nominee,       Hillary  [[Page S2285]]       Clinton, and then helping her opponent--or so the argument       goes.        Schiff relied on information that has appeared in press       reports and some that appears in a controversial dossier       passed from a former British intelligence officer to Comey by       Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. NPR and other news organizations       have refrained from reporting such details because of the       unknown providence of the dossier--but does Schiff's use of       it in the public hearing indicate that at least some of the       information has been verified?        The Democrats' case also rests on conversations between       Trump advisers and people connected to the Russian military       intelligence service, the GRU, or other top Russians. But how       much more detail exists about what was said in those       meetings? How much effort are congressional or FBI       investigators making to interview Trump's campaign advisers?    So the first question in the NPR report is, How much evidence is  still to be discovered and how reliable is what is now public?   The second question in this report:         2. Might Trump aides have colluded with Russia without       knowing it?        One new thread that emerged from Monday's hearing came as       part of an exchange between Comey and Illinois Democrat Mike       Quigley, who asked whether it's possible for Americans to       help a foreign power and not know about it.        Yes, Comey answered cautiously--an American might give       information to someone he legitimately believes is a Chinese       researcher and isn't aware is actually a Chinese intelligence       officer. Or an America might fall in love with someone and       not realize he or she is in a relationship with a foreign       agent: ``Romance could be a feature,'' he said.        That could explain denials by people at the center of the       Trump-Russia imbroglio, including former Trump campaign       manager Paul Manafort, who resigned after reports about his       connections to pro-Kremlin government factions in Ukraine.       The New York Times referred to Manafort in a story in       February about U.S. intelligence officers documenting many       alleged connections between the Trump camp and Russians.        Manafort called the report ``absurd'' and told the       newspaper: ``It's not like these people wear badges that say,       `I'm a Russian intelligence officer.' ''        Manafort's comment caused head-scratching at the time it       appeared, but Comey and Quigley's exchange on Monday created       the prospect for a story about Russia not necessarily using       Trump campaign aides as agents, but dupes.    The third question in this NPR article:         3. What did Trump know--and when did he know it?        If Comey's investigation results in no charges or no new       information about ties between Trump's camp and Russia, the       White House would get rid of an albatross that has been       around its neck for months. But if the FBI charges former       Trump campaign officials or reveals links between the Trump       camp that haven't already been aired publicly, that could       escalate quickly and land the president or his top campaign       aides in hot water.        Trump never retreats and never apologizes and so far has       mounted a brash defense. He flits between sometimes       acknowledging the Russian mischief during the presidential       race and sometimes dismissing it as a fiction created by       Democrats to excuse their loss. That strategy has continued       to be workable, and Republican aides on Capitol Hill have       shown continued willingness to carry water for the White       House in responding to press reports or handling inquiries       like those on Monday.        But charges against Trump aides, or new revelations about       collusion between the campaign and Russian agents, would       change all that--and fast. Democrats may never forgive Comey       for revealing just before Election Day that the FBI had       resumed inquiries into Hillary Clinton's private email       server, which Clinton and Democrats say threw a close       election to Trump. Now the president, the White House and       their Republican allies on Capitol Hill are under a similar       Sword of Damocles.    The fourth question:         How will Russia respond to the investigations and their       outcome?        Comey, National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers and       other top U.S. intelligence officials have taken care not to       say whether they believe Russia succeeded in influencing the       outcome of the 2016 election--only that they're confident       Moscow conducted an influence campaign.        Will Russian President Vladimir Putin turn out to have       invested wisely or to have been the dog that caught the car?       If Putin wanted the U.S. to relax the Obama-era sanctions       imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that ship may       have sailed--the scrutiny of Trump's connections to Moscow       may have now made even the appearance of any deal impossible.        And American military deployments in Eastern Europe,       including of armored units along NATO's frontier with Russia       and ships with aircraft in the Black Sea, have continued.        None of this means, however, that Putin is finished       meddling in American politics, Comey warned. He told members       of Congress on Monday that the Russians, for their own       purposes, likely are satisfied with their work--having sowed       confusion and undercut faith in the U.S. democratic process--      and may try it again.        ``We have to assume they're coming back,'' he said.    We have to assume they are also working to undermine the elections in  other democratic countries, and we need to be working with our allies  and fellow democracies to fully understand and thwart this Russian  strategy of undermining the foundation for our democratic Republic's  elections.   The NPR article raised very good questions--questions to which we  don't have answers. But just the breadth of the questions shows how  significant this situation is.   I understand the Sun is coming up behind the Supreme Court. I was  struck just how beautiful the weather was yesterday, while the weather  inside this building was so dark and gloomy. Mother Nature gave us a  beautiful, beautiful day. The partisan politics gave us a very, very  ugly setting here in the Senate Chamber as we started debating over a  nominee nominated to fill a seat which did not open up under President  Trump's watch and which he has no right to propose a nominee. This is a  seat stolen from the Obama administration, delivered to President  Trump.   Wouldn't it have been something if President Trump said: I talked a  lot about bringing this country together, and that starts by honoring  our institutions. So I am going to heal this rift. I am going to end  this theft by nominating Merrick Garland. Sixteen times--the President  could have said--16 times in the history of our country, there has been  an open seat during an election year on the Supreme Court. And we  already know the past; that is, 15 times the Senate considered the  nominee and either confirmed or rejected them but always considered  them--except with Merrick Garland.   We are going to heal that damage, the President could have said, and  so first we will put forward Merrick Garland. Then when a seat opens  legitimately on my watch, I will put forward a nominee I would choose  according to the principles I laid out in my campaign. But I am not  going to damage the Supreme Court for generations to come by  participating in this strategy of packing the Court.   If the President had given that speech, that would have been an  impressive moment--a moment of bringing this country together, of  saying that he is the President not of the Republican Party but of the  United States of America, which has these beautiful key branches of  government, coequal branches--the executive branch, the legislative  branch, the judicial branch--bringing all three of those together in  that conversation and saying: What the legislative branch did sets the  stage to damage the Supreme Court, and as President, I won't  participate in it. I will solve it. I will bring people together. I am  the great negotiator. I know how to make a deal. Right now, the only  deal is a bad deal that damages all three branches, a deal that was  crafted within a few minutes following the death of Antonin Scalia, on  the same day the majority leader came to the floor and said: We are  going to do something never done before in American history. We are  going to steal a seat.   Of course, those are not the words he used. His words were: We are  not going to have any Senate action on this nominee, the nominee the  President will put forward for this seat.   If only at that moment the Senate had been the cooling saucer. That  is the idea that Washington reputedly put forward, considered to be  apocryphal, but it is a nice image that sums up the difference between  the House and the Senate--the Senate elected for 6 years, seats  rotating every 2 years. And when there are wild ideas crafted in the  passion of the moment, the Senate comes along and says: We will bring a  little more experience and thoughtfulness. We will bring a little more  deliberation, and we will craft something that will strengthen America,  strengthen our institutions, not destroy them.   But we didn't have that reaction on that day when Antonin Scalia  died. Instead, we had not the cooling saucer, but we had the immediate  rush to a principle that will do so much damage. And I say  ``principle'' only in the context of an asserted argument; that is,  [[Page S2286]]  an argument that, well, it is an election year, so we really shouldn't  consider someone. It should go to the next President. There was no  principle behind it and no history behind it. As I pointed out, 15  seats were open during the election year in the history of our country,  and the Senate acted on every one until the 16th, when Antonin Scalia  died, and within just a couple hours, the majority leader announced  that we will do what we never did, and that is, fail to honor the  advice and consent responsibility of the U.S. Senate.    I will do so.    My colleague from Illinois is absolutely right. In the  middle of the night somewhere, a few hours ago, I pointed out that this  evidence of different style of action didn't just depend on the history  books because you can look a few hundred yards here from the Senate out  at the Supreme Court, where Justice Kennedy sits and had gone through  the process, just as the Senator had described.    As my colleague has pointed out through his question,  the challenge we have with the appropriate treatment of our advice and  consent responsibility isn't simply a problem with the Supreme Court  nominee, but with strategies to prevent the consideration of judges  from our former President--both at the district court and at the  circuit court levels--leading to the circumstances you describe.    I am aware of that, and it disturbs me that the  responsibility of the President to find the right person to place on  the Court was farmed out, essentially, to these two groups the Senator  mentioned.   While often people will say: Did the President ask the nominee a  particular question about how they might rule on XYZ, I am sure that it  is quite likely that these groups did ask all sorts of questions in  developing their list of 21 potential Justices.    I think that would not be a leap of judgment or  analysis. Clearly, the groups like the Koch brothers believe that their  interests are deeply connected to the decisions made in this body. And  they have invested vast resources into the campaigns, so it is not just  that they said: Well, let's go down and talk to people in the Senate  about our particular interests as coal and oil billionaires. No, they  decided to change the makeup of who sits in this body. In 2014, the  investment involved going into Louisiana and Arkansas and North  Carolina and Iowa and Colorado and Alaska and several other States,  including my State, the State of Oregon. And they won most of those  States that they invested in.   Then they sent a message in January 2015 by saying: In the next  election, we are prepared to spend the better part of a billion  dollars. That was heard very loudly in this Chamber, and the first bill  up was a Koch brothers' bill. You see their influence in all kinds of  ways, indeed.   I believe the reason we are here today in this conversation is in  large part because those who invested in creating the majority that we  now have in this Chamber wanted to make sure that there was a Supreme  Court that would sustain the Citizens United ruling that allows this  dark money of which the Senator speaks.    I say to my colleague from Illinois that the entire  situation we are in revolves around the issue of dark money and having  a person on the Court who will sustain that flow. That Citizens United  decision was a 5-to-4 decision. Four Justices laid out the case that  these unlimited funds--and often secret funds--are corrupting our  American political system. And if one wants an example of that  corruption, simply look at the vast change--within a short period of  years--of the position of our colleagues on the right side of the aisle  in regard to the environment.    We had many colleagues who were very concerned about carbon pollution  coming from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. They wanted to  make sure that we had a sustainable planet to pass on to our children-- our children's children. It was following a Republican tradition of  being involved in things like the Environmental Protection Agency  creation with President Nixon and the Clean Water Act and Clear Air  Act.   In a short period of time, like a shallow pool beneath a hot sun, it  just evaporated. That concern for the environment just disappeared and  dissipated. The result is that today, we have virtually no support to  take on this major environmental threat in a bipartisan fashion, and  that corresponds to this flow of dark money from the oil and coal  billionaires into the campaigns for the Senate in the United States of  America.   So it is a deeply disturbing situation in which absolutely a lot of  the explanation as to why we have a stolen Supreme Court seat and why  we have this nominee and why he is being rushed through in a way that  no Supreme Court seat had been rushed through ever before.   Yesterday--Tuesday--just shortly before I started speaking last  night, the majority leader came to the floor and said that he was  filing a petition to close debate. That is the first time in U.S.  history that has been done on the first day of the debate. That is the  type of, I guess, completely focused effort to complete the theft that  began last year.    I say to my colleague from Illinois that we will  probably never know the full vetting that took place and the  conversations that took place, but your observation that Hobby Lobby  involves a parallel with Citizens United is absolutely right. In  Citizens United, the Court said: The corporation gets these political  rights; that is, the ability to spend money in campaigns, unlimited  funds. And in Hobby Lobby, the corporation gets religious rights, if  you will--the right to overrule, not just express them through the  benefits they provide to their employees, but to trump the religious  choices of their employees. It is kind of a super religious power, if  you will, choosing the corporation over the people. In both cases,  there is this element of choosing the corporation, promoting it,  exalting it, over the rights of individuals.   Jefferson made a comment in a letter where he talked about the  philosophy of the mother principle. The mother principle said that the  only way our government will proceed to fulfill the will of the people  is if each citizen has an equal voice--not vote, but voice. ``Vote''  was a big piece of that, but he chose the word ``voice,'' as did  President Lincoln on another occasion. The point he was making is that  you have to have a place where everyone can weigh in, more or less, in  equal fashion.   The opposite of that is Citizens United, where an individual who is a  multibillionaire can weigh in massively by buying up the air waves, the  radio waves, the television waves, the web advertising, the social  media, scrolling and so forth--all of these tools that didn't exist at  the time they were formed. So there is this ability for the wealthiest  to do a citizen sound equivalent of a stadium sound system that drowns  out the voice of the people, just as you have this situation in Hobby  Lobby where the religious preference of the corporate entity can trump  the religious preferences of the employees.    My colleague from Illinois brings up the frozen trucker  case, as it has often been referred to, and how it demonstrates an  effort to really twist the law away from its original purpose in order  to find for the powerful over the individual.   In this particular case, when he wrote his viewpoint, Neil Gorsuch  revealed a whole lot because here was a law specifically crafted to  protect truckers from being fired if they operated for personal safety  or the safety of the public.    Clearly, for him to have driven that trailer down the road, a fully  loaded trailer without brakes because the brakes were frozen, would  have been incredibly dangerous to all kinds of people. To stay in that  cab freezing to death was dangerous to him. You can interpret the  concept of operating a truck, and the law said refusing to operate a  truck. Well, does refusing to operate a truck mean that you refuse to  operate it in exactly the manner that you were told to? Does it mean  driving the cab without the trailer or the cab with the trailer?   Gorsuch zeroed in on the fact that, well, he did not refuse to  operate because he drove the cab. He was operating. Well, no, he was  not operating in any common person's understanding. He left the trailer  there. He wasn't driving it down the road. But he searched for that  slight little way that he could say: Well, that does not quite fit, and  therefore I can find for the corporation.   It just fits case after case after case in which the nominee who is  before us now stretched the law, twisted the law, tortured the law, in  order to try to find a victory for the powerful over a person.    I thank my colleague from Illinois for coming down to  help focus on some of those cases. I appreciate the great knowledge he  brings to Senate issues and the deliberations in the Judiciary  Committee. I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, so, as I  listened to my colleagues commenting on the questions that were being  raised and how they were being answered, I saw in the course of those  hearings a trajectory in which many colleagues found, as they looked  into the heart of these decisions, that there was an absence of heart  reflected in the decisions.   The ability to understand the full context of which something  happened is so important. When I was a freshman in college, I had a  course, a freshman seminar, and that seminar was taught by an esteemed  professor of the law school. She would have us read the circumstances  of a case, and then say: How would you have ruled on this case? We  would write up our little memos, our short little memos, not really  based on law because we didn't know the law but on common sense or  whatever life experience would have brought to bear.   Then the next week, we would read the Justice's opinions, their  decisions on what they had found to be the case--did they sustain the  argument for the defense or otherwise, and what arguments did they  bring to bear?   I was always struck that William O. Douglas seemed to have the best  grip on being able to place himself into the mindset and the situation  of folks who were bringing grievances forward to be addressed. I think  a lot of that came from his life experience and the life experience in  which he had basically lived in the wilderness part of the time. He had  hung out with hobos, and he had ridden the rods underneath the railroad  cars to get from one place to another. He had experiences that were not  just inside the bubble--the billionaire bubble, the elite bubble, the  gated community.   The opposite of that is the situation when I was in New York back in  2008 and I was speaking to someone about campaigning for the Senate.  The individual said: I don't understand why you are so concerned about  healthcare. Everybody has healthcare--everybody. Well, in his world, in  his bubble, everybody had healthcare and everybody was wealthy, but  that is not the entirety of the world.   So it is so important to have people on the Court who can get inside  the experience that others have and that diverse experience. You don't  see that reflected in decisions that have been written by Neil Gorsuch.   I thank my colleague from Illinois.   The Guardian wrote an article titled ``The Guardian view of Trump's  Russia links: a lot to go at.'' I will share this particular article,  but before I do so, let us remember that we are here at this moment  with three substantial issues.   One issue is the fact that for the first time in U.S. history, a  Supreme Court seat has been stolen from one President and delivered to  another--the first  [[Page S2289]]  and only time. Sixteen times we have had a vacancy in a Presidential  year, and 15 times the Senate has acted to consider the nominee, in  some cases rejecting them, in some cases--in most cases confirming  them, but always acting until last year.   The second big issue is this Russia investigation, the investigation  of the links between the Trump campaign and the Russians, this big  cloud hanging over the legitimacy of the Presidency. It needs to be  resolved. That certainly affects whether it is legitimate to be  considering at this moment the President's nominee before that cloud is  dissipated or resolved because this individual, whoever is confirmed  for this seat, will quite likely serve for many decades. When it is a  younger nominee, as it is with Neil Gorsuch, that could be five  decades. It could be an extensive length of time with decisions that  stretch far into the future.   Rather than rush through this in a few days, we should be setting  this aside until these issues are resolved to make sure that we have  established the legitimacy of the President's role in office and gotten  rid of this cloud hanging over him.   The third, of course, is the nominee himself. I so much appreciate my  colleague from Illinois proceeding to, through his questions, raise a  number of the points about Neil Gorsuch's record. There is the case of  the frozen trucker. We did not talk about the case of the autistic  child, but that is very similar, where the law--and it is similar in  this sense--the law was quite clearly written to promote a particular  resolution of a challenge, and that is that every child, despite their  disability, would have the opportunity to have an appropriate  education. Neil Gorsuch managed to reduce that down to mere improvement  over de minimus; that is, basically a tiny little bit of improvement  over doing nothing. That was the Neil Gorsuch standard.   That standard went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court just  recently issued its decision, and it was not a confirmation that it is  OK to have just a mere improvement over doing nothing, it was a  wholesale rejection, because the law is very clear, and Neil Gorsuch  tormented it and twisted it and tortured it to produce a position that  you can do nothing and meet the standard of the law that says you have  to do quite a bit.   So it was 8 to 0. It was not six out of eight or seven out of eight,  but eight out of eight. Every Justice, no matter where they were in the  ideological spectrum, said: That is an absurd finding and overthrew the  Neil Gorsuch decision.   (Mr. BARRASSO assumed the Chair.)   So we have these three substantial, major issues to consider, and  that is why this conversation should be set aside until we resolve the  Russia investigation.   I will read ``The Guardian view of Trump's Russia links.'' It says:         Why days before the presidential election did the FBI       announce it was reopening an investigation into Hillary       Clinton--when it was silent about its probe into Mr. Trump's       Russia ties?        When the president's own staff turn up in Washington to       publicly rebut his accusations that he had been wiretapped by       his predecessor, it's not good news for the White House. Yet       the longer the director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, James Comey, and Mike Rogers of the National       Security Agency appeared in front of a committee of Congress,       the worse it got. Since last July, Mr. Comey said, the       president's campaign has been investigated for colluding with       Russia to influence the 2016 election. Donald Trump's       election machine is coating his White House with sewage.        Yet Donald Trump, with the insouciance of a Bourbon       monarch, shows no sign of taking any notice of the facts.       Nor, it seems, will he retract false claims, nor will he be       held accountable for his dissembling. Mr. Trump is prepared       to carry on in disgrace. He spent the minutes after his own       intelligence officers called him out for peddling falsehoods       by trying to create a bizarre counter narrative with the       @POTUS twitter account that stretched his credibility so far       it snapped.    Well, this article continues to go into how just an amazingly absurd  situation this is at this moment.   I was really struck that what seemed to have transpired just a few  days ago was that the White House, some key advisers in the White  House, some very top advisers, called up the chair of the House  Intelligence Committee and said: Hey, come over here to the White  House. We want to brief you on some information that shows that maybe  there was some intelligence picked up on Trump in the course of other  intelligence activities.   So the chair goes over to the White House, gets briefed, comes back  to the House, holds a press conference, and says that he has this  information from a whistleblower, and he has to go back over to the  White House to brief the President.   The whole thing was phony. The information came from the White House.  The whole thing was set up to look as though there was some magnificent  new information that somehow confirmed some theme or line the President  was advocating. I mean, this was Keystone Cops. That is the place we  have come to in this administration. So those are certainly the  concerns that I have.   I think it is important to continue focusing on the Gorsuch  nomination. Let us recognize the setting in which this is happening.   Certainly we have a nominee who seems to want a 19th century judicial  philosophy for the 21st century. The preamble to our Constitution  states: ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more  perfect Union, establish Justice.'' That is a vision that reminds us  that we are a nation of laws, where individuals like the frozen trucker  can go to the authorities and get a fair, square deal, a deal that  reflects the fact he was unfairly fired, but he didn't get that from  Neil Gorsuch. The type of system where an autistic child who, under the  law, is supposed to be receiving an appropriate education receives that  education, but he didn't get that fair square justice from Neil  Gorsuch.   We are a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of justice, and it  sets us apart from so many other countries--that concept that average  citizens, ordinary people have a way to pursue justice.   During his confirmation hearing last month, Judge Gorsuch put on a  great show, kind of a friendly, everyday-man show, but when it came to  making decisions, the ordinary person lost out on these decisions time  after time after time.   We have a far right, extremist judge outside of the mainstream who,  in case after case, has twisted the laws to deny average Americans the  justice they deserve. He is so far out of the mainstream that he would  be the most conservative Justice on the Supreme Court--further to the  right than Justice Antonin Scalia or Justice Clarence Thomas, according  to an independent analysis by the Washington Post. The Post came to  this conclusion by examining the Tenth Circuit's opinions that have  been delivered since Gorsuch joined the Court in 2006. The Post  concludes:         The magnitude of the gap between Gorsuch and Thomas is       roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and       Justice Kennedy during the same time period. In fact, our       results suggest that Gorsuch and Justice Scalia would be as       far apart as Justices Breyer and Chief Justice Roberts.    We can see this extremism by examining some of Judge Gorsuch's  significant cases.   Earlier, my colleague from Illinois came in and spoke about the  frozen trucker case. Alphonse Maddin was a truckdriver who was  transporting cargo through Illinois when the brakes on his trailer  froze because of subzero temperatures, and he did the responsible  thing. He got off the road. He pulled over. He refused to drive under  hazardous conditions, and he called for help.   After reporting the problem to the company, he waited 3 hours in  freezing temperatures for a repair truck to arrive. He couldn't even  wait in the cab of his truck to keep warm because the auxiliary power  unit was not working. After those 3 hours, his torso went numb, and he  began having difficulty breathing. He couldn't feel his feet. So he  unhitched the truck--that is the trailer, the loaded trailer, and left  it there. He drove the cab, seeking to find a place he could get warm,  and then he returned to the truck when the repairman was arriving.    The law is specifically written to say that you can't fire a  truckdriver for refusing to operate a truck in a fashion that will  cause dangers to others. And that is what he did; he refused to keep  driving with those frozen brakes in order to avoid causing danger to  others.  [[Page S2290]]    Neil Gorsuch looked for a way to twist that, to say: Well, he didn't  refuse to operate the truck. He drove the cab, and that is kind of like  operating the truck.   Well, I would tell Neil: It is not. Operating a cab unhitched from a  trailer is not the same as operating a truck with the trailer. The  purpose of the driver is to deliver the goods.   So, quite frankly, he did exactly what he should have done for his  personal safety and the safety of others. He was fired for it, which is  what the law is written to stop. Everyone else got this, but not Neil  Gorsuch.   Neil Gorsuch looked for a strategy that he could possibly find to  favor a company over an individual, and that is really of great  concern.   In his dissent--Neil Gorsuch was not in the majority. He wasn't  making the decision. He wasn't writing the majority opinion. He had a  dissent.   He strained the reading of the statute. He went out of his way to  minimize the words ``health and safety'' in the law. He stated that  finding for the driver was improperly using the law ``as a sort of  springboard to combat all perceived evils lurking in the neighborhood''  and that the objective to promote health and safety was ``ephemeral and  generic.''   Well, clearly the finding that a trucker who was fired because he  refused to operate the truck--the cab and the trailer--in unsafe  conditions because the brakes were frozen, when the law says you can't  fire a trucker for refusing to operate a truck in unsafe conditions-- that is about not providing a very specific danger to the community.   How do you get from that to say that finding for the driver was a  framework ``to combat all perceived evils lurking in the  neighborhood''? As if somehow deciding the case on the pure merits and  the pure law, finding a case on behalf of an individual was somehow  opening a Pandora's box of bad decisions that would affect other  situations where maybe corporations that made a mistake would have to  pay a fine. That would be unacceptable.   I don't know what he meant by ``a sort of springboard to combat all  perceived evils,'' but I know it is totally disconnected from the pure  facts of the frozen trucker case and the law that guided it, and that  is why the court found in the trucker's favor.   In short, in reaching his conclusion, Judge Gorsuch took an extremely  narrow view of the statute, remarking that it only forbids them from  firing employees who refuse to operate a vehicle out of safety. That is  exactly, of course, why he did it.   I think that all along that case, you saw common sense, a clear view  of the facts, and a clear view of the law on everyone's behalf, except  for one individual, and that individual was Neil Gorsuch, who is before  us.   Let's turn to the case of the autistic child. Luke P, a young child  with autism, began receiving special education services at his public  school in kindergarten in 2000. He had an education plan specific to  his needs, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act, the IDEA.   The problem was that he wasn't making progress in generalizing  skills, applying skills he learned at school to other environments.  Despite his appropriate social interactions at school, he often had  severe behavioral problems at home and public places, including  violence. The public school's inability to meaningfully improve Luke's  ability to generalize basic life skills put enormous stress on the  family and exposed the limitations of what the school was able to  provide.   His parents found a program designed for children with this form of  autism, a place that specialized in that, a place that knew how to  approach it. They worked at getting him admitted, and they succeeded.  It was a great opportunity for Luke to not only learn important life  skills but to be able to apply them outside the classroom. Luke got in,  and he began to flourish, getting the attention and specialized  instruction that his condition merited.   So Luke's parents, knowing that the IDEA requires that children with  disabilities are entitled to a free education, applied to the school  district for reimbursement of the new school's tuition, but the school  district said they wouldn't fund that because they could meet the goals  of Luke's updated education plan. But the problem was, they couldn't.  That experience had already occurred, and the district had fallen  short.   At the due process hearing, the State level hearing, Luke's parents  prevailed. They laid out their case. The hearing compared the situation  to the law and the requirements in the law, and Luke's parents won.   It went up to the Federal district court. Again, looking at the case,  looking at the law, the parents prevailed. At each level, a hearing  officer judge determined that Luke wasn't getting the help he needed at  the public school. They concluded that, by failing to help him  generalize his skills, they failed to provide him with the free  appropriate education he was entitled to under the law.   Each looked at the facts and said: Only the specialized residential  school could provide the education he needed, and the school district  must reimburse the family.   Well, the school district appealed all the way up to the Tenth  Circuit--Judge Gorsuch's Tenth Circuit. And what happened on the Tenth  Circuit? Well, writing the opinion for the majority, Judge Gorsuch  stated that ``the educational benefit mandated by IDEA must merely be  more than de minimis.'' A way to translate that, ``merely more than de  minimis'' means a tiny bit more than nothing. That is the standard.  That is the Gorsuch standard. In effect, Judge Gorsuch argued that you  meet the law designed to insist that disabled children get an  appropriate education with a little bit more than nothing.   Well, this was then appealed up to the Supreme Court, and what  happened here just days ago? On March 22, Judge Gorsuch's ruling was  overturned by the eight members of the Supreme Court. It wasn't a 5-to- 3 or 6-to-2 or 7-to-1 decision; it was 8 to 0.   They felt that the standard Gorsuch put forward was totally  incompatible with the way the law was written. That is a very telling  situation to have eight Justices, through a large spectrum, see that  the world is quite different from the world of Neil Gorsuch, where the  law gets twisted to find for the powerful over the individual.   Judge Gorsuch's ruling was overturned through a unanimous vote in the  case of Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District during the final  days of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearings, March 22. In that case,  another autistic child, who also has attention deficit disorder, had  been removed from public school since the fifth grade. Like Luke, he  went on to make great progress in a private school. His parents said  the education plan that the public school created was not helping, and  they sued the school district to compel them to pay for the private  tuition. It was basically a mirror example of Luke's case.   In speaking for the Court, Chief Justice John Roberts said that Judge  Gorsuch's de minimis standard was too low and that the Federal law  demands more, that it requires an educational program that is  reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in  light of the child's circumstances.   Chief Justice John Roberts went on to say in his majority opinion  that it cannot be right that the IDEA generally contemplates grade  level advancement for children with disabilities who are fully  integrated into the regular classroom but is satisfied with merely more  than de minimis progress.   No. The IDEA contemplates grade level advancement, and it cannot be  squared with the standard that Neil Gorsuch put forward in his saying  ``merely more than de minimis.''   Speaking in front of the Court, the Solicitor General specifically  noted that Judge Gorsuch's interpretation of the IDEA's requirement is  not consistent with IDEA's text or structure with this Court's analysis  or with Congress's stated purposes. Basically, that is the outline of  the autistic child's case.   Let's turn to the Utah en banc request, the Planned Parenthood  Association of Utah v. Herbert.   In August of 2015, Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican Governor, ordered  the State to strip $272,000 in Federal funding from the Planned  Parenthood Association of Utah in response to a series of hidden camera  videos that were released by the Center for Medical Progress. They were  attacking Planned  [[Page S2291]]  Parenthood's program for providing fetal research tissue to research  institutions. These videos were found to have been doctored and the  footage was inaccurate. The entire premise was debunked.   Despite the fact that the videos had no merit, Governor Herbert stood  by his order to cut Planned Parenthood's funding. Utah's Planned  Parenthood Association decided to fight back by filing for and  temporarily receiving a restraining order against the State.   In spite of his continued claim--that is, the Governor's claim--that  stripping funding was not to punish the organization for its stance on  abortion but was in response to the videos, Governor Herbert eventually  admitted, while responding to Planned Parenthood's motion for a  preliminary injunction, that the events in the videos involved other  Planned Parenthood affiliates in other States, not Planned Parenthood  in Utah. There was not even an accusation that Planned Parenthood in  Utah had strayed beyond the law.   The organization in Utah does not participate in that research  program that was attacked in that video. There was no connection--not  geographically to Utah and not through the substance issue of a tissue  research program. None of the Federal funds that go through the State's  health department to Planned Parenthood fund abortions, which is an  important point.   Let me reemphasize that the accusations made by the videos about  Planned Parenthood and its affiliates were false.   What the Governor's response has made clear is that he was, in fact,  punishing Planned Parenthood of Utah for its constitutionally protected  advocacy and its services that include abortion. That is a very, very  small part of what it does.   A three-judge panel on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a  preliminary injunction to Planned Parenthood, concluding that Utah's  Planned Parenthood was operating lawfully and that the Governor's  personal opposition to abortion could likely be demonstrated as a  motivation for blocking Federal funds. Therefore, the Governor was  targeting a health organization, in violation of its constitutional  rights.   We have these basic concepts, like equality under the law. You cannot  just choose and pick, basically, whom you like and dislike.   Here is what happened. In spite of that Tenth Circuit's finding of  those three judges, who all found on the side of Planned Parenthood,  Judge Gorsuch dissented from the court's denial and requested that it  be considered en banc--that is, by the entire Tenth Circuit set of  judges. This is very unusual because the Governor who lost the case was  not asking for it to be reconsidered, and Planned Parenthood was not  asking for it to be reconsidered. It was a done deal. The arguments  that the Governor had brought basically fell apart upon examination-- each and every argument. Planned Parenthood of Utah was not in the  videos. The videos themselves were edited to create a false story. They  did not even participate in the same research program and so forth--I  mean, every piece of it. Yet Judge Gorsuch said: No, we should have the  entire group of judges reconsider this--a judge pushing this forward  when the defendant did not even push it forward. He was willing to  ignore court practice and custom, to mischaracterize facts in law to  ensure that Utah's Republican Governor could eliminate funding for  Planned Parenthood.    He made a reference to kind of the deference to elected opinion.  That, in itself, is very strange. Isn't your job to find out whether  the circumstances fit the law and, if someone has been shortchanged, to  rule for him and not to defer to someone because he has the title of  ``Governor'' before his name?   In the majority's opinion, Judge Mary Briscoe wrote separately to  highlight the troubling nature of Judge Gorsuch's dissent. She noted  first how unusual and extraordinary it would be for the Tenth Circuit  to have one of its own make a motion for an en banc review when neither  party to the litigation sought such a review. Second, Judge Briscoe  emphasized that Judge Gorsuch repeatedly mischaracterized this  litigation and the panel at several turns.   Another judge in the majority pointed out that none of the parties  asked for a rehearing within the time permitted and that there was no  justification for polling the court on that question at all.  Apparently, an unidentified judge had requested that the judges be  polled.   So we have here--as we have in the case of the autistic child, as we  have in the case of the frozen trucker--another case of twisting the  law to try to come out with an outcome that is not merited by the facts  of the case or the plain language of the law. That really is a  significant concern.   Judge Gorsuch has been a lifelong ideological warrior. The quote from  Henry Kissinger that he used in both his high school and Columbia  yearbooks might have been intended as joke, but it warrants some  consideration in light of his record:         The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a       little longer.    In light of these cases, where in case after case he stretched the  law, tortured the law, twisted the law to find for the powerful--the  Constitution has a vision of equality before the law. Our Constitution  has this vision of justice for all so that when a judge does not pursue  equality before the law, does not pursue justice for all, then that  really is kind of a venture into the unconstitutional. That is exactly  what happened in the case of the autistic child, where the Court said:  Your decision was unconstitutional. Your decision to say that a little  bit more than nothing meets the standard of the IDEA is wrong. That is  unconstitutional. That is wrong for the law.   Indeed, it almost makes the hair on your neck stand to realize that  he was writing that the unconstitutional takes a little longer.   His world view really began to take shape at Columbia when he  cofounded the Federalist, which was the school newspaper, and a  magazine called the Morningside Review. In writing for the  publications, Judge Gorsuch defended social inequality, saying it  allows men of different abilities and talents to distinguish  themselves, as they wish, without devaluing their innate human worth as  members of society and arguing that a responsible system requires a  governing class that is comprised of men of exceptional political  ability and spirit of concern who craft laws and run the government.   When I read this, it made me think of Plato's ``Republic.'' In  Plato's ``Republic,'' he lays out a vision of the guardians, kind of  this superior group of men who find just the right solutions. It sure  sounds like that--a responsible system that requires a governing class  that is comprised of men of exceptional political ability, spirit, and  concern, who craft the laws and run the government--in other words, a  government by the elite. Through his decisions, we see that it is not  just by the elite and by the powerful, it is for the elite and for the  powerful. That is a long way from equality under the law, and that is a  long ways from justice for all. And he characterized efforts to fight  racism as ``more demand for the overthrow of American society than the  forum for the peaceable and rational discussion of these people and  events.''    We have a substantial amount of racism still embedded in our Nation,  and we see it come out in unexpected ways. The first I was really aware  of the racism that we have in our society was when I was a 19-year-old  and I was an intern for Senator Hatfield here. I was assigned to open  all of the letters each morning because I was the last of the three  summer interns to arrive, and that job went to the last person. I  started opening these letters, and the job was to sort them, to get  them into different piles according to topic for the different  corresponding legislative correspondents who would then write replies.  But as I read the letters, I would read one letter and there would be  an attack on Seventh Day Adventists. In another there would be an  attack on African Americans. In another, there was an attack on  immigrants, and so on and so forth. There were attacks on Mormons.  There were attacks on every possible group.   It made me think about how Oregon was at one time a territory that  excluded African Americans, and at a later date it came to have the  largest Ku Klux Klan in the Nation--Oregon. You wouldn't imagine that.  I saw no signs of this racism growing up in the suburbs of Portland or  down in  [[Page S2292]]  Roseburg, but these letters that people were writing were full of  racism.   We can't simply pretend that it doesn't exist. Over the course of  this last year, we have seen this time and again. We have seen groups  that kind of are still deeply wedded to racism and discrimination, and  they have kind of come out and made themselves more publicly available.  They have kind of shared their thoughts more readily, and they have  engaged in more racist acts against others.   So we have more people who have been attacked in parking lots because  of their race, or we have more situations where graffiti has been  scrolled on the side of buildings. We have mosques that have been  burned. We have synagogues that have been defiled. We have individuals  who look to be Middle Eastern being attacked because they are looking  like they are Middle Eastern.   So, clearly, as to racism, we are not discussing this challenge in  America, pondering how we come to a full respect for each and every  individual in our country. That cannot be characterized as a demand for  the overthrow of American society, unless your concept of American  society is one that is a White supremacist viewpoint, and then respect  for everyone else perhaps is an overthrow of society.   Now, I am not saying that Neil Gorsuch was coming from that  particular viewpoint, but he certainly shows in his quote that he has  great difficulty considering a conversation about racism to be a  legitimate and important conversation for making America a better  place, embracing the strengths of all of our citizens who come from  diverse backgrounds. It can't be that this is ``more demand for the  overthrow of American society than a forum for rational discussion of  these people and events.'' It is a discussion that we need to have.   Judge Gorsuch is absolutely coming into the Court with a view of  expansive rights for corporations.   For a long time in our Nation's history, our biggest businesses and  corporations certainly ruled the roost, and we had the barons who came  from Big Oil and Big Railroad and Big Copper, and their wealth and  their station in life ensured that they really had a lot of power over  the people around them. Over time, we gave and developed standards so  that people couldn't be exploited to the extent that they were  exploited under these barons. We had developed labor and safety  standards, and we had developed minimum wages and 40-hour workweeks and  overtime--really quite an amazing transformation of the workplace. We  made great strides in the course of the 20th century. We recognized  that American workers are entitled to be treated with respect in a safe  working environment.   But there are other cases other than the frozen trucker case where  Judge Gorsuch has put the interest of the company or the corporation  above the safety of the American worker. One of those is the case of  the electrocuted construction worker, the mining construction worker.   Encompass Environmental. The Occupational Safety and Health Review  Commission fined employer Encompass Environmental because the company  failed to properly train Chris Carter, a worker who was electrocuted.  He did not recover. He died.   Chris joined the construction project a week after it had begun.  Because he was not trained in that specific work, he brought a piece of  equipment in contact with an overhead line. This was specifically  something the company had trained others to avoid, but he wasn't  trained in it, and the result is he died.   The Tenth Circuit on which Neil Gorsuch serves upheld the fine  against the company for the failure to train, saying that it was  ``undisputed that Encompass did not give this employee any instruction  on the fatal danger posed by the high voltage lines located in the  vicinity of the work area.''    The company's own job hazard announcements found a fatal danger from  the high-voltage power lines involved and recommended training for  employees that would instruct them to keep at least 20 feet away from  those power lines. A lot of the employees got that training, but Chris  Carter didn't, and he died.   While all of the Tenth Circuit upheld the fine against the company,  Judge Gorsuch dissented. He said that, as to the Occupational Safety  and Health Review Commission, which fined the employer, that fine was  yet another example of an administrative agency wielding remarkable  powers and penalizing a company where no evidence existed. If it had  been up to Neil Gorsuch, Encompass Environmental would not have had to  pay this fine. It would never have been accountable for the negligence  that ended in this tragic, unnecessary death.   It is striking to me that despite the fact that the company itself  knew about this hazard, and the company itself trained other employees  to avoid the hazard but failed to provide the training in this case,  Neil Gorsuch really somehow believes that there was no error made by  the company; that, somehow, it is unfair if you are penalizing the  company.   The ultimate example of Gorsuch's efforts to expand the rights of  corporations came in the Hobby Lobby case, which held that corporations  are persons exercising religion under the purposes of the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act. Therefore, according to the ruling, closely  held, for-profit secular corporations could deny their female employees  the legal right to contraceptive coverage as part of their employer- sponsored health insurance plans.   The Tenth Circuit upheld this position, but that wasn't enough. In a  separate opinion he couched this expansion of corporate rights in a  blanket of religious freedom writing:         All of us face the problem of complicity. All of us must       answer for ourselves whether and to what degree we are       willing to be involved in the wrongdoing of others. For some,       religion provides an essential source of guidance both about       what constitutes wrongful conduct and the degree to which       those who assist others to commit wrongful conduct themselves       bear moral culpability.    What that case really amounted to was saying that religious  preferences of the employer--a corporation--trumped the religious  choices of the employees--the individuals. That is the scary thing  about Hobby Lobby--giving corporations expansive control while you  diminish the realm of private rights.   The Hobby Lobby decision has already been invoked--not only  supporting curtailing employees' access to reproductive healthcare but  also to justify noncompliance with child labor laws, anti-kidnapping  laws, and anti-discrimination laws.   As a lawyer, Neil Gorsuch wrote a brief in Dura Pharmaceuticals v.  Broudo, urging the Court to ignore the statutory legislative history of  the Securities and Exchange Act and advocating that the Court limit the  availability of those who confronted the corporation to band together  to seek redress.   In a 2005 article, Gorsuch launched into an attack on plaintiffs'  lawyers for such cases. The lawyers were just looking for a free ride  to vast riches, he concluded. They involved frivolous claims, taking an  enormous toll on the economy and on virtually every corporation in  America at one time or another, costing businesses billions of dollars  in settlements.   So Neil Gorsuch has taken positions making it more difficult for  class action lawsuits to proceed.   Well, what is a class action lawsuit and why is it so important in  our system to have class action lawsuits? Imagine that you are in a  situation where, for example, maybe a telecommunications company gets  involved in slamming charges onto your bill that you never asked for,  and maybe that costs you $10 a month for some service put on your long- distance bill or on your cable bill or on your worldwide net band bill,  and you proceed to notice this, but they put this on without you  authorizing it. Yet it is $10. You can't possibly afford to go to court  to take on this predatory conduct of charging you for something you  never ordered, but when you realize there are often tens of thousands  of other people who have also been the victims of this illegal  predatory action, then a class action lawsuit gives you the ability to  band with those other folks to take on that predatory conduct by the  corporation, and that helps to dissuade a corporation from being  involved in predatory conduct to begin with.   This can be involved in all sorts of things. It could be  misrepresenting a product that is being sold, a physical  [[Page S2293]]  product, or not warning about its having a danger that any rational  person should have warned you about, or misrepresenting stocks in some  type of a scheme where thousands of people are sold something, but what  they buy is not what they were promised, and so forth.   So class action is a powerful tool for justice, but you see in case  after case after case, complete disdain by Neil Gorsuch for class  action lawsuits. He sees them as a burden on the corporate enterprise  of America.   Well, I believe that it is important to stop illegal predatory  conduct, and in cases where you can't possibly afford to go as an  individual, class action is an important strategy.   In one case, Shook v. The Board of County Commissioners, he prevented  a group of inmates with mental illnesses who were not receiving proper  care from joining together to request that the jail meet its  constitutional obligation to provide medical care. Shook may not have  involved a corporation, but the same legal reasoning Judge Gorsuch  applied in that case can be used to limit class action lawsuits brought  against companies and against corporations. There were a number of  other cases in that category, and there are cases that essentially  highlight issues of discrimination and sexual harassment and Judge  Gorsuch's views on that.   In Pinkerton v. Colorado Department of Transportation, Judge Gorsuch  joined an opinion discounting Pinkerton's evidence of discrimination  and concluding that her performance, not discrimination, resulted in  her termination.   Betty Pinkerton was an administrative assistant. She alleged that her  supervisor had made inappropriate, sexually explicit remarks to her  over a period of several months and that she was fired when she  reported the harassment. Pinkerton specifically alleged that her  supervisor asked her whether she had sexual urges and asked about the  size of things that a boss should not ask about, and he actually  commented on a whole series of things which I don't think I will read  into the Record but which were totally inappropriate in a workplace  setting.   After her supervisor asked to go to her house for lunch, Pinkerton  called the internal civil rights administrator and complained and then  made a formal written complaint 7 days later. An investigation that  followed led to the supervisor's removal, but shortly after the  supervisor was fired, Pinkerton was also fired. She sued, claiming that  the department of transportation was liable for the hostile work  environment imposed by the supervisor and that she had been fired  because she had raised this issue and this conduct.   There was a divided panel that affirmed a summary judgment in favor  of the Colorado Department of Transportation, which held that Pinkerton  had waited too long--2 months--to report the harassment, and Judge  Gorsuch found with the majority.   Judge Paul Kelly's majority opinion concluded it was Pinkerton's  performance, not discrimination, that resulted in her termination, but  the dissenting opinion said that it should be a jury who decides at  what point Pinkerton's failure to report the harassment becomes  unreasonable, that the termination just days after the investigation  was completed raised a genuine issue of fact about her claim of  retaliatory discharge, especially considering that the State department  of transportation testified that the most serious error leading to  Pinkerton's firing was an allegedly mishandled call from an employee's  daughter that happened 4 years earlier, and the director tried to get  Pinkerton another job with the State department of transportation only  months before she was fired. But Judge Gorsuch joined the majority and  did not give Betty Pinkerton the chance to confront her employers in a  court of law in front of a jury. In other words, she wanted her day in  court to make the case.   The minority in that case said: Yes, she should get her opportunity  to make her case. There is enough evidence, and it should be presented.  She can make her case and the department can make their case--not to  preempt the opportunity for her to have her day in court. But that is  where Judge Gorsuch ended up.   Then there is Strickland v. United Parcel Service, UPS. In this case,  Judge Gorsuch concurred in part, while also dissenting in part from an  opinion holding that Strickland provided ample evidence that she was  regularly outperforming her male colleagues, and yet she was treated  less favorably than they were.   Carole Strickland was a female driver for UPS who alleged sex  discrimination and quit under pressure. Two judges on the Tenth Circuit  panel overturned a lower court decision granting UPS judgment as a  matter of law. In doing so, they emphasized that Strickland provided  ample evidence that she was regularly outperforming her male  colleagues, and yet she was treated less favorably, including direct  testimony of several of her coworkers that she was treated poorly or  worse than others.   Strickland's coworkers testified that supervisors treated her  differently from her male colleagues. She met 93 percent to 104 percent  of her sales quotas, was outperforming some of her coworkers on every  measure, and yet she was singled out to attend individual meetings--the  only one who had to make written sales commitments even though no one  was at the 100-percent quota level.   One of the men in her office had lower performance than Strickland in  almost every sales measure but was not required to attend these  meetings to discuss work performance and was not counseled on failing  to reach 100 percent.   Judge Gorsuch, unlike his two colleagues, dissented from the  decision. He would have decided the case could not have gone to a jury,  arguing that a reasonable juror could have found that Strickland was a  victim of sex discrimination. He himself decided the essence of the  case rather than giving her an opportunity to have her day in court, in  spite of the substantial evidence she brought forward. He would have  denied an employee the opportunity to hold a corporation accountable  for their mistreatment.   We see the theme in these cases, one after the other. When fellow  judges found that a person had a reasonable right to make their case,  he dissented and worked to block a chance for an individual to have  their case heard.   There is a list of cases we have been going through, but I want to go  back and recap why we are here in the Senate hearing this nomination  and deciding whether to confirm this individual, Neil Gorsuch. This  story is one that really begins with the death of Antonin Scalia.   Antonin Scalia died in February of last year. Within hours, the  majority leader had decided to pursue a strategy of asking the Senate-- really, demanding the Senate--ensuring that the Senate not fulfill its  constitutional advice and consent responsibility. If only at that  moment my colleague the majority leader had thought: This is a big  deal. Asking the Senate to not exercise its advice and consent  responsibility--that is a big deal. Maybe I should wait a day and think  about this.   But no, there was a rush to the floor to lay this out, and that  became the path this body has been on ever since.   A month later, in March, the President did his job under the  Constitution: He nominated Merrick Garland, and it was forwarded over  here to the Senate. The normal thing would be for the Senate to start  hearings, but the Republican majority leadership said: No. No hearings  in the Judiciary Committee.   Why not? It is our responsibility to provide advise and consent on  nominations, and there is no nomination more important than the  nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It  isn't someone who just serves for a couple of years in the  administration or maybe for a full 4 years of the administration; it is  somebody who serves for life. And it is not someone like a district  judge or a circuit judge who can write an opinion but then have it  overturned at a higher level; the Supreme Court is the higher level. It  is the highest level. The buck stops with the Supreme Court.   Given the lifetime appointment and enormous power to set precedent  for what the meaning of our Constitution is makes the Supreme Court  nomination fantastically important. So it is shocking that we failed to  do our job as a Senate--to hold hearings, to hold a vote, and to send  the issue to the floor and hold a debate on Merrick Garland.   Some Members said: This is in keeping with tradition for an election  year.  [[Page S2294]]    Well, no, it is not in keeping with tradition. We have had 16  nominations during an election year. A few of them came after the  election. Yet there was still a nomination, and the Senate still acted.  On others, the vacancy occurred before the election, and the President  chose not to fill or not to produce a nominee until after an election,  and still the Senate said there is time to act. In nine other cases,  the vacancy came before the election, the nomination came before the  election, and in eight of those nine, the Senate acted. In 15 cases out  of 15 cases before Antonin Scalia died, the Senate acted--confirming  most, rejecting a few, but they acted. They exercised advice and  consent. Then last year the Senate failed for the first time--the first  time in U.S. history--to act.   We can think of this as a kind of lengthy, lengthy filibuster of a  Supreme Court nominee. Some of my colleagues have said: It doesn't seem  right that a minority--41 Senators--can stop us from getting to a final  vote. But it is right. It is a tradition that a 60-vote standard to  approve a nominee to the Supreme Court is essential to make sure that a  nominee has bipartisan support, that they are from the judicial  mainstream, that they have judicial temperament, and that they fit this  very important role, this task which they are going to be assigned to  do and which they might do for many, many decades to come. That is why  we have a 60-vote standard.   What happened last year was a complete refusal to act and 290-plus  days of failure to act--plenty of time to act to fulfill our  responsibility. It would be different and we would be having a  different discussion today if the Senate had considered the nominee and  rejected the nominee.   So why didn't the majority leader simply say: We don't like this  nominee, so we are going to probably have a debate and we are probably  going to vote the nominee down. The reason why is everyone loved  Merrick Garland. He was right down the middle. He had great quotes of  support from both sides of the aisle. He didn't have a history like the  history I am describing with Neil Gorsuch, which raised eyebrows time  and time again, or where he was kind of legislating from the bench. He  didn't do that the way Neil Gorsuch has done.   So that is the big issue, that we have a strategy of stealing a  Supreme Court seat in order to pack the Court. It has never been done  before, and we are in the middle of it now. And if this week goes as  the majority leader said he was going to make sure that it went, then  the theft is going to be completed by Friday.    So I have been here through the night talking about this, to say how  important this is that we not do this--that to proceed to fill this  stolen seat will damage the Court for decades to come and will damage  the Senate for decades to come. If you can steal one seat and get away  with it, the temptation next time is to steal another seat--either to  double down on the strategy or rebalance the first crime against the  Constitution. And each and every time, it will deepen the divisions,  and it will diminish the legitimacy of the Court. In the 5-to-4  decisions that we see in the future from the Supreme Court, we are  looking to say every single time that it is Justice Merrick Garland's  stolen seat--President Obama's stolen seat. Every time that person is  in the positive side--the winning side of a 5-to-4 decision--the Court  would decide it differently if the seat weren't stolen, if the Court  weren't packed. That decision doesn't really have legitimacy because it  was the result of court-packing. That is not the way we want to be  viewing the Supreme Court.   We want to have a Court of wise, thoughtful individuals with great  depth and knowledge of the law, combined with a terrific diversity of  life experience. They can put themselves into the position and identify  with the challenges faced in an authentic manner. That is important.  That strengthens the Court. But it weakens the Court to have a Court  packed as a crass, political tactic and to do it through a stolen seat.   So that is why it matters--that it hurts the integrity of this body  and it hurts the integrity of the Court. It involves the participation  of the President because the President provided a nomination, and that  hurts the integrity of the executive branch. In other words, it is a  lose-lose-lose proposition. There is still time to take this train off  the tracks and not result in this very unfortunate potential outcome.   The second reason we are at this point is that this nomination is  just being rushed through as quickly as possible--brought to the floor  immediately after the committee vote. Then, for the first time in U.S.  history, not only was it brought to the floor the day after the  committee vote, but it was brought to the floor and then immediately a  petition was filed to close debate. For the first time in U.S. history,  on the first day of debate on a Supreme Court nominee, that a petition  was filed to close debate. That petition, under our rules, forces a  vote on whether to close debate on Thursday, long before the Senate has  had a full chance for everyone to make all of their points and  thoughts.   Mr. President, a point of Parliamentary inquiry----    What is the agreed-upon schedule to resume the normal  activities of the floor?    I appreciate that clarification. I am going to make this  comment now, in case I might forget later. I want to give special  thanks to the team of individuals who make this body work in order to  provide for the opportunity for extended debate, sometimes here under  extraordinary circumstances. Because I have been here through the night  speaking, one of those extraordinary circumstances was this night that  has just passed. The stenographers, the Parliamentarians, the pages,  our doorkeepers, our caucus staff, the bill clerks, and others who  staff the desks in the offices in the Democratic and Republican  cloakrooms--I am excited to see the set of smiles on the pages' faces.  I don't know if the same pages were here all night or not. Well, they  will hopefully really get a lot out of this opportunity to serve here.  But thank you to all the staff members who have labored during the wee  hours of the night and into this morning.   I was summing up the issues that we labor under and noting a  significant one is the stolen Supreme Court seat and the damage that  completing that theft will do to our institutions. I have been going  through a number of cases that are related to the far-right, anti-we- the-people vision of Neil Gorsuch, from the frozen trucker case, to the  autistic child case, to the worker suffering sexual discrimination or  gender discrimination at work--all of these cases that have come  forward.   We have the third issue, of course, being that cloud that is hanging  over the Presidency because of the investigations underway at this  moment into the role the Trump campaign may have played in  communicating with or collaborating with the Russians in their  extensive strategy to interfere with our Presidential election. So  there are a lot of concerns.   This should be the last case where we are cutting short the debate by  filing a petition to close debate on the opening day, but there it is-- another first, another degradation of the institution.   Dahlia Lithwick wrote in November:         We are already hearing from Republicans and Democrats in       leadership positions that it is incumbent upon Americans to       normalize and legitimize the new Trump presidency. We are       told to give him a chance, to reach across the aisle, and       that we must all work hard, in President Obama's formulation,       to make sure that Trump succeeds. But before you decide to       take Obama's advice, I would implore you to stand firm and       even angry on this one point at least: The current Supreme       Court vacancy is not Trump's to fill. This was President       Obama's vacancy and President Obama's nomination. Please       don't tacitly give up on it because it was stolen by       unprecedented obstruction and contempt. Instead, do to them       what they have done to us. Sometimes, when they go low, we       need to go lower, to protect the thing of great value.    I don't love the way that is phrased, that is for sure. Because in my  mind, the point here is to guard our institutions and make them work  better. That is the high road. That is not going lower; that is going  higher. We must strengthen and defend these institutions that are being  torn asunder by this strategy of stealing a Senate seat.   That is an article from the Slate.  [[Page S2295]]    The Miami Herald says: ``Supreme Court Nominations Will Never Be the  Same.''         The story of the Supreme Court in 2016 can be summarized in       a statistic: It's been 311 days since Justice Antonin Scalia       died on February 13, and his seat remains unfilled. That is       not the longest Supreme Court vacancy in the modern era, but       it's about to enter second place--and it will become the       longest if Donald Trump's nominee isn't confirmed about the       end of March.        This striking fact will be front and center when the       history of the court in 2016 is written, but what really       matters isn't the length of the vacancy. It's the election in       the middle of it. The Republican Senate changed the rules of       confirmation drastically by refusing even to consider Judge       Merrick Garland's nomination. And against the odds, it paid       off for them.    It is interesting because we talk about the nuclear option of  changing the rules, but in a very de facto matter, the nuclear option  went off the day the majority leader came to the floor and said that we  are going to conduct ourselves in a totally different way than the  Senate's ever conducted itself. Unlike every other time in U.S.  history, when there was a vacancy during election year and the Senate  acted, we are not going to act. We are going to essentially engage in  stonewalling the President's nominee--no hearing, no discussion. That  was a nuclear option. So, certainly, I think that is a point well made  by this article.         The history of the confirmation process is central to the       history of the court. There have been some important       landmarks in the last century. Louis Brandeis was the first       justice to have a confirmation hearing. Felix Frankfurter was       the first justice who had to testify at his confirmation.        More recently, the confirmation process for Robert Bork in       1987 had epochal consequences. For the first time, judicial       philosophy was a focus.    That was 1987.         No one disputed Bork's intelligence or qualifications.       Instead liberals, including law professors like my colleague       Laurence Tribe, criticized Bork's conservatism, as opposition       to fundamental rights.    Well, there is a whole host of commentary from all across America.  Let's turn to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ``The Senate's shame:  Merrick Garland deserved a hearing for Supreme Court.''         Judge Merrick Garland is returning to his work on the Court       of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, his nomination for the       Supreme Court killed without a vote by a Republican Senate       majority more concerned with partisan politics than with       doing its job.        The behavior of those who disposed of his nomination stands       in sharp contrast to his own record and reputation as a       nonideological judge.        Judge Garland is a moderate jurist with a reputation for       careful reasoning. Mere days before President Barack Obama       announced Merrick Garland's nomination, Senator Orrin Hatch,       a Republican from Utah, told a conservative news site that if       the President wanted to pick a moderate, he ``could easily       name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.''        But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had already       announced, in February, that his caucus would block any Obama       nominee. ``This vacancy,'' he said, ``should not be filled by       this lame-duck President.'' So the Senate refused even to       hold hearings.    Let's be clear. We have had 16 vacancies in the course of an election  year during our 200-plus years of history, and never before did a  majority refuse to exercise their advice and consent responsibility  under the Constitution, arguing that it is a lameduck President. That  is not embedded in the Constitution. It is not embedded in the Senate  rules. It is not embedded in history. It is not embedded in any logic.  When you elect a President, you elect him for 4 years.   Obama was elected, not by a small margin, not by an electoral victory  combined with a citizen majority loss. No, he won the citizen vote  massively, as well as winning the electoral college. He won it twice.  You can't look for a better endorsement for the role of a President and  an affirmation in the face of the determined effort to ensure he did  not get a second term.   So that lameduck argument is lame. The argument that the President  was a lameduck so, therefore, his Supreme Court nominee should not get  a hearing is disingenuous and irresponsible. Mr. Obama had a year left  in his term, and Presidents have their full constitutional authority  until noon on inauguration day. They must perform all of their duties  until then.   Granted, a President must nominate justices the Senate can reasonably  be asked to confirm. You can't ask a Senate dominated by the other  party to confirm someone whose judicial philosophy could appeal only to  someone who shares the President's politics. He must, when facing such  a Senate, choose someone in the middle. Mr. Obama did that. He did his  job. He picked the very judge Senator Hatch said would be a moderate  choice.   The Senate did not do its job. Its refusal to confirm Judge Garland  was not based on any flaw in the nominee's character, any deficit in  his abilities, or even any disagreement with his jurisprudence. It was  pure partisan politics. Senate Republicans wanted to let a Republican  President fill the vacancy, and they are going to get their way. But  this refusal of the Senate to do its duty cost a good man a fair  hearing, and, more importantly, it cost the Nation a potentially fine  justice, one more faithful to the law than one of the political parties  or particular judicial ideology.   As a result of this abdication of responsibility, it will be harder  to get Justices like that in the future. Indeed, the Senate has  established a terrible precedent that makes it less likely that any  President will be get a Senate controlled by the other party to confirm  his or her Supreme Court nominees, however wise and well-qualified.   This was a study of Washington politics at its worst--political and  constitutional malpractice--and it will have a lasting consequence.   Well, there is still time to change course and not have this legacy,  as characterized by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, of ``political and  constitutional malpractice with lasting consequences''. So one question  we have not talked about too much in this debate through the night is  how voters view this GOP maneuvering to push through Trump's  ultraconservative Supreme Court nominee. This is a national survey of  likely voters by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. It notes the  following:         In the wake of President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil       Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, a new national poll shows       that voters believe that the nomination has real consequences       for the direction of the country. Voters strongly oppose       efforts by the Republicans to change the rules in order to       push through Trump's ultraconservative nominee.    Americans see this as a fight that matters to them. When presented  with potential consequences and rulings that could result from  Gorsuch's confirmation, including overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving  the flow of special interest money in politics unchecked, large  majorities of voters say they are more likely to oppose the nominee.   Key findings from the poll conducted January 27 through 31 on behalf  of NARAL Pro Choice America Foundation, Every Voice, and End Citizens  United, include:         Voters overwhelmingly believe that Trump's nomination will       have a real impact on the country's future. Fully 72 percent       of voters think the nomination will have a big difference in       the direction of the country. Voters across the political       spectrum agree on the importance of this nomination, with 76       percent of Democrats saying it will make a big difference,       along with 75 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of       Independents.    So, in short, basically roughly three out of four Americans recognize  that it is a very big deal because out of this discussion could come a  confirmed nominee, a ninth vote on the Supreme Court, and that 5-to-4  votes of the Supreme Court steer the country in very different  directions, depending on how that 5-to-4 voting occurs.   If you are adding to the Supreme Court spectrum of conservatives who  have this view of Merrick Garland and antipathy toward the ability of  citizens to pursue justice through class action lawsuits, and an effort  to always kind of torture the law in order to find for corporations  over the individuals, and a love of arbitration agreements, and even  inventing them as we heard last night--inventing an arbitration  agreement where none exists--in order to prevent an issue from going  forward in the courts--all of that is a real handicap for Americans in  the future. So Americans understand this is a big deal.         Americans strongly object to any GOP attempts to use       political tactics to strong-arm Trump's nominee through the       confirmation process. After hearing balanced messaging, seven       in 10 (69 percent) oppose Republicans changing the rules to       prevent a filibuster and allow the Senate to confirm a       nominee with just a simple majority instead of the required       60 votes, with 54 percent strongly opposing this proposal. In       fact, even 4-out-of-10 Trump voters (39 percent) oppose       Republicans trying to change the filibuster rules.  [[Page S2296]]         Highlighting potential actions and rulings that could       result from confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee makes       voters much more likely to oppose him. Large majorities of       voters say they are more likely to oppose Trump's nominee       when they hear a diverse set of issues that could be impacted       by a nominee like Gorsuch. Actions that create strong       opposition include:        Upholding the Citizens United decision to allow       corporations, unions, and wealthy donors to spend more money       on elections.        Overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion       legal.        Eliminating or weakening environmental regulations that       protect air, water, and land from pollution.        Refusing to uphold or eliminating rights and protections       for LGBT individuals.        Failing to protect voting rights and making it more       difficult for Americans, particularly the poor and people of       color, to vote.        Weakening the ability of labor unions to organize workers       to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.        Voters strongly support legal abortion and oppose a Trump       nominee they believe could put that right at risk. Seven out       of 10 voters (69 percent) support a woman's right to choose,       and they recognize that Trump's Supreme Court nominee       jeopardizes the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion       legal. More than half of voters (52 percent) think it is very       or somewhat likely that Roe v. Wade will be overturned if       Trump's nominee is confirmed. This possibility raises strong       opposition for voters, with 61 percent who say they are more       likely to oppose a nominee who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade.        Voters have strong negative reactions to a Supreme Court       nominee who will continue to allow corporations and special       interests to use money to gain influence and drown out the       voice of individuals in politics. Opposition to a nominee who       wants no spending limits for corporations and wealthy       individuals in elections is broad and deep. Overall, 78       percent are more likely to oppose a nominee (56 percent much       more likely to oppose), including 92 percent of Democrats, 84       percent of Independents, and 59 percent of Republicans. Three       quarters of voters express a desire for their Senators to       oppose a Supreme Court nominee who was ruled in favor of       allowing campaign contributors to spend more money in       politics.        Voters recognize this Supreme Court nomination is crucial       to the direction of the country and they strongly oppose any       efforts by Republicans to skirt the rules to push through       Trump's ultraconservative nominee.    So the date of that Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll was  February 1. I think it really highlights that voters understand that  what we are doing now--this process of considering the potential  confirmation of a nominee--has huge consequences for this country and  has a huge impact on a whole variety of issues--environmental issues,  labor issues, discrimination issues, consumer issues, commerce issues,  a whole host of a range of things that the Supreme Court regularly  considers. So there is a lot of concern at this point.   Here is another issue, and that is the potential impact on LGBT  rights. This is an article by Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza entitled: ``Judge  Gorsuch Threatens the Dignity of LGBT People.''         Judges with Supreme Court aspirations tend to guard their       views, avoiding stances and statements that could impede a       nomination or a confirmation. Judge Neil Gorsuch has done       just that, leading observers to look to his influences rather       than his issuances. Among them is Justice Anthony Kennedy,       for whom he clerked. While Judge Gorsuch and Justice Kennedy       may share a bond, they part ways on several issues. One       lesser known but critically important point of potential       disagreement surrounds a somewhat nebulous legal principle       critical to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT,       rights: the dignity of free persons.        For decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that       individuals' due process right to liberty also protects their       dignity--and shields them from indignity. The concept of       dignity encompasses an individual's innate value as people       and their right to live free of interference; their right to       make important personal decisions; and their entitlement to       social recognition or protection from discrimination. This       notion of human dignity is at the heart of the Court's three       landmark LGBT rights cases: Lawrence v. Texas, United States       v. Windsor, and Obergefell v. Hodges.        Judge Gorsuch's writing--both on the bench and in his book       against ``assisted suicide,'' based on his Oxford       dissertation--suggests he is, at a minimum, skeptical of the       principle from which the right to dignity derives:       substantive due process. To be clear, substantive due       process, which protects individuals from having their       fundamental rights violated without justification, has       been part of Supreme Court jurisprudence for more than 100       years.        In one case, Judge Gorsuch made a point of incorporating       criticisms of substantive due process. He noted that ``some''       believe if such a concept existed, it would reside elsewhere       in the Constitution. ``Others,'' he offered, question whether       substantive due process ``should find a home anywhere in the       Constitution.'' This critical aside, while mild, is unusual.       Judge Gorsuch hews to precedent on substantive due process       only grudgingly, after conceding that ``the Supreme Court       clearly tells us'' that substantive due process does have a       home in the Constitution.        In his book, Judge Gorsuch went so far as to criticize the       Supreme Court for adhering to substantive due process       precedent in ``case after case.'' He also proposed an       alternative relevance for dignity, based in equal protection,       that could restrict rather than protect individual rights.       The recognition of innate human dignity is the foundation for       equality, Judge Gorsuch claimed, and equality makes       ``assisted suicide''--termed ``death with dignity'' in those       states that permit it--unacceptable because all people       created equal enjoy an inalienable right to life. This view       is troubling, not only in signaling an intent to       misappropriate the concept of dignity to restrict individual       choice, but also because of the implications for reproductive       access, rights, and justice.    This article continues:         Senators must press Judge Gorsuch to commit to upholding       Supreme Court precedent based on the recognition of dignity--      or admit he would not respect this long-established, critical       principle.    This goes on in a somewhat scholarly fashion.   (Mr. BOOZMAN assumed the Chair.)   I want to return to the core premise and review the fact that never  before have we had a stolen seat in the United States of America.   It is so important to drive this point home, that there is absolutely  no foundation for what happened last year in American history. You have  those 16 seats where a vacancy occurred in an election year. I am going  to go through them so that it becomes absolutely clear what we are  talking about here.   There were three seats where the vacancy occurred after the general  election. So the general election was in early November. One seat opens  in December in an election year, one in November, another in December-- three seats that opened up after the election and for which the  nomination was put forward.   There wasn't a lot of time. In these cases, the President was still  transitioning in March, rather than in January, so there was a little  more time than you might anticipate. We shortened that with a later  constitutional amendment.   Here, the President put forward a nominee within 3 days. Grant put  forward a nomination within about a week and just a single day for  Hayes to put forward a nomination.   So here you are after the election. The passions of the campaign are  starting to settle down. You know who the next President is going to  be. There is not a lot of time, but there is enough time for the Senate  to act, and it did in all three cases.   In all three of these cases where the seat became empty after the  election, even then, the Senate found there was time enough to act. In  all three of these cases, that action was a confirmation of the  nominee--three out of three. So that is one set.   John Jay was nominated by President Adams. Ward Hunt was nominated by  President Grant. Williams Woods was nominated by President Hayes, but  in one of those interesting little twists, in this case, the nominee  actually declined it after he had been confirmed. I don't know that we  have seen that very often in the history of Supreme Court Justices.   Then there is that set of cases in an election year where the vacancy  occurred before the election but the President, for a variety of  reasons, didn't nominate until after the election. So you are kind of  back in the same situation--a short amount of time. We have four cases  that are in that category.   We had the first case in 1828--a vacancy before the election, a  nomination afterward. The Senate acts. The Senate didn't always confirm  the nomination, but they always acted. In this case, they rejected the  nomination by tabling it.   Then we had President Buchanan, who nominated Jeremiah Black. In May,  the seat became vacant, and the nomination didn't occur until February.  The President would have transferred in March. The Senate again acted.  The Senators of this body acted, and they rejected it. They rejected it  by rejecting the motion to proceed.   Salmon Chase, under Lincoln--the vacancy occurred just a month before  the election in October. The President put forward the nomination a  month after the election in December, and the Senate confirmed him.  [[Page S2297]]    With Eisenhower and William Brennan, there was a vacancy a month  before the election and a nomination that basically came 2 months after  the election--getting very close to the transition date, yet he was  confirmed.   So those are seven of the nominations, of which five were confirmed  and two were rejected--tabled and the motion to proceed was rejected.  Then we have the remaining nine. These nine are closer--well, one of  them is the seat that became open when Antonin Scalia died, but the  historic additional eight seats--those seats are a little closer to the  situation we have with Antonin Scalia dying and the President  nominating Merrick Garland, because the vacancy came before the  election in these eight cases, and the nomination came before the  election.   In fact, here we have the first case, under President Jefferson. He  nominated William Johnson. But the vacancy occurred in January. The  nomination occurred in March. It was pretty close to the situation we  faced last year, yet the Senate acted, and they confirmed the nominee.   President Tyler nominated Edward King. The vacancy occurred in April,  the nomination in June, and the Senate acted. They rejected the  nomination by tabling it.   Edward Bradford was nominated by President Fillmore in July of 1852.  The following month, the nomination was put forward before the  election, and again the Senate acted, but they tabled it.   So they didn't confirm in every case, but they acted in every single  case.   Melville Fuller was nominated by President Cleveland. There was a  vacancy in March. The nomination was in May. He was confirmed.   Under President Harrison, there was George Shiras. The vacancy  occurred in January. Quite a few months passed. It was almost 6 months  before the nomination was put forward in July by the President. The  nomination was confirmed.   Justice Brandeis was put forward by President Wilson. In this case,  two vacancies occurred in an election year, both before the election-- one in January, one in June. The candidate was put forward quite  quickly--within the month of January and a month later in the case of  John Clarke--and both were confirmed.   There was Benjamin Cardozo under President Hoover in 1932. The  vacancy was in January. The nomination was in February. He was  confirmed.   So those are 8 additional, and we have now a total of 14.   Then we have Merrick Garland. Obama put forward Merrick Garland. The  vacancy was in February. The nomination was in March. No action. It is  the only time there was no action in U.S. history.   That is why we have all of these editorials from across the country  noting that this is a stolen seat, that it has never happened before,  and that it sets a terrible precedent. That is the problem we are  looking at.   Why is it a terrible precedent? Because once the Senate starts  stealing a seat from one President and handing it to another in an  effort to pack the Court, there is no end to the mischief that follows.   If you can steal a seat in which there was plenty of time to consider  in the final year of a Presidency, you can do it for 2 years. We saw  this in terms of many comments that were made by Republican legislators  before the November election. When they thought the Democratic nominee  was going to win, they were saying: We are going to make sure that for  4 years, it stays an eight-member Court, that no matter that the people  will have spoken through an election, no matter that a nominee has been  put forward who is credible, we are simply not going to consider it for  4 years.   This is a court-packing scheme through the theft of this Supreme  Court seat. You can just think about if the Court is packed, then when  the parties are reversed--and it always does go back and forth sooner  or later--then does the other party say: We have to balance back out  the Court, restore its integrity by stealing a seat back, stealing it 2  years into a Presidency.   It is terrible not only in terms of its impact on the Senate here  because it now makes this incredibly partisan pitched battle out of  what was supposed to be an advice and consent responsibility to deter a  President from nominating people of unfit character--I use the phrase  ``of unfit character.'' That is a phrase Hamilton used. In the  Federalist Papers, he lays out what this advice and consent  responsibility was supposed to be all about. They needed to have a  strategy for how they put key appointments into the executive branch to  basically staff the Cabinet agencies.   They thought at first: Maybe the check will be that we will have the  appointments made by the Senate.   So the executive branch will be headed by the President, but the  appointments will be made by, as they referred to it, the assembly.   Then they said: Well, there is a big problem with that because one  Senator will get their best friend in one post in exchange for some  other Senator's best friend in some other post. The public won't know  why it happened. There will be no accountability. So that is not a  great idea.   So they said: A better idea is to have accountability and have the  President make the appointments. But there is a problem. What if the  President goes off-track and starts appointing people of unfit  character? Well, we need a way to put a check on that.   So they came up with this idea of the Senate's advice and consent,  meaning that the Senate could block a nominee if the person was of  unfit character. They anticipated this power to be used rarely because  of the very nature and the very existence of the power of the Senate to  block someone of unfit character would deter a President from  appointing someone of unfit character.    What did they mean by unfit character? Well, it could mean a host of  things--that a President might be appointing somebody who had some  conflict of interest or who was unacceptable, or maybe the President  was appointing someone who had absolutely no knowledge of the issues or  maybe appointing somebody who had an alcohol problem and wasn't capable  of responsibly executing the task, the responsibilities of the office.  There were a host of possibilities, but they thought it would be rarely  used; that it wouldn't be applied as a tool to conduct warfare on the  executive branch; that it wouldn't be used as a tool to be conducted as  warfare on the judiciary; and it wouldn't be used as a tool to pack the  Court and delegitimize the Court. Yet we have been seeing all of that  from the past in recent years. So that really is something that we  should be deeply concerned about.   (Mr. FLAKE assumed the Chair.)   We saw, back in 2013, the growing use of the supermajority as a  weapon of mass legislative destruction or government destruction in  trying to prevent the President from having a team with which he could  act. The National Labor Relations Board was blocked from having its  positions filled, and the Labor Secretary was unable to get a floor  vote, and the list just went on and on and on--tons of district court  judges and circuit court judges, to the point that we had to find a way  to curb that destructive strategy, and that meant that we had to go to  a simple majority. But we left in place the supermajority for the  Supreme Court because it has powers no other institution has. It is the  decider.   One can have a district court make a decision that gets bumped to a  circuit court, and a circuit court makes a decision, and it goes to the  Supreme Court. They are ultimately the decider and they hold the  positions for as long as they want. So they can hold it for decades. It  is not an appointment to the executive branch that might be there for 2  to 4 years. That is why it is so incredibly important that we get this  right and why people who are observing what is going on are so  concerned about the damage that is being done.   This article is from the New York Times: ``Neil Gorsuch, the Nominee  for a Stolen Seat.''         It's been almost a year since Senate Republicans took an       empty Supreme Court seat hostage, discarding the       constitutional duty that both parties have honored throughout       American history and hobbling an entire branch of government       for partisan gain.        President Trump had a great opportunity to repair some of       that damage by nominating a moderate candidate for the       vacancy, which was created when Justice Antonin Scalia died       in February. Instead, he chose Neil Gorsuch, a very       conservative judge from the federal Court of Appeals for the       10th Circuit whose jurisprudence and  [[Page S2298]]       writing style are often compared to those of Justice Scalia.        If Judge Gorsuch is confirmed, the court will once again       have a majority of justices appointed by Republican       presidents, as it has for nearly half a century. For       starters, that spells big trouble for public-sector unions,       environmental regulations and women's access to       contraception. If Trump gets the chance to name another       justice, the consequences could be much more dire. In normal       times, Judge Gorsuch--a widely respected and, at 49,       relatively young judge with a reliably conservative voting       record--would be an obvious choice for a Republican       President.        These are not normal times.        The seat Judge Gorsuch hopes to sit in should have been       filled, months ago, by Merrick Garland, the chief judge of       the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,       whom President Barack Obama nominated to the high court last       month. Judge Garland, a former federal prosecutor and 20-year       veteran of the nation's most important federal appeals court,       is both more moderate and more qualified than Judge Gorsuch.        That meant nothing to Senate Republicans, who abused their       power as the majority party and, within hours of Justice       Scalia's death, shut down the confirmation process for the       remainder of Mr. Obama's presidency. There would be no       negotiations to release this hostage; the sole object was to       hold on to the court's conservative majority. The       outrageousness of the ploy was matched only by the       unlikelihood that it would succeed--until, to virtually       everyone's shock, it did.        The destructive lesson Senate Republicans taught is that       obstruction pays off. Yet they seem to have short memories.       After Senate Democrats refused to attend votes on two of Mr.       Trump's cabinet picks on Tuesday, Senator Pat Toomey of       Pennsylvania said, ``We did not inflict this kind of       obstructionism on President Obama.'' Even absent such       dishonesty, any Democratic impulse to mimic the Republican       blockade by filibustering Judge Gorsuch would be       understandable. But Senate Democrats should be wary of       stooping to the Republicans' level, especially because any       such effort is likely to prove futile, since Republicans have       the votes to simply eliminate the use of the filibuster. . .       .    You know, I think about the fact that it has been bandied about with  such lack of gravity that the Senate majority may change the 60-vote  requirement for the Supreme Court. It is an immediate tactical victory  to do so, but it may turn out to be a tactical mistake in the bit  longer term. President Trump may have a single opportunity to put in  place a Supreme Court Justice, and the next President, who might be a  Democrat, might have many chances to nominate a Supreme Court Justice.  So lowering the standard from the 60 votes designed to have a judge  down the middle could lead to very different consequences depending on  when various judges retire, who they are, and where they are in the  spectrum--something that none of us can predict. So it is certainly a  strategy that has simply just been asserted as this: Well, we will just  do it.    Not only does it have high tactical risk, but it just is another blow  of the ax, felling the trees in the forest of the integrity of the  Court and the integrity of the Senate. It sets the stage for all these  battles that are going to come over future nominees. The pure  partisanship, short-term gains, grudges to be remedied rather than the  advice and consent vision that was in our Constitution--the vision that  Hamilton laid out which might have to be used rarely because it would  deter Presidents from making nominations of people of unfit character.   I am disturbed about where we are headed. There are many policy  issues that seem important at the time as they come to this floor, and  they are important. They are issues related to the ability of workers  to get fair wages for the value they bring to the development of the  products they make. There are certainly key issues about our  transportation infrastructure and key challenges on healthcare. But a  single Supreme Court seat can change policy on a huge spectrum of  issues with the Supreme Court as the final arbiter.   If we have a pivot point in which dark money--unlimited amounts of  funds--are injected into the national campaigns forever more, well, we  are never going to heal and get back to the point of the Senate being a  great deliberative body, because that dark money will own this body and  control this body, much as it does now after the entry of the Koch  brothers into the national campaign contests.   That is the impact of a single Supreme Court decision. It has huge  impact on who serves here and what decisions they make. It has huge  impact on whether we are a ``we the people'' government or a government  by and for the most powerful.   It might be interesting at this point to go back in time to sections  of a speech by Senator Robert Byrd. Senator Byrd was still in the  Senate when I came here in 2008. He was one of four Senators that were  in the Senate when I was an intern in 1976.   He says in his speech, delivered December 15, 1998, in the Old Senate  Chamber:         Clio being my favorite muse, let me begin this evening with       a look backward over the well-traveled road of history.       History always turns our faces backward, and this is as it       should be, so that we might be better informed and prepared       to exercise wisdom in dealing with future events.        ``To be ignorant of what happened before you were born,''       said Cicero, ``is to remain always a child.''    So, for a little while, as we meet together in this hallowed place,  let us turn our faces backward.         Look about you. We meet tonight in the Senate Chamber. Not       the Chamber in which we transact our business daily now, but       the Old Senate Chamber where our predecessors wrote the laws       before the Civil War. Here, in this room, Daniel Webster--he       moved about the Chamber from time to time--Daniel Webster       orated, Henry Clay forged compromises, John C. Calhoun stood       on principle. Here, Henry Foote of Mississippi pulled a       pistol on Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. Senator Benton       ripped open his coat, and said, ``Let the assassin fire!''       And, ``Stand out of the way.'' Here the eccentric Virginia       Senator John Randolph brought his hunting dogs into the       Chamber, and the dashing Texas Senator Sam Houston sat over       here to my right; he sat at his desk whittling wooden hearts       for ladies in the gallery. Seated at his desk in the back       row, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner was beaten       violently over the head with a cane wielded by Representative       Preston Brooks of South Carolina, who objected to Sumner's       strongly abolitionist speeches and the vituperation that       Sumner had heaped upon Brooks' uncle, Senator Butler of South       Carolina.        The Senate first met here in 1810, but, because our British       cousins chose to set fire to the Capitol during the War of       1812, Congress was forced to move into the Patent Office       Building in downtown Washington, and later into a building       known as the Brick Capitol, located on the present site of       the Supreme Court Building. Hence, it was December 1819       before Senators were able to return to this restored and       elegant Chamber. They met here for 40 years, and it was       during that exhilarating period that the Senate experienced       its ``Golden Age.''        Here, in this room, the Senate tried to deal with the       emotional and destructive issue of slavery by passing the       Missouri Compromise of 1820. That act drew a line across the       United States and asserted that the peculiar institution of       slavery should remain to the south of the line and not spread       to the north. The Missouri Compromise also set the precedent       that for every slave state admitted to the Union, a free       state should be admitted as well, and vice versa. What this       meant in practical political terms was that the North and the       South would be exactly equal in voting strength in this       Chamber, and that any settlement of the explosive issue of       slavery would have to originate here in the Senate. As a       result, the Nation's most talented and ambitious legislators       began to leave the House of Representatives to take seats       here in the Senate Chamber. Here, they fought to hold the       Union together through the omnibus compromise of 1850, only       to overturn these efforts by passing the fateful Kansas-      Nebraska Act of 1854.        The Senators moved out of this room in 1859, on the eve of       the Civil War. When they marched in procession from this       Chamber to the current Chamber, they marked the last time       that leaders of the North and South would march together. The       next year, the South seceded, and Senators who had walked       shoulder to shoulder here parted to become military officers       and political leaders of the Union and of the Confederacy.        This old Chamber that they left behind is not just a       smaller version of the current Chamber. Here, the center       aisle divides the two parties, but there are an equal number       of desks on either side--you will count 32 on one side and 32       on the other, not because the two parties were evenly       divided, but because there was not room to move desks back       and forth, depending on the size of the majority, as we do       today. That meant that some members of the majority party had       to sit with members of the minority. It did not matter to       them. The two desks in the front row in the center aisle were       not reserved for the majority and minority leaders as they       are now, because there were no party leaders at that time. No       Senator spoke for his party; every Senator spoke for himself.       There were recognized leaders among the Senators, but only       unofficially. Everyone knew, for example, that Henry Clay led       the Whigs, but he would never claim that honor. Clay       generally sat in the last row at the far end of the Chamber       so he could talk to Senators as they came in to vote.        The Senate left this Chamber because it outgrew the space.       When they first met here in 1810, there were 32 Senators. So       many states were added over the next four decades  [[Page S2299]]       that when they left in 1859, there were 64 Senators. Yet,       while the Senate increased in size, it was essentially the       same institution that the Founders had created in the       Constitution. Today, another century and four decades later,       and having grown to 100 Senators, it is still essentially the       same institution. The actors have changed; the issues have       changed; but the Senate, which emerged from the Great       Compromise of July 16, 1787, remains the great forum of the       states. This is so, largely, because as a Nation, we were       fortunate to have wise, cautious people draft and implement       our Constitution. They were pragmatists rather than       idealists. James Madison particularly had a shrewd view of       human nature. He did not believe in man's perfectibility. He       assumed that those who achieved power would always try to       amass more power, and that political factions would always       compete out of self-interest. In ``The Federalist Papers,''       Madison reasoned that ``in framing a government which is to       be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in       this: You must first enable the government to control the       government; and, in the next place, oblige it to control       itself.'' Madison and other Framers of the Constitution       divided power so that no one person, no single branch of       government could gain complete power. As Madison explained       it: ``Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.''        However, ambition has not always counteracted ambition, as       we saw in the enactment by Congress of the line-item veto in       1996. Just as the Roman Senate ceded its power over the purse       to the Roman dictators, Sulla and Caesar, and to the later       emperors, thus surrendering its power to check tyranny, so       did the American Congress, the Senate included. By passing       the Line-Item Veto Act the Congress surrendered its control       over the purse--control which had been vested by the Founding       Fathers here in this legislative branch.        This brings me to the first point I would like to leave you       with this evening. It is this: The legislative branch must be       eternally vigilant over the powers and authorities vested in       it by the Constitution--eternally vigilant. This is vitally       important to the security of our constitutional system of       checks and balances and separation of power. George       Washington in his Farewell Address of September 17, 1796,       emphasized the importance of such vigilance: It is important       likewise that the habits of thinking in a free country should       inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to       confine themselves within their respective constitutional       spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one       department, to encroach upon one another. The spirit of       encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the       departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of       government, a real despotism. . . . The necessity of       reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by       dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and       constituting each the guardian of the public weal against       invasions of the others, has been evinced by experiments       ancient and modern. . . . To preserve them must be as       necessary as to institute them.        Each Member of this body must be ever mindful of the       fundamental duty to uphold the institutional prerogatives of       the Senate if we are to preserve the vital balance which       Washington so eloquently endorsed.    Senator Byrd continues:         During my 46 years in Congress, and particularly in more       recent years, I have seen an inclination--I think I have--on       the part of many legislators of both parties to regard a       chief executive in a role more elevated than the Framers of       the Constitution intended. We as legislators have a       responsibility to work with the chief executive, but it is       intended to be a two-way street. The Framers did not envision       the office of President as having the attributes of royalty.       We must recognize the heavy burden that any President bears,       and wherever and whenever we can, we must cooperate with the       chief executive in the interest of all of the people. But let       us keep in mind Madison's admonition: ``Ambition must be made       to counteract ambition.''        As Majority Leader in the Senate during the Carter years, I       worked hard to help President Carter enact his programs, but       I publicly stated that I was not ``the President's man''; I       was a Senate man. For example, in July 1977, I opposed       President Carter's plan to sell the AWACS (Airborne Warning       and Control System) to Iran. Iran was then a military ally of       the United States, but I was troubled over the potential       security risks involved with the possibility of compromising       highly sophisticated technology in this volatile region. I       was concerned that the sale ran contrary to our national       interests in maintaining a stable military balance and       limited arms proliferation in the Middle East. Both Houses of       Congress had to vote disapproval resolutions to stop the       sale. I enlisted the support of then Republican Minority       Leader Howard Baker. Senator Baker was someone who could rise       above political party when he believed that the national       interests required it, just as he did in the Panama Canal       debates. The Carter administration chose to withdraw the sale       of AWACS temporarily. Shortly afterwards, the Iranian       revolution occurred and the Shah was replaced. Had that sale       gone through as planned, those sophisticated aircraft would       have fallen into the hands of an unfriendly government. As so       often has happened in our history, individual courage and       character again chartered our course.    I want to return to Senator Byrd's point about Republican Minority  Leader Howard Baker. It says: ``Senator Baker was someone who could  rise above political party when he believed the national interests  required it, just as he did during the Panama Canal debates.'' The  debate over those treaties was intense because they were a valuable  asset controlled by the United States. Many thought of them as a  possession of the United States, and we were turning them over to  Panama after a long period of negotiations. But to be able to rise  above partisanship to pursue a national interest--that is what we need  now as we face the potential of this devastating change in Senate  conduct over the selection of a Supreme Court nominee.   I hope we can find a way to rise above partisanship or political  party and pursue the national interests because I have seen so little  of the desire to strengthen our institutions. I am not optimistic, but  I do think it is worth noting that it is possible. We could take this  train off the tracks--because of the shadow hanging over the  Presidency, because of the far-right views of Neil Gorsuch, because it  is a stolen seat and we haven't remedied that situation with a plan.   Senator Robert Byrd continued:         This brings me to my second point. On the great issues, the       Senate has always been blessed with Senators who were able       to rise above party, and consider first and foremost the       national interest. There are very worthy examples in       Senate history.        When I came to the Senate in 1959, artists were at work       painting five porthole portraits in the Senate reception       room. The Senate had appointed a special Committee chaired by       Senator John F. Kennedy to select the five most significant       Senators in Senate history. This was no easy task, because       there were many potential candidates.        In setting the criteria, the Committee looked to Senators       who had stood firm for principle, who had not blown with the       winds, and who made personal sacrifices for the national       good. They were not saints, nor were they perfect men.        Daniel Webster's personal financial dealings left an       eternal blot upon his record; yet, he deserved to have his       portrait in the Senate reception room, not simply as a great       orator, but as a man who sacrificed his own political       standing by endorsing the compromise of 1850, which was       deeply unpopular in his home State of Massachusetts, but       which he realized was the best chance to hold the Union       together.        In my almost 46 years in Congress, I have seen other       courageous Senators.        I have already referred to the courage demonstrated by       former Senator Howard Baker during the Panama Canal debates.       Without Senator Baker's support, the Panama Canal Treaties       would never have been approved by the Senate. We needed two-      thirds; we were swimming uphill. The odds were against us.       The killing of American servicemen in Panama would have gone       on, but Senator Howard Baker threw his shoulder behind the       wheel and helped to construct what he and I referred to as       leadership amendments, amendments which protected U.S.       interests in that region, and we both worked shoulder to       shoulder against great odds, as indicated by the polls.        We did so because we believed, after careful study, that       the treaties were in the best interests of the United States.       There were people in my own State of West Virginia who still       don't believe that. But I was convinced of it.        Howard Baker knew what my old majority leader, Mike       Mansfield, and all students of the Senate's institutional       role know.        Political polarization--too much emphasis on which side of       the aisle one sits, is not now, and has never been, a good       thing for the Senate. I am talking about politics when it       becomes gamesmanship or when it becomes mean-spirited or when       it becomes overly manipulative, simply to gain advantage.        I am not talking about honestly held views or differing       political positions. Those things enrich our system.       Americans have always loved a good debate. And that is what I       believe and wish for now: More substantive and stimulating       debate and less pure politics and imagery.        But I well understand history and its ebb and flow, and I       well know that we live in an age of imagery. It is simply my       wish that, sometime soon, the rising tide of imagery and       partisanship will begin to ebb rather than to flow quite so       freely.        Washington, in his farewell address, warned us against the       ``baneful effects of the spirit of party'' when he said:        ``. . . in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not       to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain       there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary       purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the       effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate       and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a       uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest       instead of warming, it should consume.''        So, I believe that the American people are more than tired       of partisan warfare. I believe  [[Page S2300]]       they wish for less of it from the Congress, especially in the       Senate, where more statesmanship and a longer view are still       expected.        Declining participation in elections, and repeated public       surveys which indicate weariness, distrust, and alienation       within our system ought to serve as a harbinger to be ignored       at our peril.        It must be a matter of concern to all of us that all too       few Americans look to officeholders for inspiration in these       troubled and turbulent times.        How can we attract the talent needed to serve in public       office in future years if elected officials continue to be       held in such low esteem?    Continuing to read Senator Byrd's speech in the Old Senate Chamber:         I would very much like to see a rekindling of basic faith       in our leaders, and a renewal in politics and of public       service. But the existence of inspiring leadership by public       officials is fundamental to a shoring up of that faith.        In fact, I think the American people are in desperate need       of some old-fashioned heroes. Now, it seems, today's heroes,       if we want to loosely use the term, are merely celebrities--      rock stars who spout deplorable messages, or sports figures       who mass fortunes advertising baggy clothes at exorbitant       prices.        I'm not talking about Sammy Sosa. I'm not talking about       Mark McGuire. They were my heroes, too, as was Babe Ruth in       1927. Not much to look up to here, I say. Not much to build       dreams on.        Look hard at the content of our popular culture. There is       really nothing much to inspire and look up to. And       regrettably there also is not much to counter the empty       commercialism which is so prevalent today. It has become the       norm.    Senator Byrd continued:         So where are we in all of this? What is our role? What part       can we as Senators--authority figures, statesmen representing       the people--play while we simultaneously endeavor to carry       out our 200-year-old mandate, bequeathed to us by some of the       most brilliant men of their age, or of any age before or       since?        Well, we can show up for our roll call votes, carry out our       committee assignments, issue the obligatory press releases,       dutifully follow up on constituent requests, and answer our       mail.        All of these are necessary and to a greater or lesser       degree important.        But a reemphasis by the Senate on our strict institutional       role is certainly something which I would like to see. It is       a sobering and heavy responsibility all by itself, and its       very weightiness tends to cool the over-heated passions of       political demagoguery. After all, that role is, in a       constitutional sense, the reason we are here. The Framers       expected a zealous defense of our powers to keep the tyrants       at bay. But there is still another role--an intangible       something--that we who are privileged to sit in this body,       and indeed leaders in the private sector, as well as those       who write and reflect upon the news, are called upon to play.       I call it the duty beyond our duties.        The duty I am talking about is the duty to endeavor to       inspire others and to demonstrate, through personal example,       that public service of all types ought to be an honorable       calling. Contrary to what many believe, it is absolutely the       wrong place for the slick and the insincere.        Serving the public in a leadership role demands honesty,       hard work, sacrifice, and dedication from those who dare to       ask the people for such an awesome trust. Those who ask to       shoulder that mantle also shoulder a much larger personal       obligation than many of us may regularly contemplate.        Mr. Leader, we all have a clear responsibility to serve as       role models to inspire our people, and particularly our young       people, to be and to do their best.        On that score, we politicians, as a group, generally miss       the mark.        Perhaps it's because power, whether it be the power of       political office, or the power to run giant corporations, or       the power to report and analyze events, is a very heady       thing. It can lead to arrogance, self aggrandizement,       disregard for playing by the rules, and contempt for the       people who send us here. It can lead us to forget that we are       servants, not masters.    Senator Byrd continued:         In the real world, exemplary personal conduct can sometimes       achieve much more than any political agenda. Comity,       courtesy, charitable treatment of even our political       opposites, combined with a concerted effort to not just       occupy our offices, but to bring honor to them, will do more       to inspire our people and restore their faith in us, their       leaders, than millions of dollars of 30-second spots or       glitzy puff-pieces concocted by spin-meisters.        These are troubling times for our nation and our people on       both the national and international fronts.        For our country to weather the rough seas ahead, we must       use our most tempered judgment and seek out our best and most       noble instincts.        Our example here can be a healing element--a balm to salve       the trauma of distrust and disillusionment too long endured       by good people. Let each of us follow his or her own       conscience when it comes to issues, but as we do so, may we       be ever mindful that our people watching us, and the people       who sent us here can take us back home again.        Let us be aware of the sublimely uplifting which the       example of simple dignity, decency, decorum, and dedication       to duty can play in the life of a nation.    Senator Byrd had yet more words to share.         Let us also remember that even after two hundred years, the       Senate is still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and       evening star in the American constitutional constellation.        It has had its giants and its little men, its Websters and       its Bilbos, its Calhouns and its McCarthys. It has been the       stage of high drama, of comedy and tragedy, and its players       have been the great and the near great, those who think they       are great, and those who probably never will be great.        It has weathered the storms of adversity, withstood the       barbs of cynics and the attacks of critics, and provided       stability and strength to the nation during periods of civil       strife and uncertainty, panics and depressions.        In war and in peace, it has been the sure refuge and       protector of the rights of the state and of a political       minority because great and courageous Senators have always       been there to stay the course and keep the faith.        And it can do so again as long as we are ever blessed in       this august body with those who hear the clear tones of the       bell of duty, the Senate will continue to stand--the great       forum of the constitutional American liberty!    That is a lot of good advice. As we sit here in these troubled times  and ponder how we are going to rise above the passions and politics of  the moment to restore the functionality of the Senate, that is the  challenge we have. I believe Byrd--with his experience, with his  articulate language--is calling to us from the past to say that we can  do it. We can do better. We can rise above the situation in which we  have put ourselves, the situation in which one team, for the first time  in U.S. history, has stolen a Supreme Court seat to pack the Court.    To now be in this position of considering a Senate nomination at the  exact moment that the person making the nomination and his team are  under investigation for potentially traitorous conduct against the  United States--but we don't have the answers yet.   (Mr. PAUL assumed the Chair.)   Here we are with a nominated judge who is way outside the mainstream,  and we therefore have a challenge. It is exactly what the filibuster  was designed for--to keep judges who are outside the judicial  mainstream from being nominated. So that is a lot for us to wrestle  with in the next few days.   The New Yorker did an analysis of where Neil Gorsuch lies. The  subtitle says: ``Every sign suggests that he would be at least as  conservative a judicial activist as Samuel Alito.'' This is a different  source, but that is the same basic point, showing an analysis that  places Neil Gorsuch to the right side of the right peak in terms of  ideology.         Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the diminutive liberal colossus of the       Supreme Court, has built a distinguished record as a Justice,       but her legacy as a nominee is more dubious. In her       confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee,       in 1993, she refused to answer most questions about how, if       confirmed, she would rule. In an oft-quoted phrase, she vowed       to give ``no hints, no forecasts, no previews.'' Nominees       have invoked this stonewall ever since.        Last week, Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump's choice to fill the       seat of the late Antonin Scalia, proved an especially ardent       follower of what has come to be known as the Ginsburg rule.       Asked repeatedly by members of the committee about his views       of such cases as Roe v. Wade and Citizens United, Gorsuch not       only refused to answer, but went on to say that his feelings,       if he had any, were of no consequence: ``It's not a matter of       agreeing or disagreeing. It's a matter of it being the law,       and my job is to apply and enforce the law.'' Gorsuch       portrayed himself as a kind of judicial automaton, obligated       to pay mindless obeisance to the Court's prior rulings.        This interpretation of the role of Supreme Court Justices       is, to put it charitably, incorrect--they can and do overturn       their earlier holdings. And Trump didn't nominate Gorsuch       simply because he knows how to follow precedent. He nominated       Gorsuch because his career resembles a lab experiment       synthesizing every trend in modern conservative thought.        A ruggedly handsome Coloradan--this President cares a great       deal about appearances--Gorsuch has an appealing manner and       an impressive resume. He did well in good schools, held       prestigious clerkships, worked at a fine law firm, took a       senior post in the Department of Justice, and for the past       decade has served in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. From       his boyhood days as a Republican Senate page to his decades       of volunteer work for GOP candidates, Gorsuch has been  [[Page S2301]]       a strong party loyalist. (Like many Republican pols, he       refers to the ``Democrat,'' rather than the Democratic,       Party.)        His background also includes a dose of pro-corporate,       deregulatory libertarianism, as reflected in his close       relationship with the billionaire Philip Anschutz, a client       turned mentor. A sampling of authoritarianism can be seen in       Gorsuch's service in George W. Bush's Justice Department,       where he helped craft a proposal for the treatment of       detainees at Guantanamo. (The Supreme Court later ruled it       unconstitutional.) There's social conservatism, too, evident       in his one book, a critique of death-with-dignity laws and       physician-assisted suicide. ``All human beings are       intrinsically valuable,'' he wrote, ``and the intentional       taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.''       It's easy to read the book as a coded attack on abortion       rights.        To the extent that Gorsuch said anything of substance at       his hearing, he put himself across as a mainstream figure. He       said he participated in some 2,700 cases on the appeals       court, and had voted with the majority in 99 percent of the       them. This proves only that most cases are routine. (Even the       Supreme Court issues unanimous rulings more than half the       time.) The hard cases are the ones that matter, and it's       reasonable to project how Gorsuch would vote in them. He       would oppose abortion rights. (Trump promised to appoint a       ``pro-life'' Justice.)        His predilection for employers over employees is such that       it yielded a circuit-court opinion of almost Gothic cruelty.       When subzero temperatures caused a truck driver's trailer       brakes to freeze, he pulled over to the side of the road.       After waiting three hours for help to arrive, he began to       lose feeling in his extremities, so he unhitched the cab       from the trailer and drove to safety. His employer fired       him for abandoning company property. The majority in the       case called the dismissal wrong, but Gorsuch said the       driver was in the wrong.        As a Justice, Gorsuch would embrace a deregulation of       campaign finance symbolized by the Citizens United decision.       (He argued in an opinion that judges should evaluate limits       on political contributions using the same tough standards       that they apply to racial discrimination.)        His most famous Tenth Circuit decision had him taking a       side in the culture wars. In Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius,       he ruled that a multibillion-dollar corporation could       withhold federally guaranteed rights to birth control from       thousands of female employees because of religious beliefs of       the corporation's owners. (His position was upheld, 5-4, by       the Supreme Court.)        In an embarrassing coincidence, on the second day of       Gorsuch's testimony, the Court unanimously rejected one of       his holdings in the Tenth Circuit, ruling that it denied       adequate educational opportunities to students with       disabilities.        Every sign suggests that Gorsuch would be at least as       conservative a judicial activist as Samuel Alito.        It's also clear what Neil Gorsuch is not: Merrick Garland.       Gorsuch's nomination is inextricable from its shameful       political context. When Scalia died, more than 11 months       remained in Barack Obama's Presidency, but Senate Republicans       refused to give his nominee even a hearing. This departure       from norms is all the more outrageous because a tactic was       used to block a moderate; the Republicans denied Obama his       constitutional right in order to trade a Justice who might       have been less liberal than Stephen Breyer for one who might       be as radical as Clarence Thomas.        Such a turnabout seems especially disturbing given that the       FBI and other agencies are now investigating the very       legitimacy of the Trump Presidency. Indeed, Chuck Schumer,       the Democratic leader in the Senate, has called for a delay       in the Gorsuch vote until there is some clarity about the       Trump camp's ties to Russia. Last week, he also promised to       lead a filibuster against Gorsuch's confirmation, but       Republicans, in response, vowed to change the Senate rules to       allow them to confirm the nominee by a simple majority.        The Supreme Court is, as political scientists like to say,       a counter-majoritarian institution: The President and members       of the Congress must answer to voters; the Justices, who       serve for life, answer only to the commands of the       Constitution. But, in doing so, it's their duty to speak for       those who lack political power. The Trump era has already       meant trouble for these people--the poor, the sick, the       dissenters, immigrants--and Gorsuch, for all his intellectual       distinction, has shown scant regard for their concerns.       There's little reason to believe that he would as a Justice       either.    The L.A. Times wrote the story titled ``Another judicial dirty trick  from Senate Republicans.''         One of 2016's most spectacular examples of government       dysfunction was the U.S. Senate's outrageous refusal to       consider President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick       Garland to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme       Court. That dereliction of duty by the Republican majority       not only denied the sitting President his constitutional       prerogative to fill vacancies in the court (so that the       appointment would go instead to a hoped-for Republican       successor.) It also prevented the court from resolving a       handful of cases because of a 4-4 split and probably       discouraged the justices from accepting other cases because       of the possibility of a similar deadlock.        Less well known is the fact that the Senate also failed to       hold 4 votes on 24 Obama nominees for lifetime federal       judgeships who had been cleared by the Senate Judiciary       Committee. They are among 59 aspiring judicial appointees       whose nominations will expire when the 144th Congress fades       into history this month.        Of the 24 nominees left stranded, three had been selected       to federal appeals courts, two for U.S. Court of       International Trade, and 19 for federal district courts. Some       of the nominees have been waiting for Senate action for       months, including U.S. district judge Lucy Haeran Koh, who       was nominated to the San Francisco Bay's U.S. 9th Circuit       Court of Appeals by Obama in February and recommended by the       committee in September.        Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the       Judiciary Committee, accused Senate Republicans of setting a       record for inaction on judicial nominations. Whereas the       Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 68 of George W. Bush's       judicial nominees in the last two years of his presidency,       only 22 nominees had been confirmed in the comparable period,       Democrats note.        Republicans countered by citing other statistics, such as       the fact that Obama has had more judicial nominees confirmed       overall than Bush did in his two terms--329 to Bush's 326.    It is also true that the Democratic-controlled Senate ended its  business in 2008 without having confirmed 26 Bush judicial nominees.  Both parties have a history of refusing to act on highly qualified  judicial nominees proposed by a president of the other party. Yet  Leahy's indictment is on point.   As with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's stonewalling the  Garland nomination, the failure to act on the lower court nominations  is extreme and inexcusable.         As we noted above, it represents a partisan attempt to       prevent Obama from exercising his right, as the Constitution       puts it, to appoint judges by and with the advice and consent       of the Senate. Sabotaging the exercise of that authority is       offensive, not only because it undermines the Constitution       but because it perpetuates a partisan grudge match over the       Federal courts.    It would be utterly understandable if Senate Democrats now retaliated  by making it difficult for President-Elect Donald Trump to win  confirmation for his judicial nominees, especially those slotted for  seats that Obama had every right to fill. Democrats will be especially  reluctant to support a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court who likely  would move the court to the right after the Republicans cheated Obama  out of his opportunity to shape the Court in a more liberal direction  by appointing Garland.         We recognize that the selection of Federal judges is an       inherently political process, one of which both Presidents       and Members of the Senate consider not only a nominee's       technical qualifications and legal philosophy but also his or       her ideology and party label. Even so, both parties need to       eventually find a way back to a state of affairs in which a       president, regardless of party, will receive prompt Senate       consideration of his judicial nominees and an affirmative       vote if they are well-qualified and not extreme in their       philosophy (as we fear some Trump nominees might be). That       should be the process, regardless of which party controls the       Senate.        That is important because denying qualified judicial       nominees a vote harms the federal judiciary--by denying it       needed personnel and by telling lawyers who might aspire to       the bench that their nominations could languish for months       and ultimately perish not because of any failing on their       part but because of partisan gamesmanship. And it isn't       lawyers and judges who suffer. As White House Counsel W. Neil       Eggleston told the Washington Post: ``There is a real impact       on real people. There are people and companies who are not       having their cases heard because there are no judges       around.''        Trump can make a significant gesture toward restoring a       measure of normality to the confirmation process. He should       resubmit the names of the nominees who received bipartisan       support in the Judiciary Committee but were left stranded       because of the delaying tactics of his fellow Republicans.    This article is by Paul Gordon, titled ``Gorsuch and the Senate GOP's  Alternative Universe.'' As I am reading these articles, let's not  forget the basics. The basics are that 16 seats have become open on the  Court in the history of the United States of America. Each and every  time, up until last year, the Senate acted on the nominee put forward  by the President. This is 9 of the 16. These are the nine that most  resemble the situation we had with Merrick Garland, where the vacancy  occurred before the election and the nomination occurred before the  election.   For example, with Merrick Garland, the vacancy was in February and  the nomination was in March. It is not so different from the first name  on the  [[Page S2302]]  list, William Johnson, under Jefferson, when the vacancy was in January  and the nomination was in March.   In each and every one of these cases--the cases that occurred where  the vacancy was after the election and the nomination, obviously, was  after the election as well--there were vacancies before the election  but then the President waited to nominate until after the election, and  those cases that are more like Merrick Garland, where both the vacancy  and nomination occurred beforehand. In virtually every case--well,  actually, in every case, in all 15 cases preceding the death of Antonin  Scalia, the Senate acted.   Of those 15, they confirmed 11 and they defeated 4. That brought us  to last year. As you can see on this chart, there is no action for the  first time in U.S. history. It wasn't just an alternative way of doing  things. It was a strategy to pack the Court, to try to send the  nomination into the future in the hopes that there would be a  conservative President who would nominate a conservative member of the  Court.   I think most folks who are participating in this Court-packing scheme  didn't really think it would work because it wouldn't have worked if  Democrats won the Presidency or gained control of the Senate. They were  considered at least to have a 50-50 shot at each. It was a surprise to  everyone that suddenly we were where we are, but there was no decision  even at that late date after the election that we could have had time  to vet and vote on the nominee.   There is a whole set of these nominations that occurred after the  election. It would have been totally possible after the November  election to go ahead and still at that point consider Merrick Garland.   We wouldn't be in this deep, difficult hole right now had we done so,  but we didn't. It was a deliberate strategy to pack the Court, which is  now on the verge of succeeding if we go through with the vote this week  and if the rules are changed.   If the rules aren't changed, then we will do what has been done over  the decades. If your candidate doesn't have the votes, they get  withdrawn. You change the candidate. You don't change the rules. The  rule of 60 votes to close debate is designed to ensure that there is  some bipartisan support for the nominees being put forward.   That is an important issue in terms of integrity of the Court. We  have to resolve this stolen seat. One way we can do that is to say:  Hey, we are going to put this on hold. We are going to put it on hold  until the investigation is done with the President, and we are going to  put it on hold until we have a second open seat. At that point, the  President could propose Merrick Garland for one of the seats--the first  seat where he should have been duly considered to begin with--and a  judge for the second seat that is more to his liking, off of his list,  if you will.   That would get us out of this quagmire. That would protect the  credibility of the Senate, and it would protect the legitimacy of the  Court.   This article, ``Gorsuch and the Senate GOP's Alternate Universe'' is  by Paul Gordon.         In their efforts to get the ultra-conservative Neil Gorsuch       onto the Supreme Court, Senate Republicans have moved beyond       creating ``alternative facts.'' They've created an entire       alternative universe.        If Gorsuch has earned so little bipartisan support that he       cannot get the support of 60 Senators (as all six successful       nominees of the past three presidents were able to do), Mitch       McConnell is threatening to change the Senate rules to allow       Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed by party-line majority       votes. He and his colleagues portray Judge Gorsuch as       mainstream, the absence of consultation as bipartisanship,       and themselves as victims of unprecedented and unprincipled       partisan obstruction from the Democrats. Republicans don't       want to trigger the ``nuclear option,'' they claim through       crocodile tears, but will have no choice but to do so if       those mean Democrats insist on a 60-vote threshold.        Listening to them, you'd think they were the injured party.       You'd never know that:        Republicans refused to even hold a hearing for Merrick       Garland, President Obama's nominee for this very vacancy. To       justify this unprecedented move, they claimed that it had       been decades since any president was permitted to immediately       fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.       They were careful not to mention the reason for that: It's       rare for justices to die in office, and Justice Scalia was       the only justice since 1950 to pass away during an election       year. The refusal to even consider Judge Garland for the       Supreme Court was unprecedented, a pure power play that drew       wide condemnation.        Republicans insisted on a 60-vote threshold for three of       President Obama's D.C. Circuit nominees, regardless of who       they were, and even announced their demand before any       nominations were made. They made it clear that they would       block President Obama from filling any of the three vacancies       on the 11-member court. (It was this extreme, unprecedented,       unprincipled, and anti-democratic putsch that forced the       Democrats to drop the 60-vote requirement for lower court       nominees.)        Republicans defended the 60-vote margin during the Obama       years as a safety mechanism to encourage presidents to       consult with Senators of the opposing party and select       judicial nominees with bipartisan support.        Conservatives claim that Democrats should support Gorsuch       because his nomination was a culmination of the most       transparent Supreme Court selection process in history, since       Trump listed his potential nominations before the election.        In fact, this may have been the least transparent selection       process in history, designed to lead to an extremist nominee       rather than one who could garner bipartisan support.        Trump outsourced his Supreme Court selection to two of the       most influential and well-funded right-wing ideological       organizations in the country: The Federalist Society and the       Heritage Foundation. Their selection process is the one that       matters, and it was anything but transparent. What       conversations did they have with Gorsuch that led them to       include him on their list? When Sen. Blumenthal asked Gorsuch       if he'd had any conversations about Rowe v. Wade or abortion       in general with the Heritage Foundation, Gorsuch only said       that no such conversations had occurred after the election       (long after he'd been included on the list).        We have seen transparent and bipartisan selection processes       before, and they looked nothing like what we have seen with       the current nomination. For instance, President Clinton       consulted closely with Orrin Hatch, then the ranking       Republican on the Judiciary Committee, before making his two       Supreme Court nominations. And that consultation was genuine:       Based on Sen. Hatch's advice, Clinton passed over his       original first choice, acting transparently and in a manner       to encourage bipartisanship.        Republicans can posture as a principled, wounded party,       forced to trigger the nuclear option, but that simply isn't       reality. Since the death of Justice Scalia--indeed, since the       moment President Obama took office--they have time and again       escalated their partisan approach to the selection of judges.       They held Obama circuit court nominees to a 60-vote       threshold, then refused to allow votes at all on three D.C.       Circuit vacancies regardless of who they were, and then       refused to even hold a hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.        Senate Republicans did not enter this presidency with clean       hands.        And while much of the GOP obstruction since 2009 had       nothing to do with the nominees themselves, Democrats'       opposition to Gorsuch is based on his record. Democrats have       not said that they will oppose anyone who Trump nominates. In       fact, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said       numerous times, if Gorsuch cannot earn 60 votes, the solution       is not to change the rules, but to change the nominee.        It's clear that Senate Republicans have created an       alternative universe worthy of a Star Trek episode.    The Brennan Center for Justice published an article by Ciara Torres- Spelliscy titled ``Neil Gorsuch Understands Campaign Finance--And  That's The Problem.''         It's Supreme Court prediction season with Tenth Circuit       Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to fill the late Antonin       Scalia's seat by President Trump (Or by whomever he       outsourced the job. I'm looking at you, Federalist Society       and Heritage Foundation.) Now everyone (including me) is       poring over his past decisions to see what they could mean       for the laws most in flux before the Supreme Court.        I've hunted for clues about what Gorsuch believes about       money in politics. He presides at the Tenth Circuit, which       covers Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and       Oklahoma. From a campaign finance perspective, most of the       cases come from Colorado, which has tried to improve its       campaign finance laws both through statute and by amending       its state constitution.        Various aspects of the Colorado campaign finance laws have       landed in the Tenth Circuit, which is not known for being a       particularly hospitable venue for reformers. One 2014 case       called Riddle v. Hickenlooper has a concurrence written by       Gorsuch. So what can we learn from this opinion about his       style of judging, his views of campaign finance reform, and       what he might do if he is elevated to the Supreme Court?        Riddle v. Hickenlooper involved three candidates vying for       a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives. There were       two major party candidates and one write-in candidate.       Individual contributions to the Republican and Democratic       candidates were capped at $400, while the limit for the       write-in candidate was $200. The reasoning for the law was       that major party candidates (typically) have to go through a       primary while minor and write-in candidates do not. The       write-in candidates sued, claiming that the lower cap was a       violation of contributors'  [[Page S2303]]       rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection       clause. The district court dismissed the claim, saying that       contribution restrictions were constitutional. But a three-      judge Tenth Circuit panel (consisting of two Republicans and       one Democrat) unanimously reversed the lower court, finding       that the disparities in contribution limits were, indeed, a       violation of the equal protection provision.        Gorsuch took the time to write a separate concurring       opinion. What's encouraging about Gorsuch's opinion is that       he accurately discusses complex campaign law, and this takes       time and skill. Trust me, I've read plenty of lower court       opinions in campaign finance cases where the lower court       judges . . . can't follow the ins and outs of the exceptions       to the exceptions in campaign finance law.        These details do not stump Gorsuch. He writes thoughtfully       and incisively about how the Supreme Court has been unclear       about exactly which level of scrutiny applies to equal       protection objections to differential campaign contributions.       In the end, he concludes that whether the standard is strict       scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny, the Colorado law cannot       justify allowing major party candidates to raise twice as       much as minor party candidates.        Gorsuch also deserves credit for crafting his opinion       narrowly and taking the time to note the limits of the case's       holding. As he wrote, ``[h]aving said this much, it is worth       pausing to emphasize what isn't said in these pages. Nothing       in what I've suggested or what the court holds intimates that       Colorado must adopt a per-election-cycle rather than a per-      election approach to the regulation of campaign       contributions.'' This limiting language appears to display       sensitivity to the fact that Colorado has great latitude to       choose its own means of election administration and campaign       finance. This shows judicial incrementalism and a laudable       degree of modesty.        But there are a few words from Gorsuch's opinion which       should give campaign finance reformers pause. For one, he       wrote, ``[n]o one before us disputes that the act of       contributing to political campaigns implicates a `basic       constitutional freedom,' one lying `at the foundation of a       free society' and enjoying a significant relationship to the       right to speak and associate, both expressly protected First       Amendment activities.''        In other words, Gorsuch is maintaining the link between       political money and free speech. He added, ``[t]he plaintiffs       before us don't complain that Colorado's contribution limits       violate their First Amendment rights because, say, the limits       are too low for everyone.''        This last quote is ambiguous. It is not clear whether there       is an inadvertently missing word ``they'' before ``say''       which would mean he was attributing this statement to the       plaintiffs in the case. But the way it is written sounds like       Gorsuch himself is saying that contributions are too low for       everyone. The limits at issue were $400 for major party       candidates and $200 for minor party and write-in candidates.       If this is his true belief, it would demonstrate hostility to       one of the basic pillars of campaign finance reform since       Watergate: modest contribution limits.        So the good news is Gorsuch can navigate his way through a       tangle of precedent--a basic qualification for a jurist. The       bad news is he may harbor antipathy to regulating money in       politics. If Gorsuch is elevated to the Supreme Court, he can       help conservatives move the goal post to script scrutiny so       that Colorado's and other States' attempts to temper the role       of money in politics will be far more difficult to justify in       court.    So let me return to where I started yesterday evening. We are facing  three very significant problems. The first problem is that for the  first time in history, we are considering a nominee for a stolen  Supreme Court seat. That alone should be reason for everyone who cares  about this institution to turn down this nominee and to convey to the  President that the only legitimate nominee for this open seat is  Merrick Garland, because as a Senate we have a stake in the legitimacy  of our work and that of the Court. To confirm anyone but Merrick  Garland to this seat confirms the Senate as the thief who took the seat  for the first time in U.S. history and transported it to another  President in an effort to pack the Court.   Furthermore, if there is a person confirmed to this seat other than  Merrick Garland, it will cast a shadow over every 5-to-4 decision that  individual participates in, in the years to come. It destroys the  public credibility of the position. It makes the Supreme Court simply  into a political body to which clever campaign tactics have delivered a  majority for one ideological vision over another. Let's not enter into  that position of destroying the credibility of the Senate process and  the integrity of the Court in one fell swoop.   Second of all, we should not be considering a nominee from a  President who is under investigation for conspiring with Russia to  change the outcome of an election. We don't know where those  investigations will lead, but what we do know is that this places a big  cloud over the legitimacy of him holding the office. Let's clear up  that cloud. Let's answer the questions that were raised when, a week  ago Monday, FBI Director Comey came to Capitol Hill to talk to the  House and say: Yes, those investigations are underway.   We know what the diabolical practices of the Russians were. We know  they created fake news. We know they had a team of roughly 1,000 people  sending out contrived social media messages to comment on the events of  the day, to make it look like American citizens were commenting and to  make one candidate look very good and the other candidate look very  bad.   Finally, this is an extreme nominee from the far right who does not  believe in the fundamental vision of ``we the people'' and makes  decision after decision through tortured, twisted, contrived arguments  to find for the powerful over the people. That is unacceptable.
