 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Let me be clear: House Republicans condemn the violence in Buffalo,  Uvalde, Tulsa, and Philadelphia. We stand ready to work with the  majority to directly address school safety, mental health, and the root  causes of gun violence.   Unfortunately, the bills we are considering today under the rule are  nothing more than an attempt by Democrats to try to push their antigun  agenda.   H.R. 7910 is a grab bag full of far-left proposals that will not  effectively address gun violence but will severely limit America's  Second Amendment rights.   There are a few provisions I would like to point out.   The bill raises the legal age of gun ownership to 21. This provision  is very likely unconstitutional. Even a liberal district court in  California has already determined that with regard to similar  restrictions.   This bill broadens the definition of ``frame or receiver'' that could  define multiple parts of the same gun as separate firearms. Each of  these parts would need its own distinct serial number or risk becoming  a classified ghost gun. This could turn millions of legal guns into  contraband, and law-abiding gun owners into felons.   H.R. 2377 is another reminder the Democrats fundamentally have no  respect for Second Amendment rights. It shows their lack of respect for  Fourth Amendment rights also. This bill destroys the presumption of  innocence that is the bedrock of our justice system.   It does away with the notion that an individual is innocent until  proven guilty, and instead makes anyone subject to an extreme risk  protection order guilty until proven innocent with what amounts to  another version of a red flag law.   They also want to mandate a system for gun storage in private homes,  which is unconstitutional, and almost impossible to enforce without  stripping even more rights from law-abiding citizens. Democrats are  picking and choosing legal standards to deprive citizens of their  constitutional rights based on how closely those rights are aligned  with their political agenda.   Furthermore, the universe of individuals who can petition a court for  an extreme risk protection order under this bill is far too broad, and  it creates a process that is ripe for abuse. This bill would create an  opportunity for a disgruntled ex-roommate or predatory domestic partner  to use the judicial system to harass and burden an individual by  requiring law enforcement to seize that individual's firearms and  ammunition.   Federal law already prohibits dangerous and unfit individuals from  purchasing or possessing firearms. An individual with a misdemeanor  domestic  [[Page H5350]]  violence conviction, an individual involuntarily committed to a mental  institution or adjudicated mentally defective, or an individual who is  an unlawful user of controlled substances are all prohibited from  possessing or purchasing a firearm under current law.   Democrats rejected an amendment that will allow for transfers of a  firearm to a victim of domestic violence for self-defense. Under this  bill, a friend or neighbor trying to help a victim would be charged  with gun trafficking.   These bills are not about public safety, they are about the left's  antigun agenda.   During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of this bill, the  chairman of the committee conceded that the strict gun laws in liberal  jurisdictions don't work because criminals are able to obtain guns  elsewhere illegally. A Member from Tennessee on that committee admitted  that the Democrats' bills will make it harder for law-abiding Americans  to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Another Member, one from New  York, threatened to abolish the filibuster and pack the Supreme Court  if any of our Nation's checks and balances stood in the way of the  Democrats' agenda to trample the Second Amendment.   The majority will argue that these are commonsense proposals, but  they fail to explain the details and the real effects of these  provisions.   And what are law-abiding gun owners concerned about? They are  concerned about the attack on their constitutional rights provided in  the Second Amendment.   All of us recognize the recent tragedies, and our heart goes out to  the parents, the families, and communities, but the root causes must be  addressed. Simply attacking law-abiding gun owners will not solve the  problem. Addressing the causes will.   House Republicans stand ready to address the root causes of these  senseless acts of violence, but not at the cost of America's  constitutional rights.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I ask Members to do the same. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to make a couple of comments. The  gentleman from Massachusetts, with all due respect, mentioned other  countries. I will just point out that other countries don't have the  freedoms and don't live the way we do in our great democracy or  Republic, whichever, and they don't have the constitutional rights that  we have under the Second Amendment.   Our citizens ask to have that Constitution respected, and I don't  believe I used the word ``inconvenient'' at all. What I used are the  words, ``trampling our constitutional rights,'' and that is what I  think is important here, that we do not talk about the gentleman from  Massachusetts mentioning these inconvenient things. I am talking about  our citizens' constitutional rights under the Second Amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately consider the Prosecutors Need to  Prosecute Act, legislation authored by Representatives Malliotakis and  Tiffany that ensures accountability for those charged with keeping our  streets, our schools, and our communities safe.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment along with extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote  on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, while my colleagues in the majority  believe that the best approach to addressing violence is to strip away  American's constitutional rights, Republicans stand with parents and  communities in ensuring those who commit crimes are prosecuted to the  fullest extent of the law. And those who don't, will be held  accountable. Just last night, families in San Francisco ousted their  district attorney for failing to keep their streets free from  criminals.   Americans are fed up with liberal prosecutors letting criminals run  rampant for the sake of woke idealism. This legislation will ensure the  Department of Justice and the American public have the data and  information necessary to hold those responsible for keeping our streets  safe accountable.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Malliotakis) to further explain this amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to  the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H5357]]    My colleague from Massachusetts continues to use his talking points  and mentions the gun lobby, and I want to point out that I hear from  many of my constituents who are law-abiding gun owners and who are  extremely concerned and oppose this bill.   As a matter of fact, I met with a group of students from my district  this morning who oppose this legislation. Even students know that this  bill will do nothing to stop gun violence, but they do understand it  will trample Second Amendment rights.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we already have gun laws in this country and yet those  laws continue to be broken. If Democrats want to talk about common  sense, how about we talk about enforcing the laws that already exist.   Communities across the country are making it clear that they want  people who commit crimes to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the  law; yet, liberal prosecutors are letting criminals go free with  minimal punishment. This is not woke. This is dangerous.   Criminals need to be held accountable for their actions, and that is  why we offered the PQ we did.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, why are we here debating legislation we know will  never become law, and when there are--completely separate from this  proposal--bipartisan efforts going on in the Senate? We know this is  not a genuine effort by the Democrats as they went right to extremes of  what they know will divide this country, and would not work with  Republicans or accept any of the reasonable amendments that were put  forward in committee.   This is a political ploy being put on by the Democrats for them to  use as talking points, and it is at the expense of a tragedy and the  heartache of so many across this country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, these bills are not about keeping kids and communities  safe from violent criminals, they are about furthering a blanket anti- gun agenda. This is one-size-fits-all gun restriction legislation that  would punish law-abiding gun owners and fail to improve public safety.  My colleagues on the left know it.   This was not a bipartisan effort and these bills will never make it  through the Senate. With very real problems to solve, why are Democrats  wasting precious time on something that will never make it into law? If  Democrats were serious about addressing gun violence, they would engage  in meaningful conversation about public safety instead of this agenda- driven political theater.   The sad fact is that the Democrats' approach demonstrates that these  bills and the issue of gun violence on the whole are nothing more than  political talking points in an election year. This is designed to  advance the radical Democrat base that believes no private citizen  should ever be able to own a gun.   They should be ashamed of themselves for putting us through this  political show rather than working with Republicans on a bipartisan  solution to gun violence.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule and I ask Members to do the same. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
