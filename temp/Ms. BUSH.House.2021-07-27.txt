 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of our  amendments to H.R. 4502.   Our first amendment provides $5 million more to support healthcare  services, COVID-19 testing and vaccines, behavioral health services,  and preventative care for our unhoused communities. As a nurse and  someone who has been unhoused, I have both lived and witnessed the  traumatic realities of inaccessible healthcare. This funding will save  lives.   My second amendment reduces funding for fossil energy and carbon  management by $4 million and adds $3 million for energy efficiency and  renewable energy. Environmental justice leaders are demanding that we  stop subsidizing supposedly advanced technologies that keep fossil  fuels burning in our communities, and build public renewable energy  instead.   Our third amendment supports $100 million in a new pilot funding for  mental health crisis response by directing the GAO to study health- based, nonpunative, and noncarceral approaches to public safety.
