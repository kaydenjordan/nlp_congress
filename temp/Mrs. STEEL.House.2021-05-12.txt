 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize National Police  Week.   Our police officers put their lives on the line every single day they  go to work. They answer the call of duty on holidays, weekends,  birthdays, and through the COVID-19 pandemic to selflessly protect our  communities.   When I was chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, I  introduced a resolution to recognize Law Enforcement Appreciation Day  in Orange County because now, more than ever, we owe these brave  officers our support and appreciation.   I am especially grateful for our Capitol Police officers who have  been through so much this year with the devastating loss of multiple  officers in the line of duty.   Thank you to all police officers for your continued bravery. I and so  many others are proud to stand with you today and every day.                            ____________________
