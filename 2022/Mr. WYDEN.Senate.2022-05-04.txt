 Madam President, this Congress and the Clean Energy for  America legislation, which passed the Senate Finance Committee, is the  best opportunity in the past decade for bold action that deals not just  with the threat of climate change but gives us a chance to get those  big investments here in the United States with domestic manufacturing  and good jobs--an economic win-win.   Our country should be doing everything possible to invest in a  technology-neutral, private-sector-driven approach to promote a clean  energy future, including investing in renewable energy projects,  including the manufacturing of solar, wind, and other technologies here  at home.   Further, I would note that our country has a clear prohibition on  products made with forced labor that is restricting and will continue  to restrict renewable energy products produced with forced labor in  China from entering the United States.   My friend, whom I always like working with, introduces a new, vague  restriction that would unfortunately tie our hands, limit our  businesses' ability to source necessary materials for their products  with vague and overly broad restrictions.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion.                                Vote on Motion     Madam President, I speak today to honor the memory of an  esteemed and beloved Oregonian who spent his life bettering our State.  On March 13, Oregon lost its most devoted citizen and advocate: Gerry  Frank.   Gerry's life and service to Oregon has inspired so many to learn,  laugh about, and love what makes Oregon so special: our State's jaw- dropping beauty, our unique independence, and our incredible capacity  to land on our feet. And Gerry has always done it in his own special  way. No one I know has managed to do as much good as Gerry Frank with a  simple piece of chocolate cake.   Gerry was a true renaissance man. A graduate of both Lincoln High in  Portland and Cambridge in the U.K., he made his mark as a successful  haberdasher, restauranteur, politician, and World War II veteran. But  we all knew his true loves: Oregon and a great piece of cake. Gerry  used the best chocolate cake in the world to bring us together at the  State fair, a contest he selflessly judged annually for 60 years. He  kept a terrific restaurant and retailer called Gerry Frank's Konditorei  which paired delicious Oregon food with that cake. And he went to bat  for Oregon community organizations of every size and shape, saying,  ``How much cake do you need to give a good cause a boost?''   After the family business of Meier & Frank was sold in 1965, Gerry  turned to politics, joining Senator Mark Hatfield's office. Gerry's  politics were always pretty simple. He would ask, ``Is that idea fair?  Does it make sense? And is it a part of Oregon's long tradition of  welcoming fresh approaches to tackling big challenges?'' For almost 20  years Gerry worked as Mark Hatfield's chief of staff, gaining the  nickname ``Oregon's Third Senator,'' for his dogged work ethic and  devotion to Oregonians. Gerry is an incredible testament to what we  call back home the Oregon Way: where we put aside partisan leanings to  get things done for our State.   After leaving politics, Gerry followed his passion for meeting new  people and seeing new places. A talented writer, he was the travel  columnist at the Oregonian newspaper for many years and published  multiple books, including one of my personal favorites: ``Gerry Frank's  Oregon.''   Gerry, a man of many talents and passions, never forgot about his  home in Salem. Despite travelling to over 150 countries, he always  returned home in time for some of Oregon's beloved traditions,  including the State fair and the Rose Festival. In 2019 the Gerry Frank  Salem Rotary Amphitheater was built in his name, just another testament  to the impact Gerry had on his community as a lifelong Rotarian and  lover of live music. And soon, Providence Health in Portland will  complete the Gerry Frank Center for Children's Care in his memory.   The State of Oregon will not forget Gerry Frank, and neither will I.  While his passing brings us sadness, it also bring us gratitude for his  tireless work to make Oregon a better place to call home. I honor the  illustrious life of Gerry Frank and unforgettable legacy he left in our  State for generations to come.                            ____________________
