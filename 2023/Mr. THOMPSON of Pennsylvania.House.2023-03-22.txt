 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the thousands of Pennsylvania youth who participate in 4-H  and celebrate Pennsylvania 4-H Week, March 12 through March 18.   Last week, counties across the Commonwealth, including McKean and  Jefferson in Pennsylvania 15, celebrated the youth development program  and the important role that it plays in our communities.   4-H is the well-known educational youth development program of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture administered in Pennsylvania by Penn  State Extension. It is the largest youth organization in the State,  with over 77,000 members from each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties.   In celebration of local 4-H clubs, Jefferson County youth were  invited to Brookville's Penn State Extension office for 4-H-related  goodies and program information.   McKean County youth promoted their 4-H clubs by decorating window  displays in local storefronts, and they also held their annual 4-H  benefit dinner and auction.   4-H provides a continuing service to Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District, the Commonwealth, and the Nation, and I commend  the thousands of youth and adult volunteers who comprise this  outstanding program for their club, community, country, and world.                            ____________________
