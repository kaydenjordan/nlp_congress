The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                    Recess     Mr. President, as I understand it, there are discussions  underway, and so I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess until  12:30 p.m.   There being no objection, at 11:43 a.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 12:32 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the President pro tempore.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. Castor.   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. May I be recognized?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, you are. You are recognized.                                 Stipulation    Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Senators, Donald John Trump, by his counsel, is  prepared to stipulate that if Representative Herrera Beutler were to  testify under oath as part of these proceedings, her testimony would be  consistent with the statement she issued on February 12, 2021, and the  former President's counsel is agreeable to the admission of that public  statement into evidence at this time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you, Mr. Castor.   Mr. Raskin.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   The managers are prepared to enter into the agreement. I will now  read the statement. This is the statement of Congresswoman Jaime  Herrera Beutler, February 12, 2021:         In my January 12 statement in support of the article of       impeachment, I referenced a conversation House Minority       Leader Kevin McCarthy relayed to me that he had with       President Trump while the January 6 attack was ongoing. Here       are the details:        When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6       and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot,       the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was       antifa that had breached the Capitol. McCarthy refuted that       and told the president that these were Trump supporters.       That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said:       ``Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the       election than you are.''        Since I publicly announced my decision to vote for       impeachment, I have shared these details in countless       conversations with constituents and colleagues, and multiple       times through the media and other public forums.        I told it to the Daily News of Longview on January 17. I've       shared it with local county Republican executive board       members, as well as other constituents who asked me to       explain my vote. I shared it with thousands of residents on       my telephone town hall on February 8.    Mr. President, I now move that the Senate admit the statement into  evidence.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   Without objection, the statement will be admitted into evidence.   And does either party wish to make any further motions related to  witnesses or documents at this time?   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President, the President's counsel have no  further motions.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Raskin.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. And, Mr. President, we have no further motions  either.                            Admission of Evidence    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Then the Chair would note that neither  party wishes to make further motions under section 6 of S. Res. 47.  Therefore,  [[Page S720]]  the next question is on admission of the evidence submitted by both  parties pursuant to section 8 of the resolution   The majority leader is recognized.    Mr. President, so now as we move to another matter, I am  advised that the House managers have no objection to the admission of  evidence proposed to be admitted by the former President's counsel  under the provisions of section 8 of S. Res. 47 and that the  President's counsel have no objections to the evidence proposed to be  admitted into evidence by the House managers.   Pursuant to section 8 of the resolution, as agreed to by Leader  McConnell and myself a few days ago, both parties have made timely  filings of this evidence with the Secretary of the Senate and have  provided copies to each other. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that  the Senate dispense with the provisions of section 8(a) of S. Res. 47;  and that the materials submitted by both parties be admitted into  evidence subject to the provisions of section 8(c) of that resolution,  which provides that the admission of this evidence does not constitute  a concession by either party as to the truth of the matters asserted by  the other party; and that each Senator shall decide for him or herself  the weight to be given such evidence. This request has the approval of  both parties and the Republican leader.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                              Closing Arguments    Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, the Senate has provided for  up to 4 hours in closing arguments. They will be equally divided  between the managers on the part of the House of Representatives and  the counsel for the former President. And pursuant to rule XXII of the  Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on  Impeachment Trials, the argument shall be opened and closed on the part  of the House of Representatives.   The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Raskin to begin the presentation on  the part of the House of Representatives.   Mr. Raskin, under rule XXII, you may reserve time if you wish.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.   Members of the Senate, before I proceed, it was suggested by defense  counsel that Donald Trump's conduct during the attack, as described in  Congresswoman Beutler's statement, is somehow not part of the  constitutional offense for which former President Trump has been  charged. I want to reject that falsehood and that fallacy immediately.   After he knew that violence was underway at the Capitol, President  Trump took actions that further incited the insurgence to be more  inflamed and to take even more extreme, selective, and focused action  against Vice President Mike Pence.   Former President Trump also, as described by Congresswoman Beutler's  notes, refused requests to publicly, immediately, and forcefully call  off the riots. And when he was told that the insurgents inside the  Capitol were Trump supporters, the President said:         Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the       election than you are.    Think about that for a second. This uncontradicted statement that has  just been stipulated as part of the evidentiary record, the President  said:         Well, Kevin, I guess these people--    Meaning the mobsters, the insurrectionists--         are more upset about the election than you are.    That conduct is obviously part and parcel of the constitutional  offense that he was impeached for; namely, incitement to insurrection;  that is, continuing incitement to the insurrection. The conduct  described not only perpetuated his continuing offense but also provides  to us here, today, further decisive evidence of his intent to incite  the insurrection in the first place.   When my opposing counsel says that you should ignore the President's  actions after the insurrection began, that is plainly wrong, and it, of  course, reflects the fact that they have no defense to his outrageous,  scandalous, and unconstitutional conduct in the middle of a violent  assault on the Capitol that he incited.   Senators, think about it for a second. Say you light a fire, and you  are charged with arson. And the defense counsel says: Everything I did  after the fire started is irrelevant. And the court would reject that  immediately and say: That is not true at all. It is extremely relevant  to whether or not you committed the crime. If you run over and try to  put out the flames, if you get lots of water and say, ``Help, help,  there is a fire,'' and you call for help, a court will infer that-- could infer that you didn't intend for the fire to be lit in the first  place. They would accept your defense, perhaps, that it was all an  accident. It was all an accident. Accidents happen with fire. But if,  on the other hand, when the fire erupts, you go and you pour more fuel  on it, you stand by and you watch it, gleefully, any reasonable person  will infer that you not only intended the fire to start but that once  it got started and began to spread, you intended to continue to keep  the fire going. And that is exactly where we are, my friends.   Of course, your conduct, while a crime is ongoing, is relevant to  your culpability, both to the continuation of the offense but also  directly relevant, directly illuminating to what your purpose was  originally; what was your intent?   And any court in the land would laugh out any--would laugh out of  court any criminal defendant who said: What I did after I allegedly  killed that person is irrelevant to whether or not I intended to kill  them. I mean, come on.   Donald Trump's refusal not only to send help but also to continue to  further incite the insurgence against his own Vice President--his own  Vice President--provides further decisive evidence of both his intent  to start this violent insurrection and his continued incitement once  the attack had begun to override the Capitol.   All right. Senators, that was in response to this new evidentiary  particle that came in.                         Managers' Closing Arguments    But in my closing, I want to thank you for your remarkable attention  and your seriousness of purpose befitting your office.   We have offered you overwhelming and irrefutable and certainly  unrefuted evidence that former President Trump incited this  insurrection against us.   To quote the statement Representative Liz Cheney made in January:         On January 6, 2021, a violent mob attacked the United       States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and       stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This       insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most       sacred space in our Republic.    She continued--Representative Cheney continued:         Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but       what we know now is enough. The President of the United       States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the       flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.       None of this would have happened without the President. The       President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to       stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater       betrayal by the President of the United States of his office       and his oath to the Constitution.        I will vote to impeach the President.    Representative Cheney was right. She based her vote on the facts, on  the evidence, and on the Constitution. And the evidence--video,  documentary, eyewitness--has only grown stronger and stronger and more  detailed right up to today, right up to 10 minutes ago, over the course  of this Senate trial.   And I have no doubt that you all noticed that, despite the various  propaganda reels and so on, President Trump's lawyers have said almost  nothing to contest or overcome the actual evidence of former President  Trump's conduct that we presented, much less have they brought their  client forward to tell us his side of the story.   We sent him a letter last week, which they rejected out of hand. The  former President of the United States refused to come and tell us. And  I ask any of you: If you were charged with inciting violent  insurrection against our country and you were falsely accused, would  you come and testify? I know I would. I would be there at 7 in the  morning waiting for the doors to open. I am sure that is true of 100  Senators in this room. I hope it is true of 100 Senators in this room.   The Senate was lectured several times yesterday about cancel culture.  Well, not even 2 weeks ago the President's most reliable supporters in  the House--I am sorry; not the President.  [[Page S721]]  The former President's most reliable supporters in the House tried to  cancel out Representative Cheney because of her courageous and  patriotic defense of the Republic and the truth and the Constitution.   They tried to strip her of her leading role as chair of the House  Republican Conference. But, you know what--I hope everybody takes a  second to reflect on this--the conference rejected this plainly  retaliatory and cowardly attempt to punish her for telling the truth to  her constituents and her country in voting for impeachment.   Who says you can't stand up against bullies? Who says? In my mind,  Liz Cheney is a hero for standing up for the truth and resisting this  retaliatory cancel culture that she was subjected to. But she beat them  on a vote of 145 to 61, more than a 2-to-1 vote.   You know, Ben Franklin, a great champion of the Enlightenment, an  enemy of political fanaticism and cowardice, and, of course, another  great Philadelphian, once wrote this: I have observed that wrong is  always growing more wrong until there is no bearing it anymore and that  right, however opposed, comes right at last.   Comes right at last. Think about that. This is America, home of the  brave, land of the free--the America of Ben Franklin, who said:         If you make yourself a sheep, the wolves will eat you.    Don't make yourself a sheep. The wolves will eat you.   The America of Thomas Jefferson, who said at another difficult  moment:         A little patience, and we shall see the reign of witches       pass over, their spirits dissolve, and the people, recovering       their true sight, restore their government to its true       principles.    The America of Tom Paine, who said:         The mind once enlightened cannot again become dark.    Now, we showed you hour after hour of realtime evidence demonstrating  every step of Donald Trump's constitutional crime. We showed you how he  indoctrinated the mob with his Orwellian propaganda about how the  election he lost by more than 7 million votes and 306 to 232 in the  electoral college--which he had described as a landslide when he won by  the exact same margin in 2016--was actually a landslide victory for him  being stolen away by a bipartisan conspiracy and fraud and corruption.   We showed you how 61 courts and 88 judges--Federal, State, local,  trial, appellate--from the lowest courts in the land to the United  States Supreme Court across the street and 8 Federal judges he himself  named to the bench, all found no basis in fact or law for his  outlandish and deranged inventions and concoctions about the election.   In the meantime, President Trump tried to bully State-level officials  to commit a fraud on the public by literally ``finding'' votes. We  examined the case study of Georgia, where he called to threaten  Republican Brad Raffensperger to find him 11,780 votes. That is all he  wanted, he said, 11,780 votes--don't we all--11,780 votes, that is all  he wanted to nullify Biden's victory and to win the election.   Raffensperger ended up with savage death threats against him and his  family, telling him he deserved a firing squad. Another election  official urged Trump to cut it out or people would get hurt and killed,  a prescient warning indeed. Raffensperger ended up saying that he and  his family supported Donald Trump, gave him money, and now Trump  ``threw us under the bus.''   We saw what happened in Lansing, MI, with the extremist mob he  cultivated, which led to two shocking Capitol sieges and a  criminal conspiracy by extremists to kidnap and likely assassinate  Governor Whitmer.    We saw him trying to get State legislatures to disavow and overthrow  their popular election results and replace them with Trump electors. We  showed you the process of summoning the mob, reaching out, urging  people to come to Washington for a ``wild'' time.   As we celebrate Presidents Day on Monday, think, imagine: Is there  another President in our history who would urge supporters to come to  Washington for a ``wild'' time?   You saw how he embraced the violent extremist elements like the Proud  Boys, who were told in a nationally televised Presidential candidate  debate to ``stand back and stand by,'' which became their official  slogan as they converged on Washington with other extremist and  seditious groups and competed to be the lead storm troopers of the  attack on this building.   You saw the assembly of the mob on January 6. And how beautiful that  angry mob must have looked to Donald Trump as he peered down from the  lectern with the seal of the President of the United States of America  emblazoned on it.   That crowd was filled with extremists in tactical gear, armed to the  teeth and ready to fight, and other brawling MAGA supporters, all of  them saying: Stop the steal right now. And he said he was going to  march with them to the Capitol, even though the permit for the rally  specifically forbade a march. But he said he would march with them,  giving them more comfort that what they were doing was legitimate, it  was OK.   But, of course, he stayed back, as he presumably didn't want to be  too close to the action at the Capitol, as the lawyers called it--not  an insurrection, they urged us yesterday; it is an action. He didn't  want to be too close to the action when all hell was about to break  loose.   Now, incitement, as we have discussed, requires an inherently fact- based evidentiary inquiry, and this is what we did. We gave you many  hours of specific, factual details about, to use Congresswoman Cheney's  words, how the President summoned the mob, assembled the mob, incited  it, lit the match, sending them off to the Capitol where they thought,  as they yelled out, that they had been invited by the President of the  United States.   And then, of course, they unleashed unparalleled violence against our  overwhelmed and besieged but heroic police officers, who you  thoughtfully honored yesterday, when the officers got in their way as  they entered the Capitol at the behest of the President of the United  States to stop the steal.   Now, I am convinced most Senators must be convinced by this  overwhelming and specific detail, because most Americans are. But say  you still have your doubts; you think the President really thought that  he was sending his followers to participate in a peaceful, nonviolent  rally, the kind that might have been organized by Julian Bond, who my  distinguished opposing counsel brought up; Ella Baker; Bob Moses; our  late, beloved colleague John Lewis, for the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee.   Maybe the President really thought this was going to be like the  March on Washington organized by Bayard Rustin and Dr. Martin Luther  King, who said:         Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial moral and       political questions of our time.    So let's say you are still flirting with the idea that Donald Trump's  conduct was totally appropriate, as he proclaimed right off the bat,  and he is the innocent victim of a mass accident or catastrophe, like a  fire or a flood--as we were invited to frame it on our opening day by  distinguished cocounsel or opposing counsel--and you think maybe we are  just looking for somebody to blame for this nightmare and catastrophe  that has befallen the Republic. We are just looking for someone to  blame.   Well, here is the key question, then, in resolving your doubts if you  are in that category: How did Donald Trump react when he learned of the  violent storming of the Capitol and the threats to Senators, Members of  the House, and his own Vice President, as well as the images he saw on  TV of the pummeling and beating and harassment of our police officers?   Did he spring into action to stop the violence and save us? Did he  even wonder about his own security since an out-of-control, anti- government mob could come after him too? Did he quickly try to get in  touch with or denounce the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the rally  organizers, the Save America rally organizers, and everyone on the  extreme right to tell them that this was not what he had in mind, it  was a big mistake, call it off, call it off, call it off--as  Representative Gallagher begged him to do on national television?   No. He delighted in it. He reveled in it. He exalted in it. He could  not understand why the people around him did not share his delight.   And then a long period of silence ensued while the mob beat the  daylights  [[Page S722]]  out of police officers and invaded this building, as you saw on  security footage, and proceeded to hunt down Vice President Mike Pence  as a traitor and denounced and cursed Speaker Pelosi, both of whom you  heard mob members say that they wanted to kill. They were both in real  danger, and our government could have been thrown into absolute turmoil  without the heroism of our officers and the bravery and courage of a  lot of people in this room.   Here is what Republican Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio said.  He is a former pro football player:         We are imploring the president to help, to stand up, to       help defend the U.S. Capitol and the United States Congress,       which was under attack. We are begging, essentially, and he       was nowhere to be found.    ``Nowhere to be found.'' And as I have emphasized this morning, that  dereliction of duty, that desertion of duty was central to his  incitement of insurrection and inextricable from it--inextricable,  bound together. It reveals his state of mind that day, what he was  thinking as he provoked the mob to violence and further violence. It  shows how he perpetuated his continuing offense on January 6, his  course of conduct charged in the Article of Impeachment as he further  incited the mob during the attack, aiming it at Vice President Mike  Pence himself, while failing to quell it in either of his roles as  Commander in Chief or his real role that day: ``inciter in chief.''   And it powerfully demonstrates that the ex-President knew, of course,  that violence was foreseeable, that it was predictable and predicted  that day since he was not surprised and not horrified. No. He was  delighted. And through his acts of omission and commission that day, he  abused his office by siding with the insurrectionists at almost every  point, rather than with the Congress of the United States, rather than  with the Constitution.   In just a moment, my colleague Mr. Cicilline will address President  Trump's conduct, his actions and inactions, his culpable state of mind  during the attack, as he will establish yesterday's explosive  revelations about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's desperate call  to Trump--and Trump's truly astounding reaction--confirming that Trump  was doing nothing to help the people in this room or this building.   It is now clear beyond a doubt that Trump supported the actions of  the mob, and so he must be convicted. It is that simple.   When he took the stage on January 6, he knew exactly how combustible  the situation was. He knew there were many people in the crowd who were  ready to jump into action, to engage in violence at any signal that he  needed them to fight like hell to stop the steal. And that is exactly  what he told them to do.   Then he aimed them straight here, right down Pennsylvania, at the  Capitol, where he told them the steal was occurring; that is, the  counting of the electoral college votes. And we all know what happened  next. They attacked this building. They disrupted the peaceful transfer  of power. They injured and killed people, convinced that they were  acting on his instructions and with his approval and protection.   And while that happened, he further incited them while failing to  defend us. If that is not ground for conviction, if that is not a high  crime and misdemeanor against the Republic and the United States of  America, then nothing is.   President Trump must be convicted for the safety and security of our  democracy and our people.   Mr. Cicilline.   Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, as we  have demonstrated, there is overwhelming evidence that President Trump  incited the violence and knew violence was foreseeable on January 6. He  knew that many in the crowd were posed for violence at his urging and,  in fact, many in the sea of thousands in the crowd were wearing body  armor and helmets and holding sticks and flagpoles. And then he not  only provoked that very same crowd but aimed them at the Capitol. He  literally pointed at this building, at us, during his speech. He  pointed to the building where Congress was going to certify the  election results and where he knew the Vice President himself was  presiding over the process.   No one is suggesting that President Trump intended every detail of  what happened on January 6, but when he directed the sea of thousands  before him--who, reportedly, were ready to engage in real violence-- when he told that crowd to fight like hell, he incited violence  targeted at the Capitol, and he most certainly foresaw it. My  colleague, Manager Dean, will stand up after and walk you through the  overwhelming evidence that supports those claims.   I want to start, though, by talking about what happened after that.  There was a lot of discussion yesterday about what the President knew  and when he knew it. There are certain things that we do not know about  what the President did that day, because the President--that is, former  President Trump--has remained silent about what he was doing during one  of the bloodiest attacks on our Capitol since 1812.   Despite a full and fair opportunity to come forward, he has refused  to come and tell his story. As Manager Raskin said, we would all do  that. In fact, I would insist on it. If I were accused of a grave and  serious crime that I was innocent of, I would demand the right to tell  my side of the story. President Trump declined.   But there are certain facts that are undisputed, that we know to be  true despite the President's refusal to testify; which is, counsel  either ignored entirely or didn't and couldn't dispute.   Before I go to those facts, let me quickly just touch on a few  things. First, President Trump and his counsel have resorted to  arguments that the evidence presented was somehow manufactured or  hidden from them. I want to be very clear about this because this is  important. In terms of the timing of when they received the materials  here, defense counsel had access to all materials when they were  entitled to have them under S. Res. 47, and they cannot and have not  alleged otherwise.   As to their desperate claim that evidence was somehow manufactured,  they have not alleged that one tweet from their client was actually  inaccurate--nor can they. We got these tweets--which are, of course,  statements from the former President--from a public archive, and they  are all correct.   We also know the President's claims about evidence being manipulated  also are untrue because they didn't even object to the introduction of  the evidence when they had the opportunity to do so. So I hope we can  now set those issues aside and turn to the facts of this case and  really set the record straight about the undisputed facts in this case,  about what the President knew that day and when he knew it.   At the outset, let me say this. As you may recall, in direct response  to a question yesterday, President Trump's counsel stated, and I quote:         At no point was the President informed the Vice President       was in any danger.    As we walk through these undisputed facts, you will see, quite  clearly, that is simply not true.   As you can see here, from just after 12 p.m. to just before 2 p.m.,  President Trump delivered his statements at the rally, which incited an  initial wave of protesters coming down to the Capitol, and his speech  was still ongoing, and you saw the evidence of people broadcasting that  on their phones.   He finished his speech at 11:11 p.m., at which point a much larger  wave surged toward us here at the Capitol, ripping down scaffolding and  triggering calls for law enforcement assistance.   Thirty minutes later, at 1:49 p.m., as the violence intensified,  President Trump tweeted a video of his remarks at the rally with the  caption:         Our country has had enough, we will not take it anymore,       and that's what this is all about.    During the half-hour following that tweet, the situation here  drastically deteriorated. Insurrectionists breached the Capitol  barriers, then its steps, then the complex itself.   By 2:12, the insurrectionist mob had overwhelmed the police and  started their violent attack on the Capitol.   And as you all know, this attack occurred and played out on live  television. Every major network was showing it. We have shown you,  during the course of this trial, side-by-side exactly what the  President would have seen on TV or his Twitter account.  [[Page S723]]    We have also shown you that he would have seen around 2:12 p.m.  images of Vice President Pence being rushed off the Senate floor. I  won't replay all of that for you, but for timing purposes, here is the  footage reacting to Vice President Pence leaving the floor.   (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. No audio. They just cut out. It       looks--and sometimes the Senate.        Unidentified Speaker. It seemed like they just ushered Mike       Pence out really quickly.        Unidentified Speaker. Yes, they did. That is exactly what       just happened there.        Unidentified Speaker. They ushered Mike Pence out. They       moved him fast. There was--I saw the motions too.    Defense counsel seems to suggest that somehow the President of the  United States was not aware of this; that the President had no idea  that his Vice President had been evacuated from the Senate floor for  his safety because violent rioters had broken into the Capitol with  thousands more coming and with the Capitol Police completely  overwhelmed.    This was on live television.   So defense counsel is suggesting that the President of the United  States knew less about this than the American people--this is just not  possible--that the Secret Service failed to mention that his Vice  President was being rushed from the Senate for his own protection, but  nobody in the White House thought to alert him; that none of our law  enforcement agencies raised a concern to the Commander in Chief that  the Vice President was being evacuated from the Senate floor as a  violent mob assaulted the Capitol. It simply cannot be. And with each  passing minute on the timeline of events on January 6, it grows more  and more inconceivable.   Let's continue forward in time.   Between 2:12 to 2:24, the Senate recessed. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was  ushered off the floor. The Capitol Police announced a breach and a  lockdown, and the insurrectionist mob began chanting: ``Hang Mike  Pence.'' And it was unfolding on live TV in front of the entire world.   So, again, let me ask you: Does it strike you as credible that  nobody, not a single person, informed the President that his Vice  President had been evacuated or that the President didn't glance at the  television or his Twitter account and learn about the events that were  happening?   Remember, this was the day of the electoral college. Remember his  obsession with stopping the certification. It is just not credible that  the President at no point knew his Vice President was in this building  and was in real danger.   Senators, I submit to you these facts, this timeline is undisputed.  At 2:24 p.m., after rioters breached the barriers, after calls for  assistance, after rioters stormed the building, after Vice President  Pence was rushed from the Senate floor, and just before Vice President  Pence was further evacuated for his safety, President Trump decided to  attack his own Vice President on Twitter.   The undisputed facts confirmed that not only must President Trump  have been aware of the Vice President's danger but he still sent out a  tweet attacking him, further inciting the very mob that was in just a  few feet of him, inside of this very building.   The Vice President was there with his family, who was in danger for  his life. They were chanting, ``Hang Mike Pence,'' and had erected a  noose outside.   And as we have shown, the mob responded to President Trump's attack  instantly. The tweet was read allowed on a bullhorn, if you remember  that video. Insurrectionists began chanting again about Mike Pence.   And in those critical moments, we see President Trump engaging in a  dereliction of his duty by further inciting the mob, in real-time, to  target the Vice President, with knowledge that the insurrection was  ongoing. And that is, of course, included in the conduct charged in  this Article of Impeachment.   The former President's counsel's suggestion otherwise is completely  wrong. His further incitement is impeachable conduct that continued  during the course of this assault itself, and it is part of a  constitutional crime and was entirely and completely a part of his  indefensible failure to attack the Congress.   There has been some confusion as to the phone call I referenced with  Senator Lee. So I want to be clear about certain facts that are not in  dispute. First, Senator Lee has confirmed that the call occurred at  2:26 p.m. So I added that to the timeline above.   Remember, by this phone call, the Vice President has just been  evacuated on live television for his own safety. And Donald Trump had,  after that, tweeted an attack on him, which the insurgents read on a  bullhorn. And a few minutes after Donald Trump's tweet, he didn't reach  out to check on the Vice President's safety. (Text deleted.) The call  was interrupted. Senator Tuberville has since explained, and I quote:         I looked at the phone and it said the White House on it,       [and] I said hello, the President said a few words. I said       ``Mr. President they're taking the Vice President out and       they want me to get off the phone and I've got to go.''    That was his second evacuation that day. A minute later, live feeds  documented the insurgents chanting:         Mike Pence is a traitor.    At this point, even if somehow he had missed it earlier, it is  inconceivable that the President--the former President--was unaware  that the Vice President was in danger. And what does the President do  after hearing that? Does he rush to secure the Capitol? Does he do  anything to quell the mob? Does he call his Vice President to check on  his safety? We all know the answers to those questions too. There can  be no dispute. He took none of those steps, not a single one.   Even after learning that Senators were being evacuated and that Vice  President Pence had also been evacuated, he did nothing to help the  Vice President.   And here is some more evidence that we have since learned. At some  point over the following 30 minutes, President Trump spoke to Minority  Leader Kevin McCarthy. And as Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler has  revealed--evidence that now has been stipulated as part of the  evidentiary record--in that conversation, Kevin McCarthy is pleading  with the former President to do something. He first tries to assign the  blame to another group, and Leader McCarthy says: No, these are your  supporters, Mr. President.   What does the President say in response? Not ``I'll send people right  away; I didn't realize you were in danger.'' He says:         Well, Kevin--    And I quote. I quote:       Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the       election than you are.        I guess these people are more upset about the election than       you are.    The President, just as he conveyed in that tweet at 6:01, was  essentially saying: You got what you deserve. Let me say that again.  Not only was the President fully aware of the Vice President's  situation and the situation that we were all in, when he was asked for  help, when he was asked to defend the Capitol less than 30 minutes  after inciting this violence against his own Vice President, President  Trump refused that request for assistance, and he told us why--his  singular focus: stopping the certification of the election of his  opponent.    He incited the violence to stop the certification. He attacked the  Vice President and further incited the insurrection to pressure the  Vice President to stop the certification of the election. He called  Senator Tuberville to stop the certification, and he refused to send  help to Congress. This Congress and the Vice President of the United  States were in mortal danger because he wanted to stop the  certification. He did these things--attacking the Vice President,  calling Senator Tuberville, refusing Senator McCarthy's request--with  full knowledge of the violent attack that was underway at that point.  He chose retaining his own power over the safety of Americans. I can't  imagine more damning evidence of his state of mind.   The call ended with a screaming match interrupted by violent rioters  breaking through the windows of Representative McCarthy's office.   Senators, the President knew this was happening. He didn't do  anything to help his Vice President or any of you or any of the brave  officers and other employees serving the American people that day. His  sole focus was stealing the election for himself.  [[Page S724]]    He apparently has still not thought of anyone else. (Text deleted.)   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Objection. This is not in evidence.  Objection. This is not in evidence.   If you wanted a stipulation to this--   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The counsel will sit down.   Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Senators, remember--   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair has no way of knowing whether  the evidence is admitted into evidence or not. The counsel for the  President will have the chance to speak, and the Chair will consider  the issue.   Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Senators, remember, as one of you said, during  this attack, they could have killed us all--our staff, the officers  protecting all of us, everyone.   President Trump not only incited it but continued inciting it as it  occurred with attacks on his Vice President and then willfully refused  to defend us, furthering his provocation and incitement by the mob,  siding with the mob, siding with the violent insurrectionists,  criminals who killed and injured police officers sworn to protect us,  because they were ``more upset about the election'' than Leader  McCarthy.   Those facts are undisputed. President Trump has not offered any  evidence or any argument to disprove them. His lawyers almost entirely  ignored these facts in their short presentation. We have only his  counsel's false claim yesterday that ``at no point was the President  informed that the Vice President was in any danger,'' a claim that is  refuted not just by common sense but by the timeline you have seen and  also the Vice President's legal team.   So there can be no doubt, at the moment we most needed a President to  preserve, protect, and defend us, President Trump instead willfully  betrayed us. He violated his oath. He left all of us and officers like  Eugene Goodman to our own devices against an attack he had incited and  he alone could stop. That is why he must be convicted.   I would like to conclude by making one final point that follows  directly from what I discussed. Our case and the Article of Impeachment  before you absolutely includes President Trump's dereliction of duty on  January 6, his failure as ``inciter in chief'' to immediately quell or  call off the mob, his failure as Commander in Chief to immediately do  everything in his power to secure the Capitol. That is a further basis  on which to convict, and there can be no doubt of that. The ongoing  constitutional misconduct is like any continuing offense, and the proof  of that is overwhelming.   Most directly, his dereliction of duty offers conclusive, irrefutable  evidence that he acted willfully, as we charge. He wasn't furious or  sad or shocked, like virtually everyone else in America. He was  reported by those around him as ``delighted.'' Rather than rush to our  aid or demand his mob retreat, he watched the attack on TV and praised  the mob to Leader McCarthy as more loyal to him, more upset about the  election. That was all that mattered. His reaction is also further  evidence of his intent. He acted exactly the way a person would act if  they had indeed incited the mob to violence to stop the steal.   Moreover, as I have shown, President Trump's dereliction and  desertion of duty includes his decision to further incite the mob even  as he failed to protect us. While the mob hunted Vice President Pence  in these very halls, he attacked Vice President Pence. While he tried  to stop the steal, he spread the big lie. We all saw how his mob  responded in real time. This further incitement was part of his  dereliction of duty. It was also part of his course of conduct  encouraging and provoking the mob to violence.   President Trump's dereliction of duty also highlights how foreseeable  the attack was to him. In his tweet just after 6 p.m., he said:         These are the things and events that happen when a sacred       landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously       stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &       unfairly treated for so long.    This tweet continued his endorsement of the attack, his failure to  condemn it, his desertion of duty, but it also reveals his view this  was of course what would happen when Congress refused his demand to  reject the election that he continued to tell his supporters was stolen  and he had actually won in a landslide. Again, he wasn't surprised. He  saw this as a predictable result of his repeated demands that his  followers stop the steal by any means possible.   This was all connected. His dereliction of duty, his desertion of  duty was part and parcel of the crime charged in the impeachment, and  it is certainly a basis on which to vote for conviction. If you believe  that he willfully refused to defend us and the law enforcement officers  fighting to save us and that he was delighted by the attack and that he  saw it as a natural result of his call to stop the steal and that he  continued to incite and target violence as the attack unfolded, we  respectfully submit you must vote to convict and disqualify so that the  events on January 6 can never happen again in this country.   Mr. House Manager RASKIN. I would like to call up Ms. Dean.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Utah.    Proceed.                         Counsels' Closing Arguments    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. I will promise that I will be the only one  talking, and it will not be so long.   Before I start my prepared closing, I really want to clean up a few  things from the mess that was the closing of the House managers. I do  not want to ruin my closing because I think the ending is pretty good.   What they didn't--they started off by misstating the law, and they  started off by misstating the intent of our stipulation. What we did  today was stipulate to an article that was published in a magazine,  apparently, they have had for weeks, according to the documents they  produced today, but for some reason this morning popped up with it.   The stipulation was that they can put that in. We did not stipulate  to its contents for truthfulness, and they tried to portray that in  their closing as the stipulation. The stipulation was read into the  Record. The proponents of that conversation--the real ones--have denied  its content, its veracity.   With respect to--and I am not going to talk much about the tortured  analysis of our arson wars that started off or the truly sideways  analogies that were used with fires. What I do want to talk about,  though, is the doctoring of evidence.   First of all, they sent us their evidence on Tuesday the 9th at 2:32  p.m. by email. I was in the room trying the case already when they sent  their evidence--due process.   They used evidence that was flat wrong two or three nights ago with  Senator Lee and had to withdraw it. They tried to use it again today.   They tried to use evidence that they had never presented in the case  in their closing argument. That is a very desperate attempt by a  prosecuting team--nine of them--by a prosecuting team that knew that  their case has collapsed.   Their closing did not mention one piece of law. They didn't talk  about the Constitution once. They didn't talk about the First Amendment  and its application. They didn't talk about due process and how it  applies to this proceeding for my client.   The basic rule of any court is that when you close a case out, you  close on the facts that were admitted in the trial. It is a basic,  fundamental principle of due process and fairness. And that was  violently breached today on multiple occasions. And you have to ask  yourself why? Why did they resort to those tactics at this moment in  time?   Senators, good afternoon. Mr. President.   What took place here at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was a grave  tragedy. Over the course of this trial, you have heard no one on either  side of this debate argue that the infiltration of the Capitol was  anything less than a heinous act on the home of American democracy.   All of us, starting with my client, are deeply disturbed by the  graphic videos of the Capitol attack that have been shown in recent  days. The entire team condemned and have repeatedly condemned the  violence and law breaking that occurred on January 6 in the strongest  possible terms. We have advocated that everybody be found and punished  to the maximum extent of the law. Yet the question before us is not  whether there was a violent insurrection of the Capitol. On that point,  everyone agrees.   Based on the explicit text of the House Impeachment Article, this  trial is about whether Mr. Trump willfully engaged in an incitement of  violence and even insurrection against the United States, and that  question they have posed in their Article of Impeachment has to be set  up against the law of this country.   No matter how much truly horrifying footage we see of the conduct of  the rioters and how much emotion has been injected into this trial,  that does not change the fact that Mr. Trump is innocent of the charges  against him.   Despite all of the video played, at no point in their presentation  did you hear the House managers play a single example of Mr. Trump  urging anyone to engage in violence of any kind. At no point did you  hear anything that could ever possibly be construed as Mr. Trump  encouraging or sanctioning an insurrection.   Senators, you did not hear those tapes because they do not exist,  because the act of incitement never happened. He engaged in no language  of incitement whatsoever on January 6 or any other day following the  election.   No unbiased person honestly reviewing the transcript of Mr. Trump's  speech on the Ellipse could possibly believe that he was suggesting  violence. He explicitly told the crowd that he expected the protest  outside the Capitol to be peaceful and patriotic.   They claim that is not enough.   His entire premise was that the proceedings of the joint session  should continue. He spent nearly the entire speech talking about how he  believes the Senators and Members of Congress should vote on the  matter.   It is the words. The Supreme Court ruled in Brandenburg that there is  a very clear standard for incitement. In short, you have to look at the  words themselves. The words have to either explicitly or implicitly  call for--the words--call for lawlessness or violence. Whether the  speech--you have to determine whether the speech was intended to  provoke the lawlessness and whether the violence was the likely result  of the word itself. They fail on all three prongs.   The false and defamatory claim that Mr. Trump gave a speech  encouraging his supporters to go attack the Capitol has been repeated  so often, uncritically, without any examination of the underlying  facts, that the American--the Americans--listening at home were  probably surprised to learn it is not true.   Furthermore, some of the people in this room followed Mr. Trump's  statements and tweets in the weeks leading up to January 6 very  closely. We know that he was not trying to foment an insurrection  during the time because no one--from the Speaker of the House to the  Mayor of Washington, DC--behaved in a fashion consistent with the  belief that violence was being advocated for.    Mr. Trump did not spend the weeks prior to January 6 inciting  violence. He spent those weeks pursuing his election challenge through  the court system and other legal procedures, exactly as the  Constitution and the Congress prescribe.   To believe based on the evidence you have seen that Mr. Trump  actually wanted and, indeed, willfully incited an armed insurrection to  overthrow the U.S. Government would be absurd.   The gathering on January 6 was supposed to be an entirely peaceful  event. Thousands and thousands of people, including Mr. Trump, showed  up that day with that intention. A small percentage--a small fraction  of those people--then engaged in truly horrible behavior. But as we now  know, that those actors were preplanned and premeditated and acted even  before this speech was completed, to which is the basis of the Article  of Impeachment. It was preplanned and premeditated by fringe--left and  right--groups. They hijacked the event for their own purposes.   The House managers' false narrative is a brazenly dishonest attempt  to smear, to cancel--constitutional canceled culture--their No. 1  political opponent, taking neutral statements, commonplace political  rhetoric, removing words and facts from context  [[Page S730]]  and ascribing to them the most sinister and malevolent intentions  possible.   Their story was based not on evidence but on the shear personal and  political animus.   The flimsy theory of incitement you heard from the House managers  could be used to impeach, indict, or expel countless other political  leaders. Many leading figures in other parties have engaged in far more  incendiary and dangerous rhetoric, and we played some of them. I am not  going to replay it. I am not going to replay you the words. You all saw  the evidence. I am not going to replay mob scenes. I don't want to give  those people another platform, any more view from the American people  as to what they did. They should be canceled.   Democrat politicians spent months prior to January 6 attacking the  very legitimacy of our Nation's most cherished institutions and  traditions. They didn't just question the integrity of one election;  they challenged the integrity of our entire Nation--everything from our  Founding Fathers, our Constitution, the Declaration of Independence,  law enforcement officers, and the United States Military. They said  that our society was rooted in hatred. They even said that America  deserved--and I will quote--``a reckoning.''   As you heard yesterday, throughout the summer, Democrat leaders,  including the current President and Vice President, repeatedly made  comments that provided moral comfort to mobs attacking police officers.  During that time, many officers across the country were injured. As we  all know, two sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles were ambushed and shot  at point-blank range.   Members of this very body have been in danger. Senators from Maine to  Kentucky, and most points in between, have been harassed by mobs.   Last August, a menacing leftwing mob swarmed Senator Rand Paul and  his wife as they left the White House, and they had to be rescued by  police.   For months, our Federal courthouse in Portland was placed under siege  by violent anarchists who attacked law enforcement officers daily and  repeatedly and tried to set fire to the building.   Speaker Pelosi did not call the violent siege of the Federal building  an insurrection. She called the Federal agents protecting the  courthouse ``stormtroopers.''   The White House complex was besieged by mobs that threw bricks,  rocks, and bottles at Secret Service agents, set fire to a historic  structure, and breached a security fence to infiltrate the Treasury  grounds.   When my client's administration sent in the National Guard to secure  the Nation's Capital City amidst the violence, Democrat leaders  demanded that the forces be withdrawn.   The Washington, DC, Mayor said the presence of the National Guard was  an affront to the safety of the District. It must be fully investigated  whether political leadership here in Washington, DC, took an inadequate  and irresponsible force posture on January 6 because of their  commitment to the false narrative of what happened last June.   Hopefully we can all now agree that the administration acted properly  by taking action to stop a riotous mob, establishing an appropriate  security perimeter, and preventing the White House from potentially  being overrun.   The House managers argued this week that an alleged brief delay in  issuing a public statement from Mr. Trump on January 6 was somehow  evidence that he committed incitement or supported the violence. Yet  for months last year Joe Biden and Vice President Harris and countless  other Democrats repeatedly refused to condemn the extremists as riots  were occurring daily, as businesses were being ramshackled, as  neighborhoods were being burned, as bombs were exploding. They  repeatedly refused to tell their violent supporters to stand down.   Some even suggested that the mobs' actions were justified. Vice  President Harris literally urged her followers to donate money to a  fund to bail out the violent, extreme rioters so that they could get  out and continue to do it over and over again. She later said that  those folks were not going to let up and that they should not.   All of this was far closer to the actual definition of ``incitement''  than anything President Trump has ever said or done, never mind what he  said on the 6th. It is a hypocrisy. It is a hypocrisy that the House  managers have laid at the feet of this Chamber.   The House managers suggested that this recent history is irrelevant  to the current proceedings, but not only is Democrats' behavior  surrounding last year's riots highly relevant as precedent and not only  does it reveal the dishonesty and insincerity of this entire endeavor,  it also provides crucial context that should inform our understanding  of the events that took place on January 6.   Many of the people who infiltrated the Capitol took pictures of  themselves and posted them on social media. To some, it seems, they  thought that it was all a game. They apparently believed that violent  mobs, destruction of property, rioting, assaulting police, and  vandalizing historic treasures was somehow now acceptable in the United  States. Where might they have gotten that idea? I would suggest to you  that it was not from Mr. Trump. It was not Mr. Trump. It was not anyone  in the Republican Party that spent the 6 months immediately prior to  the Capitol assault giving rhetorical aid and comfort to mobs, making  excuses for rioters, celebrating radicalism, and explaining that angry,  frustrated, and marginalized people were entitled to blow off steam  like that.   Let me be very clear. There can be no excuse for the depraved actions  of the rioters here at the Capitol or anywhere else across this  country. One hundred percent of those guilty of committing crimes  deserve lengthy prison sentences for their shameful and depraved  conduct. But this trial has raised the question about words, actions,  and consequences.   As a nation, we must ask ourselves, how did we arrive at this place  where rioting and pillaging would become commonplace? I submit to you  that it was month after month of political leaders and media  personalities, bloodthirsty for ratings, glorifying civil unrest and  condemning the reasonable law enforcement measures that are required to  quell violent mobs.   Hopefully we can all leave this Chamber in uniform agreement that all  rioting--all rioting--is bad and that law enforcement deserves our  respect and support. That has been Mr. Trump's position from the very  beginning.   The real question in this case is, Who is ultimately responsible for  such acts of mayhem and violence when they are committed? The House  Democrats want two different standards--one for themselves and one for  their political opposition.   They have carried out a grossly unconstitutional effort to punish Mr.  Trump for protected First Amendment speech. It is an egregious  violation of his constitutional rights. Since he uttered not a single  word encouraging violence, this action can only be seen as an effort to  censor disfavored political speech and discriminate against a  disapproved viewpoint. It is an unprecedented action with the potential  to do grave and lasting damage to both the Presidency and the  separation of powers and the future of democratic self-government.   Yesterday we played you a video of countless Democrat Members of the  Senate urging their supporters to fight. We showed you those videos not  because we think you should be forcibly removed from office for saying  those things but because we know you should not be forcibly removed  from office for saying those things. But recognize the hypocrisy   Yesterday in questioning, House Manager Raskin admitted that the  House Democrats had invented an entirely new legal standard. In fact,  they have created a new legal theory: the Raskin doctrine. The Raskin  doctrine is based on nothing more than determining protected speech  based on the party label next to your name. Regardless of what you have  heard or what you have seen from the House managers, if you pay close  attention, you will see that any speech made by Democrat elected  officials is protected speech, while any speech made by Republican  elected officials is not protected.   The creation of the Raskin doctrine actually reveals the weakness of  the House managers' case. Elected officials--and we reviewed this in- depth yesterday--under Supreme Court precedent Wood and Bond--by the  way,  [[Page S731]]  Bond didn't burn his draft card; he actually still had it. It was part  of his defense. But in Bond and in Wood, the Court clearly directed all  to know that elected officials hold the highest protections of speech,  the highest protections, and I remind you why: because you all need to  be free to have robust political discussion because your discussion is  about how our lives are going to go, and that shouldn't be squelched by  any political party on either side of the aisle, no matter who is the  majority party at the time.   Why would the House managers make up their own legal standard? I will  tell you why. Because they know they cannot satisfy the existing  constitutional standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court  that has existed for more than half a century. They argue Mr. Trump, as  an elected official, has no First Amendment rights. It is the complete  opposite of the law. We have shown you, without contradiction, that is  wrong.   They also know that they cannot satisfy the three-part test of  Brandenburg, as elucidated in the Bible Believers case.   There was absolutely no evidence that Mr. Trump's words were directed  to inciting imminent lawless action. There was no evidence that Mr.  Trump intended his words to incite violence. And the violence was  preplanned and premeditated by a group of lawless actors who must be  prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, but it proves that his  words weren't what set this into motion, what was the incitement.   With no ability and no evidence to satisfy the existing  constitutional standard, what are the House managers to do? They had to  make up their own law. This is not only intellectually dishonest,  folks; it is downright scary.   What type of precedent would be set if the Senate did vote to  convict? Can Congress now ignore Supreme Court precedent on the  contours of protected free speech? Will Congress be permitted to  continually make up their own legal standards and apply those new  standards to elected officials' speech? This would allow Congress to  use the awesome impeachment power as a weapon to impeach their fellow  colleagues in the opposing party. This is not a precedent that this  Senate can set here today.   If the Senate endorses the House Democrats' absurd new theory, you  will set a precedent that will trouble leaders from both parties  literally for centuries to come, but that will not be the only  disgraceful precedent to come from this case.   This has been perhaps the most unfair and flagrantly unconstitutional  proceeding in the history of the United States Senate. For the first  time in history, Congress has asserted the right to try and punish a  former President who is a private citizen. Nowhere in the Constitution  is the power enumerated or implied. Congress has no authority, no  right, and no business holding a trial of Citizen Trump, let alone a  trial to deprive him of some fundamental civil rights.   There was mention of a January exception argument. The January  exception argument is a creation of the House managers' own conduct by  delaying. They sat on the Article. They could have tried the President  while he was still in office if they really believed he was an imminent  threat. They didn't. The January exception is a red herring. It is  nonsense because Federal, State, and local authorities can investigate.  Their January exception always expires on January 20.   House Democrats and this deeply unfair trial have shamefully trampled  every tradition, norm, and standard of due process in a way I have  never ever seen before. Mr. Trump was given no right to review the so- called evidence against him at trial. He was given no opportunity to  question its propriety. He was given no chance to engage in  factfinding.   Much of what was introduced by the House was unverified second- or  thirdhand reporting cribbed from a biased news media, including stories  based on anonymous sources whose identities are not even known to them,  never mind my client. They manufactured and doctored evidence, so much  so that they had to withdraw it.   We only had--we had the evidence after we started the trial. They  went on for 2 days, so in the evening, I was able to go back and take a  really close look at the stuff. Myself and Mr. Castor and Ms. Bateman  and Mr. Brennan, we all worked hard and looked at the evidence, four  volumes of books in little, tiny print. We started--we literally had  12, 14 hours to really look at the evidence before we had to go on, and  just in that short time of looking at the evidence, we saw them  fabricating Twitter accounts. We saw the masked man sitting at his desk  with the New York Times there.   And when we looked closely, we found that the date was wrong; the  check had been added. They fabricated evidence. They made it up. They  never addressed that in their closing--as though it were acceptable, as  though it were all right, as though that is the way it should be done  here in the Senate of the United States of America. Fraud--flatout  fraud. Where I come from, in the courts I practice in, there are very  harsh repercussions for what they pulled in this trial.   As we have shown, the House managers were caught creating false  representations of tweets, manipulating videos, and introducing into  the Record completely discredited lies, such as the ``fine people''  hoax, as factual evidence.   Most of what the House managers have said and shown you would be  inadmissible in any respectable court of law. They were not trying a  case; they were telling a political tale--a fable--and a patently false  one at that.   House Democrats have denied due process and rushed the impeachment  because they know that a fair trial would reveal Mr. Trump's innocence  of the charges against him. The more actual evidence that comes out,  the clearer it is that this was a preplanned and premeditated attack,  which his language in no way incited.   Because their case is so weak, the House managers have taken a  kitchen-sink approach to the supposedly single Article of Impeachment.  They allege that Mr. Trump incited the January 6 violence. They allege  that he abused power by attempting to pressure Georgia Secretary of  State Raffensperger to undermine the results of the 2020 election, and  they allege that he gravely endangered the democratic system by  interfering with the peaceful transition of power. There are at least  three things there.   Under the Senate rules, each of these allegations must have been  alleged in a separate Article of Impeachment. I need not remind this  Chamber that rule XXIII of the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the  Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials provides, in pertinent part,  that an Article of Impeachment ``shall not be divisible . . .  thereon.''   Why is that? Because the Article at issue here alleges multiple  wrongs in the single Article, it would be impossible to know if two- thirds of the Members agreed on the entire Article or just on parts of  it as the basis for a vote to convict. Based on this alone, the Senate  must vote to acquit Mr. Trump. You have got to at least obey your own  rules if it is not the Constitution you are going to obey.   In short, this impeachment has been a complete charade from beginning  to end. The entire spectacle has been nothing but an unhinged pursuit  of a longstanding political vendetta against Mr. Trump by the  opposition party.   As we have shown, Democrats were obsessed with impeaching Mr. Trump  from the very beginning of his term. The House Democrats tried to  impeach him in his first year. They tried to impeach him in his second  year. They did impeach him in his third year. And they impeached him  again in his fourth year. And now they have conducted a phony  impeachment show trial when he is a private citizen out of office.   This hastily orchestrated and unconstitutional circus is the House  Democrats' final, desperate attempt to accomplish their obsessive  desire of the last 5 years.   Since the moment he stepped into the political arena, my client-- since my client stepped in, they have been possessed by an overwhelming  zeal to vanquish an independent-minded outsider from their midst and to  shame, demean, silence, and demonize his supporters in the desperate  hope that they will never, ever pose an electoral challenge.   We heard one of the Congressmen on the screen: If you don't impeach  him, he might be elected again.   That is the fear. That is what is driving this impeachment.  [[Page S732]]    When you deliberate over your decision, there are four distinct  grounds under which you must acquit my client.   First is jurisdiction. There is no jurisdiction. And if you believe  that, you still get to say it.   Two, rule XXIII--it had to be divisible. Each allegation had to be  singularly set out in front of you so it could be voted on and to see  if two-thirds of you think that they proved that case or not. They  didn't do that. You have got to ask yourself why. They know the Senate  rules. They got them, and so did I. Why did they do it? Because they  hadn't investigated, first of all. But, also, what they found out is  when they were preparing all this, they couldn't do it. So if they  threw in as much as they could and made as many bold, bald allegations  as they could, then maybe two-thirds of you would fall for it. That is  why the rules don't allow it to go that way.   Due process--I have exhausted that subject. It is a really good  reason for all of you--all of you--in this Chamber to stop the  politics, to read the Constitution and apply it to this proceeding and  acknowledge that the lack of due process--way over the top, shocking.  And you must not stand for it.   And, of course, the First Amendment--the actual facts of this case.  There were no words of incitement.   Four grounds. Nobody gets to tell you which ground to pick, and  nobody gets to tell you how many grounds to consider.   Senators, do not let House Democrats take this maniacal crusade any  further. The Senate does not have to go down this dark path of enmity  and division. You do not have to indulge the impeachment lust, the  dishonesty, and the hypocrisy.   It is time to bring this unconstitutional political theater to an  end. It is time to allow our Nation to move forward. It is time to  address the real business pressing this Nation--the pandemic, our  economy, racial inequality, economic and social inequality. These are  the things that you need to be thinking and working on for all of us in  America--all of us.   With your vote, you can defend the Constitution. You can protect due  process. And you can allow America's healing to begin. I urge the  Senate to acquit and vindicate the Constitution of this great Republic.   Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Senators, I understand--I am told  we have around 27 minutes, but I will return all of that but perhaps 5  back to you. There are just a few things I need to address. In an  extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented act of self-restraint on my  part, I will resist the opportunity to rebut every single false and  illogical thing that you just heard. And I am going to be able to  return to you, you know, perhaps 22, 23 minutes.   A few points: One, we have definitely made some progress in the last  few days because a few days ago, the President's team--although I think  it was perhaps a member who has since left the team--lectured us that  this was not an insurrection and said that impeachment managers were  outrageous in using the word ``insurrection.'' Today, counsel, in his  closing statement, said it was a violent insurrection, and he denounced  it. And I would certainly love to see President Trump also call it a  violent insurrection and denounce it too. And I believe--although, I  don't have a verbatim text--that counsel called for long sentences for  the people who were involved. Again, I would love to hear that come  from the President as well.   The distinguished counsel complains that there is no precedent with  the developed body of law that the Senate has for impeaching and  convicting a President who incites violent insurrection against the  Congress and the government of the United States. Well, I suppose that  is true because it never occurred to any other President of the United  States--from George Washington, to John Adams, to Thomas Jefferson, to  James Madison, to James Monroe, to Abraham Lincoln, to Ronald Reagan,  to George W. Bush, to Barack Obama--to incite a violent insurrection  against the Union.   You are right. We have got no precedent for that, and so they think  that that somehow is a mark in their favor--that is a score for them-- that this Senate has to be the first one to define incitement of  violent insurrection against the Union. And so the gentleman puts it on  me. He says: Inciting a President for committing incitement to violent  insurrection against the Union is the new Raskin doctrine.   We have tried to convince them that there are well-known principles  and elements of incitement, which we have talked to you about ad  nauseam, and that this is an intrinsically, inherently fact-based  judgment. But if that is the Raskin doctrine--that a President of the  United States cannot incite violent insurrection against the Union and  the Congress--then I embrace it, and I take it as an honor. Most law  professors never even get a doctrine named after them, so I will accept  that.   And, finally, the counsel goes back to Julian Bond's case because, I  think, in the final analysis, their best argument--as pathetically weak  as it is--is really about the First Amendment. But, remember, they keep  talking about stifling President Trump's speech. Someone tell me when  his speech has ever been stifled. He says exactly what he wants  whenever he wants. If and when you convict him for incitement of  insurrection, he will continue to say whatever he wants on that day.  Remember, they referred yesterday to interference with his liberty,  which I found absolutely bizarre because everybody knows he will not  spend 1 minute in prison or jail from conviction on these charges. It  is a civil remedy to protect all of us--to protect the entire country,  our children, our Constitution, our future. That is what impeachment  trial convictions are all about--are all about.   Julian Bond--see, I knew Julian Bond, so forgive me. Most people say:  Don't even respond to this stuff. I have got to respond to this. Julian  Bond was a civil rights activist who decided to go into politics, like  the people in this room, like all of us who are in politics. And they  tried to keep him out. He was a member of SNCC, the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee, which really launched the voting rights  movement in America. It is a great story that Bob Moses tells in his  book called ``Radical Equations'' about--you know, he was a graduate  student, mathematics, at Harvard. He was a graduate student in  mathematics at Harvard. He went to Mississippi. You know why? Because  he saw a picture in the New York Times of Black civil rights  protesters, college students, I think, North Carolina A&T. He saw a  picture of them on the cover of the New York Times, and they were  sitting in at a lunch counter. He looked at the picture, and he said:  They looked the way that I felt. They looked the way that I felt.    He said he had to go down south to Mississippi, and they launched the  voting rights movement. That is where the phrase ``One-person, one- vote'' comes from. It was not invented by the Supreme Court. They would  go door-to-door to try to register people to vote.   But anyway, Julian Bond was a part of that movement, the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee--nonviolence. It was the end, and it  was the means--nonviolence.   And he ran for the State legislature in Georgia, a path other civil  rights activists followed, like our great, late, beloved colleague John  Lewis, who is in our hearts today. And when he got elected, they wanted  to try to keep him from being sworn in to the Georgia Legislature. And  so they said the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee is taking a  position against the Vietnam war. You are a member of SNCC. We are not  going to admit you because you took a position against the Vietnam war.  And the Supreme Court, in its wisdom, said you cannot prevent someone  from swearing an oath to become a member of a legislative body because  of a position that they took or a group they were part of--took before  they got sworn in.   That is the exact opposite of Donald Trump. He got elected to office.  He swore an oath to the Constitution to preserve, protect, and defend  the Constitution. He served as President for 4 years, right up until  the end, when he wanted to exercise his rights under the imaginary  January exception, and he incited a violent mob and insurrection to  come up here, and we all know what happened.  [[Page S733]]    He is being impeached and convicted for violating his oath of office  that he took. He is not being prevented from taking his oath in the  first place.   The First Amendment is on our side. He tried to overturn the will of  the people, the voice of the people. He lost that election by more than  7 million votes. Some people don't want to admit it. Counsel for the  President could not bring themselves to admit that the election is over  in answer to the question from the distinguished gentleman from  Vermont. He refused to answer that. He said it was irrelevant, despite  all of the evidence you have heard about the big lie and how that set  the stage for his incitement of the insurrectionary violence against  us.   The First Amendment is on our side. We are defending the Bill of  Rights. We are defending the constitutional structure. We are defending  the separation of powers. We are defending the U.S. Senate and the U.S.  House against a President who acted no better than a marauder and a  member of that mob by inciting those people to come here. And in many  ways, he was worse. He named the date; he named the time; and he  brought them here; and now he must pay the price.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.    Mr. President, the Senate is now ready to vote on the  Article of Impeachment. And after that is done, we will adjourn the  Court of Impeachment.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the Article of  Impeachment.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         Article I: Incitement of Insurrection.        The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives       ``shall have the sole Power of Impeachment'' and that the       President ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for,       and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors''. Further, section 3 of the 14th Amendment to       the Constitution prohibits any person who has ``engaged in       insurrection or rebellion against'' the United States from       ``hold[ing] any office . . . under the United States''. In       his conduct while President of the United States--and in       violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute       the office of President of the United States and, to the best       of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the       Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his       constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully       executed--Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and       Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of       the United States, in that:        On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th Amendment to the       Constitution of the United States, the Vice President of the       United States, the House of Representatives, and the Senate       met at the United States Capitol for a Joint Session of       Congress to count the votes of the Electoral College. In the       months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump       repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the       Presidential election results were the product of widespread       fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or       certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the       Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd       at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false       claims that ``we won this election, and we won it by a       landslide''. He also willfully made statements that, in       context, encouraged--and foreseeably resulted in--lawless       action at the Capitol, such as: ``if you don't fight like       hell you're not going to have a country anymore''. Thus       incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had       addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives,       interfere with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty       to certify the results of the 2020 Presidential election,       unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and       killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of       Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel,       and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and       seditious acts.        President Trump's conduct on January 6, 2021, followed his       prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of       the results of the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior       efforts included a phone call on January 2, 2021, during       which President Trump urged the secretary of state of       Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to ``find'' enough votes to       overturn the Georgia Presidential election results and       threatened Secretary Raffensperger if he failed to do so.        In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the       security of the United States and its institutions of       Government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic       system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and       imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed       his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people       of the United States.        Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has       demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national       security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to       remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly       incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. Donald       John Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from       office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of       honor, trust, or profit under the United States.                             Vote on Article I    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Each Senator, when his or her name is  called, will stand in his or her place and vote guilty or not guilty,  as required by rule XXIII of the Senate Rules on Impeachment.   Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the Constitution regarding the vote  required for conviction of impeachment provides that ``no person shall  be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the Members  present.''   The question is on the Article of Impeachment. Senators, how say you?  Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, guilty or not guilty?   A rollcall vote is required.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--guilty 57, not guilty 43, as follows:    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S733, February 13, 2021, second column, the following  appears: The result was announcedguilty 57, not quilty 43, as  follows:      The Record has been corrected to read: The result was  announcedguilty 57, not guilty 43, as follows:    ========================= END NOTE =========================                             [Rollcall Vote No. 59]                                  YEAS--57       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Romney      Rosen      Sanders      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Toomey      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--43       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Capito      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Portman      Risch      Rounds      Rubio      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Wicker      Youn   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays  are 43.   Two-thirds of the Senators present not having voted guilty, the  Senate adjudges that the respondent Donald John Trump, former President  of the United States, is not guilty as charged in the Article of  Impeachment.   The Presiding Officer directs the judgment to be entered in  accordance with the judgment of the Senate, as follows:         The Senate, having tried Donald John Trump, former       President of the United States, upon one Article of       Impeachment exhibited against him by the House of       Representatives, and two-thirds of the Senators present not       having found him guilty of the charge contained therein, it       is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John       Trump be, and is hereby, acquitted of the charge in said       Article.    The majority leader is recognized.         Communication to the Secretary of State and to the House of                              Representatives     Mr. President, I send an order to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the order.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         Ordered, that the Secretary be directed to communicate to       the Secretary of State, as provided by rule XXIII of the       Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on       Impeachment Trials, and also to the House of Representatives,       the judgment of the Senate in the case of Donald John Trump,       and transmit a certified copy of the judgment to each.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the order will be  entered.   The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move that the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment on the Article against Donald John Trump, adjourn  sine die.  [[Page S734]]    The motion was agreed to, and at 3:51 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned sine die.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The majority leader                            ____________________     Mr. President, the case of Donald Trump's second  impeachment trial was open and shut.   President Trump told a lie--a big lie--that the election was stolen  and that he was the rightful winner. He laid the groundwork for this  big lie in the months before the election. He told the big lie on  election night, and he repeated the big lie more than 100 times in the  weeks afterward.   He summoned his supporters to Washington, assembled them on the  Ellipse, whipped them into a frenzy, and directed them at the Capitol.  Then he watched as the violence unfolded and the Capitol was breached  and his own Vice President fled for his life, and President Trump did  nothing.   None of these facts were up for debate. We saw it. We heard it. We  lived it. This was the first Presidential impeachment trial in history  in which all Senators were not only judges and jurors but witnesses to  the constitutional crime that was committed. The former President  inspired, directed, and propelled a mob to violently prevent the  peaceful transfer of power, subvert the will of the people, and  illegally keep that President in power. There is nothing--nothing--more  un-American than that. There is nothing--nothing--more antithetical to  our democracy. There is nothing--nothing--more insulting to the  generations of American patriots who gave their lives to defend our  form of government.   This was the most egregious violation of the Presidential oath of  office and a textbook example, a classic example of an impeachable  offense, worthy of the Constitution's most severe remedy.   In response to the incontrovertible fact of Donald Trump's guilt, the  Senate was subject to a feeble and sometimes incomprehensible defense  of the former President. Unable to dispute the case on the merits, the  former President's counsel treated us to partisan vitriol, false  equivalence, and outright falsehoods.   We heard the roundly debunked jurisdictional argument that the Senate  cannot try a former official, a position that would mean that any  President could simply resign to avoid accountability for an  impeachable offense, a position which, in effect, would render the  Senate powerless to ever enforce the disqualification clause in the  Constitution. Essentially, the President's counsel told the Senate that  the Constitution was unconstitutional. Thankfully, the Senate took a  firm stance, set a firm precedent with a bipartisan vote in favor of  our power to try former officials for acts they committed while in  office.   We heard the preposterous claim that the former President's  incitement to violence was protected by the First Amendment. The First  Amendment right to free speech protects Americans from jail, not  Presidents from impeachment. If the President had said during World War  II, ``Germany should attack the United States on Long Island; we have  left it undefended,'' I suspect Congress would have considered that an  impeachable offense.   Finally, defense counsel said that President Trump was not directly  responsible for the violence at the Capitol:         His words were merely a metaphor; his directions were       merely suggestions; and the violent mob was just a       spontaneous demonstration.    Yet wind the clock back, and ask yourself, if at any point Donald  Trump did not do the things he did, would the attack on the Capitol  have happened? There is only one answer to this question: Of course  not. If President Trump hadn't told his supporters to march to the  Capitol, if he hadn't implored them to come to Washington on January 6  in the first place, if he hadn't repeatedly lied to them that the  election was stolen and their country was being taken from them, the  attack would not have happened, could not have happened. January 6  would not have happened but for the actions of Donald Trump.   Here is what the Republican leader of the Senate said: The mob that  perpetrated the ``failed insurrection'' on January 6 ``was provoked by  President Trump.'' Do you want another word for ``provoke''? How about  ``incite''? Yet still--still--the vast majority of the Senate  Republican caucus, including the Republican leader, voted to acquit  former President Trump, signing their names in the columns of history  alongside his name forever.   January 6 will live as a day of infamy in the history of the United  States of America. The failure to convict Donald Trump will live as a  vote of infamy in the history of the U.S. Senate.   Five years ago, Republican Senators lamented what might become of  their party if Donald Trump became their Presidential nominee and  standard-bearer. Just look at what has happened. Look at what  Republicans have been forced to defend. Look at what Republicans have  chosen to forgive. The former President tried to overturn the results  of a legitimate election and provoked an assault on our own government,  and well over half the Senate Republican conference decided to condone  it--the most despicable act that any President has ever committed, and  the majority of Republicans cannot summon the courage or the morality  to condemn it.   This trial wasn't about choosing country over party, even not that;  this was about choosing country over Donald Trump, and 43 Republican  Members chose Trump. They chose Trump. It should be a weight on their  conscience today, and it shall be a weight on their conscience in the  future.   As sad as that fact is, as condemnable as the decision was, it is  still true that the final vote on Donald Trump's conviction was the  largest and most bipartisan vote of any Presidential impeachment trial  in American history.   I salute those Republican patriots who did the right thing. It wasn't  easy. We know that. Let their votes be a message to the American people  because, my fellow Americans, if this Nation is going to long endure,  we as a people cannot sanction the former President's conduct, because  if lying about the results of an election is acceptable, if instigating  a mob against the government is considered permissible, if encouraging  political violence becomes the norm, it will be open season--open  season--on our democracy, and everything will be up for grabs by  whoever has the biggest clubs, the sharpest spears, the most powerful  guns. By not recognizing the heinous crime that Donald Trump committed  against the Constitution, Republican Senators have not only risked but  potentially invited the same danger that was just visited upon us.   So let me say this: Despite the results of the vote on Donald Trump's  conviction in the Court of Impeachment, he deserves to be convicted,  and I believe he will be convicted in the court of public opinion. He  deserves to be permanently discredited, and I believe he has been  discredited in the eyes of the American people and in the judgment of  history.   Even though Republican Senators prevented the Senate from  disqualifying Donald Trump for any office of honor, trust, or profit  under these United States, there is no question Donald Trump has  disqualified himself. I hope, I pray, and I believe that the American  people will make sure of that. If Donald Trump ever stands for  [[Page S735]]  public office again, and after everything we have seen this week, I  hope, I pray, and I believe that he will meet the unambiguous rejection  by the American people.   Six hours after the attack on January 6, after the carnage and mayhem  was shown on every television screen in America, President Trump told  his supporters to ``Remember this day forever.'' I ask the American  people to heed his words. Remember that day forever but not for the  reasons the former President intended. Remember the panic in the voices  over the radio dispatch, the rhythmic pounding of fists and flags at  the Chamber doors. Remember the crack of a solitary gunshot. Remember  the hateful and racist Confederate flag flying through the halls of our  Union. Remember the screams of the bloody officer crushed between the  onrushing mob and a doorway to the Capitol, his body trapped in the  breach. Remember three Capitol Police officers who lost their lives.  Remember that those rioters actually succeeded in delaying Congress  from certifying the election. Remember how close our democracy came to  ruin.   My fellow Americans, remember that day, January 6, forever, the  final, terrible legacy of the 45th President of the United States and  undoubtedly our worst. Let it live on in infamy, a stain on Donald John  Trump that can never, never be washed away.   On Monday we will recognize Presidents Day. Part of the commemoration  in the Senate will be the annual reading of Washington's Farewell  Address. Aside from winning the Revolutionary War, I consider it his  greatest contribution to American civil life, and it had nothing to do  with the words he spoke but the example it set.   Washington's Farewell Address established for all time that no one  had the right to the Office of the Presidency, that it belonged to the  people. What an amazing legacy. What an amazing gift to the future  generations, the knowledge that this country will always be greater  than any one person, even our most renowned. That is why Members of  both parties take turns reading Washington's address once a year in  full into the Record, to pledge common attachment to the selflessness  at the core of our democratic system.   This trial was about the final acts of a President who represents the  very antithesis of our first President and sought to place one man  before the entire country: himself.   Let the record show--let the record show before God, history, and the  solemn oath we swear to the Constitution that there was only one  correct verdict in this trial: guilty. And I pray that while justice  was not done in this trial, it will be carried forward by the American  people, who, above any of us in this Chamber, determine the destiny of  our great Nation   I yield the floor.
