 Madam President, today I would like to take a  moment to recognize and honor the life of a great South Carolinian,  Mother Lula Mae Lollar Belton, ``Mom-mo,'' who departed this life on  September 20, 2017.   Mother Belton was a spiritual, humble, and loving woman who loved the  Lord and her community. She worked for the Colleton County Food Service  for 31 years, as well as many positions within Buckhead UMC Church,  where she was a faithful member. She most notably served as Mother of  the Church. Mother Belton always had an open heart to her many  children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, great-great- grandchildren, as well as many others in the community and church. She  will be greatly missed by the family and community she leaves behind,  and I would like to add her name to our October 23, 2017, Congressional  Record.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I would like to take a  moment to recognize and honor the life of a great South Carolinian, Dr.  Oscar P. Butler, Jr., who departed this life on October 2, 2017. Dr.  Butler was a graduate of South Carolina State University and later went  on to earn a doctor of philosophy in administration and higher  education from Michigan State University. He then spent over 27 years  in student personnel development, including as a dean at SCSU. He also  served as executive director of 1890 Research and Extension for over 10  years. He has been recognized for Outstanding Service by the  N.A.A.C.P., Meritorious Service and Commendations by the U.S. Navy, and  given the Distinguished Alumnus Award by SCSU. Dr. Butler was a  faithful member of Williams Chapel A.M.E. Church for over 57 years,  where he was the recipient of the Unsung Hero Award 2015. Dr. Butler  will surely be missed and remembered as a great South Carolinian, and I  would like to add his name to our October 23, 2017, Congressional  Record.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I would like to take a  moment to recognize and honor the life of Bishop Lewis Nathaniel  Taylor, a great South Carolinian, who departed this life on October 2,  2017. Bishop Lewis Taylor deeply loved his family, church, and  community. He pastored in San Diego, California, Washington, DC, and  New York. He eventually returned to his native Walterboro, SC, where he  continued the legacy of his father and became pastor of Greater Saint  James Church. He encouraged, inspired, and mentored many people in the  community and abroad. Bishop Taylor served not only as a pastor, but as  a carpenter and general contractor as well. In short, Bishop Taylor was  a builder-visionary who helped design and construct churches across  South Carolina. In 2008 and 2017, the mayor of Walterboro presented  Bishop Taylor with the Key to the City. He was known to many as ``the  little man, with a big vision'' and served his community tirelessly and  earned the respect and admiration of all people he came in contact  with. He will be greatly missed by the Walterboro community and the  people of South Carolina.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to recognize and  congratulate Dr. Akil Ross, of Chapin High School, who has been chosen  as the National Principal of the Year by the National Association of  Secondary School Principals.
