 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for  so eloquently explaining the underlying reason that I rise to oppose  the previous question so that we may immediately consider H.R. 8749,  which is my bill to strike the new tax on every American, the new tax  on natural gas that was included in the Democrats' paycheck reduction  act.   At a time when we actually are witnessing probably the most  destructive energy poverty crisis in the civilized world, which is  happening right now in Europe, in most cases happening in countries  that are now experiencing a tenfold increase of their heating bills, a  tenfold increase of their energy bills, a tenfold increase of all the  requirements of energy, the most foundational piece of any economy,  President Biden is driving an agenda to do the same thing here in the  United States, driving an agenda to impoverish the energy needs of this  country.   While the President may deny the existence of inflation and crippling  price hikes, those of us who are actually buying our own groceries and  paying our bills every month know that is false. No position in the  United States can deny the economic facts--8.3 percent. That, I  believe, pales in comparison to what areas in rural America are  actually paying.   Price hikes on energy are the largest driver of this inflation by  far. Gas utility bills are up 33 percent. Electricity is up almost 16  percent. It is 16 percent more expensive than it was this time last  year.   In the United States right now, today, energy costs are so high that  one in six Americans are facing a notice from their electric company  that they may be disconnected--one in six.   When I said these words just a couple of months ago, everybody on the  other side of the aisle laughed at that proposition. Yet, it is the  policy that started with the flurry of activity last January, the  executive orders that were aimed at killing the industry that underpins  our economy, the industry that won World War II, the industry that has  lifted 1 billion people out of poverty, 1 billion people around the  world in places like sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and  the Far East. That is because of the shale revolution. That is because  of technology.   The Paris climate accords have absolutely nothing on the reduction of  harmful pollutants and emissions that private innovation has actually  done.                                time  1230    And even knowing this, President Biden and Democrats in Congress have  introduced another tax on American energy that will continue to drive  costs up.   How many more Americans will be unable to heat their homes this fall  and this winter when Democrat tax initiatives make their utility bills  50 percent more expensive than last year?   Does the Green New Deal lobby group want America to follow in the  footsteps of the Europeans I just mentioned who have returned-- literally returned to burning wood chips in their homes?   Restarting coal plants, where was that in the Green New Deal? Where  was that in the Paris climate accord in COP26?   Make no mistake. These costs will swiftly be passed along to the 180  million Americans and 5.5 million businesses that rely on natural gas.   In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now estimates  this fee will increase taxes by $6.5 billion and raise natural gas  bills an additional 17 percent, in addition to the inflationary  pressures already facing our economy. What an inexcusable error.  [[Page H7981]]    Instead of encouraging more U.S. production of oil and gas, House  Democrats have opted instead to cut government checks to favored green  special interest groups.   And by the way, what happened to the President's promise not to raise  taxes on Americans earning less than 400,000? It is laughable.   Americans are begging for lower prices. They are begging for the  government to simply allow free market principles to work; to allow the  companies that underpin energy to do what they do best, which is to do  it better, to do it more efficient; to do it cleaner and to not be  dependent on adversaries like Russia and China and other adversaries.   The crowning achievement of President Biden's energy policies will be  dependence on adversaries for our energy needs. In Maslow's hierarchy,  I couldn't think of something that is worse; dependence on OPEC oil as  he goes to Saudi Arabia asking for more production when we can do it  here better.   We only need to look at the reckless policies in Europe to understand  how bad this can be. We only need to look at the dependence that Europe  had on Russia that has now, in many, many ways, led to a crisis in  Ukraine.   Energy underpins everything. And I am tired of hearing that we are in  an energy transition. We are not. We are in an energy expansion.   Another billion people will be added to the population of this globe  within the next 15 to 20 years, one billion. Where is their energy  going to come from? Can those people afford electric vehicles?   Where does electricity come from?   These are the questions it would be nice to have in a transparent,  open, and realistic debate. In this energy expansion, I invite my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come to my district to see  the fact that my congressional district has more wind energy than the  entire State of California. Come see what we do with regards to solar.    Come to my district to see that, in this energy  expansion, it is going to take every available source of energy. But  most importantly, it is going to take reliable energy, base-load  energy, sources that are primary that can provide the reliability.   We don't need to go the direction that Europe has gone, and we  certainly don't need to go the direction that our friends in California  have gotten used to with rolling blackouts.   And we don't need higher taxes. Every American family is struggling.  The solution is literally directly below our feet. It is literally at  the hands of the most innovative and experienced entrepreneurs,  engineers, hardworking patriots. It is here. We can provide that  reliability and reduce dependency.   I urge my colleagues to cast their vote for the American family, for  the senior on a fixed income, for the small business owner, and for  energy security.   And let me issue a warning. If we continue down this path, it will  end in energy poverty right here in this country; and those that will  be affected most are the vulnerable in our population, the ones that  are disconnected from their energy companies; the ones that can't  afford to do anything because energy costs are so high.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8749 which would  strike the new tax on natural gas, and get us on a path, once again, to  energy dominance, energy security and reliability.
