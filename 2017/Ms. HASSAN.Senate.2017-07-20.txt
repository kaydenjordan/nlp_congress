 Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Schumer, for  his remarks.   I join with Senator Schumer and all of our colleagues in wishing the  very best to our tough and resilient American hero and colleague, John  McCain. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. We need  him back here as fast as he can get here.
