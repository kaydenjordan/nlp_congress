 I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, this is the first I am aware of this  amendment. It was given to me this afternoon to take a look at. I don't  have any history with it.   It is interesting and coincidental that today is the 94th birthday of  President George Herbert Walker Bush, the first President of the United  States to ever live to the age of 94, a World War II decorated veteran,  a man who served this country in so many different ways.   This effort to eliminate the expenses--an amount that is paid to him  as a former President--I had not seen before today. I am told this  amendment would save the Treasury $4.3 million a year. So I would like  to suggest to the Senator from Iowa--I am going to make an official  request in this regard. We can do much better than $4.3 million a year  in deficit reduction.   I am going to ask the Senator from Iowa if she will modify her  request to shave $404 million over 10 years by ensuring that  millionaires across the United States--in Illinois and in Iowa--don't  receive generous crop insurance subsidies.   Big agribusiness in Iowa and Illinois receive government subsidies to  the tune of nearly $600 million. A GAO study found that 4 percent of  the most profitable farmers in America accounted for 33 percent of all  the Federal premium support.   My legislation that I am asking to be added to the Senator's  amendment would reduce premium support for producers with an AGI,  adjusted gross income, higher than $750,000 a year, and it will only  reduce it by 15 percent.   So I ask the Senator to modify her request so the text of her  amendment be modified with the changes at the desk.    I object.
