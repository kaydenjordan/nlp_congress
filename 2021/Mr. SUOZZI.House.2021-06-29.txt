 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, tonight, over the next hour, I, along with  my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, will rise to advocate for  the repeal of the unjust and unfair SALT cap and the full restoration  of the SALT deduction. There are five basic arguments that I, along  with my colleagues, will flesh out over the next hour.   One, the SALT cap was specifically and unjustly targeted against the  residents of New York, New Jersey, California, Connecticut, Illinois,  Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania,  Virginia, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and other congressional districts with  high local and State taxes.   Two, middle-class families, which in these States can earn between  $100,000 and $200,000 per year, are disproportionately impacted in a  negative way.   Three, these same middle-class families, as well as wealthy families,  are incentivized by the loss of the SALT deduction to leave States with  high State and local taxes, thereby leaving a gaping hole in the  revenues that are used by these same States to fund their programs.  When wealthy individuals and families leave our States because they  have been incentivized to leave because of the loss of the SALT  deduction, it is middle-class and low-income people who are left behind  to hold the bag. Because of the gap in revenues, they will either face  higher taxes, which is unacceptable and unsustainable, or reduced  services, which is unlikely.   Four, the SALT cap is anti-union because one of the main reasons that  taxes are higher in SALT States is because we pay our teachers and our  public safety and our civil servants significantly higher wages than  our low-tax competitor States.   Five, many States with high State and local taxes that have been  negatively affected by the SALT cap are net donors to the Federal  Government. That is, these States contribute more to the Federal  Government in income taxes than they receive in Federal programs and  contracts. They are donor States.   Why are the taxes higher in New York, California, and other SALT  States? Why are the taxes lower in Florida, Texas, and other low-tax  States?   The reason for our higher taxes is because we insure our children.  New York State and California have some of the lowest rates of  uninsured children in the Nation, while Texas and Florida have some of  the highest rates of uninsured children in our country. We adopted the  Affordable Care Act; they refused to.   Our States have the highest rates of union employees. Our low-tax  competitors don't like unions. In fact, they actively oppose them. They  have right-to-work laws. They don't pay their teachers well.   In States like New York, we have one of the greatest mass transit  systems in the world that delivers the lowest carbon footprint per  capita of any city in the world. In California, they have been  implementing policies to address climate change for decades. Yet, in  low-tax States, they have no mass transit to speak of, and they are  still debating whether climate change is a hoax.   Secretary Yellen has said that we need to stop the international race  to the bottom by creating a global minimum corporate tax. Well, we need  to discourage a race to the bottom right here in the United States of  America.   It is cheaper not to insure your children. It is cheaper to use  nonunion labor. It is cheaper to have lax environmental regulations,  unregulated utilities that shut down in cold weather, or septic tanks  instead of sewers that cause red tide in your waterways.   Each State, each city, each laboratory of democracy has decided how  they want to govern, what services they want to provide, and how much  in taxes they will collect. By removing the SALT deduction, the first  deduction in the Federal income tax code, a deduction that has been in  place for over 100 years, by capping this deduction, we are crippling  the very States, cities, and local municipalities that are the economic  engines of our Nation.   By capping the SALT deduction, the long arm of the Federal Government  is reaching into our States and local governments to try to determine  what programs they should provide, how much they should collect in  taxes. They are breaching the covenant of federalism that has been in  place for over 100 years.   That is why, tomorrow, will be holding a press conference with the  U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the  National Association of Counties to showcase how the SALT cap is  devastating our local governments.   Last week, we held a press conference with unions to show how they  are negatively impacted by the SALT cap.   That is why, tonight, so many of my colleagues are here to join me in  our call to repeal the unfair and the unjust SALT cap.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congresswoman Kim so much and  thank her for being here this evening.   You have been hearing about the SALT cap and the effect on your  constituents. Have they been talking to you about this a great deal?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim)  for the purpose of a colloquy.    And are people talking about leaving the region because  of the effect of the taxes? I yield to the gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kim for her  comments.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell), who has been a real leader on the issue of SALT, and who has  been outspoken ever since 2017 on this issue. We are grateful to him.    Well, I thank Mr. Pascrell very much for his comments. I  wanted to mention that the gentleman served as the mayor of his  hometown. I yield to the gentleman.    And you talk about President Lincoln when the Federal Tax  Code was first adopted, and the idea was that we didn't want the  Federal Government stopping local governments and State governments  from being the laboratories of democracy.    And so they put a deduction in place for State and local  taxes so that State and local governments could govern the way they  wish.    Madam Speaker, I know that the gentleman has always been  a strong proponent for law enforcement, for the firefighters, and  public safety officials, and they are very dramatically negatively  affected by this. Is that right?    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Pascrell very much for his  comments.   I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), a good friend  and a leader, not just on this issue but in Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  on this and for being such a fierce advocate for the middle class.   I now introduce a good friend of mine from California, who really had  a district that was devastated by COVID. People lost their jobs at one  of the greatest entertainment facilities in the country, and now he  wants to tell us about how SALT is affecting his district.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal).    Madam Speaker, I just want to--some people, when they  hear you talk about this, and they hear a home worth $500,000,  $600,000, $700,000, $800,000, they think, boy, that person must be  really rich.   What they don't seem to understand is that in my State, in your  State, and many of the States represented here, those are actually  middle-class home values.    So we have to recognize that the country is not the same  all over. If you make $150,000 in your household, you are in the top 20  percent of the income earners of the country.   However, if you make $150,000 in your district or my district, you  are not a rich person. If you make $150,000 in Oklahoma or in Iowa or  North Dakota, you may be a wealthy person. So we have to recognize  these regional differences.   People say: Well, why should we be subsidizing what you are doing?   And the gentleman points out so clearly in what he just spoke about  that we are, in fact, in our States, subsidizing the rest of the  country. We are net donors and they are net takers.    I thank the gentleman for being such a fierce advocate.   Madam Speaker, I want to travel across the country from California  now  [[Page H3295]]  to New Jersey, to another fierce advocate; someone who served in the  U.S. military as a Navy helicopter pilot for 5 years both in the Middle  East and in Europe; someone who has been one of the fiercest advocates  for the reinstatement of the SALT deduction.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms.  Sherrill).    Congresswoman, you have been an amazing advocate. You  mentioned in your remarks at the end there about this being a double  tax. Can you tell us a little bit about that?    So you are getting taxed on the taxes you have already  paid.    So if a family makes $100,000 in your State, and they  have to pay $20,000 in taxes, between their property taxes and their  income taxes, that leaves them with $80,000 of that income.   However, if they are in a low tax State where they don't have as good  services, they start with $100,000, but they only pay $5,000 in State  and local taxes, they have got $95,000 left in income.    But they are being taxed the same at the Federal level.    Madam Speaker, now I want to go across the aisle again to  Congresswoman Michelle Steel from California, who is also being  accosted by her constituents. They are talking to her about the fact  that they need the SALT deduction back.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Steel).    Congresswoman, thank you so much for being here tonight  and for speaking out on this very important issue. We are grateful for  your presence here tonight.   Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to go to the middle of the  country, to the State of Illinois, where my good friend who serves on  the Ways and Means Committee really is one of the brightest minds in  Congress today, who wants to speak to us about the SALT deduction and  its effect on his district.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider).     Congressman, I want to thank you so much. You hit on the  topic of fairness so many times. Many of our States and our local  governments have relied on this deduction for literally a hundred  years, and it was suddenly taken away in 2017. It has had a dramatic  effect.   Can you briefly touch on fairness one more time?    Thank you, Congressman. It really galls me sometimes when  I hear people boasting about the fact that they are leaving our States  and moving to other States, when, in fact, we are subsidizing the rest  of the country with our tax dollars. Thank you so much for your  leadership on this issue. We are very grateful.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Porter), one of the most progressive Members of the United States  Congress, and also one of the great intellects who has been so  passionate about this issue and has some very interesting things to  share with us.    Congresswoman, I ask you, please go into it a little bit  further about this concept of double taxation. We have heard it several  times here tonight. Just explain what you mean by double taxation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the Congresswoman for a colloquy.    It is very important, Congresswoman, what you point out.  This is a mandatory payment. You are not spending the money to go on  vacation; you are not spending money to go out to dinner; you are not  building an addition onto your home. This is a mandatory expense that  you must pay, as you said, to your county, to your village, or to your  State. That is no longer available to you.    In other States where the overall income is exactly the same, but the  mandatory taking is much smaller, the tax bill is not as burdensome.    Congresswoman, I want to thank you so much for being  here. We have had some Republicans across the aisle here tonight. We  have had some moderate Democrats here tonight. And we have progressive  Democrats, such as yourself, here.   I think it is important that we point out that actually the SALT  deduction  [[Page H3297]]  is in keeping with progressive policy, because it supports those States  that want to promote progressive policies within their States.    Congresswoman, thank you so much. We really appreciate  you being here this evening to talk about this.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer), back across to the other side of the country, one of my  neighbors and good friends who serves as the chair of the Problem  Solvers Caucus. He has been one of the strongest advocates for the  reinstatement of the SALT deduction and the repeal of the SALT cap.    Congressman Gottheimer, thank you so much for pointing  out all of those important points.   I want to go back to one thing that you have mentioned here tonight.  We have heard from Senator McConnell and from others the concept of a  blue State bailout, the idea that the SALT deduction is some sort of  advantage for blue States. But you talked about how your State is  actually a net donor to the Federal Government.   Could you tell us a little bit more about that?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman for a colloquy.                                time  2030     Madam Speaker, Mr. Gottheimer has been a great champion  on this issue. I am grateful to him for pointing that out.   I know, in the case of my State of New York, in the past 5 years, New  York has sent $150 billion more to the Federal Government than they  have received back in Federal services or Federal contracts, whereas  Mitch McConnell's State in the past 5 years, this same period, they  have received $150 billion more in services and contracts than they  have put back into the system.   The gentleman's advocacy on this issue has been stellar. I am  grateful to him for being here tonight.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time that my colleagues  and I have had tonight to make these different points.   I want to close by saying this is about fairness. It is not fair.   It is not fair that the State and local tax deduction has been in  place for over 100 years so State and local governments have relied on  this deduction in order to fund the programs that we have.   It is not fair that people are being taxed on taxes that they have  already paid.   It is not fair that the taxes that are being paid in these States are  no longer deductible on people's income tax returns.   It is not fair that, after all these years of relying on this  deduction, it is no longer in place, and my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have been boasting about people leaving my State and  going to their States while we are, in fact, subsidizing those very  States.   This is a battle that is going to continue. Hopefully, over the next  few months, we will be able to build a coalition, together, of  Democrats and Republicans who recognize that this unfairness has to be  addressed and that we need to restore the State and local tax deduction  for the benefit of the residents of my State and people throughout the  United States of America who are relying on basic fairness.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
