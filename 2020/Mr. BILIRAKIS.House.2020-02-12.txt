 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the birthday of  the great Abraham Lincoln, an attorney, a Congressman, and the 16th  President of the United States.   In this day and age, let us honor President Lincoln by remembering  his words: ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.''   While these words rang true 3 years before the Civil War, they are  just as true today, Madam Speaker. As we move past the cloud of  impeachment, let us come together and remember why we are here in this  Chamber: to serve the American people. That is why we are here.   Let today be the day that we come together and serve the people of  our great Nation in a way that would make Abraham Lincoln proud.                            ____________________
