 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the launch of  the 50th Upward Academy at the Tyson Foods plant in my hometown of  Zeeland, Michigan.   This unique in-plant educational program offers empowering resources  and courses to all workers at no cost.   By partnering with local community organizations, Upward Academy  provides team members the opportunity to access important classes, such  as English as a second language, general education development, and  citizenship courses.   The academy also includes multiple components focused on workplace  skills and professional training to develop talent, especially in rural  and marginalized areas.   Through programs such as drivers' education, computer technology, and  financial literacy, Upward Academy brings knowledgeable experts  directly to workers so they can move beyond entry-level jobs and  receive valuable qualifications so that they can perform at even higher  levels.   The 50th launch of the Upward Academy will open the door for all team  members to strive beyond their current situations.   Tyson Foods and Upward Academy's commitment to cultivating a modern  workforce that is prepared for the 21st century helps our community  grow stronger and make west Michigan a better place to live, work, and  raise a family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the ranking member allowing  me this time.   Let's set aside the moral and societal aspects of cannabis and the  debate and acknowledge that we have a problem. We do have a problem. We  have States that have decided to violate Federal law; and within those  States, we have banking institutions and businesses that are operating  within the confines of the State, however, that are still in violation  of the Federal law.   Now, here is what we do agree on: We need to have a goal of  predictability for these financial institutions and for these  businesses. However, I don't believe that this bill will ultimately do  that because the Federal Government still views this as a schedule I  substance.   I had an amendment in committee, as the author of the bill well  knows, that would have forced alignment with all of the various  regulators. I think at the time, my recollection is, we counted 13  different Federal regulators that touch these institutions in one way  or another.   The answer to that was, well, in the bill, we have a requirement that  they are going to agree with each other within 180 days.   Well, this is not going to come as a surprise to those watching on C- SPAN. We can't collectively tie our shoes here in Washington in 180  days, much less get through something that complicated.   My amendment said that this would go into effect only when and if all  of the regulators could agree to the language of how to deal with it. I  still think that is the right way to go.                                time  1645     There is a big difference we know between industrial  hemp and recreational cannabis. The only way for us to really get at  this issue and provide predictability to the companies, to the  financial institutions, and to our citizens is to have the full debate  about whether marijuana and cannabis should be a schedule I substance  or not. It is time for this full debate to happen, and I look forward  to it.    Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 545 and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 546.                            ____________________
