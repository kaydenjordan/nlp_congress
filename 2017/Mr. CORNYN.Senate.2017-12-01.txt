 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up and reported by number: Cruz No. 1852, Kaine  No. 1846; further, that following disposition of the Kaine amendment,  Senator Manchin be recognized to offer a motion to commit and that  there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on the  motion.    Mr. President, what our friend from West Virginia is  proposing is to make the United States uncompetitive in a global  economy.   Right now, we have the highest tax rate in the industrialized world,  and what we are doing is lowering that tax rate to make us competitive  and in so doing, taking the advice of Barack Obama in his 2011 State of  the Union message; advice from the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer;  and Senator Wyden, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, who has  recommended a lower rate than that contained in this motion to  recommit.   We think we should take the advice of President Obama, President  Clinton, Senator Wyden, Minority Leader Schumer, and other prominent  Democrats--the advice they have given us over the last few years to  lower these corporate rates and make us more competitive so we can  bring jobs back home, improve wages, and get the economy growing again  so people can pursue their American dreams.   I would encourage our colleagues to defeat this motion to commit.
