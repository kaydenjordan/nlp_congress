 Mr. Speaker, Saturday marked one month since the  massive protests in Nicaragua began against Ortega's dictatorial  regime: 76 people have been killed, 868 have been injured, and 438 have  been detained. Torture and degrading treatment have been reported, as  well as media censorship and other forms of persecution, to prevent  citizens from participating and exercising their God-given human  rights.   The message is clear: The Nicaraguan people want Ortega out of power.  They are calling for free, fair, and transparent elections, with  credible international observers, and they want them now.   The U.S. can, and should, use all of our tools to aid the people of  Nicaragua in their fight to end the repression and reinstitute  democratic order.   I urge the administration to sanction those responsible for these  abuses, and I will be submitting names of individuals who should be  subject to immediate sanctions.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass  my NICA Act now to help the people of Nicaragua.                            ____________________
