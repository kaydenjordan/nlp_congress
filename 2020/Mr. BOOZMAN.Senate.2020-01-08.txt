 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Izard County Sheriff Earnie Blackley. Sheriff Blackley passed away on  January 4, 2020, after a brief battle with cancer.   He first joined the Izard County Sheriff's Department in 1993 after  having previously worked as a police officer in Greenville, MS, and  served as chief deputy for 18 years before being elected sheriff in  2018.   Sheriff Blackley was a dedicated law enforcement official; a devoted  husband, father, and grandfather; and a man of faith. His obituary  noted how he was known for hosting fish fries to benefit a variety of  causes and organizations. The outpouring of love and support shown to  the sheriff and his family since his diagnosis is a testament to how  well he served his community and how much that service was recognized  and appreciated by all it impacted.   After being diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in May of last year,  Sheriff Blackley asked for prayers as he faced this serious diagnosis  head on while also continuing to serve. Over 1,000 people reportedly  turned out to a fundraiser in his honor shortly thereafter.   Sheriff Blackley was clearly a leader who inspired love, confidence,  and respect. I am tremendously grateful for his decades of service in  law enforcement and for the way he lived his life.   I join with many in his community and across the State of Arkansas in  mourning his passing and praying for his loved ones, including his wife  Theresa, during this difficult time. On behalf of everyone in Arkansas,  I pray  [[Page S90]]  God will bless the Blackley family and the people of Izard County as  they cope with this loss and celebrate the life of Sheriff Earnie  Blackley.                            ____________________
