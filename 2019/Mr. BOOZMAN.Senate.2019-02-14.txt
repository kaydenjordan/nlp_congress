 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, it is no secret that the 116th Congress  got off to a rocky start as we tried to address the ongoing partial  shutdown. Despite that, I remain optimistic that we can work together  to get things done for the American people.   Those looking for an example of how to find common ground should look  no further than the important work Congress has done, and continues to  do, for our veterans. The hearing room of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee is traditionally one of the most bipartisan places in  Washington. It is also one of the busiest.   Last Congress, under Chairman Isakson's leadership, we held 30  hearings, considered 56 pieces of legislation, and sent to the full  Senate 17 of President Trump's nominees to serve our veterans.   That spirit of cooperation continued here on the floor. During the  last session of Congress, the Senate passed 23 major pieces of veteran- related legislation. As a result, the President signed into law bills  that significantly enhance healthcare, education, retirement, and other  benefits for our veterans.   I want to talk briefly about two of the more notable measures--the VA  MISSION Act and the Forever GI bill--to underscore why it is so  important for Congress to operate in a collaborative manner. Bipartisan  oversight of the Departments and Agencies that implement the laws we  pass in that Chamber is critical to ensuring that the executive branch  follows the intent of Congress. These two laws highlight just how  important that is.   Let's start with the VA MISSION Act. This law was passed to replace  the Veterans Choice Act, which was created in response to the VA Health  Administration scandal of 2014. This was a good first step. The Choice  Program addressed many shortcomings within the VA system. However, my  colleagues and I quickly learned it had its own share of troubles.  Specifically, we heard repeated stories of difficulties navigating the  complex and confusing bureaucratic process. Despite the new reforms,  many veterans were still facing unacceptably long wait times at VA  medical centers.  [[Page S1354]]    Through our oversight of the Choice Program, we recognized that more  needed to be done to strengthen and streamline VA healthcare services  and its community care programs. That was the genesis of the VA MISSION  Act. One of the key reforms in the VA MISSION Act is that it enables  veterans to seek quality healthcare services in their own communities,  whether inside the VA system or from a private sector provider.   Specifically, the law requires the Department to establish access and  quality standards that will be used as the framework for the VA and the  veteran to decide when to get care in a VA facility and when to get  care in the community. If the VA is unable to meet certain designated  access standards, veterans will be given the option to receive care in  the community. Last week, the VA announced the proposed new access  standards to determine a veteran's eligibility for the community care  that will take effect this June.   I am pleased that the VA maintained the spirit of the law in its  proposed access standards. We understood that by providing additional  access to community healthcare resources, there would be an added cost.  As chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction  over the VA, the entire committee will be closely working with the  Department and my colleagues. Together, we will have the responsibility  of making sure that the allocation of resources to support veterans'  healthcare is spent wisely.   Oversight is also crucial to uncover negligence on the part of the  Agencies charged with implementing the law. This is exactly what  happened when the VA failed to fully comply with the housing stipend  rates set by the Forever GI bill.   Passage of the initial GI bill after World War II was seen as a  turning point in the way our Nation treated those who have served. The  program is designed to give service men and women the building blocks  they needed to succeed after leaving the military. The problem is,  those building blocks have changed in the 70-plus years since the GI  bill was first instituted. Since then, Congress modernized the GI bill  when it passed the post 9/11 GI bill. After 17 years of war, it was  once again time for an update.   The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act--also known  as the Forever GI bill--brings educational benefits to veterans so that  they can receive them in this modern era. It became apparent, however,  that the VA was implementing key provisions of the law incorrectly.  When Secretary Wilkie testified before the VA Committee last September,  I pressed him about the Department's failure to fully award the housing  allowances for more than 340,000 Forever GI bill beneficiaries.   According to the statute, the VA should have used the Department of  Defense's 2018 basic allowance for housing rates. This should have been  calculated based on the ZIP Code where the student takes the majority  of classes, rather than on the ZIP Code in which the school's main  campus is located. Instead, some GI bill recipients were receiving  housing stipends at the 2017 rate and based on the school's ZIP Code.  This was clearly unacceptable.   Once it was evident that the VA was not following the statute,  Congress had an obligation to act. That is why Senator Schatz and I  introduced the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act to  demand an immediate fix from the VA. That bill became law within a  matter of weeks from its introduction.    With this law, what we are asking of the VA is really threefold. The  first is to make every unpaid or underpaid veteran whole. The second is  to be accountable for the errors that have happened and prevent them  from recurring in the future. The third is to fix the problems to  prevent them from recurring so that we will not go through this problem  again. It is promising to see that the VA has begun to carry out some  of the requirements that have been dictated in the Forever GI Bill  Housing Payment Fulfillment Act.   The VA recently announced the members of the tiger team that the VA  is required to assemble per the statute. For those who are unfamiliar  with the term, a tiger team is a team of specialists tasked to achieve  a specific goal. In this case, it is comprised of six senior benefits  and IT officials at the VA who will be tasked with providing Congress a  detailed plan to correct this egregious error. Hopefully, the move to  quickly establish this team is reflective of the seriousness with which  the Department takes this mandate. It is frustrating that it has taken  another act of Congress to get to this point, but all of us are  committed to ensuring that the VA follows the law as written.   In a spirit of cooperation, the leadership of the congressional  committees who oversee the Department recently sent a letter to  Secretary Wilkie to request that the VA work collaboratively with  Congress throughout the implementation process. This message was echoed  during a recent subcommittee hearing I chaired about the VA's  implementation of a modern, commercial, electronic health record. It is  important to ensure that the VA is able to share information with the  Department of Defense and community healthcare providers while it  undertakes the largest health record modernization project in the  Nation's history. With all of the reforms getting underway  simultaneously, it is vital for the VA to share information openly,  even predecisional information, so that we can work together and have a  common understanding of the impact of changes, including costs, and can  assess the challenges that may arise.   The laws we pass in this Chamber are a key part of our legacy, but  our oversight responsibilities are of equal importance. The bipartisan  manner in which the Veterans' Affairs Committee works to uphold that  oversight responsibility sets an excellent example for the rest of  Washington to follow.   We appreciate the hard work of Secretary Wilkie and that of his team  and all of those in the VA system who work so very hard on behalf of  our Nation's veterans. In working together, we can ensure that veterans  receive the benefits they deserve and were promised.   I yield the floor.
