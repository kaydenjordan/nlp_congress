 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and  colleague, Representative Pete Olson, for partnering with me to colead  this Special Order tonight on the benefits of natural gas and liquified  natural gas exports, especially as the United States prepares to hold  the World Gas Conference next week.   I am honored to share this floor time with Mr. Olson to talk about  this very important topic, and I also want to thank many of my  colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for participating in  this Special Order tonight to talk about this important topic.   I represent rural eastern and southeastern Ohio, which is no stranger  to the benefits of natural gas. My district sits on top of, as  Representative Olson just mentioned, the Utica and the Marcellus shale  plays, which have led to a growing interest in new and exciting  manufacturing opportunities like ethane cracker plants and ethane  storage opportunities.   In fact, one recent report led by Shale Crescent USA and IHS Markit  forecasts that this region will supply 37 percent of the Nation's  natural gas production by 2040. This same report forecasts that natural  gas liquid production from these two plays will increase from 0.53  million barrels per day in 2017 to 1.37 million barrels per day in  2040, an increase of over 150 percent. Other studies predict that the  region has sufficient ethane feedstock to support up to five ethane  cracker plants.   These opportunities are huge. These are massive construction  projects, putting upwards of 10,000 construction workers to work over a  6-year period, with upwards of 1,000 permanent employees once those  plants go operational.   Additionally, ethylene projects within the region will have a  comparative advantage because of the access to ample supplies of  locally produced, low-cost ethane and because of the fact that the  region is in close proximity to over two-thirds of U.S. polyethylene  consumption. And that is only half the story.   The economic and geopolitical benefits of exporting our excess gas  are equally exciting as these benefits are helping to encourage oil and  gas activity throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.   As you will hear from multiple colleagues tonight, the U.S. is now  the world's leading producer of oil and natural gas, and we are  projected to become a net energy exporter by 2026. Natural gas  production is at an all-time high, and reserves are so large that they  are predicted to meet domestic demand for almost a century.   Ohio alone reached new heights in October of 2017 as natural gas  production reached 5.5 billion cubic feet per day. Simply put, we must  do everything we can to take complete advantage of this abundance, and  that includes LNG exports.   However, the window of opportunity for American LNG exports will not  remain open indefinitely. The U.S. is in fierce competition with other  LNG-exporting nations, and if America misses our opportunity to get  into these international markets in a big way, our share of the global  gas market could be greatly reduced. Subsequently, opportunities to  support our national security and strengthen the energy security of our  allies through American LNG will diminish as well.   So we must continue to elevate and promote the United States as a  reliable source of natural gas onto the world market, which will  diversify our friends' and allies' energy sources, greatly reduce their  vulnerability to a single monopolistic supplier, and change the  conversation at the table with the likes of Russia's Vladimir Putin.    Additionally, studies have found that LNG exports support thousands  of American jobs, many of them within manufacturing. ICF International,  Inc., estimates that these jobs will occur across the entire value  chain, translating into millions of dollars in new wages for American  workers.   In fact, the Department of Energy once again highlighted the benefits  of LNG exports with a study it released just this past week. This  study, which is in addition to four other studies commissioned by DOE  since 2012, presented data that demonstrates just  [[Page H5352]]  how LNG exports are a net benefit to our economy.   Additionally, these exports increase our GDP. They lower the trade  deficit. And it is for those reasons, these reasons, that I have led  the effort to ensure the U.S. does all it can to take advantage of our  ability to export natural gas.   Most recently, the Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 4606,  the Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act, out of committee  in a bipartisan fashion. I was proud to author this bill, which seeks  to codify the Department of Energy's recent efforts to encourage  exports of small volumes of natural gas.   There is a significant interest in potential for U.S. natural gas in  the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, although not in the  quantities that the current large-scale domestic exporting facilities  were built to address via conventional liquefied natural gas tankers.  H.R. 4606 will help the U.S. to act on these interests through greater  regulatory certainty and a reduction in administrative regulatory  burdens.                                time  1730    Now, when I first came to Congress in 2011, I worked hard to advance  the idea that energy independence and security are the next great  frontiers for America.   Today, energy independence and security have been replaced by a new  concept. Mr. Speaker, you have heard Representative Olson mention it,  and you have heard Chairman Walden mention it. It is called energy  dominance; and with it, all the global economic and geopolitical  implications that come with being the king of the energy hill.   Such an energy vision that harnesses America's innovative  exceptionalism will lead to new discoveries and technologies around  domestic energy production, storage, distribution, and usage; and will  lead us to greater economic prosperity and job growth.   I am excited to help further that vision which includes natural gas  and LNG exports. I am excited for all the great opportunities that lie  ahead for our country, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on  those benefits tonight.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas mentioned  it; Chairman Walden mentioned it; Mr. Barton mentioned it. We should be  celebrating, and that is what we are doing here tonight. All America  should be celebrating the good fortune that we have to be blessed with  such an abundance of natural gas.   In my home State of Ohio, and many other areas in the Midwest and  Appalachia, the production of natural gas and its valuable liquid  byproducts is providing a much-needed boost to our local economies.   Let me give you some figures. From 2011 to the end of May 2018, we  had drops in unemployment in the counties that comprise my 18-county  district by more than 48 percent. Some of those counties, especially  the ones that have the heavy shale plays, have seen drops of  unemployment upward of 60 percent. It is unbelievable.   In addition to the direct benefits, the natural gas industry also  supports hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs across the country  and supplies our industries with a reliable and affordable source of  domestic energy.   Next week, as thousands of visitors and dignitaries from around the  world arrive here in D.C. to attend the World Gas Conference, we should  reflect on  [[Page H5354]]  our country's energy dominance--you have heard that term several  times--and how that affects our standing on the world stage.   According to the Energy Information Administration, the United States  has remained the world's top producer of natural gas ever since 2009,  when we surpassed Russia in production levels.   Additionally, last year, we set a record in natural gas production,  with gross withdrawals reaching almost 91 billion cubic feet per day.   I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, this is a big deal for America. It is  charting the way for a new future of energy dominance and leverage not  only in the economic energy markets, but also on the international  stage.   So there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about where America is  going on the energy front because of natural gas.
