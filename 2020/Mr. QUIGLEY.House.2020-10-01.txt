 Mr. Speaker, in sports there are many ways to honor  great players. Most sports have all-stars, MVP honors, and halls of  fame.   In some cases, teams choose to retire the number of their biggest  stars to recognize their careers and legacies. But in a few rare cases,  a league can choose to retire a player's number for every team.   That is how Major League Baseball chose to honor the monumental  achievements and impact of Jackie Robinson's iconic No. 42. And that is  why the NHL should retire Willie O'Ree's No. 22.   Willie is recognized as both an ambassador and a pioneer of the  sport. O'Ree broke the NHL's color barrier and helped end segregation  in professional hockey. He changed the game for the better, and he  deserves this distinguished honor.   He made his debut in the NHL in 1958. His groundbreaking journey  through the NHL inspired hundreds of other players, both men and women,  and laid the groundwork for Hispanic, indigenous, and Asian players in  the NHL, as well as the growth of the women's game.   But what makes Willie O'Ree's impact more impressive is the global  impact he has made in the sport of ice hockey. There is no better way  to say this: If Willie O'Ree had not broken the color barrier when he  did, thousands of young hockey players would not be exposed to this  sport.   Hundreds of organizations that provide inner-city youth opportunities  to develop and expand social skills would not be here today. Athletic  skills and professional skills through the sport of ice hockey would be  drastically reduced, and the hockey community in the United States  would remain far too homogenous.   In short, without Willie O'Ree, there is no American hockey culture  that embodies and reflects the diverse makeup of our country. That is  why I was proud to introduce the Willie O'Ree Congressional Gold Medal  Act in this Congress to celebrate this man of profound strength who  pushed the sport to embrace diversity and promote inclusion for all.   I hope you will join me in cosponsoring this resolution that  highlights Willie's incredible moral character, impeccable hockey  skills, and contributions to American history and culture.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing Willie's jersey retired in the  near future, and for Willie to celebrate this special moment with his  family.                            ____________________
