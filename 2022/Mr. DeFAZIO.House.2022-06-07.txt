TITLE VI--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 601. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7776, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this will be the fifth consecutive 2-year authorization  of the Water Resources Development Act since 2014, a tradition revived  by our former chair, Bill Shuster.   I am grateful for the partnership of Ranking Member Sam Graves,  Subcommittee Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, and Subcommittee Ranking  Member   David Rouzer for all their work in developing this historic  Water Resources Development Act.   This legislation builds on the successes of previous water bills,  moving projects from feasibility to construction. This 2-year cycle is  critical to addressing future water resource needs of our Nation.   This bill authorizes construction of 18 reports of the Chief of  Engineers that were studied and transmitted to Congress since the last  water bill was signed into law. These Chief's reports represent  thoroughly vetted, locally driven projects with highly engaged cost- share partners. Corps projects  [[Page H5290]]  cover a myriad of purposes from navigation, flood control, levees,  ecosystem restoration, that will benefit communities all across the  United States of America.   The bill also authorizes 72 new feasibility studies and directs the  Corps to expedite the completion of 14 ongoing studies. It is critical  that we keep our infrastructure in this Nation up-to-date with new  challenges--with severe weather events, sea level rise, and other  things--and deal with the challenges that communities across this  country endure.   For two decades, I spent two decades--actually, I started longer than  that--Bud Shuster in 1996--trying to free up the Harbor Maintenance  Trust Fund. That is a tax paid by shippers, which ultimately is passed  on to consumers on the value of imported goods which have been  impounded for years, totaling nearly $10 billion, while our harbors  need dredging, jetties need rebuilding. We finally got that done in  2020. That was historic.   It gives the Corps more resources on the harbor side, which means  they can devote a little more of their allocation to the inland  waterways and to their other 40-some-odd billion dollars of backlog of  critical projects across the country.   It will meet the challenge of climate change by rebuilding these  navigation jetties and breakwaters to new heights and dimensions  necessary for sea level rise and extreme weather. It will study the  impact of coastal storms on inland flooding--which is a particular  concern of the ranking member--address future water supplies in the  arid West, which is a particular concern of all of us in the West, but  particularly those further south and the chair of the subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, 21st century challenges should have 21st century  solutions. The Corps has been hamstrung in their ability. We have  worked with other Members who have heard similar concerns. We included  a solution in this bill that will allow the Corps to be the innovation  expert they need to be to address our Nation's ongoing new challenges.   I am also proud it will continue building upon efforts to provide  equitable project outcomes and flexibility for communities with  affordability concerns. It will address the needs of economically  disadvantaged minority rural Tribal communities in an affordable  manner.   In particular, the bill creates a Tribal liaison position within each  Corps' district office. The Corps often fails to consult meaningfully  with the Tribes. Tribal leaders will have a direct line of  communication now into the regional office and back to the national  office to get consultation, technical assistance, and information to  them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Subcommittee Chairwoman Napolitano and  Representative Stanton for their tireless work advocating for our  Tribal communities.   For the first time in over a decade, it significantly expands the  Corps' environmental infrastructure authorities to assist more  communities in addressing drinking water and wastewater needs. We need  major work in these areas. Communities all across America--red, blue,  whatever--are suffering, and we need these tools to help them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Napolitano for her effort to help the  Corps with flexibility and additional authorities that will help them  meet future water supply needs of the arid regions of this Nation. We  are rationing the Colorado River for the first time in history this  year. Her input and advocacy also brought many of the environmental  justice provisions to this bill--support for Tribal communities. She  has been a tireless advocate for meeting the needs of her district and  her State and the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sam Graves--I couldn't have asked for a better  partner working on this bill--for his steadfast support which has made  it possible. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) for  his support and wise input on the bill before us today. Their input  brought in critical perspectives.   We had the subcommittee vice chair from Georgia, Representative  Bourdeaux, who brought recreational safety concerns at local dams to  our attention. We had the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams), who  supported a watershed-wide study of the Chattahoochee River.   I thank the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Kahele), who was an ardent  advocate of native Hawaiians and ensuring their participation in  activities. I thank the gentleman for giving us new perspectives on  that. Representative Newman of Illinois worked hard for all the Great  Lakes.    Representative Carter came to the table with fresh policy and project  ideas to help Louisiana deal with natural disasters, sea level rise,  and severe weather events.   Mr. Speaker, this is essential legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to support it. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of  organizations that support H.R. 7776, totaling 51 very diverse  organizations. I am certain there are more.

Mr. Speaker, may I ask as to how much time remains on my  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Hawaii (Mr. Kahele).    Mr. Speaker, I again inquire as to the remaining time  just to check here. We are tight on time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has done some extraordinary work  for her district and Florida on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Most of what we do here would not be possible without the hard work  of staff, so I would like to take a moment specifically to thank the  staff of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment that took  the lead in developing WRDA 2022 and ensuring that Members' priorities  and national priorities were included: Ryan Seiger, the staff director  of the subcommittee, who worked to enact more of WRDA than any other  staffer on Capitol Hill; Alexa Williams; Logan Ferree; Michael Bauman.  On the minority side: Ryan Hambleton, the minority staff director;  Leslie Parker; Tim Petty; and Melissa Beaumont. Without them and their  work, we would not be here today.   Paul Sass has already been thanked a number of times, but I  congratulate him on his 20 years on the Hill and wish him well in his  next endeavor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 88) authorizing the use of the  Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 88         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring),       SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES.         (a) In General.--The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby       Association (in this resolution referred to as the       ``sponsor'') shall be permitted to sponsor a public event,       soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the       ``event''), on the Capitol Grounds.        (b) Date of Event.--The event shall be held on June 18,       2022, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration       of the Senate jointly designate.       SEC. 2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.         (a) In General.--Under conditions to be prescribed by the       Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the       event shall be--        (1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and        (2) arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.        (b) Expenses and Liabilities.--The sponsor shall assume       full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident       to all activities associated with the event.       SEC. 3. EVENT PREPARATIONS.         Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol,       the sponsor is authorized to  [[Page H5297]]       erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound       amplification devices, and other related structures and       equipment as may be required for the event.       SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.         The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board       are authorized to make such additional arrangements as may be       required to carry out the event.       SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.         The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of       the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40,       United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements,       displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well       as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with       respect to the event.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 88.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are again considering legislation, H. Con.  Res. 88, to authorize the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater  Washington Soap Box Derby. I thank Majority Leader Hoyer for  introducing this resolution on behalf of the Washington regional  delegation.   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is an annual competitive event  that encourages boys and girls, ages 9 through 16, to construct and  race their own soap box vehicles.   On Capitol Hill, the event has become a great tradition in the  Washington, D.C., metropolitan area over the last quarter of a century.  It provides a terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the  workmanship necessary to build the vehicles and enjoy the thrill of  competition.   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the  Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police to ensure appropriate  rules and regulations are in place and the event remains free to the  public and safe for all those involved.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to  join me. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader and sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I thank the majority leader for bringing this legislation. I  misspoke earlier. I thought it had only been a quarter of a century. It  has been 29 years.   That is extraordinary, and this is a wonderful event for youth. It  does bring a little something to Capitol Hill other than the day-to-day  business, which can sometimes be suffocating.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation unanimously, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
