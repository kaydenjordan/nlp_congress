 Mr. President, America is very involved in a war in  Yemen, and it is time we have a debate as envisioned under our  Constitution.   Our Constitution did not lay out the power of deciding when to go to  war with the executive branch. It places it  [[Page S1812]]  very clearly here, with article I, Congress is to act, but we have  participated very directly, in partnership with Saudi Arabia, in the  assault on Yemen, on the Houthis, and the result is a dramatic,  dramatic humanitarian crisis. So we should absolutely hold that debate  on this floor, as envisioned in our Constitution.   Article I, section 8 states, unequivocally, that ``the Congress shall  have Power . . . to declare War.'' It is only Congress that is given  this power under our Constitution.   If anyone has any doubts, then let's pay attention to the other words  of our Founders, James Madison himself: ``In no part of the  constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause which  confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to  the executive department.''   The Founding Fathers' vision was reinforced by the War Powers  Resolution of 1973, also often referred to as the War Powers Act. That  act was necessary because the executive branch tends to put our forces  into conflict without the permission of Congress, in violation of the  Constitution. So it is important to lay out the parameters under which  they are allowed to do so under emergency action and the circumstances  under which they are not allowed to do so.   The War Powers Act says: ``It is the purpose of this joint resolution  to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United  States and insure that the collective judgement of both the Congress  and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed  Forces into hostilities.''   It goes on to say that ``the constitutional powers of the President  as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into  hostilities . . . is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are  exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific  statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack  upon the United States.''   In the case of the Saudi war we are participating in against the  Houthis, it is not triggered by an attack upon the United States, nor  is there any specific statutory authorization--that is why we are going  to have this debate today--nor is there a declaration of war.   So the standards of the War Powers Resolution have not been met, and  I call upon my colleagues to shoulder your constitutional  responsibility to have this debate and hold the Executive accountable  when they are violating the law of the United States of America.   There are two components to our presence in Yemen which should not be  confused. One is where we are directly involved against forces  associated with al-Qaida. This debate is not about that. The  administration contends and we do not dispute today whether that is  covered by the 2001 authorization for use of military force.   I think many of us feel that initial 2001 AUMF, authorization for use  of military force, has been stretched beyond recognition. That is a  debate for a different day. This argument is directly about our support  of Saudi Arabia in bombing the Houthis in Yemen. That is the central  question.   For us to understand why this is so important is, one, the integrity  of the Constitution. If we do not hold the Executive accountable to the  Constitution of the United States of America, then we are essentially  taking that key, critical clause that gave us responsibility for when  military force is used by the United States out of the Constitution and  delivering it to the Executive. That certainly is not the vision. If  people want to have that vision, they will introduce a constitutional  amendment to that point. Introduce a resolution to declare war to make  this action in concert with the Constitution. Create specific statutory  authority in concert with the Constitution. But do not fail your  constitutional responsibility to hold this debate.    The War Powers Resolution lays out clearly that our participation in  the support of foreign forces engaged in hostilities is engagement  under the vision of our Constitution and certainly under the law of the  War Powers Resolution. It says under section 8:         Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into       hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in       hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall       not be inferred--(1) from any provision of law . . .       including any provision contained in any appropriation Act,       unless such provision specifically authorizes the       introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.    Again, specific authorization is required.   It goes on. In this section titled ``Interpretation of Joint  Resolution,'' it states:         ``[I]ntroduction of United States Armed Forces'' includes       the assignment of member of such armed forces to command,       coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the       regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country .       . . in hostilities.    Clearly, the law states that our engagement, our coordination with a  foreign power engaged in war, is covered by this act. Our participation  in the movement of their military forces into hostilities is covered by  this act.   Therefore, we have to understand the details of our engagement.   First, the United States refueling the Saudi planes as they go to  bomb the Houthis is very directly participation in the movement of  military forces into engaged hostilities. We are refueling the planes  en route. How can that not be participation in the movement? Certainly  a plane is a part of a military force. Certainly refueling it is  participation in the movement of that plane. Could this be any clearer?  This is black and white. Not many things are. In terms of the violation  of the War Powers Resolution and the offense against our Constitution,  this is black and white.   Second, we provide intelligence.   Third, we provide the weapons.   Fourth, we provide targeting assistance.   Fifth, we established a joint combined planning cell operation center  to conduct military and intelligence activities in partnership with  Saudi Arabia.   All of that fits into this direct section of the War Powers Act  regarding coordination or participation in the movement of a foreign  force engaged in hostilities. If this were a minor involvement--it is  not. We have participated thousands of times in this manner. On a daily  basis, we are involved in coordination.   The airstrikes Saudi Arabia is conducting have produced one of the  worst humanitarian situations in the world. Think about the reports on  these different strikes.   There were 3 airstrikes in Sa'dah last month, killing 5 civilians and  wounding 14 more, including 4 children, as well as killing the  paramedics who were trying to pull the survivors out after the first  bomb dropped.   We had a strike on a hotel last August that turned the building's  ceiling black with the charred blood of 50 farmers who were in that  building.   It is one horrific circumstance after another as these bombs drop on  civilians in Yemen. It is time for us to reckon with the fact of our  participation in this carnage. This carnage has resulted in 10,000  Yemeni civilians killed, and there are 8 million people on the brink of  starvation. Why is it that humanitarian aid has not gotten to those  folks? Because Saudi Arabia has blocked it. We are partnering with a  country that is blocking humanitarian aid. Does that square with the  principles of the United States of America, to participate in  partnership with a country starving 8 million people?   Then we have the fact that the Saudi bombs have been dropping on the  infrastructure of Yemen, and they have destroyed the water systems.  When you destroy the water systems, the sewage contaminates the fresh  water, and a direct consequence of that is cholera. At this moment, the  cholera epidemic in Yemen has affected 1 million people. That is the  single largest cholera epidemic in the recorded history of mankind.   There are 8 million people starving and 1 million people sick with  the worst cholera epidemic ever. We are participating in creating this.   To my colleagues who say Saudi Arabia has partnered with us against  ISIS, fine and good, as they should. However, this issue is different.  This is about whether we are helping them and participating directly in  the hostilities of dropping bombs on civilians, Houthis, and creating a  massive famine and a massive cholera epidemic and massive deaths. A lot  of children are dying every day.  [[Page S1813]]    The Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency  Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, warned that this famine could become  ``the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions  of victims.''   Every day, about 130 children die from hunger and disease. We pride  ourselves on going to the assistance in the world when children are  being slaughtered or starved or decimated by disease. In this case, we  are participating in this carnage. Does any Member of this Senate want  to stand up and say that is an appropriate mission for the United  States to participate in, this carnage? I certainly hope not.   The death and destruction in Yemen is unimaginable. It is appropriate  that we debate on the floor the Sanders-Lee-Murphy resolution, a  bipartisan resolution to say: Let's honor the Constitution. Let's abide  by the 1973 War Powers Act. Let's hold the administration accountable  because it is not just this issue--although this issue is massive--it  is also the standard by which the Executive will operate in every  potential war theater around the world for a decade to come.   If we proceed to say that it is OK that you trample the Constitution  in Yemen, that you disregard the War Powers Resolution in Yemen, then  we will be giving carte blanche to this administration to do so in one  nation after another. We have long abdicated our responsibility. Let's  abdicate no more. Play the role, the responsibility the Founding  Fathers gave us in the Constitution, and bring an end to our  participation without authorization in this horrific conflict.                            ____________________
