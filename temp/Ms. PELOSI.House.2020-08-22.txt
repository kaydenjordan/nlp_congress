 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her kind words  of introduction, but I most importantly want to thank her for being the  champion, the champion in defense of the Postal Service. I rise to join  her in support of the Delivering for America Act, to protect lives,  livelihood, and the life of our American democracy during a critical  moment for our Nation.   I thank you, Madam Chair, again, for the intellectual resource you  have been in shaping the legislation, for making us current in terms of  the reports from the Postal Service, what is at stake, and why this  legislation, Mr. Speaker, is so important.   I salute House Democrats for their enthusiasm, energy, and insistence  on delivering for America. Since day one of the postal crisis, they  have conveyed the concerns of their communities to Congress, holding  events, accelerating a drumbeat, and shining light on this crisis.   I am going to talk about three things, Mr. Speaker and Madam Chair  and Mr. Ranking Member. This is about the provenance of the postal  system and how important it has been to America, also what the  challenges are in delaying service and, therefore, why this legislation  is so necessary.   First, let me say that, in the Constitution of the United States, it  says that Congress shall have the power to establish post offices and  post roads, Article I, Section 8. So the post office is there in the  Constitution.   But even before that, it has been a pillar of American democracy. It  is an all-American institution, which enjoys the overwhelming support  of the American people for a reason. Again, enshrined in the  Constitution, an inseparable part of our national story, helping  transition America from colonies to country.   In the early 1770s, our Founders relied on the precursor of the  Postal Service, the Committees of Correspondence, to educate people  about the abuses of the British and to build support for independence.   Even before the Declaration of Independence was signed, the  Continental Congress had established the Postal Service as one of the  first and most important offices that would be part of the new  government.   Two of our U.S. Presidents, Abraham Lincoln and Harry Truman, would  proudly hold the title of postmaster. One of our Founders, Benjamin  Franklin, was the Postmaster General. Actually, he established the  Postal Service.   So this goes to the heart of our country and the connection that the  Postal Service, throughout our history, from the very start, has been  in tying our country together.   In the early 19th century, when visiting America to write his great  book, ``Democracy in America,'' Alexis de Tocqueville praised the  Postal Service as being the great link between minds, writing that not  ``in the most enlightened rural districts of France there is an  intellectual movement either so rapid or on such a scale as'' this, as  the Postal Service.   So it has been excellent from the start, part of the unity of  America.   As we all know, the postal motto states: ``Neither snow nor rain nor  heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion  of their appointed rounds.''   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure that those  courageous couriers are not stayed from their constitutional duty to  serve the American people.   I join you, Madam Chair, in saluting the patriotic men and women who  risk their health and safety to serve the American people every day:  our postal workers, our letter carriers, and all who may bring us  together.   There is a second postal motto inscribed above the original  Washington, D.C., Post Office, and this is really so clearly what the  Postal Service has been about:         Messenger of Sympathy and Love        Servant of Parted Friends        Consoler of the Lonely        Bond of the Scattered Family        Enlarger of the Common Life        Carrier of News and Knowledge        Instrument of Trade and Industry        Promoter of Mutual Acquaintance        Of Peace and of Goodwill Among Men and Nations.    Our Postal Service is the beautiful thread that connects our country,  delivering sympathy and love, news and knowledge, peace and goodwill.  And as a grandmother, I will say, we have seen our children and  grandchildren write their letters to Santa; we have seen messages come  from the tooth fairy; we have seen photos and drawings of families  taking joy in each other that no amount of social media can convey.   So, again, we must honor their service with our full support and  protection and gratitude for what they mean in our lives.   Today, the Postal Service--and this is why this is so important that  we have this legislation--provides critical services for Americans in  every corner of the country: for our workers, delivering paychecks and  tax returns; for our seniors, ensuring Social Security benefits; for  small businesses, providing shipping and essential services; for  millions of Americans, particularly rural Americans, delivering 1.2  billion prescriptions, including most of the medications delivered by  the VA.   In 2019, 1.2 billion prescriptions were delivered by the Postal  Service, and that was before the coronavirus hit.                                time  1645    That was before the coronavirus hit.  [[Page H4294]]    And for voters: Delivering absentee ballots and election mail, which  is essential, especially during the coronavirus epidemic. No one should  be forced to choose between his or her health and the right to vote.   Across the Nation, though, the Postmaster General is pushing sweeping  new operational changes that degrade service, delay the mail, and  threaten to disenfranchise voters, particularly in communities of  color.   Now the Postmaster says he will postpone any further changes until  after the election, that is what he says. But this is about more than  the election. This legislation is written in a timely fashion to be  about the coronavirus, and these changes should be there until the end  of January or the end of the raging epidemic, whichever is later.   It is in that regard that I rise as Speaker to support the  legislation. But as a representative of my district where I am not  called Madam Speaker, I am called Nancy, this is what they have told  me.   Michael said, he is a veteran with epilepsy. He reports that  prescriptions sent by the VA through the mail are taking twice as long  to arrive.   Walker says, he is a senior with debilitating health conditions, is  now struggling to send and receive his mail after his closest mailbox  was suddenly removed.   Claire, an 83-year-old with serious chronic illness, who does not  have a car and is afraid to use public transport during the pandemic,  is in a panic because she is utterly dependent on USPS for her  medication and other vital deliveries, and of course, her ballot.   Another San Franciscan, Charlotte, warns that the Postal Service is  vital to our country, not only when it comes to mail and voting, but  also for fundamental needs of Americans.   And as Mark, another constituent, puts it, not only does what Trump  is doing put the integrity of the November elections at risk; people  are suffering every day, and they are not receiving their critical  medications.   That is what I am hearing from my constituents, and they are told to  go to the drug store. Well, they really can't in some cases. It  endangers them to go to the drugstore, instead of getting it through  the mail. Go to the drugstore.   So, again, this is immediate in their lives. We are their  representatives. That is our job title and our job description. In  representing my constituents, I wanted to convey some samples of  concern that we have heard.   Earlier this week, in response to the activism of the American  people, people have risen up, I have never seen anything quite like it.  The Postmaster General announced changes that are wholly insufficient  and do not reverse damage already wreaked. He said to me, frankly--and  I have to give him credit for his honesty--he said, I have no intention  of replacing the sorting machines that were removed from the post  offices;   I have no intention of replacing the blue mailboxes that have been  ripped from our neighborhoods; and   He has no plans for ensuring adequate overtime, which is critical,  critical for the timely delivery of the mail.   He said he has no intention of treating ballots as first-class mail.  Now, yesterday he said something different, but that is what he told me  a couple of days ago.   And I said to him, We will have the provision in the bill that  requires you treat ballots as first-class mail. And he said, Well, if  it is in the bill, then I will have to do it. Hence, his change of  attitude.   He has not adequately addressed America's concerns about the slowdown  and the delivery of medicine to veterans. He just didn't even seem to  know about it. Really?   Today, Chairwoman Maloney released new internal post office documents  that expose the severity of the service declines and delivery delays  caused by the Postmaster General's drastic changes.   These documents make clear that the Postmaster General has  deliberately misled Congress and the American people about the extent  of the damage, brushing them off as a dip in service or as unintended  consequences. These revelations show that we cannot have confidence  that the Postmaster General is prioritizing the Postal Service or the  millions who rely on it.   Now, the House is moving forward with a, hopefully, bipartisan vote,  and I think it will be, on Delivering for America Act, which will  reverse the Trump damage and provided $25 billion to the United States  Postal Service.   Sadly, the administration has already threatened to veto this  legislation, which contains the same amount of funding, the $25  billion, that was recommended by the United States Postal Service Board  of Governors. They are bipartisan. They are 100 percent appointed by  Donald Trump, and they unanimously recommended the $25 billion that is  contained in this bill.   So for the sake of every senior who is delayed in getting his or her  Social Security check, every veteran who is delayed in getting his or  her medication, every working family who is delayed in getting their  paycheck, and every voter now facing the prospect of choosing between  their vote and their health, we need to pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for H.R.  8015, the Delivery for America Act. Let's pass this under the  leadership of distinguished Chairwoman Maloney for the people.
