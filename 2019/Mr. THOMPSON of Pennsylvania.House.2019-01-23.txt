 Madam Speaker, northwest Pennsylvania  has a rich history and a vibrant, diverse economy. Its winding trails,  beautiful landscapes, recreational experiences, and thriving  communities make Venango and Crawford Counties especially captivating  places to live, to work, and to visit. Many of these attractions are  centered around the same central common theme: the world's first  commercial oil well.   Colonel Drake successfully drilled this well in 1859, triggering the  first oil boom and establishing the Oil Region as ``the valley that  changed the world.'' His efforts not only made northwest Pennsylvania  the energy powerhouse that it is today, but also sparked a cultural  revolution that came as a result of a booming economy.   We are tremendously proud of our history and heritage in northwest  Pennsylvania. We still celebrate these historic communities that  bloomed from Colonel Drake's innovative idea, and Drake Well continues  to have a tangible impact on the area's economy.   In 2004, Congress designated the region as a national heritage area.  There are only 49 of these areas across the country that are designated  as places where natural, cultural, and historic resources combine to  form a cohesive nationally important landscape.   The Oil Region national heritage area was the Nation's 25th national  heritage area, and it celebrates the birth of the petroleum industry.  The region is honored to have this important designation, but without  action, it will sunset next year. That is why I have introduced H.R.  642, the Oil Region National Heritage Area Reauthorization Act.   The heritage area's coordinating entity, the Oil Region Alliance of  Business, Industry, and Tourism, has taken a grassroots, community- driven approach to heritage conservation and economic development.  Through public-private partnerships, national heritage area entities  support historic preservation, natural resource conservation,  recreation, heritage tourism, and educational projects. These  partnerships foster pride of place and an enduring stewardship ethic.   The Oil Region Alliance focuses on heritage development, economic  development, and tourism destination marketing. All three of these  areas have been successful, and from 2005 to 2015, ORA has been able to  invest more than $6.8 million in heritage development projects, invest  more than $6.7 million in economic development activities, and attract  nearly 240,000 visitors, annually. They have done an excellent job  using innovative methods to stimulate the local economy, using a  mixture of both Federal and private funds.   Last year, Congressman   Mike Kelly and I visited the home of the  legendary investigative journalist Ida Tarbell. Born in Pennsylvania at  the onset of the oil boom, Tarbell is best known for her 1904 book,  ``The History of the Standard Oil Company.''   The ORA had recently completed a full restoration of Ms. Tarbell's  home, ensuring that it would be preserved for generations to come. This  restoration was just one of many projects the ORA is working on, and my  bill will allow these projects to continue through 2026.   Extending this funding is crucial for the ORA to continue its mission  of preserving the Oil Region's history, stimulating the local economy,  and allowing others to appreciate the beauty and culture of Venango and  Crawford Counties.   The ORA's efforts give us the ability to appreciate the rich history  of northwestern Pennsylvania and understand the impact that our  community has had on American culture today. I urge my colleagues to  cosponsor this legislation, which will directly impact northwestern  Pennsylvanians and preserve a rich heritage for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last Friday, more than  100,000 Americans came to Washington for the 46th annual March for  Life. This year's theme was ``Unique from Day One.''   Those who march envision a world where the beauty, dignity, and  uniqueness of every human life are valued and protected.   Thanks to the pro-life movement, abortion rates across the country  are at the lowest since 2013. Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  remains one of the top protective States in the Nation to provide legal  protections for human life from conception to natural death, according  to the Americans United for Life.   Many of my colleagues have introduced legislation in this Congress to  advance the pro-life cause and to protect the unborn. I am proud to  cosponsor many of these bills, including the Defund Planned Parenthood  Act, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the Sanctity of Human  Life Act, the Protecting the Dignity of Unborn Children Act, and the  Life at Conception Act.   Mr. Speaker, we must always be a voice for the voiceless, and we must  continue to build a culture that values  [[Page H1012]]  life and respects mothers and their children, both born and yet to be  born.                            ____________________
