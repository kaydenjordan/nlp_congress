 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of  Mr. James M. Cooper to Indiana's State banking system and in  recognition of his retirement from the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors, or CSBS. Jim has been an essential member of the CSBS team  for over 10 years, first leading the CSBS policy and supervision team  and, for the past 18 months, serving as president and chief executive  officer of CSBS, bringing direction, leadership, and compassion after  the sudden death of former CSBS president and chief executive officer  John W. Ryan.   During his tenure, Jim helped to advance the State system's strategy  for strengthening and streamlining State regulation, known as Networked  Supervision, and provided stability during a time of stress for the  banking system. Jim brought innovation to State supervision and CSBS's  core mission, particularly advancing data and analytics for the State  system.   In Jim's 40-year career, he proved himself to be a dedicated public  servant to the State of Indiana. After graduating from Hanover College  in Hanover, IN, he had a distinguished 30-year career at the Indiana  Department of Financial Institutions, where he served as deputy  director from 1994 to 2013. In that role, he oversaw the supervision  and examination of all State-chartered depository institutions in  Indiana, including banks, credit unions, corporate fiduciaries, savings  banks, and savings associations.  [[Page S5995]]    Throughout his career, Jim has worked diligently to ensure a safe and  sound financial services environment, including during the most  tumultuous times in our economy. During the great recession and the  more recent 2023 bank closures, Jim showed his steadfast ability to  manage a difficult situation and minimize the effects of disruption  within the industry.   I know Jim will be missed by CSBS and the entire State banking  system, and I wish him the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
