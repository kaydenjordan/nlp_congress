 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of International  Women's Day, A Day Without a Woman strike. Today we are here and are  joined by many of our sisters around the Nation to declare, once and  for all, that women's rights are human rights. We are here to stand in  solidarity with women across the country to send a clear message: We  will not rest until we create a society where all women--all women-- have equal rights under the law.   We are resisting and letting President Trump and the Republicans know  that we will not go back. We stand with the millions around the Nation  who have walked out today, and today we are walking out for them. We  are raising our voices for the millions of women who can't because they  might get fired or because they can't afford to lose their meager  wages.   I encourage all of my Democratic colleagues to join us, along with  Leader Pelosi, the Democratic Women's Working Group, Congresswoman  Katherine Clark, and so many others, for a walkout following these 1  minutes and attend the press conference on the House steps right  outside in solidarity and in honor of all of the women in the world who  are marching today and striking today for equal rights.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Mr. Visclosky for yielding.  I also thank him for his tremendous leadership as our ranking member,  and giving us all an opportunity to really voice our opinions and put  our points of view forward in a very fair way.   I rise in opposition to this bill, however.   I offered two amendments to this bill, the fiscal year 2017 Defense  Appropriations bill, and I am really disappointed to once again see  that my amendments were not made in order. I want to explain these two  amendments because this is the only chance that we will have to talk  about this.   The first amendment, which I have offered several times on a  bipartisan basis, would prohibit the funding for the 2001 Authorization  for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, beginning on September 30, 2017.  And mind you, that 6-month window provides Congress ample opportunity  to draft and debate a new AUMF and to vote it up or down.   Clearly, Congress is required to act. This amendment would require  Congress to finally debate and vote on nearly a 3-year-long war that is  raging in the Middle East, a war that has already claimed the lives of  several brave servicemembers. The House simply cannot continue to  abdicate its constitutional responsibility to give the American people  a voice in matters of war and peace.   I offered another amendment, which would prohibit funding for United  States combat troops in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment was really simple, but, once again, I am  sad to say that it was not made in order. This amendment would use the  power of the purse to prevent funding for combat operations in Syria,  unless the purpose is to rescue or protect members of the Armed Forces  from danger.    We can all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, but  Congress continues to be missing in action from this debate.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    We know that the 2001 authorization was specific to 9/11.  And I voted against it because I knew it would be broadly interpreted,  which it has been. Sadly, it is a blank check for war. Actually, the  Congressional Research Service provided us a declassified report  saying--and this was last year--it had been used over 35 times. Nothing  related to 9/11. So this blank check needs to be repealed.   We also know that ISIL didn't even exist in 2001. Every day, more  bombs fall and the battlefield expands. We have already spent billions  of dollars against this unauthorized war.   Congress needs to show up for work, muster its courage, exercise its  constitutional responsibility for debate, and vote on the ongoing war  in Iraq and Syria. We owe nothing less to our brave men and women who  are in harm's way. It is past time to force a debate and vote on this  issue. Hopefully, one day we will make these amendments in order and,  hopefully, we will have bipartisan support to just move forward and do  our job as Members of Congress, which is what the Constitution  requires.
