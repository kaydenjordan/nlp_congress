 Mr. Speaker, since March, I have traveled my  district, administering COVID-19 vaccines. As a doctor and former  Director of Public Health, I combat vaccine hesitancy by discussing the  safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, and the benefits of returning  to normal lives, removing our masks, gathering together, and reopening  businesses and schools by attaining herd immunity.   But the deepening mental health crisis has become an epidemic within  the pandemic. Yesterday, I read of yet another youth suicide. Eighteen- year-old star quarterback Dylan Buckner, with plans to attend MIT,  committed suicide on January 7. His father said that the Illinois  extended stay-at-home orders and school closures greatly contributed to  his suicide.   As leaders, it is our responsibility to encourage and incentivize  vaccinations. One incentive is by removing our masks and returning to  normal. Despite having reached the traditional level of herd immunity  by our Members, our Chamber does not reflect a return to normal.   I implore leadership and the Attending Physician to follow science  and the CDC guidelines, and permit Members who have been vaccinated or  who have naturalized immunity to forgo wearing a mask while in the  Chamber, and incentivize and show the public that a world beyond the  pandemic exists.   Not another minute should go by where children as young as 9 years  old commit suicide because they see no hope of a future beyond the  pandemic. We cannot waste another second or another young life.   Let us remove our masks and show America that there can be a light at  the end of the pandemic tunnel.                            ____________________
