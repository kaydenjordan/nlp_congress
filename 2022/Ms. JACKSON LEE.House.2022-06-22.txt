 Madam Speaker, we are in the midst of many  elections, primary elections and ongoing to November 2022.   I salute our election officials because what we saw yesterday in the  January 6 hearings was appalling and disgraceful and an attack on  democracy. From the speaker of the House of Arizona to the elections  officers in Georgia, pain was exhibited from being violated, violently  attacked by words, and threatened.   I remember the words of the election official from Georgia saying: I  don't even want to give my card out or give my name.   Both she and her mother are targeted. These are just people who are  Americans who want to serve their country. What an outrage.   As we continue to listen to the January 6 proceedings, let us take  them very seriously. Those who engage in this kind of outrageous  behavior, an attack on the flag of the United States, must be held  accountable.   My heart goes out to the election officials and the speaker of the  Arizona Legislature, whose daughter was sick while his house was being  attacked.   We cannot do any less than to hold those accountable, accountable  because this is a disgrace to the American flag.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. As I  begin--I am going to ask the chairman to enter into a colloquy--but,  first, let me express my strong support for H.R. 7666 and the work that  has been done in a bipartisan manner by both the chairman and the  ranking member, and the importance of the issue of dealing with opioid  addictions and other addictions that require this additional work. I am  gratified to rise to support that.   I thank Chairman Pallone, and ask, as I said, that he engages in a  colloquy with me on the need to support the mental health needs of  trauma victims impacted by trauma and, yes, mass  [[Page H5780]]  shootings. I think I have been here in the United States Congress  during Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Mother Emanuel, Santa Fe,  Parkland--and the list goes on--and tragically Uvalde with 19 children,  2 adults, and 1 individual who died of heartbreak. I was in Uvalde, and  I saw the impact on our children, to see 9-year-olds--9-year-olds-- crying and saying that because I spoke to them, they said you are  making me happy because you spoke to me, and you said you care. Out of  the mouth of a 9-year-old.   So we know there is a mental health crisis as relates to the trauma  of those who certainly are survivors and those who are in the  community.   We also know that too many families and children in this country are  hurting from the preventable epidemic of gun violence, shootings, and  mass casualty events. These tragic events have lasting scars on the  families, friends, and communities. I have seen this pain with my own  eyes. And so I am interested in--as my amendment that I withdrew  indicated--is there a prioritization of those children who are impacted  by trauma?   Madam Speaker, I would like to be able to work with Chairman Pallone  on this issue. Will the gentleman yield for the purpose of a colloquy?    I thank the chairman for answering my questions  regarding the Restoring Hope Act that there will be provisions for  mental health care and services for children, families, and communities  who experience these traumatic and violent events.   I look forward working with the chairman on these vital resources.  With your partnership I would like to continue to work with you and the  administration to ensure that when this legislation is enacted, the  needs of the vulnerable victims and those closest to them are in the  front of our minds.   Will the gentleman commit to working with me on this matter?    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support.  I will support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as a staunch advocate for mental health services  to speak in favor of the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well- Being Act of 2022.   This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  critical mental health programs for those dealing with mental health or  substance abuse disorders.   H.R. 7666 works to mitigate some of the most pressing issues of our  time by designating grants, expanding the availability of high-quality  recovery housing, reauthorizing treatment programs, and combatting  substance abuse.   In 2019, an estimated 10.1 million people in the U.S. aged 12 or  older misused opioids in the past year. Specifically, 9.7 million  people misused prescription pain relievers and 745,000 people used  heroin.   The bill eliminates a key restrictive classification of opioid  addiction so that access to treatment programs is expanded.   These issues disproportionately impact tribal communities. According  to the American Addiction Centers, 10% of Native Americans have a  substance use disorder.   H.R. 7666 specifically funds the prevention and treatment of mental  health and substance use disorders for tribal populations.   This is a needed step in protecting a community with a history of  being mistreated by the Federal government.   This bill's expansion of access to mental health care services, most  importantly of all, would make these services much more available to  children and adolescents, who must always be our top priority.   For example, this bill increases mental health services for our youth  by integrating behavioral health into public education in primary  schools and creating a grant for pediatric mental health services.   This legislation also addresses another pressing issue that afflicts  young Americans: eating disorders. As many as 10 in 100 young women  suffer from an eating disorder.   H.R. 7666 provides federal funding for the identification and  treatment of eating disorders.   But, above all, Mr. Speaker, who among all of our children, need  mental health services more than those who have just experienced the  unconscionable? Senseless shootings leave our students, some as young  as five years old, devastated and vulnerable.   As adults, the thought of having our peers murdered in front of us is  disturbing. How much more traumatizing would that be for pre-school  students?   This bill acts as a conduit for protecting children who are victims  of a mass shooting or mass casualty event.   Mass shootings, especially school shootings, can leave lethal and  obvious physical wounds on victims.   However, the long-lasting and subtle mental trauma is the invisible  scar left on many survivors. Friends, family, and classmates often  suffer with extreme guilt and sadness.   There have been 278 mass shooting in this year alone. Firearms are  now the leading cause of death for children and teens.   In addition to those tragically killed, millions more are left  behind, coping with these deaths. An estimated 3 million children in  the US are exposed to shootings per year.   Since Columbine, there have been 337 school shootings and 311,000  students have experienced gun violence at school. Even more disturbing,  just since Uvalde, there have been 65 mass shootings.   This is not a one-state issue. From the 28 killed at Sandy Hook in  Connecticut, to the 17 killed at Marjorie Stoneman-Douglas in Florida,  to the 10 killed at Red Lake in Minnesota, to the 22 killed at Robb  Elementary in my home state of Texas, school shootings have become a  disgusting norm.   Children exposed to violence, crime, and abuse are more likely to  abuse drugs and alcohol; suffer from depression, anxiety, and  posttraumatic stress disorder; fail or have difficulties in school; and  engage in criminal activity.   These children don't stay children forever. These mental health  struggles translate to a life of pain and suffering where crime, drug  use, and suicide are more likely.   This trauma has real consequences: in the year following the 2018  massacre at Stoneman-Douglas High school, two students took their own  life after suffering with the mental anguish of the events they had  lived through.   Passage of this bill will not solve the gun crisis or mass shootings  in this country. Only common-sense gun-control will do that.   However, this bill will set a foundation for the government to  address the toll of gun violence on children's mental health.   Additionally, enactment of this legislation demonstrates Congress'  support of victims of mass casualty events by prioritizing access to  mental health services.   Children are the future of our country. Far too many of them have  their hopes and dreams stripped away by senseless shootings.                                time  1500
