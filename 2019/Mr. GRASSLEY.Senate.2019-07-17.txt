 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, in honor of Anti-Counterfeiting Consumer  Education and Awareness Month, I wish to highlight the problem of  counterfeits sold online.   Counterfeiters are increasingly turning to e-commerce to sell all of  their fakes. In the past, I have advocated for increased education and  awareness efforts because I believe these efforts and education are  critical tools in our country's arsenal against counterfeits.   I encourage our Customs and Border Protection to identify ways to  increase information sharing with their private industry partners. This  is one way we can prevent the sale of fakes and keep consumers safe.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
