 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today to  defend a woman's right to choose. I rise to say that I am totally,  completely, and absolutely opposed to Senator Graham's bill.   I rise to say that Senator Graham's bill would deny a woman the right  to choose, that it is a bill that is antithetical to the best interests  of women.   I stand with the women. I support their right to choose. A woman  ought to have the opportunity to consult with those who are closest to  her, including her physician, to make this medical decision. Senator  Graham would deny this.   I stand with the women, and I stand for a woman's right to choose.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  time, and I say to the gentlewoman that it has been a preeminent  privilege to serve with her for lo these many years; indeed,  superlative pleasure. I miss you already. Thank you for what you are  doing.   I am grateful to my colleague, Chairman Connolly. I see this as  another example of his legislative brilliance: to make a decision that  will allow people to succeed on their merits or fail on their demerits,  to take the political patronage out of the civil service system.   The civil service system functions efficaciously across the length  and breadth of this country. Police departments and fire departments  across the country that have civil servants provide the institutional  knowledge. They have the expertise. Mr. Speaker, you don't want to just  throw out all the best of the best that have been working there and  understand what the system is all about.   Every new person who comes in would like to bring in people to  support his or her political philosophy. I support your having people  to work with you, but I don't support destroying a system that allows  us to have the institutional knowledge to keep the government  functioning efficaciously.   This patronage system that has developed under F has been a failure,  and it is little more than fatuous folly that will prove to be harmful  to this country.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 302, and I beg that my colleagues would  do so, as well.
