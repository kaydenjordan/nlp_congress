 Mr. President, today, negotiators from the White House,  Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans will continue negotiations on  a national security supplemental package. Yesterday, we had another  round of productive conversations, and there was more progress. But of  course, there is more work to do, and we are going to keep at it and  keep at it.   Last night, I filed cloture on a couple of nominations to the Federal  bench and the Department of Justice, with possible votes on these  nominees as soon as tomorrow.   To my Republican colleagues who have said action on the border is  urgent: Let's keep working to find a solution instead of rushing for  the exits. If Republicans are serious about getting something done,  they should not be so eager to go home. This may be our last best  chance to get this legislation done.   After weeks of deadlock, we have seen significant progress over the  past few days, and we should take advantage of the opportunity because  we may not get one for quite a while. It is not easy to reach an  agreement on something this complicated. But so much hangs on our  success, so we need to try with everything we have.   The world is watching what Congress does right now. Our friends are  watching. Our adversaries are watching even more closely. And most of  all, Vladimir Putin is watching closely. He is eager to see us abandon  Ukraine and thinks he is getting that done, working, in part, through  Donald Trump.   Here is what Putin said a few hours ago about American aid to the  Ukraine:         [T]he free stuff is going to run out someday, and it seems       it already is.    That, Mr. President, is Vladimir Putin taunting the Senate, taunting  America. While Congress is mired in gridlock, Putin is on the other  side of the world mocking our resolve.   In generations past, this would have been a no-brainer. Democrats and  Republicans would have bent Heaven and Earth to stand up to Russian  dictators. We spent half a century, spent billions and billions and  billions of dollars, lost lives to safeguard the free world against the  malicious spread of communism, against tyranny, and against those who  undermine our values. Now we find ourselves at another moment in  history when democracy is under siege.   We heard directly from President Zelenskyy 2 days ago about what is  at stake if we fail. So fail we must not. There is too much on the line  for Ukraine, for America, for Western democracy to throw in the towel  right now. We must keep talking. We must keep working.   Our Republican friends must be reasonable. They must show they are  serious about getting something done, and we have had serious  discussions in the last few days. Democrats are willing to keep trying.  I urge my Republican colleagues to do just the same.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Now, Mr. President, over the last few days, negotiations  on a path forward to getting a national security supplemental done have  made good progress. As I have said, if we believe something is  important and urgent, we should stay and get the job done. That is  certainly the case with the supplemental. It is important. It is  urgent.   I spoke with Leader McConnell this morning about the plan for next  week and making sure the Senate continues to do our work.   So, for the information of all Senators, after we finish today, the  Senate will return on Monday. That will give negotiators from the White  House, Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans time to work through  the weekend in an effort to reach a framework agreement. It will then  take some time to turn that framework into text.   To prevent unnecessary delays, I intend to move to reconsider the  shell for the supplemental, as a vehicle, to move an agreement forward.  The plan is for the Senate to act as soon as we are ready to move  forward on the supplemental.   Members need to be here next week. We have to get this done. Our  Republican colleagues who have said action on the border is so urgent  should have no problem with continuing to work next week. We hope to  come to an agreement. But no matter what, Members should be aware that  we will vote on a supplemental proposal next week.   Mr. President, it is not easy to reach an agreement on something this  complicated. This might be one of the most difficult things we have  ever had to work through. But we all know that so much--so much--hangs  on our success. We know the world is watching. We know autocrats like  Putin and Xi are  [[Page S5986]]  hoping for us to fail. So we need to try, with everything we have, to  get the job done.   I will update Senators when more information about schedule becomes  available.                       Nomination of Jerry Edwards, Jr.     I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tonight, just in time for the holidays,  the Senate is giving our military, our military families, a present:  the justice and backpay they so richly earned and deserved. Finally, we  are able to right the wrong of Senator Tuberville's illogical, hurtful,  and dangerous holds and the massive impacts the holds had on military  families.   These men and women have worked so hard for our country for so long.  And just because of Senator Tuberville, in a really nasty--and  whimsical, almost--holding back of their promotions, they weren't  getting paid.   Well, tonight, at long last, we are giving these military families-- families that have already sacrificed so much--the justice they  deserve: their backpay. And it is a good night for them, and it is a  good night for America. America is keeping its promise and saying to  these men and women: You served us well. You don't deserve to be  penalized in any way at all.   And so, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S.  3553, introduced earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  three times and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 214, 431, and  432; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
