 Madam Speaker, we are in the depths of the  Biden energy crisis.   On day one of Joe Biden's Presidency, he launched his war on American  energy when he killed the Keystone XL pipeline, which could be  supplying 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to U.S. refineries.  As recently as a few days ago, we imported 600,000 barrels of oil from  Russia.   During the State of the Union, President Biden claimed he wanted to  ``Buy American.'' But regrettably, he did not apply that to our oil or  our natural gas. Biden has made it crystal clear that his anti-energy  agenda would continue.   He also announced that he would once again tap into the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve and release 30 million barrels of oil in another  desperate attempt to reduce gas prices here at home. The SPR is  supposed to be used for national security emergencies and  [[Page H1279]]  for major weather events, not for Biden to use as a political Hail Mary  when his policies fail us. Energy security is national security.   Let me say this: Winston Churchill said appeasement is like feeding a  crocodile and hoping he eats you last. We must stop appeasing Russia.  We must be Churchill in this moment, not Chamberlain.                            ____________________
