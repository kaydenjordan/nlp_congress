 Mr. Speaker, as we respond to the Coronavirus pandemic,  it's crucial that we don't forget the 22 million children who rely on  free or reduced-priced school lunches.   For many kids, it is the only meal they get each day. It is our  responsibility to ensure that kids continue to get the meals they need.   I'm proud that the package the House is passing today includes my  legislation--the Maintaining Essential Access to Lunch for Students  Act.   My bill gives schools that are forced to close during a public health  emergency the flexibility to implement alternate options--like home  delivery of meals--in order to ensure their students are fed.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill and ensure that no  child goes hungry due to school closures in times of crisis.
