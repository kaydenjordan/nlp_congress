 Madam Speaker, I was looking at a local news source here  today. The title of the article is: ``Heat Waves Add Burden to Electric  Vehicle Owners.'' There are challenges, as it turns out, that these  heavy, expensive batteries in electric vehicles have a tendency to get  damaged by high temperatures.   Electric vehicles are extremely complicated, and they are expensive.  Repairing EV batteries is nearly impossible, and replacing one is very  costly. A section of the article referenced a really expensive brand of  pickup that's on the market. It talked about making repairs in a fender  bender if somebody hit the rear quarter panel on it and it drove the  body work up into the rest of the forward part of the car. It isn't  just a matter of repairing that quarter panel. They had to take the  vehicle almost entirely apart, which made it a $42,000 repair because  there is so much complexity with the extensive wiring system in the  electric vehicle technology that drives all the different wheels.   We are being told as Americans that we should start driving these  vehicles. We should buy them, replace what we have, and drive these  vehicles. In my home State of California, they are basically forcing  the mandate on that, followed closely behind the Biden administration  wanting to do certain things by an X amount by year 2030. By the way,  they just make up numbers. They will say 50 percent by 2030 and 75  percent by 2035. They will do the same thing at the Federal level: X  amount by 2040 and 2050. They just make this stuff up with fancy round  numbers.    Some of the recommendations in the article about how to deal with  your electric vehicles are actually the absurd part of it. Don't park  your car in the Sun and charge during cooler times of day are some  suggestions in the article to EV drivers.   Now, I got to spend the weekend here in D.C. because my plane was  canceled going home the other day, so I am not sure how you try and  figure out when the cool time of day is in D.C. so you can charge your  car.   Another suggestion of the article was to use air-conditioning  sparingly. Sure. In places like this, or even where there is more  humidity in the South and others, you are going to drive along in this  car because it is electric and not use your air-conditioner.   One of the really good ones was that they wanted you to keep the car  plugged in while you are using the air-conditioner. What does that even  mean? How do you keep your vehicle plugged in while you are using the  air-conditioner?   People made fun of this one. Are you supposed to have an extension  cord that is 10 miles long so you can keep it charging while you are  driving around? It becomes really absurd after a while.   What is the bottom line here? For certain people, electric vehicles  make sense for them if they have short commutes or they do a lot of in- town driving, and it will last for a particular amount of time.   The article goes on to state, though, that most of the time you can  come home and plug in, and you don't need to use a fast charger, unless  you are on a long trip. If you are on an extended trip, then you are  going to have to find a means to do that. You can't just go 200 miles  and then charge it for 8 hours. However, they also don't want you to  use a fast charger because it is tough on the battery in hot  conditions.   Your mobility is really what is being affected, what is being taken  away here, and there are those in this place in the regulatory scheme  we have in my home State of California or here in D.C. that don't  really care that you have mobility. They don't want you to have  mobility. They want you to be tied to what they believe are your  walkable neighborhoods and stay in your 15-minute cities. They don't  seem to like that.   This all starts with these mandates, taking away the systems, the  things  [[Page H3617]]  that you normally use, use at your choice, and forcing you into  something else.   Whether it is your vehicles, whether it is your gas stove or other  appliances, your yard maintenance tools, they want to take that out and  convert you to a grid that is not actually ready to accept the mass  amount of charging that is going to be needed to do this again.   California's grid on many hot days is close to going down. They have  to start telling people to shut off their manufacturing plants and such  so they can keep the grid going. They are tearing down hydroelectric  dams in my district right now because they aren't green enough, even  though it makes CO2-free power.   It is absurd what is going on with the regulatory state, and we need  to stop the Biden administration by doing it just by executive action.  It needs to run through us so we are held accountable to you.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this year marks the 75th anniversary of  the State of Israel and its recreation after World War II when many  countries around the world got together and decided indeed there should  be a current Jewish state.   Now, their day of independence, known as Yom Haatzmaut, occurred this  year on April 25. It moves around in order to not conflict with the  Sabbath.  [[Page H3619]]    On the day after Israel officially declared independence back in  1948, they were attacked immediately by five surrounding Arab  countries. We see that Israel's existence is not an easy one. It is one  that requires our alliance, as they are a loyal friend to this country  as we are to them.   It is my understanding that President Issac Herzog is actually the  first native-born Israeli President since the creation of the State, so  it is only fitting that we welcome his address to the House this week.                            ____________________
