 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, Congress has long recognized the importance of Native  American Tribal cultural items and their historical, traditional, and  cultural importance to Native American Tribes.   Approximately 137 million Native American artifacts, works of art,  and specimens are in the Smithsonian's collections according to the  Government Accountability Office.   Both the Archaeological Resources Protection Act and the Native  American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act provide a legal  framework for the repatriation of human remains and cultural items to  Indian Tribes.   While these two statutes have greatly reduced the sale of cultural  items within the United States, many items have appeared in European  auctions where they have little legal protection from being sold.   In recent years, Paris auction houses facilitated the sale of Hopi,  Navajo, and Acoma Tribal masks and ceremonial items.   The U.S. Government attempted to intervene to prevent the sales, but  the French government and the auction houses maintained that they were  legal.   In response to this problem, former Congressman Steve Pearce  introduced a concurrent resolution in March of 2016 condemning these  sales and requesting that the U.S. Comptroller General conduct a report  on the issue.   The Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony Act, or the STOP Act, would  expand legal protections to Native American Tribal artifacts and sacred  objects by increasing criminal penalties for repeat traffickers of  Native American human remains or cultural items and banning the export  of illegally obtained items.   The Department of the Interior would be required to form an  interagency working group to facilitate repatriation of items and  protect items currently in an Indian Tribe's possession.   To incentivize repatriation, the bill would allow immunity from  prosecution if an individual voluntarily surrenders to the appropriate  Tribe the Native American cultural objects in his or her possession  within 2 years of enactment.   I want to thank the sponsor of the legislation for working with  stakeholders impacted by this bill, including the Acoma, the Pueblo,  the Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association, the Department of the  Interior, the Department of Justice, and others.   It is important that we protect items of cultural and historic  significance to our Indian Tribes.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage adoption of this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as the gentlewoman described, this is a very complex  issue with a long history behind it. H.R. 4352 would reverse a 2009  Supreme Court decision, Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Indian  Reorganization Act does not authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  acquire land in trust for Tribes that were not under Federal  jurisdiction in 1934 when the act was passed.   The Carcieri decision created vast uncertainty over the fee-to-trust  process for Tribes and impacted stakeholders. Since the decision was  handed down, there has been no resolution in this incredibly complex  issue.   Lands taken into trust are extremely important to Tribes. Tribes'  desire to increase their Tribal land base and help  [[Page H6733]]  their communities must be respected. There are certain benefits and  advantages afforded to Tribes having lands that are held in trust.   But we should be clear that even prior to Carcieri, the fee-to-trust  process was far from perfect. We should not ignore the larger need to  improve the process.   Many have argued the current Bureau of Indian Affairs process  provides very limited incentive for community stakeholders to be  partners and places little requirement on the BIA to analyze the  impacts of a fee-to-trust decision on nearby communities or Tribes,  often resulting in unresolved conflicts and litigation at the local  level.    For the last decade, county governments have been asking us to reform  this process. Their concerns with the tax, zoning, and community  impacts of trust land acquisition have been well documented.   While this bill addresses the immediate impacts of the Carcieri  decision, if this bill becomes law, nothing will have changed to  address the larger issues with the fee-to-trust process. Congress  should address the impacts of the Carcieri decision and enact needed  reforms to improve the fee-to-trust process. Tribes and all  stakeholders deserve as much, and I look forward to working with them  on this important issue.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 897, the Agua Caliente Land Exchange Fee to Trust  Confirmation Act, would place approximately 2,560 acres of land owned  by the Agua Caliente Tribe within the reservation into trust.   And I will agree with the gentlewoman from New Mexico. I have visited  this area, and it is a beautiful area.   The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' reservation is located  approximately 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles in and around Palm  Springs, California, with nearly 11,000 acres of the reservation within  the city limits of Palm Springs.   Originally established in 1876 by President Grant, the Tribe's  reservation only encompassed 1\1/2\ acres. Today, the reservation is  approximately 31,000 acres.   The lands in question were acquired through a land exchange with the  Bureau of Land Management in 2018 pursuant to the Santa Rosa and San  Jacinto Mountains National Monument Act of 2000. H.R. 897 would allow  the Bureau of Land Management exchange lands owned by the Tribe to be  taken into trust and made part of the Tribe's reservation. Gaming  pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act would be prohibited. The  Tribe intends to use the land for conservation purposes. According to  the Tribe, the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains hold strong  cultural and historical value to the Tribe.   I appreciate the work of the Tribe and the bill's sponsor to advance  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2074, as amended, the Indian  Buffalo Management Act, and I also thank my good friend and the sponsor  of the legislation, the dean of the House, Congressman   Don Young, for  his tireless advocacy on behalf of Indian Country.   Madam Speaker, it may come to a lot of people's surprise but in my  home State of Arkansas, in my district, we actually had buffalo herds  there at one time. And it lingers in many names around the State: The  Buffalo National River, the Buffalo Gap. There is actually a history of  buffalo in Arkansas and many other States that no longer have herds.   H.R. 2074 would authorize the Department of the Interior to establish  a permanent program to develop and promote the capacity of Indian  Tribes and Tribal organizations to manage buffalo and buffalo habitat.   The American buffalo, or bison, has long held importance to the  United States and was officially named the national mammal in 2016.  Many American Indian and Alaska Natives have also had a longstanding  cultural and spiritual relationship with buffalo, which continues to  this day.   By the end of the 19th century, however, buffalo were near  extinction. But as a result of conservation efforts, buffalo have  slowly returned, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated  that there are now 200,000 buffalo in the United States.   In 1991, several Tribes with buffalo herds joined together forming  the InterTribal Buffalo Council. The council received a Federal charter  to aid Tribes in the restoration of buffalo on Tribal lands in 2009.   Today, the InterTribal Buffalo Council is comprised of 68 member  Indian Tribes and Alaska Natives with 55 buffalo herds in 19 States  with the mission of restoring buffalo to Indian Country.   In 2019, the council received approximately $1.4 million from the  Bureau of Indian Affairs. Unfortunately, this available funding is  subject to the fluctuating appropriations and it is not dedicated to  buffalo management on Tribal lands. The council estimates that unmet  needs are in excess of $12 million per year.   H.R. 2074 would dedicate $14 million annually for the Department of  the Interior to directly support the ability of Indian Tribes to  protect, conserve, and enhance buffalo populations on their lands. The  bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into  agreements with Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations to dispose of  surplus buffalo on Federal land and transfer those buffalo to Indian  lands.   The program is intended to help Tribes and Tribal organizations plan,  conduct, or implement buffalo restoration programs, plan and execute  commercial activities related to buffalo products, and carry out other  activities related to buffalo restoration and management.    I again thank Congressman Young for his leadership on American Indian  and Alaska Native issues, and I urge support for this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I encourage passage of this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3531 offered by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton,  authorizes the Women Who Worked on the Home Front Foundation to  establish a commemorative work in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the  commitment and service of millions of women during World War II.   During World War II, roughly 12 million women worked in defense  industries and support services across the Nation. Women served in  critical professional roles in shipyards, steel mills, foundries,  warehouses, offices, and hospitals.   Women worked as codebreakers, aircraft testing pilots, trainers,  welders, riveters, telegraph operators, radio and electrical engineers,  crane operators,  [[Page H6739]]  surveyors, assembly line workers, and many other jobs that kept America  running.   In recent years, Congress established the Rosie the Riveter National  Historical Park in California to highlight the incredible contributions  of women to the war effort. Authorizing this commemorative work in our  Nation's capital is another fitting tribute to the brave, strong, and  intelligent women that helped us win the war.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers on my side,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I listened to the testimony about  the bill today, I thought about all of the women that I was around  growing up who were part of that war effort at home during World War II  and the jobs that they did that were critical to the war effort.   I think about Representative Burchett's mother from Tennessee who  flew planes in World War II. My counsel's grandmother, Mimi Hart, was a  codebreaker in World War II, and I think it is fitting that we  recognize all these women as they are getting up in years and we are  losing a lot of them.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman for bringing this bill  forward. I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4706, offered by  Representative  [[Page H6741]]  Tony Gonzales of Texas, to establish the Blackwell School National  Historic Site in Marfa, Texas, as a unit of the National Park system.   Segregation education began in Marfa in 1892 following the completion  of a new school for the city's White students. The Blackwell School  served as the sole public education institution for the city of Marfa,  Texas', Mexican and Mexican-American children from 1909 to 1965.   Known originally as the Ward or Mexican School, the Blackwell School  was later renamed for its longtime principal, Jesse Blackwell, who  arrived in 1922. During Blackwell's 25-year tenure, the school grew  from one building and 120 students to a multi-building campus and more  than 600 students.   The original historic school building and grounds provide an  authentic setting to commemorate and interpret the history of the  Blackwell School. Designation as a national historic site is locally  supported and the designation helps meet needs identified in the  National Park Services' American Latino Theme Study completed in 2013.   Madam Speaker, I highly commend my colleague from Texas (Mr. Tony  Gonzales) for his work on commemorating this important landmark. I urge  adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Tony Gonzales), the author of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I want to  encourage adoption of this bill and, again, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for his hard work in bringing this bill forward. I hope we can  all get behind it. I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, the first unalienable right named in  the Declaration of Independence is the right to life. The Preamble of  the Constitution further built the framework for this most fundamental  liberty.   ``We, the people . . . in order to form a more perfect Union,  establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common  defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of  liberty to ourselves and our posterity''--none of which can truly be  accomplished when the law allows the murder of unborn children.   The Supreme Court got this wrong in 1973 and now has the chance to  correct its mistakes and uphold the constitutional right to life. It is  absurd to argue, as the plaintiff in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health  Organization does, that our founding document can be used to prevent  duly-elected State legislators from protecting life.   The Supreme Court must right this wrong. Our Nation should never put  an unwritten right to privacy before the enumerated right to life.                            ____________________
