 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding time  here today, as these issues affect my constituents in northern  California as well. So being here to support H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act,  really pleases me because we haven't had a lot of honesty the way the  EPA has applied new interpretations of new rules to some of the folks  in my district here, that farm and ranch and other activities that use  their resources and their land in the way they see fit.   We need to ensure that the EPA rules and regulations are made using  verifiable, publicly available data and science.                                time  1430    A fundamental tenet of our Nation is that citizens have the right to  know how and why the government makes decisions and, just as  importantly, have the ability to challenge those decisions. However, we  have seen an increasing tendency of Federal agencies to refuse to  disclose the data they have based decisions on, claiming it is too  sensitive to share. Really, now.   For example, the Obama administration's waters of the U.S. rule,  which would have inserted the Federal Government into local land use  decisions across the Nation, directly conflicts with publicly available  data prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers, yet the EPA refused to  release data it claimed supported its conclusion.   Farmers, in some cases, cannot even use their land under the threat  of litigation, fines, or even arrest. Even the Army Corps of Engineers  disputes the EPA's refusal, noting, in 2015, that EPA provided no  scientific basis for its jurisdictional power grab.   Under waters of the United States, we have heard interpretations that  [[Page H2545]]  people plowing their fields could be interpreted now as a regulatable  land because that could be seen as a watershed because you now have  furrows that are new watersheds.   This is the kind of thing that needs to be heard publicly in review  of Congress and the people, not made in a back room of the EPA  somewhere. That is not an honest way of doing business. That is why  H.R. 1430 is an honest way to bring them back to the accountability we  need to have so people can have their day and have a right to dispute  nonscience-led decisions made by the EPA.   The Obama Administration did not even rely on peer-reviewed science  or on publicly available Scientific Advisory Board determinations  despite EPA claims that its effort was backed by science.   The tendency for Federal agencies to develop regulations based on  secret data is even more insidious when we note that these are not even  elected officials. They don't have to stand for election. These are  career bureaucrats who cannot be removed or even sometimes met up with  by the voters, by their constituents.   Mr. Speaker, when Americans face regulations imposed by unelected  bureaucrats and based on secret science that cannot be verified or even  viewed, how can they employ their First Amendment right to petition  their government? The answer, colleagues, is simple. They can't.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill to protect every American's  right to know how and why their government makes decisions, to protect  their First Amendment rights, to protect their property, and their  ability to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time, and I thank you for  bringing this effort and for your battle.    Madam Speaker, tonight I rise to commend the House for  passing H.R. 1430, what is known as the HONEST Act. This would put more  of the onus on to the Environmental Protection Agency, sometimes known  as the employment prevention agency, to disclose where they get their  science or where they get their reasoning when they are going to make a  regulation upon the people that produce in this country.   My own constituents have suffered from that in my district in  northern California, where arbitrary rules are put in place without  even the opportunity to face their accuser of what kind of science they  are using or what kind of reasoning they are using to put a regulation  in place that they have to fight, and fight sometimes for many years,  in order to have the opportunity just to use their land, just to use  their land for planting crops or for grazing or for other things that  would help them with their livelihood, with their economy, like they  have been using for so many years, even decades, in their families.   The HONEST Act will put accountability back on the EPA to say you  have to come forward with reasoning, with logic, and with science that  is publicly available and not hidden from the public so that we can see  what you are using to regulate the people.                            ____________________
