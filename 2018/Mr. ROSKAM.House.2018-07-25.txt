 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see the inclusion of the  Promoting High-Value Health Care Through Flexibility for Deductible  Health Plans in this bill today. This is legislation that is bipartisan  that I introduced, along with the Congressman from California (Mr.  Thompson), that gives consumers the choice and flexibility that they  need to be engaged in their healthcare.   In a nutshell, the bill allows plans to offer coverage for high- value, low-cost services like telehealth, chronic disease management  such as diabetic testing strips, or primary care visits below the  deductible. In a nutshell, what we are trying to do is give patients  more choices, more capacity to be more demonstrative about navigating  through their own healthcare needs.   This is a good bipartisan approach. I thank the gentlewoman for  including it, and I thank her for the time. I urge its passage.  [[Page H7657]]         Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1011, I call up  the bill (H.R. 6311) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to modify the definition of  qualified health plan for purposes of the health insurance premium tax  credit and to allow individuals purchasing health insurance in the  individual market to purchase a lower premium copper plan, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I chair the Health Subcommittee at the Ways and Means  Committee, and I have had the opportunity, like many of my colleagues,  to hear from physicians, hospitals, and patient advocates. I have heard  a lot of stories about increased costs, which are exacerbating the  coverage and access challenges that we currently face.   There is a broad consensus that healthcare in the United States needs  to move towards a system that provides greater access to affordable  care. The question is: How do we get that done?   The ACA government-approved, government-mandated one-size-fits-all  insurance has dramatically decreased choice and increased premiums in  the individual market. We will hear a lot of debate about this today.   But here is what is happening close to home. Mr. Speaker, in my home  State, the Department of Health and Human Services released a report  that shows, between 2013 and 2017, the average monthly premium for  coverage in the individual market, in Illinois, increased 108 percent,  or by $3,228 a year.   I have five counties in my constituency. In two of those five  counties, there is only one insurer offering plans on the individual  exchange. That is not a choice. That is a government mandate. That is a  government monopoly.   It is time to drive a discussion around empowering individuals and  their families to make healthcare decisions for themselves based on  their needs and based on their budgets.   The policies that are included in H.R. 6311 expand access to  consumer-directed health plans with tax favored accounts, like health  savings accounts, HSAs. This bill increases choice, lowers premiums,  and let's more families save more money to pay for their healthcare  costs.   Now, my friends across the aisle will, without question, get up this  afternoon and say that this bill doesn't do anything to help people.  That instead of these policies, we should drop everything and work to  fix the very broken, flawed plan that is the ACA. Well, here is the  thing.   There are twice as many people who have an HSA than those who are  covered under the exchanges. Let me say that again. Twice as many  Americans are covered under HSAs than under the Affordable Care Act:  21.8 million people, Mr. Speaker, had a health savings account in 2017,  and there is only 10.6 million who are enrolled in the exchanges in  2018--2 to 1.   The bill makes smart changes to help families save more money pre-tax  for their healthcare. It changes the so-called use-it-or-lose-it nature  of flexible spending arrangements, FSAs, by allowing balances to roll  over to the next year. It doubles the amount of money people can put  into a health savings account so that they can save enough to cover  their exposure to out-of-pocket costs, and they are increasingly  vulnerable to these out-of-pocket costs.   Now, my friends on the other side may say they want to talk about and  distract from some of these commonsense solutions and say that somehow  some subpar insurance is being promoted. Well, even after canceling  millions of healthcare plans that people had and that people liked,  notwithstanding the President's promise that if you like your coverage,  you get to keep your coverage--you remember that, Mr. Speaker-- notwithstanding that, Democrats, God bless them, they still think they  know what type of healthcare is best for everyone. They haven't learned  yet that individuals and families are the best ones to make these  decisions, not politicians and not bureaucrats in Washington.   We think people should be able to purchase the type of coverage they  want and the type of coverage they can afford. One of the provisions in  this bill allows everyone to purchase a catastrophic plan, a plan that  was designed by ObamaCare. These plans offer the lowest premiums, and  we think everyone should have access to them.   Even better, because these plans have average deductibles of $6,000,  we think we should allow catastrophic and bronze plans to qualify for  an HSA as well. This means people can get a break in taxes for the  money that they save for their huge ObamaCare deductibles. This is real  savings to real people who are struggling under the current healthcare  law.                                time  1645    It allows working seniors with HSA-eligible coverage who are enrolled  in Medicare part A to contribute to an HSA, which can provide an added  benefit for seniors and an incentive for them to stay on their  employer-sponsored plan over Medicare, if they choose. It makes perfect  sense.   It increases utility and flexibility through allowing both spouses to  make  [[Page H7660]]  catch-up contributions into the same HSA if they are over age 55.   Finally, it delays ObamaCare's health insurance tax for an additional  2 years, which would otherwise increase the cost of insurance premiums  through a nearly $27 billion excise tax. This is a flawed tax that gets  passed on to American families who are purchasing in the individual  market; it gets passed on to seniors in Medicare Advantage; it gets  passed on to small businesses; and it gets passed on in Medicaid  programs.   So I want to thank the Ways and Means Committee members who took that  effort seriously. I look forward to this afternoon's debate.   I want to thank Chairman Brady for his leadership in driving this  discussion, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                      Washington, DC, July 13, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding H.R. 6311,       to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act to modify the definition       of the qualified health plan for purposes of the health       insurance premium tax credit and to allow individuals       purchasing health insurance in the individual market to       purchase a lower premium copper plan.        The Committee on Ways and Means ordered favorably reported       this bill which was also referred to the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce       waive formal consideration of the bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bill, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letters regarding       H.R. 4952, the ``Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits       Act,'' H.R. 6138, the ``Ambulatory Surgical Center (ACS)       Payment Transparency Act of 2018,'' and H.R. 6311, the ``To       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act to modify the definition       of qualified health plan for purposes of the health insurance       premium tax credit and to allow individuals purchasing health       insurance in the individual market to purchase a lower       premium copper plan.''        The Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo       consideration of both bills so that they may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I appreciate your assurance that by forgoing action on       these bills, the Committee is in no way waiving its       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the bills.       I also appreciate your offer of support for the appointment       of conferees from the Committee to any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Michigan asked the rhetorical question: Why are we  here?   I will tell you one reason why we are here. One reason why we are  here is I have an independent recollection of being in my car on  Michigan Avenue in Chicago, listening then to President Obama give a  speech to, I think it was the American Medical Association. I was  listening on the radio and he said, I think--I may be conflating here.  But he said: If you like your coverage, you can keep your coverage. If  you like your doctor, you get to keep your doctor.   I think, during the course of the healthcare discussion, the Obama  administration made this explicit promise to the American people: You  are going to save $2,500 per family. And it was going to be great. It  was going to solve all the problems. Yet, that didn't happen. That is  why we are here.   I have a constituency where two counties have one insurer. That is  why we are here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Paulsen) to tell us why we are here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every time today we hear the phrase ``junk coverage,''  think ObamaCare. And I am not trying to be facetious, because there is  nothing in this bill that makes any change to any coverage. I could  only assume that the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu) is  referring to the catastrophic coverage that was part of the ACA.   All we are doing today is saying, with that coverage, they ought not  be alone. They ought not just be out on an ice floe all by themselves.  People who have that type of catastrophic coverage that our friends,  when they were in the majority, created, those people should simply  have access to a health savings account.    What is not to love about that?   So when you hear ``junk coverage,'' just be dismissive of that. It is  a talking point, and it is not particularly persuasive. Who is  persuasive is the gentleman from Nebraska.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's talk about the 5 percent solution. So, if you are  in the 5 percent, you need a solution. Five percent of this country is  millions of people who are in HSAs.   And the characterization of something as a tax shelter, as the  gentleman from Texas just characterized, is a completely loaded and  pejorative term.   So where do we go for some level of clarity? Let's go to the Joint  Committee on Taxation, and the question that was posed to them was:  Show us the tax returns of people who take advantage or who are in a  health savings account.   In 2015, 71 percent of returns reported an income of $200,000 or  less. Are those rich people? I don't think so. And, in addition, 28  percent reported income of $75,000 or less.   So the hyperbole, the overstatement, the mischaracterization, I think  is ``rich.''   And did you notice something, Mr. Speaker? I laid out the President's  promise: You like your coverage, you get to keep your coverage. You  like your doctor, you get to keep your doctor. And we are going to save  $2,500 per year per family.   There has been silence on the other side of the aisle, and I predict  that that won't be answered all afternoon. Do you want to know why?  Because there is no answer.   For real answers, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Roe).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in this bill that is destructive at  all. The entire structure of the bill is invitational. The bill  presumes the status quo in terms of the Affordable Care Act, and it  allows people to get in sync with the Affordable Care Act, and it  allows them to save money in a tax-free manner.   I am really surprised at the hyperbole, the overstatement, and the  over characterization. Nobody has answered either, Mr. Speaker, if you  will notice, my admonition about the characterization of junk  insurance. To attribute that claim, which we have heard from a couple  of speakers this afternoon, against this bill is to attribute that  claim and that criticism against the ACA, because the underlying bill  matches exactly what the ACA purports, that is, catastrophic coverage.  It simply says, if you have that coverage and your deductibles take  your breath away, good news; you can save on a tax-free basis.   So I think, with all due respect to the talking point writers and all  due respect to the critics of this bill, I think the entire debate  would be uplifted somewhat if we were debating the actual bill that is  before us instead of tweets and news feeds and so forth.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I served on the Ways and Means Committee when the ACA  was passed, and I recall then-minority ranking member Dave Camp from  Michigan, who went on to become the chairman later, offered an  alternative to the ACA.   He inquired of then-chairman Rangel: When are we going to get to the  Republican alternative? When are we going to get to the Republican  alternative?   I remember this because I was sitting--I think I had the same seat  that Mr. Higgins from New York has--down in front on the left side of  the dais.   Charlie Rangel evoked an old gospel song. He said: Soon and very  soon, which is why I remember.   Now, soon and very soon never came for that amendment. Soon and very  soon never came for the Republican alternative to be considered in the  Ways and Means Committee.   Now what we are dealing with is the reality of the Affordable Care  Act. Mr. Speaker, what we are proposing is to say: Look, we have got  some suggestions; we think we can make this better.   Is this reckless? I think not. I fundamentally reject that. When you  accept the entire premise of the current structure of the Affordable  Care Act, and you take something that pre-existed within the Affordable  Care Act, that is health savings accounts, and you attach it and you  expand it, where is the defensiveness?   This is what is amazing to me about this debate. This is why our  country is stuck. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have  created the Affordable Care Act, and it is orthodoxy. To take it on and  to try to make improvements--they say they want improvements.   They say: Oh, let's work together.   All afternoon with Ms. Jenkins here on the House floor, she was  managing time of bills that were bipartisan in nature, bipartisan as  they went through the committee, but you got none of that veneer of  bipartisanship as they were discussed on the floor. They were perceived  as a direct attack at what? Orthodoxy.   So notwithstanding the invitation to work on both sides of the aisle,  the other side is making it very clear that they are unwilling to take  the structure of the ACA, to take favorable tax treatment and help more  people save their own money and spare themselves the results of a law  that our friends on the other side of the aisle said that you could  keep your doctor, you could keep your coverage, and you would save  $2,500 per person--and, again, I reiterate, Mr. Speaker, did you notice  there was no answer to that charge this afternoon?   I laid it out twice and now a third time; and absolute silence.   Why? Because they oversold. Now when they have got friends on this  side of the aisle who are saying: Look, we can improve this. Let's work  here. No, we don't like the ACA, but we can work through some of these  things, then, all of a sudden, it is stiff-arm. Then, all of a sudden,  it is insincere. Then, all of a sudden, it is political.   This is good work, this is serious work, and it is work that is  designed to bring relief to people who are suffering, who have no  interest in the nature of a donkeys-and-elephants debate on the House  floor. Most people's eyes glaze over.   Most people say they want remedies. This is a remedy that makes  sense. This is a remedy in sync with the ACA in some ways. The  responses we have heard from the other side I don't think are  persuasive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 6311, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I urge us to reject this motion to recommit.   The hospital insurance trust fund isn't going to be insolvent purely  because we are freeing Americans from the individual mandate. This  crisis has been going on for decades.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
