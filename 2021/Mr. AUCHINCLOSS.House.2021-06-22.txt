 Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Pride Month, I rise  to recognize my constituent, my friend, Newton City Councilor Holly  Ryan. Councilor Ryan is a long-serving activist in my district and my  hometown. She is the first openly transgender woman to serve on a city  council in Massachusetts and the first openly LGBTQ-plus person to  serve on the Newton City Council.    Holly is a distinguished champion of equality, serving as the  founding member and former co-chair of the Massachusetts Transgender  Political Coalition. Her advocacy led to the passage of both the 2011  trans rights law and the 2016 public accommodation law, ensuring that  no one in the Commonwealth can face discrimination because of gender  identity.   I was fortunate to serve with Councilor Ryan on the city council  before coming to Congress. Councilor Ryan is a trailblazer, paving the  way for a more equal future. Massachusetts is better off thanks to her  accomplishments.
