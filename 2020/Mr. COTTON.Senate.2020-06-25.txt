 Mr. President, our country faces real challenges today.  For example, anti-American mobs are roaming the streets in many cities,  tearing down statues of our greatest statesmen, men like Abraham  Lincoln, U.S. Grant, and George Washington, after whom this Capital  City is named.   But the Democrats aren't doing anything about that problem. Oh, no,  on the contrary, the mob is, in many ways, the youth movement of the  Democratic Party. So they are perfectly content to look the other way-- or even cheer it on. I mean, have you heard Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer,  or Nancy Pelosi denounce the mob violence we see on our streets? Me  neither.   Instead, the Democrats have found another pressing issue. The House  is voting tomorrow on a bill to make Washington, DC, a State. If that  sounds insane, you are not alone. More than two-thirds of the American  people oppose DC statehood, according to a Gallup poll last summer.   By some estimates, DC statehood is less popular even than defunding  the police. So why are the Democrats pushing for it? The answer is  simple--power. The Democrats want to make Washington a State because  they want two new Democratic Senators in perpetuity.   The Democrats are angry at the American people for refusing to give  them total control of the government, for going on a decade now. So  they want to give the swamp as many Senators as your State has. They  want to make Washington a State to rig the rules of our democracy and  try to give the Democratic Party permanent power.   In doing so, the Democrats are committing an act of historical  vandalism as grotesque as those committed by Jacobin mobs roaming our  streets. In their rush to make Washington a State, they disregard the  clear warnings of our Founding Fathers.  [[Page S3297]]    If the Democrats succeed in forcing through DC statehood, they will  do so only as a narrow faction that scorns the history of our country  and seizes power against the will of the people who want Washington to  remain what it has been for more than 200 years--a Federal city, our  Nation's Capital.   The District of Columbia is unusual, though not unique, among  capitals of the world, in that it didn't grow naturally over the  centuries but was purpose-built as the Capital of our Nation. The  Founders created Washington as a Federal city so that the operations of  government would be safe and free from domination by the States around  it.   James Madison wrote in Federalist 43 that ``the indispensable  necessity of complete authority at the seat of government, carries its  own evidence with it.''   It is so obvious as to be self-evident. Without complete control over  its territory, Madison wrote, the government ``might be insulted and  its proceedings interrupted with impunity.''   Hostile magistrates or an angry mob might interfere with the people's  elected representatives or even usurp the government.   Now, this was no abstract concern for the Founders. Just 5 years  before Madison wrote those words, several hundred mutinous soldiers  assailed the Congress in Philadelphia, where it met at the time. They  issued demands to Congress for money and wantonly pointed their muskets  at Independence Hall.   Pennsylvania's Governor rejected Congress's pleas for help, saying he  would wait until the mob committed some actual outrages on persons or  property before sending in the State militia. Congress ultimately had  to adjourn and flee to New Jersey while Washington sent in troops to  put down the mutiny.   This mutiny was an insult, an interruption of the sort Madison refers  to in Federalist 43. The Founders made Washington, DC, independent so  that the Federal Government would never again be at the mercy of a mob  or a hostile State.   The wisdom of this decision was on display just days ago when violent  riots erupted near the White House, setting fire to a historic church  and committing other acts of vandalism and destruction across the city.  Those riots were contained thanks to an impressive show of force by  Federal law enforcement officers under Federal control.   One can only imagine how much worse the destruction would have been  if those Federal officers hadn't been there, if most of Washington were  under the control not of the Federal Government but of a leftwing  politician like Muriel Bowser, who frequently takes the side of rioters  against law enforcement.   Would you trust Mayor Bowser to keep Washington safe if she were  given the powers of a Governor? Would you trust Marion Berry? More  importantly, should we risk the safety of our Capital on such a gamble?   Now, of course, the Democrats will argue that the statehood bill  doesn't entirely eliminate Federal control of Washington because it  preserves a small Federal district that encompasses the White House,  the Capitol, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, the National  Mall, and a few other government buildings. What a humbling demotion  from the grand Federal city that President Washington and Pierre  L'Enfant envisioned more than 200 years ago, which they hoped would  rival Paris in size and ambition.   By contrast, look at this ridiculous map. Look at it. The Democrats  propose to turn Washington into little more than a gerrymandered  government theme park, surrounded on all sides by a new State  controlled, of course, by the Democrats.   The Federal Government's safety and independence cannot be assured by  such a laughable district. Again, look at it. It has 90 sides. A mere  city block, less than 200 yards, separates the White House from the  proposed boundaries of a new State, governed at present by a politician  who hates the President. The Supreme Court and several congressional  office buildings are right at the edge of the map, separated from the  new Democratic State by the width of a single city street. In the event  of emergency, like the Philadelphia mutiny of 1783, those narrow  boundaries could jeopardize the operations of the Federal Government.   Consider also what is not included in this ridiculous new map of a  new Washington, DC. The headquarters of the Department of Homeland  Security would be outside the Federal Government's control, as would be  the headquarters of the FBI and the FCC, which governs all  communications in the country.   The seat of government would be separated for the first time from its  military bases--Fort McNair in Southwest Washington, the marine  barracks in Southeast Washington, and Bolling Air Force Base, across  the river.   Washington's roughly 200 foreign embassies would no longer be in the  Federal district but in the Democrats' new State, giving it unusual  prominence in foreign affairs--precisely the kind of treatment the  Founders hoped to avoid by creating a Federal city.   While the proposed Federal District would have access to a single  powerplant, undoubtedly it would rely on the Democrats' new State for  many basic utilities--not just power but water, sewage, and  telecommunications. It would also rely on the new State, as well as  Virginia, for access by land.   The civil servants and officers of the Federal Government would have  no choice but to reside in a different State on which they would wholly  depend for access to the Federal zone.   These may seem like minor or obscure problems, and, at peaceful  times, maybe they are. But recognize the truth: The government of the  most powerful Nation in the world wouldn't have control of critical  infrastructure necessary for its own safety, functioning, and  independence in a crisis. Maybe that seems like a remote danger,  although one should think better after the riots earlier this month, to  say nothing of the Civil War itself, when our seat of government faced  imminent danger in encirclement by hostile forces. In fact, the danger  was so severe that President Lincoln wanted Washington to be enlarged,  not diminished, and to include the area south of the Potomac that was  retroceded to Virginia in 1846. He said:         The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension       of this District across the Potomac at the time of       establishing the capital here was eminently wise, and       consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it       which lies within the state of Virginia was unwise and       dangerous.    How much more unwise and dangerous would it be to shrink the Federal  District even further to just a few buildings in a 90-sided map? But  that is exactly what the Democrats propose to do.   Those are just the practical and prudential problems. DC statehood  also presents a grave constitutional conundrum. Attorneys General as  diverse as Bobby Kennedy and Ed Meese understood that the 23rd  amendment to our Constitution forecloses the Democrats' statehood  proposals. The 23rd amendment, ratified in 1961, gave Washington  residents a meaningful vote in Presidential elections. The amendment  grants three electoral votes to, in its own words, ``the district  constituting the seat of government of the United States.''   But of course, the Democrats' new State would also be entitled to its  own three electoral votes. Yet, if the 23rd amendment isn't repealed,  the rump Federal district will retain its three electoral votes. The  practical effect, of course, would be to increase the swamp's electoral  power in Presidential elections.   Even the radical Democrats can't ignore this thorny problem. Their  bill calls for the swift repeal of the 23rd amendment, but they would  allow Washington to become a State before the amendment is repealed.  But there is no assurance that the amendment would actually be  repealed. The Constitution has only been amended on 18 occasions in our  Nation's history. It is not a walk in the park in the best of times.  Yet the Democrats want you to think they can pull off an amendment to  alter the electoral college in the midst of a Presidential election.   In the meantime, DC statehood, along with the 23rd amendment, will  lead to absurd consequences. This small Federal district, with three  electoral votes, would have virtually no residents. In fact, as far as  I can tell, the only residents in the district are right here, in the  White House.  [[Page S3298]]    If the House passes this bill tomorrow and the Senate were to approve  it for the President's signature, then Donald and Melania Trump need  only change their voter registration from Florida to Washington to get  their own--their very own--three electoral votes. I can't help but  think this isn't what Nancy Pelosi had in mind.   Even putting aside these practical and constitutional problems with  DC statehood, though, we return to a basic truth: Washington is a city  with all the characteristics of a city, not a State. Washington doesn't  have the size or diversity of interest of even the smallest of the 50  States.   Consider Washington's size. At just shy of 70 square miles, DC is 18  times smaller than the smallest State in the union--Rhode Island. But,  of course, the Democrats say size doesn't matter. What matters is  population. Washington has just over 700,000 residents--more than  Wyoming and Vermont and about as many as Alaska. Doesn't this qualify  Washington as a State? If it did, we would need a lot more States  because Washington is just the 20th largest city in the country. If  Washington deserves to be a State at 700,000 residents, how much more  does New York City deserve to be its own State at 8 million residents?  Perhaps Bill de Blasio should trade out his title of mayor for  Governor, all the better to battle his nemesis Andrew Cuomo on equal  terms. But let's not give the Democrats any bright ideas.   What about Jacksonville, FL, at more than 900,000 residents,  shouldn't we have a State of Jackson to accompany the new State of  Washington? We all know that will not do. Jacksonville is governed by a  Republican, and the Democrats have canceled Andrew Jackson.   Washington also doesn't have the diversity of interest and financial  independence that Madison explained were necessary for a well- functioning State. Yes, Wyoming is smaller than Washington by  population, but it has 3 times as many workers in mining, logging, and  construction, and 10 times as many workers in manufacturing. In other  words, Wyoming is a well-rounded, working-class State. A new State of  Washington would not be.   What about Alaska? It provides more than 60 percent the Nation's  seafood, and its vital geography protects the entire Nation with  missile defense systems and enables us to check Russian and Chinese  ambitions in the Arctic.   But what vital industries would the new State of Washington  represent--lobbying, bureaucracy? Give me a break. By far, the largest  group of workers in the city ar bureaucrats and other white collar  professionals. This State would be nothing more than an appendage of  the Federal Government, not separate from the government, as the State  ought to be.    Faced with these insuperable facts, the Democrats will retreat to the  claim that it is not fair for Washington to pay taxes but not be  represented in Congress. Washington residents, they say, get a raw  deal. ``No taxation without representation,'' as their license plates  proclaim.   But, of course, this is backward. As our Nation's Capital, the  District of Columbia is represented by the very fact of its privileged  position, and it reaps the benefits of that privilege. For every $1  that District residents pay in taxes, they get $4 back in Federal  spending. That is more than any of the 50 States.   Nor is Washington unique in its relationship to Congress. Just like  other Territories--Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American  Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands--Washington has a  nonvoting member of Congress who is empowered to introduce legislation,  advocate for it on the House floor, and sit on committees. In fact,  Washington's Delegate introduced the very bill that Democrats plan to  vote on tomorrow to create this ridiculous Federal district.   If it is a special indignity for Washington residents not to have a  voting Member of Congress, is it also an indignity for the 55,000  American Samoans? Should they get two Senators as well? Once again,  though, let's not give the Democrats any bright ideas. They already  want to make Puerto Rico a State.   But all of my observations about the practical effects and  constitutional obstacles in the end give too much credit to what the  Democrats are really up to--a naked power grab. Democrats in Congress  are advocating DC statehood against the will of the American people-- including the will of democratic voters, a majority of whom oppose DC  statehood. Democratic politicians are pushing for this radically  unpopular idea not because it is a sound idea but because they are  angry that they don't win every election under the current rules, and  so they want to change the rules.   If you doubt this whole endeavor is about power, consider that the  Democrats could just as easily call for retroceding the District of  Columbia to Maryland. This would give Washington residents the voting  power in Congress that is supposedly at the heart of this matter--a  voting Member in the House, probably of its own, and representation in  the Senate. There is even historical precedent for retrocession, unlike  turning the Federal District into a State. But retrocession wouldn't  give the Democrats their real aim--two Democratic Senators in  perpetuity to rubberstamp the swamp's agenda. So you will not hear them  talk about that.   Also consider the Democrats' other big idea as of late. You will see  that startling them. Earlier this week, the junior Senator from  Delaware expressed his openness to ending the legislative filibuster in  the Senate, even though he wrote the letter demanding that we preserve  the filibuster. Having two more Democratic Senators would be awfully  handy to that goal. The Democrats also have a scheme to abolish the  electoral college so that a handful of massive, liberal cities can pick  the President. They want to pack the Supreme Court so liberal activists  never lose again at the highest Court in our land.   These proposals have practical and constitutional problems as glaring  as DC statehood, but the Democratic Party pushes forward nevertheless  because their goal is to accumulate as much power as possible and never  relinquish it.   This week, the mob comes for Washington--his statue, his history, and  now his city. We must oppose this destructive campaign in the Senate,  just as it is opposed by the majority of American people across the  country.   I yield the floor.
