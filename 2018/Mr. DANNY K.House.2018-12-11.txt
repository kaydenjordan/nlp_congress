 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Texas for yielding.   I also want to commend the Subcommittee on Health and the Committee  on Energy and Commerce for its outstanding work under the leadership of  Dr. Burgess.                                time  1345    Mr. Speaker, I am going to speak about sickle cell, a bill that has  been worked on and passed. Of course, sickle cell disease is an  inherited blood disorder characterized by affected red blood cells that  mutate into the shape of a crescent or sickle. And as such, these cells  are unable to pass through small blood vessels. It is a recessive- genetic condition that occurs when a  [[Page H10057]]  child inherits two sickle cell genes, or traits, from each parent.   The consequences and complications of this disease are extreme. The  Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, whom we have worked with  for many years on this legislation, have studied and reported that  common complications with this disease include early childhood death  from infection; stroke in young children and adults; lung problems  similar to pneumonia; chronic damage to organs, including the kidney,  leading to kidney failure; damage to the lungs, causing pulmonary  hypertension; and severe, painful episodes. In fact, pain episode are a  hallmark of sickle cell disease.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are at this juncture in passing S.  2465, a bill designed to help improve, treat, prevent, and conduct  research on sickle cell disease and to include other blood diseases for  surveillance and data collection.   While this legislation includes other blood diseases, its original  intent and its continuing focus is to put major emphasis on sickle cell  disease and issues related to it.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Representative  Michael  Burgess, and Representative G.K. Butterfield, Senator Tim Scott, and  Senator Cory Booker for their tireless support and efforts to bring  this bipartisan and bicameral bill to fruition.   There has been a great deal of back and forth on this bill.  Therefore, I want to thank, again, Dr. Burgess, the chief Republican  cosponsor and advocate. I want to commend the leadership on the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, Chairman  Greg Walden and Ranking  Member Frank Pallone.   Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight the work of my colleague and friend,  Representative G.K. Butterfield, who carried the bill for this  legislation in the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Our staffs did outstanding work, and I commend all of them,  especially my Health Subcommittee staffer, Dr. Caleb Gilchrist. I want  to acknowledge and thank our advocate organizations, the Sickle Cell  Disease Association of America, the American Society of Hematology, and  other organizations, hospital providers, families, and those infected  with the sickle cell disease.   Mr. Speaker, those who say that Congress does not work and is not  working, I tell you, when we pass legislation of this sort, it tells me  that America is on the right track and we are, indeed, moving forward  to help make our communities as safe and healthy as they can possibly  be.   I end by just thanking Dr. Burgess, again, for his outstanding  leadership on this issue.
