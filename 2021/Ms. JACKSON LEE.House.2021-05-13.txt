 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chairwoman, the  gentlewoman from California for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is a stupendous effort, and I did not want to miss  the opportunity to speak on behalf of my constituents, for debt blocks  you from living your life as a family, as a recent college graduate, as  a veteran, and as an enlisted person. All of these people are in my  congressional district. Texas has the highest number of military  personnel.   Have you ever had them come into your house, excuse me, into your  office--sometimes it is like my house because I live there, almost--and  tell you about the inability to access credit, or the eviction notice,  or the repossessing of the car, and therefore, impacting on their  credit, but more importantly, being threatened to lose benefits by  outside debt collectors.   So the legislation here, and might I rise to oppose the amendments  that are en bloc at this time, but I thought it was important to be  able to discuss the importance of this particular combination of  legislation that goes to the very needs and hearts of our district by  prohibiting the use of confession of judgment as an unfair credit  practice, and providing the opportunity, as I said, to ensure that we  are protecting those individuals that are military.  [[Page H2289]]    According to the CFPB, in the past year, debt collection accounted  for 27 percent of all complaints received, 49 percent of which were for  attempts to collect a debt not owed. During COVID-19 people suffered  economically.   For example, in April 2020, Kate Boatswain, Texas resident and  grandmother of three, had been laid off from work due to the pandemic.  Her savings account had held a $4,900 tax refund. But when she checked  her account, it showed a negative balance. Ms. Boatswain drove to her  credit union to find out what happened, only to be told that staff  members were not allowed to explain. She was given a number to a debt  collection law firm. They had taken her money.   So this legislation that protects military persons, grandmothers,  small business owners, is extremely crucial, and I ask my colleagues to  support this legislation, H.R. 2547. Let's stop debt and let's make  sure Americans can thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the rule governing debate of  H.R. 2547, the ``Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act,'' which  is an incredibly important comprehensive bill that clarifies and  expands the rights of Americans facing all forms of debt collection,  and also extends existing consumer protections to small businesses,  prohibits debt collectors from threatening service members with a  reduction in rank or loss of security clearance, restricts contact to  consumers by email or text messages, and requires discharge of private  student loans in the case of permanent disability for the borrower.   H.R. 2547 better protects vulnerable consumers by enacting a wide  variety of critical reforms, including:   Prohibiting the use of confessions of judgment as an unfair credit  practice that eliminate notice and the right to be heard;   Prohibiting certain abusive collection practices directed at  servicemembers, including threats to reduce rank or revoke security  clearance;   Requiring discharge of private student loans due to total and  permanent disability;   Prohibiting collection of medical debt for the first two years and  credit reporting of debt arising from any medically necessary  procedures;   Requiring debt collectors to obtain consent before using electronic  communications and provide written validation notices;   Amending the FDCPA to expand and clarify coverage, including  extending coverage for all federal, state, and local debts collected by  debt collectors;   Adjusting statutory damages in the FDCPA for inflation and indexing  them to index for inflation in the future; and   Clarifying FDCPA coverage for non-judicial foreclosures.   An estimated 77 million Americans have a debt that has been turned  over to a private collection agency, and predatory debt collection  affects communities and families across the country.   The debts owed can be as small as a few dollars, and they can involve  every kind of consumer debt, from car payments to utility bills to  student loans to medical fees.   Debt in collection can wreak havoc on individuals, subjecting them to  harassing debt collection calls and potential lawsuits.   Annually, hundreds of thousands of individuals face threats,  harassment at home and the workplace, and abusive litigation from  unscrupulous debt collectors.   While all Americans are covered by laws barring debt collectors from  overly aggressive or deceptive tactics, these laws are insufficient in  many cases, and protections for Americans must be improved.   Debt collectors use predatory tactics that undermine citizens' rights  with misleading and confusing information.   Each year, millions of lawsuits are filed by ``lawsuit mills,'' and  in some cases, thousands of affidavits are filed in a single day that  have inaccurate information about the debt and the debtors.   Consumers are often not even given the chance to defend themselves  because collectors hire process servers that falsely certify documents  have been delivered.   Most consumers are not represented by an attorney and debt collectors  overwhelmingly seek default judgments against them in these cases.   This past year has seen a rise in aggressive debt collections due to  the impact of COVID-19, according to the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau (``CFPB'').   Despite the enactment of the FDCPA in 1977, debt collection remains a  frequent source of complaints to the CFPB.   According to the CFPB, in the past year debt collection accounted for  27 percent of all complaints received, 49 percent of which were for  attempts to collect a debt not owed.   These trends devastate communities across the country as unmanageable  debt and household financial crises become ubiquitous across the  country during this pandemic, and they impact Black and LatinX  communities most harshly due to longstanding racial and ethnic gaps in  poverty and wealth.   The COVID-19 pandemic has been among the most disruptive long-term  events we will see in our lifetimes, and it is not surprising that the  shockwaves it sent across the planet were felt deeply in the consumer  financial marketplace.   Texans have the second-highest rate of debt in collections in the  country and are uniquely vulnerable because the state's consumer  protections for bank account garnishments are virtually nonexistent.   For example, in April 2020 Kate Boatswain, Texas resident and  grandmother of three, had been laid off work due to the pandemic.   Her savings account had held a $4,900 tax refund, but when she  checked her account, it showed a negative balance.   Ms. Boatswain drove to her credit union to find out what happened,  only to be told that staff members were not allowed to explain why.   She was given a number to a debt collection law firm, and a man at  the firm tersely explained that she had owed money to Wells Fargo since  2006.   The debt was now owned by a client of the law firm who was trying to  collect, and the client was not interested in solutions--telling Ms.  Boatswain that, ``We already have your money.''   In a time of national crisis and economic hardship, Ms. Boatswain was  left without money for her mortgage and for her family.   As we work to bolster our national economic recovery, Americans must  have better safeguards against predatory debt collection actions like  this.   This bill offers comprehensive reforms against predatory debt  collection efforts in several ways, and I would like to touch on two  protections included in these reforms--those reforms offered for our  small business owners and members of the military.   Since at least 2018, an arcane legal document called a confession of  judgment has targeted our hard-working small businesses and forced  financial ruin on tens of thousands of contractors and small business  owners.   Before many small business owners get a loan, they are forced to sign  a statement called a confession of judgment which gives up their right  to defend themselves if the lender takes them to court.   Armed with this confession of judgment, a lender can, without proof,  accuse borrowers of not paying and legally seize their assets before  they know what has happened--a practice that has not surprisingly been  abused by some lenders.   Then, without contacting the borrower, lenders can immediately  withdraw the value of the loan, including the full interest payments,  from their accounts.   By requiring the borrower to accept any and all liabilities and  damages pertaining to the loan, it undermines and circumvents the  entire judicial process.   The borrower has no legal right to dispute these claims or prove  their compliance with the terms of the loan contract, making them  virtually powerless to reclaim--what often ends up being--their life's  savings.   Although Congress banned the use of confessions of judgment for  consumers in 1985, small businesses were left exposed and remain  particularly susceptible to this unfair debt collection practice.   H.R. 2547 fixes this oversight by extending the ban on confessions of  judgment to commercial loans nationally by amending the Truth in  Lending Act and closing the loophole that has allowed thousands of  American small businesses to be seized and brought down by dishonest  lenders.   Military members and their families face particular financial  challenges requiring extra protections: in service to their country,  they relocate frequently, deploy overseas and are a prime target for  scammers.   Military members are also more vulnerable to debt collectors in some  instances, and debt collectors have taken advantage of this  vulnerability by targeting members of the Armed Services through  calling their superior officers, threatening reduction in rank and even  courts-martial.   Nearly 40 percent of complaints filed by servicemembers with the CFPB  concern debt collection--as compared to only 26 percent by non- servicemembers.   Our servicemen and servicewomen make extraordinary sacrifices on our  behalf, and they should not be forced to confront aggressive and  manipulative debt collectors who capitalize on the strains required of  them in the course of their duties.   We must address this fact and protect the women and men who have  served our country and remove the unethical methods debt collectors use  to prey upon our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members to support this legislation,  because it is critical for  [[Page H2290]]  the United States' Congress to stand with our small business owners,  students, the women and men who have served our country, and millions  of Americans to address unfair and predatory debt collection efforts.    Mr. Speaker, as we speak about criminal justice  reform, sometimes children and juveniles are missing--many in the  juvenile criminal justice system.   Today, in the Committee on the Judiciary, we had a powerful hearing  that spoke about the integrating of juveniles into a new system and to  ensure that we move forward on preventing juveniles from serving in the  same facilities as adults; to not in any way cede to a sentence of a  life without parole; and to realize the best life for juveniles who may  have had a detour, who may have been traumatized, who may have, because  of the non-maturity of their brain, done something wrong.   But there is a life after. And we should look for those systems that  integrate that juvenile back into society. Intervention. And after the  incarceration, to be able to bring them to a point where they can be  contributing to our society.   That is what we are going to move on, the House Committee on the  Judiciary. I encourage my colleagues to join us, because our juveniles  are not our tomorrows; they are our todays.                            ____________________
