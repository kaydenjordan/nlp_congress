 Mr. Speaker, this week we honor the brave men and women  who make it their life's duty to protect and defend our citizens, our  Nation, and our way of life. Police officers across the country wake up  every morning unaware of the challenges they may face, the threats they  must overcome, and the lives they will affect and protect in the  process.   The badge officers don is a symbol of their altruism and their  devotion to the common good. I believe in ``Backing the Blue'' and  visit first responders throughout my district in Texas to express my  unyielding support.   America's police officers represent the best in all of us and are the  finest our country has to offer. For their service, their sacrifice,  and their selflessness, we are eternally thankful.                            ____________________
