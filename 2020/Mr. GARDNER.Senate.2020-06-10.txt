 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S2848]]     Mr. President, the Senate is considering landmark  legislation. I call it that because it is indeed landmark legislation,  but also it is about the great landmarks of our Nation.   We have a chance to lead this country this week with a historic  package of bills. The Great American Outdoors Act combines the Land and  Water Conservation Fund--our crown jewel of conservation programs--with  the Restore Our Parks Act, legislation which would help to make a  dent--help to catch up on our deferred maintenance backlog throughout  our National Park System. It is more than just our national parks,  though; it addresses the needs of our National Forest System, our  Bureau of Land Management lands, Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as  the Bureau of Indian Education.   This legislation affects all four corners of Colorado, but it also  affects every part of this country. In fact, this chart shows a map of  the States that get support from the Great American Outdoors Act, shown  in green. The States that don't get support from the Great American  Outdoors Act are highlighted in orange. It may be hard to see because  there are no orange-highlighted States. Every State in the Union  receives support through the Great American Outdoors Act, from sea to  shining sea.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Restore Our Parks Act, and  the Great American Outdoors Act will provide billions of dollars in  opportunities for recreation, hiking, fishing, camping, conservation,  and access to lands that the public already held but didn't have access  to until the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Ninety-nine percent of  the land and water conservation funds go to lands the American people  already hold, inholdings within a national park. In fact, one of the  most recent purchases the Land and Water Conservation Fund performed in  Colorado was in Rocky Mountain National Park, acquiring one of the land  holdings within the national park, helping to complete the great Rocky  Mountain National Park, the third most visited national park in the  country.   This legislation gives this Congress a chance to lead on a bill that  affects everyone, from Maine to California, from Texas to Alaska, from  Maine to Hawaii, Hawaii to Utah, Utah to Alaska, and beyond.   I know there are some who believe this is a Federal land grab. That  simply is not true. As I mentioned, 99 percent of the dollars in the  Land and Water Conservation Fund go to purchasing inholdings.   There are some who believe this is mandatory spending. Remember how  this bill was passed. In 1965, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was  authorized at $900 million a year. It was authorized to take certain  dollars over time, and it became $900 million, but it only reached that  level twice in the history of the program.   Throughout the past 55 years, though, dollars had been diverted away  from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. What this legislation does  through its permanent funding is make sure the dollars we authorized  beginning in 1965 and reaffirmed by this Congress in the permanent  authorization in the John Dingell Conservation, Management, and  Recreation Act by a vote of 92 to 8--to make sure those funds would not  get diverted and to stop funds from being syphoned off and instead go  to what they were intended to go to in the Land and Water Conversation  Fund beginning in 1965. We have an opportunity to stop that diversion.   This is not new. This is paid for--not by the taxpayers but by oil  and gas revenues. These dollars are generated from the revenues that  come from offshore. Those energy revenues--the boat excise tax, the  boat fuel excise tax, and a couple of other allocations--it is not  coming from the taxpayers.   It is an opportunity to protect our land, our most precious spaces,  to catch up on our deferred maintenance of national parks, and to make  sure we are doing that across the country without costing the taxpayers  money.   This land is purchased. There is no Federal land grab. There is no  eminent domain. They don't use eminent domain for this. There is no  premium that the Federal Government gets to buy land to crowd out other  people. There is a formula that is used that doesn't allow for  premiums. So this, indeed, is another stick in the bundle of property  rights for landowners.   We also know the positive impact this bill has right now on our  economy. You know, when we started working on this legislation, we were  talking about its economic impact and what it would mean, but we were  talking about it in terms of the overall outdoor recreation economy,  which in Colorado is $28 billion and growing. There are 5.2 million  Americans employed in the recreation economy.   When COVID hit, we saw what happened in western Colorado as ski  slopes shut down 2 months early and as hotels and restaurants emptied.  This bill will create over 100,000 jobs, restoring our national parks,  repairing trails and forest systems. It does so at a time when we have  high unemployment rates in those communities surrounded by public lands  because of the shutdown as a result of the coronavirus.   This is an economic and jobs package as much as it is a conservation  package. For every $1 million we spend in the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, it supports between 16 and 30 jobs. It is our chance  to not only protect our environment, to catch up on deferred  maintenance, but also to grow our economy when our economy needs the  growth.   After spending the last several months in the great indoors, it is  time to get out to the great outdoors, and this bill accomplishes both  of those goals.   It is historic in another way. We received support from over 850  groups across the country representing significant spectrums of  purposes and ideologies, from sportsmen, to The Nature Conservancy, to  all the groups who touted this effort. This is a list of over 850  groups strongly supporting this legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from these  850-plus organizations be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [May 11, 2020]                Support for the Great American Outdoors Act         Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Minority       Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader McCarthy: Our       organizations, and the members we represent, strongly support       passage and subsequent enactment of the Great American       Outdoors Act (S. 3422) as quickly as possible. This bill is       necessary to support the public lands we all rely upon by       achieving the twin goals of protecting America's special       places and repairing deteriorating infrastructure. We urge       you to vote in favor of this crucial legislation and to       oppose any amendments to it.        The bill will help address priority repairs in our national       parks and on other public lands by directing up to $9.5       billion over five years to address maintenance needs within       the National Park System, other public land agencies, and       Bureau of Indian Education schools. It will also fully and,       permanently dedicate $900 million per year already being       deposited into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, our       nation's most important conservation program, to ensure       protection of and access to irreplaceable lands and local       recreation opportunities.        This legislation was introduced on March 9 and has the       strong bipartisan support of a majority of the Senate. It is       consistent with legislation supported by a surpassing       bipartisan majority in the House, and the President has       specifically requested this bill for his signature, creating       an unprecedented opportunity for a historic win for the       American public and the places they care about.        The Great American Outdoors Act will ensure a future for       nature to thrive, kids to play, and hunters and anglers to       enjoy. National parks and public lands provide access to the       outdoors for hundreds of millions of people every year and       habitat for some of our country's most iconic wildlife. These       treasured places also tell the stories that define and unite       us as a nation. Funds provided in this bill will secure these       vital resources while preserving water quantity and quality,       sustaining working landscapes and rural economies, increasing       access for recreation for all Americans no matter where they       live, and fueling the juggernaut of our outdoor economy.        In 2018, over 318 million national park visits led to $20.2       billion in direct spending at hotels, restaurants,       outfitters, and other amenities in gateway communities,       supporting over 329,000 jobs and generating over $40.1       billion in total economic output. Nationally, outdoor       recreation contributes $778 billion in consumer spending and       supports 5.2 million jobs.        The Great American Outdoors Act will ensure that our parks       and other public lands continue to preserve our nation's       heritage and recreation opportunities, and that local       communities and economies in these areas will continue to       flourish.  [[Page S2849]]         We urge you to support our parks and public lands by voting       for the Great American Outdoors Act (S. 3422) as a clean bill       with no amendments.

There is another historic feature I am particularly  grateful for, and that is, the previous Secretaries of the Interior  have signed a letter to Congress urging the passage of the Great  American Outdoors Act. This letter includes two Secretaries of Interior  from Colorado--Senator Ken Salazar, who was Secretary of the Interior  under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, and Secretary Gale Norton, who  was the Interior Secretary under President George W. Bush from 2001 to  2006. This letter was sent to us on June 3, 2020. It is a historic  letter with six previous Secretaries of the Interior signing on to it,  including Secretaries Zinke, Jewell, Kempthorne, Norton, and Babbitt.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the  Secretaries of the Interior be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       June 3, 2020.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Majority       Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer: During our time       as Secretaries of the Interior, we had the privilege and       responsibility of stewarding some of America's most       incredible landscapes and natural and cultural treasures.       Now, more than ever, we are all cognizant of the critical       role of public lands in our lives, as places to recreate, to       recharge and to seek solace in the midst of great       uncertainty--and, also, to create jobs.        Together, we write to strongly urge swift passage and       enactment of the Great American Outdoors Act (S. 3422)       without any amendments. This bill (and its expected House       companion) is critically needed to support the public lands       upon which all Americans rely. The Great American Outdoors       Act will advance the protection of America's special places       and invest in the repair and restoration of deteriorating       infrastructure. The bill will help address priority repairs       in our National Parks and on other public lands by directing       up to $9.5 billion over five years to address maintenance       needs within the National Park System, other public land       agencies, and Bureau of Indian Education schools. It will       also fully and permanently fund the Land and Water       Conservation Fund, our nation's most important conservation       program, as authorized at $900 million every year to ensure       protection of and access to our public lands.        The Great American Outdoors Act will help ensure a better,       brighter future for nature and for all of us. As Secretaries,       we have all experienced how public lands managed by the       Department provide vital functions like wildlife habit while       preserving water quantity and quality, sustaining working       landscapes and rural economies, increasing access for       recreation opportunities, and stimulating the outdoor       economy. Nationally, outdoor recreation contributes roughly       $778 billion in consumer spending and supports 5.2 million       jobs. The Great American Outdoors Act will ensure that our       parks and other public lands are maintained and enhanced so       that they can continue to provide these critical benefits for       generations to come.        We are pleased to see strong bipartisan support from the       House and Senate--and from the President--for the Great       American Outdoors Act. Americans need these public lands. And       Americans need your continued leadership to deliver this       historic legislation into law.            Sincerely,      Ryan Zinke,        Secretary of the Interior 2017-2019.      Ken Salazar,         Secretary of the Interior 2009-2013.      Gale Norton,        Secretary of the Interior 2001-2006.      Sally Jewell,        Secretary of the Interior 2013-2017.      Dirk Kempthorne,        Secretary of the Interior 2006-2009.      Bruce Babbitt,        Secretary of the Interior 1993-2001.     We have a chance to lead. We have a chance to show the  American people that Congress can work together. We have a chance to  show the American people that indeed Republicans and Democrats can come  together for the good of their country to provide great things for  future generations. Despite the bickering seen on nightly talk shows,  this Congress can come together and pass the Great American Outdoors  Act, which can restore faith in our government to do what people hope  we will do, and that is to come together and to work together and to  inspire each other with those dreams of previous generations who  protected our lands and had the idea and forethought to create national  parks, to create national forests, to say that there are places in our  great land  [[Page S2852]]  that can and should be enjoyed for generations to come.   It is also about ballparks and swimming pools because not all of  these dollars go to purchase land. In fact, here is a photo of a  ballpark in Pueblo, CO. Runyon Park was funded through the Land and  Water Conservation Fund. We have swimming pools across Utah and Alaska  that were funded through it as well. States determine a great portion  of it.   Listed here is Paradise Sports Park in Paradise, UT. It sounds like a  great place. In 2015, $80,000 was used for that park in Paradise.   In Alaska, the Kenai Peninsula, there is the Kenai soccer park in the  city of Kenai, which received $321,000 from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Let's lead. Let's inspire. Let's show the American people that,  indeed, from sea to shining sea, across America, the beautiful, the  Great American Outdoors Act can stand as a testament to a Congress that  realizes generations ahead of us need for us to work for them as well.   I will end this with a quote from the Father of Rocky Mountain  National Park, who said: ``Within National Parks is room--glorious  room--room in which to find ourselves, in which to think and hope, to  dream and plan, to rest and resolve.''   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the motion to  proceed, the rollcall vote we are about to take. I would encourage my  colleagues to vote yes   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
