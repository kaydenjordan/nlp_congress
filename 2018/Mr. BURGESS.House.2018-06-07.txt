 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 923 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 923         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 5895) making appropriations       for energy and water development and related agencies for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other       purposes. The further amendment printed in part A of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       shall be considered as adopted in the House and in the       Committee of the Whole. No further amendment to the bill, as       amended, shall be in order except those printed in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules and available pro forma       amendments described in section 4 of House Resolution 918.

All       points of order against such further amendments are waived.       At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment       the Committee shall rise and report the bill, as amended, to       the House with such further amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3) to rescind       certain budget authority proposed to be rescinded in special       messages transmitted to the Congress by the President on May       8, 2018, in accordance with title X of the Congressional       Budget and Impoundment Control Act 1974. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment       printed in part C of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.        Sec. 3.  The provisions of section 1017 of the Impoundment       Control Act of 1974 shall not apply to a bill or joint       resolution introduced with respect to the special message       transmitted under section 1012 of that Act on May 8, 2018.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   House Resolution 923 provides for the consideration of two important  bills related to Federal spending of taxpayer dollars.   The first, H.R. 5895, the combined appropriations bill, containing  three individual fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water, Legislative Branch,  and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bills, provides the  annual funding for these Federal departments.   The second bill, H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary  Programs Act, is a critical bill to honor the House Republicans'  commitment to eliminating wasteful Federal spending.   The resolution before us this afternoon provides for a structured  rule for H.R. 5895. Yesterday, the House passed the first rule  pertaining to this bill, providing for 1 hour of general debate on the  measure. Today's rule makes in order 40 amendments offered by both  Democrats and Republicans.   House Resolution 923 also provides a closed rule for H.R. 3, the  rescissions package, but does execute Leader McCarthy's amendment which  incorporates President Trump's revised and updated spending proposal.   One hour of debate time for H.R. 3 is provided, divided and  controlled equally by the majority leader and the minority leader or  their respective designees.   Finally, the rule provides the minority the customary motion to  recommit on both pieces of legislation under consideration.   H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019, funds a  net total of $144 billion in base discretionary spending, $33 billion  for defense, and $112 billion for nondefense purposes. The totals  reflect the amount specified in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.   Division A of the appropriations package funds the Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act at nearly $45  billion,  [[Page H4863]]  providing for national security and energy and water infrastructure  investments.   The bill would increase Federal investments in nuclear security by  $600 million above fiscal year 2018, then totaling more than $15  billion.   As President Trump has repeatedly stated, our Nation must modernize  its aging nuclear forces. They are the centerpiece of our deterrent  strategy, and we cannot allow them to degrade to a point where they  become functionally useless.   To prevent this outcome, nuclear weapons activities, especially Navy  nuclear reactors, all continue to receive funding. Congress must not  leave the United States unprepared while our adversaries continue to  advance their own nuclear weapons programs.   Division A also improves the security of our energy infrastructure.  Most Americans take for granted the ability to easily access  electricity, but that convenience is tenuous. The electric grid is  massive, it is complex, and it is vulnerable to cyber and physical  attacks. These threats have become increasingly likely as more  operations go online or are connected to a network which is not secure.   This bill appropriates $117 million to ensure that our energy  infrastructure operators have the resources they need to develop these  defenses.                                time  1245    Additionally, the bill supports the completion of the Yucca Mountain  nuclear waste repository, helping to ease the risk and burden of  storing nuclear waste in temporary storage sites across the country.   In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act gave the Department  of Energy authority to regulate incandescent light bulbs through the  law's excessive energy efficiency standards, effectively killing free  market competition.   Therefore, I submitted an amendment that would prohibit the use of  Federal funds to carry out these onerous enforcement standards. This  amendment has been included in the Energy and Water Development  appropriations bill every fiscal year since 2011, and I look forward to  continued consumer choice in this market.   Division A includes the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In  Texas' 26th Congressional District that I represent, the Army Corps has  been instrumental in ensuring the thorough maintenance, repair, and  safety of Lake Lewisville Dam, which sustained damage due to heavy  rains in the north Texas area in 2015.   This is just one example of the important work the Army Corps  performs throughout the United States, and the bill increases funding  of the agency to more than $7 billion for fiscal year 2019.   The bill also repeals the massive overreach of Federal authority  known as the waters of the United States rule, promulgated by the  Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Army Corps of  Engineers. This rule changed the definition of navigable waters subject  to Federal regulation under the Clean Water Act, placing significant  costs on property owners.   Last, the bill prohibits the use of nuclear nonproliferation projects  in Russia without certain notifications from the Secretary of Energy.   Division B appropriates $3.8 billion for the legislative branch. This  encompasses the House of Representatives and joint operations with the  Senate.   The House of Representatives is funded at $1.2 billion, which is $25  million below the President's budget request. Funding also supports  Capitol security and police forces, services for visitors, and Capitol  operations and maintenance.   The Capitol Police are funded at $456 million, an increase of $30  million above fiscal year 2018. Last year, we learned just how vital  the Capitol Police are when they responded to and stopped a shooter who  opened fire at a congressional baseball game practice.   The bravery and skill demonstrated by those agents are what allows  Members of Congress, our staff, our support personnel, and visitors to  go to work or visit the Capitol complex every day without fear. They  deserve our full support.   The Office of Compliance is appropriated over $5 million for employee  and Member workplace rights training. This funding will also support a  dispute resolution process that is fair and accessible for all.   The bill also includes almost $580 million for the Government  Accountability Office so that it may continue its vital work of  oversight and reporting on how Federal programs are using taxpayer  dollars.   Two important things that the bill does not fund are a cost-of-living  increase for Members of Congress and allowances for former Speakers of  the House.   Division C of the appropriations package provides over $96 billion in  discretionary funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs,  an increase of more than $4 billion over fiscal year 2018.   Nearly all of the increase in funding goes toward supporting the  efforts and the services of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Robust  funding for Veterans Affairs will ensure that those who have served our  country have access to quality services.   This bill includes a total of $194 billion in discretionary and  mandatory funding for Veterans Affairs, which is $9 billion more than  fiscal year 2018.   Importantly, this bill provides more than $71 billion for Veterans  Affairs medical care and more than $1 billion in funding for the  Department of Veterans Affairs to deploy a new electronic health  records system that aligns with the Department of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, this is something that we have been promised since 2006.  This will allow our veterans an easier transition into the Veterans  Affairs system than they experience today.   The bill also includes funding for reducing the disability claims  backlog so that veterans will receive more timely compensation.   Yesterday, the VA MISSION Act was signed into law. American veterans  deserve the best possible care, and this bill gives the Department of  Veterans Affairs the resources to work towards providing that care for  the 7 million patients who are expected to receive Veterans Affairs  treatment in fiscal year 2019.   Additionally, this bill funds construction, operation, and  maintenance of housing for our troops and medical and education  facilities at over $10 billion.   This is the first step toward funding the government and its  essential programs for fiscal year 2019. This year, Congress will do  its job to ensure smart, efficient, and appropriate use of taxpayer  dollars.   H.R. 3, the second bill contained in today's rule, is the rescissions  package to cut stagnant and unused prior-year Federal funding.   President Trump submitted and recently revised a proposal to rescind  approximately $14.5 billion of budget authority, affecting 15 Federal  departments and agencies. These include unobligated balances from the  Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan  Program and the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program; the  Department of Housing and Urban Development's capital fund; the  Department of Justice's Assets Forfeiture Fund; the Department of  State's Complex Crisis Fund; and unnecessary funding for the Millennium  Challenge Corporation, among other things.   President Trump recently revised his request to withdraw the proposed  rescission of emergency Ebola funds as well as supplemental  appropriations for Superstorm Sandy recovery and to decrease proposed  rescissions to Housing and Urban Development's capital fund and  Treasury's capital management fund.    Two provisions related to the Children's Health Insurance Program  should be noted.   The first rescinds over $5 billion that was included in the Medicare  Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 that supplements the fiscal  year 2017 allotments to States. This was in addition to the annual  Children's Health Insurance Program appropriation to reimburse States  for Children's Health Insurance Program expenses. The remaining funds  are no longer needed.   The second provision rescinds almost $2 billion made available to the  Children's Health Insurance Program contingency fund, which is used to  provide payments to States that have funding shortfalls. The Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services currently does  [[Page H4864]]  not expect any State to need a payment from the contingency fund during  the current fiscal year.   It is important that the American people understand that these  Children's Health Insurance Program rescissions will have no impact on  the current Children's Health Insurance Program.   Early this year, Republicans passed and signed into law the longest  and most generous extension to the Children's Health Insurance Program  in its 20-year history. When House Democrats were presented this  opportunity, they voted against it not once but twice.   Mr. Speaker, when Federal funds are no longer needed in an agency or  have not been obligated, Congress should do the right thing and use  these taxpayer dollars to reduce the deficit.   I support passage of the rule to allow debate on these important  priorities. I urge Members to support today's rule and both underlying  bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, February 9 of this year, the House of Representatives  passed the most generous extension of the Children's Health Insurance  Program since its inception in 1996. The gentlewoman from California  voted against that extension.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gibbs), a valuable member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee and the Committee on Agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that as of June 7 of this  year, Republicans in the 115th Congress have provided consideration for  over 1,200 amendments on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, during the entirety of the 111th Congress, when Speaker  Pelosi was Speaker, the Democrats allowed less than 1,000 amendments to  be considered on the floor. Their majority blocked nearly 3,000  amendments that year in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   I would like to recognize that on February 9 of this year, the most  generous extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program--for 10  years' time--was passed by the House and eventually signed into law.  The gentleman from Massachusetts fought against that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Knight).                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's service to our  country. I would point out that I worked as a physician in a VA  facility in the 1970s, and I am well aware of the good work that the  doctors and nurses in VA facilities provide.   I would like to point out that, in the Statement of Administration  Policy, the administration expected the MISSION Act to be in place by  the beginning of fiscal year 2018. Do remember that this was one of the  promises that then-candidate Trump promised to the Nation, that he  would make the funding of the veterans programs a priority, and I  believe he has done that.    Continuing to quote from the administration: ``The delay in enacting  the MISSION Act's new community care program increases the requirements  to continue the VA's current traditional community care program by an  additional $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019.''   Here is the important point: ``The administration looks forward to  working with Congress to secure this funding within the existing  nondefense discretionary cap.''   I think it is fair to say there is more to come.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I will point out that one of the things that the  Military Construction and VA appropriation does fund is the  improvements to the VA Electronic Health Record. This is something that  has been sought by this Congress and previous administrations going  back to 2006. I am happy to say that in this appropriations bill it is  being taken care of.   Three administrations is too long for that to happen. I am grateful  for the focus that the administration put on this problem, and I am  grateful that they have finally gotten it solved.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as of June 7, 2018, Republicans in the 115th Congress  have provided for consideration of over 1,200 amendments on the House  floor. Over 570 of those amendments have been proposed by Democrats,  480 proposed by Republicans, and 190 were bipartisan. That is 46  percent Democratic amendments, 39 percent Republican amendments, and 16  percent were bipartisan.   By contrast, during the entire 111th Congress, that was the last  Congress where Speaker Pelosi was the Speaker of the House, Democrats  were in the majority. During the entire 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi  allowed less than 1,000 amendments to be considered on the House floor,  and, in fact, the Democratic majority blocked 3,000 amendments, with  roughly 2,400 during, actually, the first session, the first year of  that Congress.   These numbers include measures where the summaries of amendments  submitted are publicly available, but at that time, due to the lack of  the majority's transparency, the number is likely much higher that were  blocked.   Now, look, Chairman Sessions of the Rules Committee has made it a  point  [[Page H4868]]  to ensure that every single Member has the opportunity to submit their  amendments and come to the Committee on Rules and share their thoughts  and concerns. And as the gentlewoman knows well, there is no clock in  the Rules Committee. Any Member can come and spend as much time with us  as they wish.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of two  important pieces of legislation: H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water,  Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  Appropriations Act of 2019, and H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired  and Unnecessary Programs Act. Both are responsible measures that take  seriously our responsibility to be vigilant stewards of the Federal  taxpayers' dollars.   I want to thank the President for his leadership in eliminating  unused and unnecessary funding from past years, a responsible approach  that until this President has been underutilized. I urge my colleagues  today to support the rules and the two underlying pieces of  legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 923 Offered by Ms. Torres         In the first section, strike ``printed in part A of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution'' and insert ``specified in section 4 of this       resolution, modified by adding at the end the text of H.R.       5805 as introduced,''.        Add at the end the following new section:        ``Sec. 4. The amendment referred to in the first section is       as follows:        `Page 165, after line 14, insert the following:        Sec. 239. For an additional amount for the Department of       Veterans Affairs, $1,138,000,000 for the programs and       activities authorized in the VA MISSION Act of 2018 and the       amendments made by such Act, which shall be in addition to       amounts otherwise made available in this Act for such       purpose, of which--        (1) $600,000,000 shall become available for the Veterans       Community Care Program under section 1703 of title 38, United       States Code, as amended by the VA MISSION Act of 2018, on the       effective date specified in section 101(b) of such Act; and        (2) $253,000,000 shall be available for the Family       Caregivers Program under section 1720G of title 38, United       States Code, as amended by such Act:       Provided, That amounts made available under this section       shall remain available until September 30, 2020. ''.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
