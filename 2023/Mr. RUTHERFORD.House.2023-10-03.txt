 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Aimee  Befort for her tireless efforts to place children in reliable, safe,  and loving homes.   In 2013, Aimee started her career in child welfare as a dependency  case manager for the St. Johns County Family Integrity Program, which  works with State and local partners to find safe homes for abused and  neglected children.   After 2 years as a dependency case manager, Aimee transitioned into  the role of adoption coordinator, where she works closely with case  management staff to avoid prolonged foster care and expedite permanency  through adoption.   Thanks to her determination and ongoing efforts to place children in  secure homes, she has played a role in finalizing over 250 adoptions  for more than 100 families.   Throughout my 40-year career in law enforcement, I have seen the  difference individuals like Aimee can make in our community. Without  Aimee's heart for our youth, these children would have lost the  opportunity for a safe and joyful childhood.    For this reason, I was proud to nominate Aimee for this year's  Congressional Angels in Adoption award. On behalf of Florida's Fifth  Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend a  heartfelt congratulations to Aimee Befort.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless her and this calling, and may God bless  the families that she serves.                            ____________________
