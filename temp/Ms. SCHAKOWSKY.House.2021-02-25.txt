 Madam Speaker, I rise as the proud grandmother of a  trans young man, and I just want to say that any family would be lucky  to have the amazing and loving and smart and funny Isaac in their  family.   And I rise today to say thank you to the generations of people who  have been arrested and beaten and excluded and sometimes killed for  this fight. Let today be the end.   I thank Congressman Cicilline and all of those who have spoken today  and are going to vote for freedom. This is a remarkable day, not just  for my Isaac, but for all the young people who are frightened today. No  more. We are with you.
