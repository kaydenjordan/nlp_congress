 Mr. Speaker, I rise to join our friends in Israel and in  the Jewish communities around the world in recognizing Israel's  Holocaust Remembrance Day.   President Trump took the unprecedented step of proclaiming this week  Holocaust Remembrance Week, and solidarity is one of our strongest  allies in the entire Jewish community.   With the recent rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric amongst some, even in  this House, it is important that we remember just how horrific and  dangerous these ideas truly are.   More than 6 million Jewish people died at the hands of the Nazis  during the Holocaust. Many who survived will never be able to escape  the horrors of their experience. They emerged into a world that has  changed them forever.   But the world has changed since then, too. No longer is that sort of  hatred and bigotry to be accepted, and that is what we must affirm on  this National Day of Prayer, via prayer, via our actions, for Jewish  people as well  [[Page H3411]]  as Christians being massacred around the world.   I thank the President for once again reaffirming America's commitment  to supporting Israel and the Jewish people. This week, today, and  always, we are with you.                            ____________________
