 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the  nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services of Xavier  Becerra.   As I stand here today, America is still fighting the worst pandemic  in a century. More than half a million Americans, as we have just  heard, have died of this coronavirus. Life expectancy in our country  has actually dropped by a full year. Now, as a doctor, I will tell you  that is a significant drop of life expectancy.   In this time of crisis, our Secretary of Health and Human Services  may be the single most important member in the President's Cabinet.  There are many well-qualified Democrats, in my opinion, who could serve  in this position. For example, I voted to confirm President Obama's  last Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell. She was  confirmed by a large bipartisan majority.   That is not the kind of nominee that we have this time. In the middle  of a crisis, President Biden has chosen someone who is, in my opinion,  both unqualified and unfit for this specific job.   First, Attorney General Becerra is unqualified. Let me talk about  that. As a doctor, I am deeply concerned that President Biden has  nominated someone with no medical or public health experience. He is  not a doctor, not a scientist, not a public health official. He is a  trial lawyer and a career politician. A global pandemic is no time for  on-the-job healthcare training. The Secretary must be ready on day one.   Attorney General Becerra is not only unqualified, I say he is  radically liberal in his positions. Attorney General Becerra is the  most leftwing nominee for this job, in my opinion, in history. He is an  aggressive culture warrior from the radical left. He supports Medicare  for All, which would ban private health insurance, and 180 million  people who get their health insurance through their jobs would lose it.  If his positions go forward and he has his way, American workers would  lose that opportunity and that benefit of their jobs.   He has made a name for himself in the Democratic Party for his  extreme positions on abortion. During his 24 years in Congress,  Attorney General Becerra voted against every restriction on abortion.  During his confirmation hearing, Senator Daines even asked him to name  a single restriction he would support. He couldn't name a single one.  This record has earned him a ``100 percent'' rating from Planned  Parenthood.   As a Congressman, Mr. Becerra even voted against the ban on partial- birth abortion. The Supreme Court, rightly, upheld banning partial- birth abortions in the United States.   This wasn't the only time the attorney general's positions were at  odds with that of the current Supreme Court as he was attorney general  in California.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Becerra claimed he never sued  any nuns. That is his quote: ``never sued any nuns.'' He also said he  only sued because of California law. Well, both of these statements  stretch the truth, to put it mildly.   In 2017, the Trump administration gave a group of nuns an exception  from being required to pay for birth control. The nuns say that  violates their religious beliefs, having to pay for birth control.  Attorney General Becerra then sued the Trump administration to stop  them from giving this exemption. Attorney General of California  Becerra, the nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, lost  at the Supreme Court by a vote of 7 to 2.   One of the jobs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to  protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. Mr. Becerra's  record shows he can't be trusted to do that.   There is a well-known case involving Crisis Pregnancy Centers. Now,  these are groups that help women facing an unplanned pregnancy.  California said  [[Page S1629]]  they had to advertise where these women could go to get abortions.  Attorney General Becerra brought the full power of the State of  California against the pro-life groups. Once again, the Supreme Court  of the United States stepped in to stop him.   Mr. Becerra also used the power of his office to criminally prosecute  pro-life journalists. A pro-life activist went undercover to  investigate Planned Parenthood for trafficking in aborted body parts.  His revelations caused outrage across the country. Attorney General  Becerra charged him, the undercover reporter, with 15 felony counts.   This was too much even for Attorney General Becerra's liberal  hometown newspaper. The Los Angeles Times said:         It's disturbingly aggressive for Becerra to apply this       criminal statute to people who were trying to influence a       contested issue of public policy, regardless of how sound or       popular that policy may be.    So Attorney General Becerra is a radical liberal on a whole host of  issues. As attorney general of California, he sued the Trump  administration over 120 different times. That is quite a few. This  includes filing nine lawsuits on the very last day of President Trump's  administration--the very last day, nine more lawsuits added to the  pile.    He sued to try to stop President Trump from building the wall on the  southern border. He sued the Trump administration to try to stop  fracking on Federal lands in California. This is just the tip of the  iceberg. The list goes on and on. When you look at the record, it is  clear: Xavier Becerra is out of touch with the views of the American  people.   President Biden has chosen an extremely liberal Cabinet. He was  forced to withdraw his nominee for Budget Director. His Vice President  has been the least bipartisan, in terms of a Senator of record, of any  Senator in 2019. And now Attorney General Becerra seems to be the most  liberal of them all.   Frankly, his selection, I think, shocked a lot of people across the  country. During this pandemic, we need a leader for the Department of  Health and Human Services who brings us together as a nation. Instead,  the President has chosen a nominee with no public health experience and  an extremely partisan record, so I urge my colleagues to reject this  unqualified, incredibly liberal nominee.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
