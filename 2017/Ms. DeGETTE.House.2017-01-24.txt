 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, our constituents are looking to this Congress to  address the economy, jobs, our crumbling infrastructure, and so many  other issues. But despite these pressing needs, the only substantive  bill this House is considering this week is a bill restricting a  woman's ability to get a full range of healthcare services and a bill,  which passed before in this House and that we know is going nowhere in  the other body.   Its title alone must be part of the majority's new plan to redefine  facts. As we heard the other day, we now apparently have in our  discourse ``alternative facts.''   This bill takes that to a whole new level, and let me tell you why.  The bill is called the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion  Insurance Full Disclosure Act. But under current law, under the Hyde  amendment--which I hate, which I will do everything to repeal--we have  no taxpayer funding for abortion. Taxpayer funds are currently  prohibited from use for abortions. Instead, what this bill does is it  takes that concept and it uses it to far expand a restriction on a  woman's ability to get the full health care that she needs.   Let me talk about what this bill does exactly. First of all, it  codifies the Hyde amendment into statute, which has never been done in  this Nation's history.   Secondly, it codifies a ban on abortions in D.C., even when they are  done with D.C.'s taxpayer money and not with Federal money.   Number three, it codifies the Helms amendment, which denies women  abroad access to safe abortion care by severely restricting the use of  U.S. funds to pay for healthcare services in developing countries.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   It severely restricts abortion coverage in the ACA's exchanges by  forbidding people who have plans where they get subsidies from paying  for plans with their own money. This is a far expansion of a  restriction on a woman's right to get her own health insurance with her  own money.   It denies insurance-related tax credits to small businesses that  choose plans that offer abortion services. It permanently bans abortion  services for Federal employees and it codifies a ban on abortion  coverage for women in military services overseas.   The fact that we are debating this today, just 1 day after President  Trump issued an executive order reinstating the global gag rule, is a  slap in the face to the over 3 million women who marched last weekend.   Let's vote ``no'' on this bill and let's go to the business that the  American public really cares about.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), one of our new Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from Tennessee has attempted to imply  that several of our speakers today support the Hyde amendment because  they voted for very large omnibus spending bills that included the Hyde  amendment. I would like to be really clear that none of the speakers on  this side today do support the Hyde amendment, and, in fact, in the  last Congress we had a bill, the EACH Woman Act, sponsored by a number  of us, 129 cosponsors, which would repeal the Hyde amendment. Sometimes  people vote for large pieces of legislation because they do things like  keep our government open and build highways and roads. But we will do  everything in our power to repeal this poorly thought-out and  regressive amendment, and we will do everything we can to defeat this  bill today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The gentlewoman from Tennessee keeps saying over and over that  different people voted for H.R. 2029 and, therefore, they must be for  the Hyde amendment. I would like to point out that she herself voted  against H.R. 2029. I guess maybe that means she is against the Hyde  amendment since she voted against that bill.   The point I am making is that all of us oppose the Hyde amendment. We  are all cosponsoring the EACH Woman Act. Simply because you vote for or  against a large omnibus bill does not mean you are necessarily in favor  of or against the Hyde amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), another one of our excellent new Members.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), an activist on this issue.   (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)  [[Page H642]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan), another one of our new, wonderful Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the fad,  apparently, this week, is the idea of alternative facts. In other  words, if politicians don't like the facts that they have been given or  the reality of the situation, then what we should do is we should just  come up with new facts; and apparently, the facts in this bill are  that, apparently, the other side is worried about taxpayer funding for  abortions.   As we have said repeatedly, we don't like this on this side of the  aisle, but right now, because of the annual Hyde amendment, there is no  taxpayer funding for abortion. We aim to change that because it is  probably the most regressive legislation that we have for women's  health.                                time  1530    It says that rich women can get the full range of healthcare services  they need, including abortion; but poor women, the women least equipped  to be able to raise unwanted children, and certainly not with help from  this Congress, are the ones who cannot get those services that they  needed.   So I just want to say one more time because I keep hearing the  alternative facts over and over, there are right now no taxpayer  funding for abortions, something that we need to fix. But this bill  takes us the opposite direction. What this bill does is it codifies the  Hyde amendment in statute once and for all, and that would bar low- income women from receiving these much-needed services. It codifies the  D.C. abortion ban, which would rob the D.C. City Council of giving the  healthcare services D.C. women need, even with D.C. tax revenues. It  codifies the Helms amendment, which is the same thing as the Hyde  amendment for international programs. And perhaps the biggest ban here  is it restricts people's ability to buy insurance policies on the  healthcare exchanges with their own money that will cover abortion.   I heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle over and  over again that there are a thousand policies. The lady from South  Dakota said that government dollars were supporting abortive  procedures. That is just simply not the case. There is no Federal money  in the exchanges paying for abortive procedures.   What this bill does is it greatly expands restrictions on women's  ability with their own money to buy insurance policies with legal  healthcare coverage that they feel that they need. And it says that if  you get a subsidy, then you can't get a policy with your own money.  That is a vast expansion, and it is well beyond the pale.   It is also, by the way, beyond what the American public says. Because  the American public, by 86 percent, says that if you are poor, then  politicians should not put their personal views on you and you should  be able to get the healthcare coverage that you need. We saw this with  the millions of American women and men in Washington and around the  country who marched this last weekend. But we see it in the polling.  People say, if you are poor, you should be able to get the healthcare  coverage you need, not what some politician in Washington tells you.   I have an idea. Every year, around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and  the time that the protestors come to Washington, I don't think that we  should debate this futile exercise year after year. I think we should  come together across the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to figure  out how we can prevent unwanted pregnancies.   I am getting ready to introduce a bill. I would urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle, including the Republican side, to cosponsor  this bill. This bill will expand contraception and family planning  services and long-range contraception for all American women so that we  can prevent unwanted pregnancies.   In Colorado, we have a program that is called LARC. And what it is is  a program where the State helps teen and young women get long-acting  contraception so they can prevent unwanted pregnancies. And here is  what happened in Colorado when we enacted this very robust and helpful  program. According to the data from the Colorado Department of Public  Health and Environment, both the birth rate and abortion rate for women  ages 15 to 19 fell 48 percent from 2009 to 2014 because of long-acting  contraception, and the same was true for women of the next age group  up.   We can do this. We can do this together. Let's start talking about a  way to improve women's health instead of to restrict their choices.  Vote ``no'' on this ill-conceived bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
