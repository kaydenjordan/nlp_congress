 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 549, the Transit Security Grant Program  Flexibility Act.   As the threats to our homeland continue to evolve, transit systems,  domestically and abroad, have become a leading target for terrorists.  Last year, the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee for  Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held field  hearings in New Jersey to assess how transit owners and operators and  local first responders were coordinating efforts to secure domestic  mass transit and to determine what the Federal Government could do to  assist those efforts.   At the hearing, transit operators repeatedly praised the transit  security grant program, although they raised serious concerns about  funding, which has decreased dramatically since its peak in 2009.  Witnesses also testified that the period of the performance for the  transit safety grant program was too short to support infrastructure- hardening projects.   Under H.R. 549, the period of performance for security-hardening  projects would be extended from 36 months to 55  [[Page H792]]  months in order to make it possible for transit agencies to complete  projects that may take longer than the time period allowed under  current law.   This bipartisan bill was passed in the House last Congress, and I  urge my colleagues to again support this measure.   It is very important that we give transit professionals the  flexibility that they need to keep our transit systems safe and secure.  H.R. 549 will allow transit security grant program grantees to use the  funds designated for security-hardening projects more efficiently and  within a more reasonable timeframe.   I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 687, the First Responder Access to  Innovative Technologies Act.   Mr. Speaker, in my time serving as ranking member of the Committee on  Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response,  and Communications, I have come to learn a great deal about the very  important, very challenging job of first responders. These brave men  and women run toward danger with our safety as their number one  priority.   Since the September 11 attacks, the private sector has redoubled its  efforts to develop innovative technologies for first responders to use  and to carry out their vital missions.   Yet, through our subcommittee's oversight, we have seen where, in  some instances, industry standards have  [[Page H793]]  failed to keep the pace with breakthroughs in technology. As a result,  we have found that first responders cannot always access the most up- to-date equipment because they cannot use Homeland Security grant funds  to purchase equipment and technology that does not meet or exceed  voluntary industry standards.   H.R. 687 would require FEMA to develop a transparent process for  reviewing requests to use grant funds to purchase technologies that do  not meet or exceed voluntary industry standards and/or that are not on  the authorized equipment list.   The bill has the support of the Security Industry Association and  unanimously passed the House last September. Mr. Speaker, I include in  the Record a letter from the Security Industry Association.                                  Security Industry Association,                                Silver Spring, MD, January 27, 2017.      Hon. Dan Donovan,      Chairman, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency           Preparedness, Response and Communications, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Donald Payne,      Ranking Member, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on           Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Donovan and Ranking Member Payne: On behalf       of the Security Industry Association (SIA), I would like to       express our strong support for H.R. 687, the First Responder       Access to Innovative Technologies Act, which would streamline       the existing process for first responders utilizing homeland       security grants to purchase innovative equipment. SIA is a       non-profit international trade association representing       nearly 700 global security and life safety solutions       providers, and our members develop, manufacture and integrate       equipment that is vital to carrying out a variety of homeland       security missions.        Under current law, equipment purchased with homeland       security grants must meet or exceed ``national voluntary       consensus standards,'' unless an explanation as to why an       exception is necessary is provided to, reviewed and approved       by the Department. For some products, including first       responder equipment, technology innovations have outpaced the       process of developing voluntary consensus standards, and no       such standards may yet exist. Among other provisions, H.R.       687 directs FEMA to develop a more consistent and transparent       process for reviewing these requests, which would expedite       consideration and provide more certainty to stakeholders.        Like you, we believe that first responders must be able to       choose the most appropriate and advanced equipment to meet       urgent and changing needs as they work to protect the public.       SIA and its members stand ready to serve as a resource to you       as you continue work on this critical issue. Thank you for       your leadership and attention to this important matter.            Sincerely,                                                      Don Erickson,                                CEO, Security Industry Association.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, our first responders are on the front lines  of emergency response. In recognition of their bravery and sacrifices  they make every day, in and out, we must make sure that they have the  access to the most up-to-date technologies to help them do their jobs  better and safer. To that end, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  687.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 584, the Cyber  Preparedness Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, since I became ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications 4 years ago,  States have repeatedly expressed concern about the ability to confront  the cyber threat and have rated cybersecurity among the core  capabilities in which they had the least confidence.   Last Congress, the subcommittee held a hearing on State and local  efforts to counter the cyber threat where State emergency managers and  chief information officers testified about activities they were  undertaking to secure their networks and infrastructure.   For example, my home State of New Jersey has begun developing its own  cyber information-sharing capability, similar to DHS' National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center.   Since the subcommittee held its hearing last year, the Federal  Government has made significant progress in providing cybersecurity  guidance to Federal, State, and local stakeholders.   In December of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security issued its  national Cyber Incident Response Plan, which describes roles and  responsibilities among stakeholders with respect to preventing,  disrupting, and responding to a cyber event.   Additionally, the plan also provides guidance on information sharing  related to cyber threats.   H.R. 584 would help facilitate implementation of the National Cyber  Incident Response Plan by promoting the sharing of cyber threat  indicators and information, as well as cybersecurity's best practices,  with State and major urban area fusion centers.   The bill also designates ``cybersecurity'' as an allowable use of  State Homeland Security grants and Urban Area Security Initiative  funds, which would help other States replicate the cyber threat  information-sharing capabilities developed in New Jersey.   This is commonsense legislation, passed by the House last Congress,  and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again.   Mr. Speaker, last fall, the range of cyber threats we faced came into  focus when a foreign government attempted to interfere and undermine  the integrity of our Presidential election by hacking into the campaign  and political party databases.   H.R. 584 includes language to address this threat by directing DHS to  share cyber threat information regarding election equipment and  technology with fusion centers.   H.R. 584 seems to secure our critical cyber networks by improving  cyber information sharing with fusion centers on the full spectrum of  cyber threats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 584, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
