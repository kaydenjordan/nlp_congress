 Mr. President, I can't express enough what Chris  Cline meant to our home State of West Virginia. He represented the very  best of the Mountain State, which is saying a lot. Born in McDowell  County and raised a stone's throw from the train tracks in the  coalfields of Beckley, Chris's family was wealthy beyond measure in the  [[Page S4767]]  only currency that truly matters: love, work ethic, and profound  strength of character.   One of my favorite stories about Chris is, when he was a child, he  filled bags with dirt for his father, Paul, to use for blasting holes  at the mine. His father paid him a penny per bag. It was once the front  porch caved in that his father realized he had been getting the dirt  from beneath it. Chris said that was how he learned the importance of  infrastructure.   He never lost touch with the days he would come home from a shift in  the mines as a young man of only 15, his face caked in coal dust. In  fact, he kept his first hard hat, battered from years of hard labor, in  a place of honor at his home in Beckley. From this foundation, he built  an opportunity empire. From the early days of Pioneer Fuel to when  Chris founded Foresight Energy, much of the success he gained was  returned to the men and women who keep the lights on. He treated his  workforce as family, knowing very well what it was like to be in their  shoes, and so he invested in the safest, most innovative, and efficient  tools and methods.   His coal enterprises took him from Appalachia to Illinois to Canada.  He offered cash incentives to his miners, installed advanced and safe  mining equipment, and was ahead of his time in anticipating the market  for coal. Chris believed it was not enough to be innovative, you need a  little luck. At Foresight, his four mine complexes were the most  productive underground operations in the Nation. He bought docks on the  Mississippi River and built rail spurs to haul coal onto ships bound  for India, Europe, and Asia.   Chris understood opponents of burning coal while defending coal and  his role in supplying the world with it. He believed that people  deserved the cheapest energy they could get. He had a curious mind, was  eager to learn about everything, and never stopped learning. As  committed as he was to coal energy, for his Big Grand Cay property, he  installed solar panels and batteries. Where renewable energy sources  made sense, he was eager to embrace them.   There is no greater accomplishment in the world than to be in a  position to give back to the community you love, that made you who you  are. That is what made Chris the wonderful, inspiring, and generous  person he was. Through the Cline Family Foundation, founded in 2009,  Chris made a profound impact on Marshal University and West Virginia  University. His legacy will remain forever in the hearts of all who had  the privilege of knowing him, and he will be remembered through the  countless lives he benefited with his generosity to our academic  institutions. Chris believed with all his heart that West Virginians  are the most hard-working, ethical people in our Nation, and he wanted  to ensure they had every opportunity to utilize their skills with the  best possible resources to build their lives from the ground up, just  as he did. His mission was for each of his accomplishments to pave the  way for others to go even further than he did.   Chris was generous with his philanthropy publicly through the Cline  Family Foundation, but most importantly, he was generous and  compassionate privately, almost daily. The foundation focuses on  donations throughout West Virginia in recognition of the community's  contribution to his success. It offers scholarships and grants, endows  universities, and financially supports charitable organizations that  make life better for children and older youth. Chris once said that  everyone in West Virginia contributed to his success, and he was  determined to repay the favor. He certainly did, and our statewide  community is better for it.   Among other donations, the Cline Family Foundation supported Place of  Hope, a foster care and adoption organization; Peacehaven Community  Farm, a home for disabled adults; orphanages in West Virginia and  Haiti; Save the Children; humanitarian aid organizations in Tanzania;  churches; and the Raleigh County YMCA, among other organizations, and  many needy individuals over the years. He also supported the Benjamin  School from which his daughter Kameron graduated in 2015. Few people  beyond the recipients know details of Mr. Cline's many and constant  personal acts of private charity.   Sharing his adventures with his four children and his lifelong  friends was his absolute favorite way to spend his time. He would take  crowds of friends and family to the Super Bowl, the Big East  Tournament, countless other sporting events, and on his frequent world  travels. Chris was an adventure junkie, always looking forward to the  next time he could drive a fast car or ride a four-wheeler through the  West Virginia hills.   I can't speak enough to what a good-hearted, wonderful person he  truly was. I always thought of him as a man for all seasons. No matter  the circumstances, he kept a cool head and a warm demeanor, always able  to discern the most honorable path forward. It was an honor to call him  my friend, and I miss him dearly.   I join all West Virginians in extending my deepest condolences to his  children, Candice and her husband James, Christopher, and Alex, for the  loss of their loving father and their sister, Kameron. I also extend my  condolences to Chris's brothers Greg and Kenneth. It is my hope the  entire Cline family is able to find peace, strength, and support in one  another.                            ____________________
