 Mr. Speaker, for everything our veterans have given in  service to the country, they have earned their benefits and access to  timely, quality healthcare at the VA. That is the promise that was made  to them when they volunteered to serve. That is the promise that we in  Congress are obligated to keep.   Honoring this promise is not just a matter of resources; it also  depends on changing the actual culture at the VA. From the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs to the doctors and nurses, to the administrators who  deal with the flood of appointments that come in, it has to be about  serving the veteran, not about serving the bureaucracy.   For as long as I have been in Congress, improving VA accountability  has been a bipartisan goal. I am glad to see us working across the  aisle once again on this legislation that builds on the progress we  made in 2014.   This bill strengthens whistleblower protections, which encourages  employees to call out careless or criminal behavior that we have  unfortunately seen too often at VAs around the country. It gives the  Secretary greater authority to remove or discipline poorly performing  and negligent employees, and it provides a reasonable and efficient  appeals process for VA employees that is the subject of compromise.   The bill won't solve all the problems at the VA, but by holding bad  actors accountable and protecting the hardworking employees who care  for our veterans, this bipartisan legislation will improve on the  service that our veterans receive.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work done by my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, the administration, and the veterans service  organizations to craft this important piece of legislation, and I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Let's send this bill to the President's  desk and help veterans in my district in San Diego and across the  country get the care that they have earned.
