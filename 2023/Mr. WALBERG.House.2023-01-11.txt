 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res.  3, which condemns the epidemic of attacks on pro-life and faith-based  organizations.   Unfortunately, Michigan's Fifth District has not escaped these  attacks. Last June, Jane's Revenge vandals graffitied and smashed the  windows of Jackson, Michigan's Right to Life and my own office. It was  a despicable act. The Jane's Revenge perpetrator, who has yet to be  caught, even accidentally graffitied a neighbor's house, as well.   Yet, this darkness presented an opportunity to show the best of our  community. Volunteers from the community came out to clean up the  broken glass and help board up the windows.   In contrast to this positivity displayed by everyday Americans, and  despite congressional efforts we have spearheaded, President Biden's  Justice Department has stayed silent on these acts of domestic  terrorism.   Today, congressional Democrats have an opportunity to right the  wrongs of this administration and join us in condemning these acts of  violence as we condemn all acts of violence, as well.   Volunteers at pregnancy centers who remain committed to their  convictions and efforts understand they have a target on their backs.  These volunteers are individuals spending their time and their money to  clothe, feed, provide  [[Page H176]]  shelter, and minister to women in crisis.   Is this the progressive America my colleagues talk about? I think  not. Does their idea of progress consist of political violence  targeting those who provide services to women and families? Are  intimidation and violence acceptable to the Biden administration and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle? I hope not.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge support for this resolution for the  benefit of lives, security, and decency in our country.
