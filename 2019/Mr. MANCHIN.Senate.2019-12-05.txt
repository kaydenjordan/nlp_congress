 Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the service  of my defense fellow, Maj. Jordan Kahn, who is approaching the end of  his assignment with my office as part of his experience in the U.S. Air  Force Legislative Fellowship Program.   Major Kahn joined my office in January and his dedication, work  ethic, and intelligence quickly made him a trusted voice on my  legislative team. A proud member of the U.S. Air Force, as well as  being a graduate of both the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Air  Force Weapons School, Jordan has deployed to defend our country  multiple times, and because of his service, our Nation is safer. Most  importantly, Jordan is a devoted husband and father, and I have had the  pleasure of watching his family grow over the last year. In November,  his wife Becky gave birth to their second son Haden, and his firstborn  son Harrison has now dutifully taken on the responsibility of big  brother.   As Major Kahn moves on to his next assignment, I have full faith that  he will continue to excel as a leader in the Air Force and would trust  him in the most demanding and sensitive positions within our Armed  Forces. I extend my sincere thanks for his service to our Nation and  our office and wish him and his family continued success in his future  endeavors.                            ____________________
