 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R.  8.   I want to say, too, the chairman's commitment to passing bipartisan  WRDA bills every 2 years has been very impactful on better managing the  bureaucracy of the Corps of Engineers.   I think we can all agree that the Corps needs regular examination of  projects and policy to hold them accountable, and this is good  government and a policy I would like to see the committee remain  committed to in the future.   In my district, Mr. Chairman, this bill is extremely important to the  agriculture economy and to everyone who relies on the Missouri and  Mississippi Rivers.                                time  1500    My district alone is bordered by 400 miles of Missouri and  Mississippi River frontage. So we in northern Missouri are directly  affected by the Corps' actions.   I am glad that the committee unanimously adopted my amendment to  bring some common sense to the management of the endangered species-- specifically, the pallid sturgeon--that live along the Missouri River.   Past efforts to help the pallid sturgeon have led to multiple years  of flooding and millions of dollars' worth of damage to my  constituents. What is worse is the fact that the Corps has spent money  year after year on population recovery, and it has not helped the  pallid sturgeon one bit. This is absolutely unacceptable.   Before the Army Corps builds any new, unproven structures along the  Missouri and spends millions of taxpayer dollars, they are now required  to prove that it actually works. Furthermore, the Army Corps must prove  that these structures, called IRCs, do not negatively impact the other  management priorities on the Missouri River that the Corps is  responsible for, most importantly, which is flood control and  navigation.   Mr. Chairman, the Corps shouldn't be focused on constructing  environmental habitats. They should be protecting people and businesses  from flooding and helping facilitate navigation on the river. We have  been down this road before with unproven methods to help fish over  people.   In closing, this is a good bill. It is necessary to advance important  flood control projects and ensure our inland waterways remain a  reliable and efficient option for transporting goods up and down the  rivers. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 8.
