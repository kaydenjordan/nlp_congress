 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for yielding me the customary  30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the  consideration of two bills.   The first piece of legislation, H.R. 3017, is a bipartisan compromise  to extend the EPA's brownfields program. The successful brownfields  program assists communities across this country in cleaning up  contaminated sites to reduce pollution and health risks and spur  economic development.   Although funding for this program has enjoyed broad support over the  years, its authorization lapsed in 2006; 11 years ago. It is certainly  long past time for this important program to be reauthorized. I  appreciate the work of Republicans and Democrats on both the Energy and  Commerce and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees in coming  together to produce this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this is how the process is supposed to work. There was a  hearing, and there was a markup. I should  [[Page H9480]]  say, for the Record, the majority could have issued an open rule,  instead of a closed rule. But I am not even going to criticize that  today, Mr. Speaker, because experts on this issue came together to  negotiate it in a bipartisan manner, and the result is a good piece of  legislation that I look forward to voting for later this week.   I commend Mr. McKinley, Mr. Tonko, Mr. Pallone, and all those who  worked together, and I just want to say for the Record, as one who  routinely gets up here and criticizes the majority for issuing closed  rules and structured rules all the time, I do so not just as a knee- jerk reaction to what they produce in the Rules Committee. I do it  because usually they do closed rules and structured rules to basically  stifle a deliberative process. They do it to shut off debate and to  shut out other people's opinions. Quite frankly, the majority's record  on rules is abysmal.    In this case, what we are doing is bringing forward something that  represents a bipartisan process. I wish this wasn't an anomaly. I wish  that the majority would understand that, in the House of  Representatives, the views of Democrats are just as important as the  views of Republicans. If you want to get things done, you need to come  together in the spirit of compromise and work together for the good of  the American people, not just for the good of one political party, not  just so you can issue a press release, not just so you can play gotcha  games, but actually produce things that are meaningful.   If the Republican leadership would drop their all-or-nothing approach  to governing more often, support genuine bipartisan negotiations and  compromise, and open up the process on all pieces of legislation, both  minor and substantial, we might be able to get something done around  here. Maybe we could have more than 12 bills of any sort of real  significance signed into law.   This rule also brings to the floor legislation, I am sad to say, that  would do irreparable harm to our federally protected land by allowing a  foreign company the ability to use a half-century-old lease to mine  right next door to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.   H.R. 3905 would allow a Chilean mining company, which is facing tens  of millions of dollars in fines from the Chilean Government for their  failure to protect nearby water resources, the ability to mine just  upstream of pristine U.S.-protected land.   This is all based on a 50-year-old lease--a lease that didn't go  through any environmental review because NEPA didn't exist yet. There  are Members of this Chamber who weren't even born when this lease was  signed.   My colleagues in the majority will claim that this bill will help  create jobs, but what about the 22,000 jobs that the local protected  land already supports?   What will happen to those jobs when the water is so polluted that no  one can visit the recreational area around the mine?   The truth is, this isn't about jobs. It is about helping a few rich  owners of mining companies line their pockets at the expense of the  environment. In fact, the recipient of this Republican handout is a  subsidiary of a Chilean company, Antofagasta, which is controlled by  Chilean billionaire Andronico Luksic Craig. And get this: he just  happens to be the landlord of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, President  Trump's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers to the Trump White  House.   You cannot make this stuff up. This is part of a pattern of sketchy  deals and questionable business contacts involving the President and  his family and their closest advisers.   Earlier this month, we learned that President Trump and his family  made millions through a hotel in Panama financed by Colombian drug  cartels and the Russian Mafia. We still don't even know how these new  deals will boost President Trump's income or how his family profits off  of the Presidency, because we are 312 days into his Presidency, and we  still haven't seen his tax returns.   Imagine if this were Hillary Clinton. Imagine if this were Barack  Obama. Imagine the screams on the other side of the aisle demanding  transparency and an open process. But when it comes to covering up all  these sketchy deals on behalf of this President of the United States,  there is silence.   President Trump promised to drain the swamp, but, instead, he has  created a cesspool. There are so many conflicts of interest, this  administration is on a collision course with corruption.   Mr. Speaker, we have only 6 legislative days left before the  government runs out of money, but the Speaker of the House thinks  another corporate handout, this time to Jared Kushner and Ivanka  Trump's landlord, is the most pressing issue that needs to be resolved  in Congress this week.   If the Speaker wants some suggestions as things we ought to focus on  this week, I know Democrats in this Chamber have a few. I can give you  an example.   Democrats think we should be debating a funding bill to avert the  coming shutdown on December 8, when the temporary spending bill  expires.   Democrats want to debate and pass the Dream Act, ending the turmoil  this President has caused by upending the lives of 800,000 young  immigrant DREAMers and their families.   Democrats want to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program,  known as CHIP, and community health centers, whose authorization  expired 2 months ago.   Democrats think we ought to debate flood insurance reauthorization,  which expires on December 8.   Democrats want to pass additional hurricane relief to help those who  are still recovering from devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and  Puerto Rico.   Democrats want to address funding for the Veterans Choice Program,  which is set to run out of money before the end of the year.   But instead, here we are, considering yet another ridiculous, extreme  antienvironment bill.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle love talking  about returning this country to the way it used to be. I have seen the  Make America Great Again stickers on many of their cars.   I can think of no pastime more important or more significant to our  national heritage and identity than our wilderness and protected areas.  My friends and colleagues who have spent time in the Boundary Waters  tell me how stunning it is. They say it is one of the most beautiful  places in our country. And we are going to risk polluting this national  treasure with copper-sulfide acid drainage running into the streams  that feed the Boundary Waters?   Worse yet, this bill makes these mining leases impossible to ever  overturn, even should the Bureau of Land Management conclude its  environmental assessment and rule against further mining in this  protected national forest.    This is a slippery slope. If we continue to allow corporations to  pillage our federally protected wilderness areas, we are opening the  door to irreversible damage. What is next? Clear-cutting in Yellowstone  Forest? Oil drilling off the coast of Acadia National Park?   Mr. Speaker, I beg my Republican friends to drop this assault on our  public lands and urge the leadership of this House to bring up the  urgent bills and priorities that we need to deal with before adjourning  in less than 3 weeks' time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose  efforts that will further degrade our natural resources.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to just respond to my colleague from  Wyoming, you know, when she raised the issue of why our Democratic  leaders didn't show up to the meeting at the White House. Maybe she  didn't catch the President's tweet in which the President made it very  clear he didn't see a deal.   I am glad our leaders didn't show up because they are not props, and  we in the minority are not props either to be rolled out, to give the  appearance of bipartisanship or give the appearance that somehow you  are working with us when, in fact, you are not.   The President showed his hand. He had no interest in a deal, no  interest in working with us. And I would say that is one of the  problems in this House of Representatives, that the reason why we are  not more productive in getting things done and producing real  legislation to help the American people is because there is no  bipartisanship, very little. I made one exception to the issue on this  brownfields legislation, but on the big bills, nothing.   The gentlewoman brought up the Affordable Care Act. You know, what  was her solution to the Affordable Care Act? What was the Republican  majority's solution to making the Affordable Care Act better? I mean,  bringing a bill to the floor under the most closed process that you can  possibly imagine, a bill that would throw 23 million Americans off of  health insurance, what are my friends thinking?   When people talk about healthcare reform and improving the Affordable  Care Act, they talk about lowering prices; they talk about more  accessibility; they talk about more people getting coverage. What the  Republicans brought to the floor was a bill that would throw 23 million  Americans off of health insurance. That is their solution. That would  take away essential benefits protection for people who desperately need  health insurance to deal with this opiate crisis and a whole bunch of  other things.   So we don't want any lectures about what is extreme and what is  ridiculous in this House of Representatives. The way the majority  conducts business in this House is extreme and ridiculous. The  legislation, whether it is their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care  Act or even this tax bill that is a giveaway to corporate special  interests and is going to raise taxes on people earning $100,000, that  is extreme, that is wrong.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my Republican friends, again,  you know, if you want to get things done, if you want to work with us,  you have got to treat us as more than just props. You have to enter  into good faith negotiations. And I would say, if you did that, we  actually might get some things done around here that might improve the  quality of life for everybody in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to again respond to my colleague from  Wyoming when she again raised the issue as to why our leaders didn't  show up to the White House. It is not because they have a fragile ego.  It is because they didn't want to waste their time. It is because they  didn't want to be a prop or just be there for a photo op. It is because  they are actually focused on trying to do the people's business, and  they are tired of the gamesmanship.   If the gentlewoman wants to talk about fragile egos, I would suggest  that she observe the behavior of the man who is in the Oval Office. I  mean, this is a guy who will get into a Twitter war with a basketball  player's father.   I would say that, and I would just respectfully urge my Republican  colleagues, now is the time for an intervention because we have serious  business to deal with in this country: there are issues of war and  peace; there are issues of domestic security; there are issues of  economic security that we have to deal with; and instead, we are  dealing with constant nonsense coming out of the White House. So it is  time for the Republican majority to intervene and to say to the  President, ``Enough is enough.''   Mr. Speaker, you know, for weeks, tax experts have been reporting  that the Republican tax plans would raise taxes on millions of middle  class families in order to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations.  Their proposed legislation may directly benefit President Trump and his  family members to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, according to  independent analyses. President Trump has denied this, stating that he  would be a bigger loser if the House GOP tax bill is approved.   Well, without his tax returns, we simply have no way of knowing  exactly how much President Trump stands to gain from the tax bill. The  American people deserve to know whether or not our President is  directly benefiting from legislation that would hurt millions of  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, H.R.  305, which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the  Presidency to release their tax returns.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, as I stated earlier, there are so many  conflicts of interest in this administration, and especially with this  President. This administration is on a collision course with  corruption. It is time for Democrats and Republicans to stand up and to  be united and to demand a little sunshine on what the reality is.    To discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Wyoming talks about this great tax  bill that the Republicans have proposed. I would call her attention to  an article in Politico/Morning Consult today, which said that 8 percent  of Americans believe that the Senate should take the Republican House- passed tax bill and enact it as-is--8 percent. I don't know how much  lower you can get.   I thought my friend's healthcare bill had terrible ratings. I think  it was like 17 percent of the American people supported it. I don't  know how she can walk around and be proud of what she is trying to do  here when the vast majority of the people don't want what you are  selling. They believe that these policies will be harmful.   We are supposed to be the House of Representatives--the people's  House--not the House of corporations, to give out special deals to  mining companies, or to pass tax bills that benefit corporations at the  expense of middle class families, or to pass healthcare reform that is  a giveaway to insurance companies and rips away health coverage from  millions and millions of people. I mean, come on.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, we believe in transparency on this side of  the aisle, and we need to know what is behind some of these proposes in  this tax bill, to find out who is benefiting and who is not. We know a  lot of middle class families will not benefit. They are going to see  their taxes increase. But we would like to know whether or not this  President is going to benefit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Clay).    I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from  Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Minnesota Governor  Mark Dayton in opposition to H.R. 3905.                                                 State of Minnesota,                                  Office of Governor Mark Dayton,                                  Saint Paul, MN, November 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: I write in strong opposition to HR3905,       which I understand has passed out of Committee and is being       reviewed by House Majority Leadership for a floor vote. I       implore you not to schedule a vote on this bill without a       full vetting of the serious risks to the Boundary Waters       Canoe Area Wilderness from adjacent copper-nickel mining, the       status of the two-year federal study currently underway, and       the wishes of the majority of Minnesotans, who oppose copper-      nickel mining in the immediate vicinity of the Boundary       Waters.        HR3905 is a bill, ``To require congressional approval of       any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the       National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota, to       provide for the renewal of certain mineral leases in such       lands, and for other purposes.'' HR3905 was introduced in       response to the desires of a foreign mining company to use       Congress to circumvent the deliberations of the U.S.       Departments of Interior and Agriculture and their agencies,       the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest       Service (USFS), to determine whether copper-nickel mining can       be conducted safely in this ecologically sensitive part of       Minnesota.        The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BCWAW) is       America's most popular national Wilderness Area, drawing       visitors from all over the world to Northeastern Minnesota to       fish, hunt, and experience its interconnected pristine lakes,       rivers and streams. Additionally, the BWCAW contributes       enormously to Minnesota's social and economic well-being.        In January, 2017, the BLM and the USFS began a       comprehensive two-year study to determine whether copper-      nickel mining, with its toxic by-product, sulfide ore, is       appropriate within the watershed and immediate vicinity of       the BWCA. Specifically, this environmental review will       determine whether the Superior National Forest lands next to       the BWCAW should be removed from the federal mining program       to protect the Wilderness from pollution and other       environmental degradation caused by the resulting sulfide       ore. The study considers a wide variety of factors, including       scientific evidence, public input, economic considerations,       ecological characteristics, and recreational value, among       others.        I respectfully ask that you allow the completion of this       important review process. Over 126,000 Americans have       submitted public comments as part of it. Many attended three       public meetings conducted earlier this year by the BLM and       USFS. Moving HR3905 forward at this time would disregard the       input of all Americans, who have participated in the process,       as well as the views of the 79 percent of Minnesotans, who       favor the two-year pause and environmental review of       potential impacts to the BWCAW.        The BWCAW is crucially important to our state, and I       believe strongly that future federal and state decisions       about its future should be made only after the most careful       and objective scientific review. I urge you to reject the       attempts by a foreign mining corporation to short-circuit the       review process underway, and to affirm the importance of a       careful, objective analysis under the existing federal legal       framework.        Continuing this review process is the best way to allow for       well-informed federal and state decisions, which will affect       many future generations of Americans. Industry should not       dictate the stewardship of taxpayer-owned public lands, nor       use Congress to short-circuit sound decision-making--      especially regarding pristine Wilderness Areas like the       BWCAW.            Sincerely,                                                       Mark Dayton,                                                          Governor.     Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from  the Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters in opposition to the bill; a  letter from the National Parks Conservation Association; and a letter  from the Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes and Pines in  opposition to this bill.                              Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters,                                         Ely, MN, November 29, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge  [[Page H9485]]       you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the so-called ``Minnesota's Economic       Rights in the Superior National Forest Act'' when it is       considered on the House floor.        Simply put, H.R. 3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining       at the edge of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness       (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most       accessible and most-visited wilderness areas. At 1.1 million       acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest wilderness east of       the Rockies and north of the Everglades. This interconnected       system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled       opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.       The connections between Northern Minnesota's national       forests, Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs       National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire       trans boundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of       pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic       industries in America, according to the EPA.        H.R. 3905 would require congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National       Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would       provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases       in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest       Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The bill       undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy       Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters       Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in       Minnesota's national forests.        Contrary to the bill's title, H.R. 3905 would do more harm       than good for the economy of Northern Minnesota. Economic       analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore       mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of       the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000       jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the       economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500       million reduction in private property values.        Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it       would:        Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on       Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters       and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the       Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at       the expense of beloved American public lands.        Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest       Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal       requests in the Superior National Forest due to the       unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the       Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest       System's fresh water supply.        Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting       review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental       assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no       `pending EA.' However, this section would override the       ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)       initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management       to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore       mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is       strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the       citizens of Minnesota. More than 79% of Minnesota voters       support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted       comments during the scoping phase.        Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional       approval for any national monument designations in       Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a       bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by       Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal       lands from potential threats. Monument designation under the       Antiquities Act have provided protections for areas including       the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic       National Parks. Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities       Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.        Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral       withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,       FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to       protect public lands as monuments.        Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal       obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness Act. In       this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the       high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining       Protection Area within the Superior National Forest. The       Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the       Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'       determination that it is necessary to `protect the special       qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland       wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,       recreational and educational value to the Nation.' ''        Make all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests       essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases       is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and       policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and       1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that       require Forest Service consent to any mining.        Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission       that environmental review of impacts on trans boundary water       quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of       four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,       and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and       the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE       H.R. 3905.            Sincerely,          Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, National Wildlife             Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation             Partnership, Fly Fishers International, Minnesota             Division Izaak Walton League of America, American Fly             Fishing Trade Association, Pope and Young Club,             keepitpublic.org.                                   ____                                                      National Parks                                        Conservation Association,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Oppose H.R. 3905: Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior           National Forest Act.         Dear Representative: Since 1919, the National Parks       Conservation Association (NPCA) has been the leading voice of       the American people in protecting and enhancing our National       Park System. On behalf of our more than 1.3 million members       and supporters nationwide, I urge you to oppose H.R. 3905:       Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest       Act when it is reviewed at a markup by the Natural Resources       Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, November 7th and 8th.        NPCA strongly opposes this legislation as it undermines two       decisions made by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of       Land Management (BLM) regarding harmful sulfide-ore copper       mining within the watershed of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park. The legislation also       carves out a special exception for Minnesota from protective       provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) and the Antiquities Act.        H.R. 3905 threatens the decision-making process already set       in motion by the Forest Service to consider a twenty-year       mineral withdrawal within the Superior National Forest in the       Rainy River watershed. These public lands lie upstream of two       prized and federally-protected areas, the Boundary Waters       Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park. Both areas are easily       threatened by pollutants from mining activities in this       watershed given the exclusive drainage into their waters.       Tens of thousands of people have already submitted comments       on this matter and over 2,000 have participated in agency-      sponsored listening sessions. This legislation could erase       the remarkable outpouring of public support for clean water       and public lands, and set a precedent for legislating a       decision that could counter what our federal agencies and       public want.        The legislation also threatens the BLM's decision, with       advice from the Forest Service, not to renew two mineral       leases on the edge of the Boundary Waters Wilderness held by       Twin Metals Minnesota. Although the language of the       legislation is unclear, it is possible its intent is to       restrain Forest Service and BLM discretion on lease renewals       while reinstating the Twin Metals leases. Congress has       granted discretion to the Forest Service and BLM to assess       the circumstances and surrounding environment of any mineral       lease application, including applications for lease renewals.       Based on this discretion, both agencies have determined that       this region is too vulnerable for this type of risky mining,       a type of mining never before allowed in Minnesota. Twin       Metals would operate in the northeastern part of the state       upstream of the Boundary Waters Wilderness that hosts some of       cleanest water in America, and Voyageurs National Park, which       encompasses over 84,000 acres of water relied upon by many       native species.        NPCA also strongly objects to carving out a special       exception for Minnesota from the protective provisions of the       Antiquities Act and FLPMA. The Antiquities Act allows the       president to establish national monuments on federal lands       already owned by all Americans. Nearly every president since       1906 (eight republicans and eight democrats) has used the       Antiquities Act as a bipartisan conservation tool to protect       our nation's history and culture. The bill would eliminate       this authority on federal lands in Minnesota, making it only       the second state declared off-limits for national monuments       declared by presidential proclamation. To carve out       exceptions from this law is nothing short of a betrayal to       the American people and the land and history we've spent       generations protecting.        FLPMA establishes the authority of the Secretary of the       Interior to withdraw land from leasing for up to twenty       years. Any final Forest Service and BLM decision to move       forward with a twenty-year mineral withdrawal would be based       on a thorough, science-based process through the National       Environmental Policy Act. H.R. 3905 would eliminate this       authority solely for Minnesota, alone among the fifty states,       and undermine the ability of the agencies to do their job, as       appointed by Congress.        Thank you for considering our views on this important       legislation. Please reject H.R. 3905 during this week's       markup.            Sincerely,                                                     Ani Kame'enui,                                  Director, Legislation and Policy.  [[Page H9486]]                                          ____          Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes and Pines,                                                 November 26, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: I am writing to request you vote       no on HR 3905, which is a bill that would stop a 2-year       Forest Service study of environmental, economic, and social       risks to the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore copper mining       on Superior National Forest lands in the headwaters of the       Boundary Waters Canoe Area.        For over fifty years, Northern Lakes Canoe Base has offered       wilderness canoe trips in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness (BWCAW). I guided Girl Scout canoe trips for five       years and have directed our wilderness program for 7 years       and am writing this letter to describe the strengths of this       program to you and to underscore the fact that this one-of-a-      kind program cannot exist anywhere other than the Boundary       Waters.        Girls who come on our canoe trips may have had basic       camping and canoeing experiences, but few have experience in       wilderness travel. We typically serve 150-200 girls a summer.        In general, girls travel in wilderness areas less than       boys. Even in 2017, girls are taught to think that the       outdoors is no place for a girl because it is hard work,       dirty, and going to the mall is just much easier. We teach       teenage girls, in a girl-only environment, that their       individual strength and the power of teamwork is far greater       than they ever imagined. They also learn that hard-work and       dirt is part of the fun on a Boundary Waters canoe trip, and       they leave with an appreciation for the beauty of wilderness       and an understanding of the challenges they now know they can       overcome. Girl Scout wilderness canoe trips bring out the       best in teenage girls; we see how creative, hardworking, and       kind they can be to each other. It doesn't take much       imagination to believe that these traits will follow them       back to their everyday life.        We are a high quality, affordable program and pride       ourselves in our thriftiness. We use our canoes for 20+       seasons and packs and paddles summer after summer. We do this       so we can serve girls from all economic backgrounds,       including local iron range and Native American communities.        For years we have received feedback from participants       crediting their Boundary Waters experience for continued,       life-long growth. Our program cannot exist somewhere other       than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. No other       place on earth offers the perfect combination of       accessibility and high adventure that the BWCAW offers. Many       of our participants drive to Ely from Chicago, Milwaukee, and       Minneapolis. Many others fly to Minneapolis and then rent a       car to get to Ely. Unlike many other wilderness areas which       may be high on a mountain range or only accessible by high-      clearance vehicles, it is easy for a mom or dad to drive a       van full of girls to the Boundary Waters, send them on a       trip, and then pick them up a week later.        The Boundary Waters is also unique in that, unlike many       other wilderness areas, visitors don't require any previous       experience or training to have a safe, adventurous trip.       Anyone seeking adventure and challenge belongs on a canoe       trip, not just body builders and endurance athletes. We have       even seen that a Girl Scout canoe trip sometimes inspires       girls who may be uninterested in athletics or leadership to       seek out her own creative ways to be active and healthy,       leading to improved confidence and greater aspirations.       Again, it doesn't take much imagination to conclude that       girls who experience wilderness travel will go on to make the       world a better place.        Girl Scouts canoe trip participants always remark that the       solitude they find in the Boundary Waters is unlike any they       have found elsewhere, whether at their own Girl Scout       resident camp or a state or national park. The quiet       environment of a protected wilderness area gives them an       opportunity to reflect on their life in a way that they could       not in a non-wilderness setting. Girl Scouts end their canoe       trip with a swagger to their step, ready to take on any       challenge that comes their way.        Thank you for doing your part to preserve the Boundary       Waters Canoe Area Wilderness by voting no on HR 3905. It       means a lot to all of us in Ely whose programs and businesses       are focused around wilderness travel.            Sincerely,                                                    Ann McNally,                                           Northern Lakes Canoe Base                                     Summer Program Director/Guide.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why many of us are opposed to H.R.  3905 is because we see it as a corporate giveaway that puts treasured  public lands in the hands of a Chilean mining conglomerate.   So much of what comes out of this Congress is about rewarding those  who are well-connected and well-off, rewarding corporations at the  expense of average citizens.   I will go back to our previous question, which would force a vote.  Everything would still move forward, but it would force a vote on a  bill that was introduced by Ms. Eshoo that would require Presidents and  Presidential nominees to release their tax returns.   It is not just the connections between the Trump family and this  mining company that we have concerns about; it is the connections  between this President and his administration and the tax bill that is  being proposed that we know would raise taxes on millions and millions  of middle class families and basically give a big tax cut to the  wealthiest individuals and to corporate special interests and to  corporations. We think that is all backwards, but I think the American  people deserve to know who benefits and who doesn't.   Again, for the life of me, I don't understand why so many of my  Republican friends have circled the wagons in opposition to  transparency, in opposition to letting the American people know where  this President's conflicts of interests are, and basically protect what  I think may very well be multiple conflicts of interest and maybe  conflicts of interest that lead directly into a collision course with  corruption. This is a big deal.   All this legislation that we are talking about here today, there is a  good piece of legislation, the brownfields legislation; a bad piece,  that is this mining bill. This still goes forward, but vote with us to  defeat the previous question so that we can bring up this other bill.   Now, my Republican colleague from Wyoming may say: Well, that is not  what we are talking about here today. The Democrats are just trying to  muddy up the discussion.   The reason why we have to resort to a procedural motion to bring up  this bill to force the President and Presidential nominees to release  their tax  [[Page H9487]]  returns is because the Rules Committee shuts everything down that this  leadership doesn't want to see come to the floor. We can't bring this  bill to the floor to require the President to release his tax returns  under regular order and our normal process. They won't let us. We can't  offer it as an amendment. They won't let us. This is the only way we  can do it.   I would urge my Republican friends to stop defending the indefensible  here.   This thing would apply not just to Donald Trump, it would apply to  every President. We have never had to do this before because every  other President has released their tax returns. This President, for  some reason, doesn't think it is anybody's business.   Given the nature of the legislation coming out of this House of  Representatives, I think the American people need to know and have a  right to know.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if I could just inquire of the gentlewoman  how many more speakers she has.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition to  H.R. 3905 signed by virtually every major environmental organization in  the country.                                                   November 8, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the       ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest       Act'' scheduled for mark-up in House Natural Resources on       Wednesday. Section 3 of this radical bill, which would       require Congressional approval of any monument extension or       designation involving National Forest lands in Minnesota,       represents yet another direct attack on one of our nation's       bedrock conservation laws, and flatly ignores the       overwhelming public support for protecting unique and       sensitive federal lands and ocean areas through national       monument designations.        We urge the committee to consider the following during       markup of H.R. 3905 this week:        Contrary to the Intent of the Law--The Antiquities Act was       designed to allow for swift and necessary action, including       when Congress is either unable or unwilling to act, to       protect irreplaceable resources from potential threats. Not       only has the law successfully protected some of our nation's       most remarkable historical, cultural and natural treasures       for a century, Congress intentionally left this presidential       power intact when passing the Federal Land Policy and       Management Act of 1976 (signed into law by President Ford).        A Vote Against our Parks--Supporting any bill that would       undermine the Antiquities Act is a vote against parks. Nearly       half of America's national parks began as national monuments       including the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and       Olympic National Parks; and over two-thirds of our national       monuments are managed by the National Park Service. Quite       simply, a vote against the Antiquities Act is a vote against       our national parks and monuments.        Federal Lands Belong to All Americans--The Antiquities Act       is used only to protect federal lands already owned by the       American public. By carving out an exception for national       forest lands within Minnesota, Section 3 of H.R. 3905 flies       in the face of our nation's shared public heritage and       disregards how dearly the public values iconic public lands       and waters, like Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and       Voyageurs National Park.        Bipartisan History--A signature achievement of President       Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act has been used by 16       presidents since its inception--8 Republicans and 8       Democrats.  [[Page H9488]]         Out of Step with the Public--This bill is wildly out of       step with the American public's support for our national       parks and monuments. Just this summer, a vast majority of the       2.8 million people who submitted comments on the issue raised       their voices in support of keeping our national monuments       protected just as they are. These voices made Secretary       Zinke's national monuments public comment period the largest       public comment period in the history of the Interior       Department. Across the West, public support for protecting       our national monuments has proven strong, and a significant       majority of Western voters oppose more mining and drilling on       public lands. According to Colorado College's Conservation in       the West Poll, 80% of western voters support ``future       presidents continuing to protect existing public lands as       national monuments.'' This poll reinforces other surveys that       document widespread public opposition to congressional       attacks on new parks. Americans want more protected public       lands, not less!        Opposed by Diverse List of Hundreds of Organizations--As       demonstrated by this letter as well as the attached letter       signed by nearly 200 organizations, a diverse array of local       and national organizations representing sportsmen, outdoor       recreation businesses, local chambers of commerce, cultural       heritage, historic preservation and conservation have       consistently opposed efforts to undermine the Antiquities Act       in any form.        Disregards Local Economies--Economic research shows that       national monuments support the growth of local economies,       bringing in tourism and recreation dollars and boosting the       quality of life. The Outdoor Industry Association reported       this year that public lands like our national monuments help       support 7.6 million jobs in America, and $887 billion in       outdoor recreation activity.        Monuments Protect our Shared History and Culture--In       response to broad community input, sites honoring America's       military and outdoor heritage, as well as those expanding the       diversity of our national park system to better recognize the       contributions and histories of Native Americans, Hispanics       and African-Americans have been designated under the       Antiquities Act. These monuments include Fort Ord, Fort       Monroe, Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers, Harriet Tubman       Underground Railroad, Chimney Rock, Organ Mountains-Desert       Peaks, Cesar E. Chavez and many more.        Recent attacks on national monuments, from President       Trump's executive order, to Interior Secretary Zinke's hasty       and arbitrary review of these magnificent places, to       legislative proposals like H.R. 3905 are a smokescreen for       other uses of these special places.        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's shared public       resources, we urge you to vote no on H.R. 3905.            Sincerely,        American Bird Conservancy, American Rivers, Boundary Waters       Trust, Center for Biological Diversity, Conservation Lands       Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Earthworks,       Endangered Species Coalition, Environment America,       Environmental Law & Policy Center, Environmental Protection       Information Center, Friends of the Earth, Hip Hop Caucus,       League of Conservation Voters, National Parks Conservation       Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, Northeastern       Minnesotans for Wilderness, Sierra Club, Southern Utah       Wilderness Alliance, Tuleyome, The Wilderness Society,       Wilderness Watch.                                   ____                                                  November 28, 2017.        Dear Representative:  On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the so-      called ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National       Forest Act,'' when it is considered on the House floor.        Simply put, H.R. 3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining       at the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness       (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most-      accessible and most-visited Wilderness Areas. At 1.1 million       acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest Wilderness east of       the Rockies and north of the Everglades. This interconnected       system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled       opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.       The connections between Northern Minnesota's national       forests, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs       National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire       transboundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of       pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic       industries in America, according to the Environmental       Protection Agency.        H.R. 3905 would require congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National       Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would       provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases       in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest       Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The bill       undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy       Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters       Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in       Minnesota's national forests.        Contrary to the bill's title, H.R. 3905 would do more harm       than good for the economy of Northern Minnesota. Economic       analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore       mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of       the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000       jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the       economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500       million reduction in private property values.        Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it       would:        Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on       Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters       and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the       Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at       the expense of beloved American public lands.        Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest       Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal       requests in the Superior National Forest due to the       unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the       Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest       System's fresh water supply.        Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting       review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental       assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no       `pending EA.' However, this section would override the       ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)       initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management       to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore       mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is       strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the       citizens of Minnesota. More than 79% of Minnesota voters       support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted       comments during the scoping phase.        Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional       approval for any national monument designations in       Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a       bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by       Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal       lands from potential threats. Monument designations under the       Antiquities Act have provided protection for areas including       the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic       National Parks. Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities       Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.        Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral       withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,       FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to       protect public lands as monuments.        Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal       obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness Act. In       this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the       high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining       Protection Area within the Superior National Forest. The       Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the       Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'       determination that it is necessary to `protect the special       qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland       wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,       recreational and educational value to the Nation.' '' Make       all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests       essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases       is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and       policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and       1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that       require Forest Service consent to any mining.        Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission       that environmental review of impacts on transboundary water       quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of       four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,       and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and       the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE       H.R. 3905.

[[Page H9489]]                                          ____     Mr. Speaker, we oppose the overall rule, but I will say  to the gentlewoman that we would have no problem even with the closed  rule on the brownfields bill, which is one of the bills that I think  has bipartisan support and reflects a legitimate process.   What we have a problem with is H.R. 3905, which we think is a  corporate giveaway that puts treasured public lands in the hands of a  Chilean mining conglomerate, and we think that is wrong.   I agree with the gentlewoman that we ought to be doing important  business here, but I would argue that, rather than rewarding some  Chilean mining conglomerate, the more important business would be  making sure we keep the government open, because we have a government  shutdown fast approaching on December 8.   I would say to the gentlewoman that we have got to pass the Dream Act  and help 800,000 people whose lives have been thrown into turmoil  because of this President.                                time  1345    We ought to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program. We ought  to debate flood insurance. We ought to pass additional hurricane  relief. We ought to address funding for the Vets Choice Program. That  is more important, that is more vital to the national interest than  basically rewarding some Chilean mining conglomerate.   Finally, I would say to my colleagues here that we will ask you to  vote to defeat the previous question. We will ask you to defeat the  previous question so we can bring up and have a vote on a bill that  will require this President and all Presidents and all party nominees  to release their taxes.   I think the American people have a right to know where the conflicts  of interest are with this White House. I think they have a right to  know who benefits from this tax bill that we know is a giveaway to  corporations that will raise taxes on millions of middle class  families. They have a right to know who benefits from this.   I am astounded that the bar keeps on getting lower and lower and  lower for my Republican friends. I mean, we have daily offensive  tweets. We have irrational statements that come out of this White House  on a daily basis, and there is silence.   When it comes to transparency, when it comes to making sure that  there are no conflicts of interest, my Republican colleagues will not  even allow us to have a vote on basically requiring this President and  all Presidents to release their tax returns. That is not passing  judgment on this President. It would be a requirement of all Presidents  and nominees.   Basically, it is saying, let the sunshine in. Let us make sure that  there are no conflicts of interest. That ought to matter, because  everything that comes out of this House seems to be directed at helping  those who are well-off and well-connected.   Every corporation is cheering when this House comes up with  legislation, whether it is on tax reform or whether it is on helping  mining companies, because it always seems to benefit those who are the  most well-off.   Well, it is about time we put people first. It is about time the  American people know what is going on in this government. Let the  sunshine in. There is nothing wrong with that. We are doing it this way  because it is the only avenue available for us to bring this to a vote,  because the Rules Committee and the leadership in this House shuts off  debate on issues that they find uncomfortable.   This is supposed to be the people's House, not the Russia House. We  ought to be a place where we have deliberative engagements, where we  discuss important issues, where we do things that benefit the American  people.   I would say to my colleagues again, vote ``no'' on the previous  question so we can have this debate. If you want to help the President  cover up his tax returns, fine. You can vote ``no,'' but we ought to  have a vote.   I don't know why this is so controversial. It, to me, is a no- brainer. Vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on the  rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
