 Mr. President, 1 year ago, I said upon the conclusion of  President Trump's first impeachment trial,``Unchallenged evil spreads  like a virus,'' and that acquittal would lead to worse behavior. The  events of January 6--seven dead, the first siege of our Capitol in over  200 years, the disruption of the peaceful transfer of power--are the  direct result of that first acquittal. I voted to convict because seven  needlessly died and hundreds were injured by a former President's  egregious lies. So many risked all to protect us. The least we can do  is protect them by voting to condemn and thus prevent behavior that  should never be repeated.
