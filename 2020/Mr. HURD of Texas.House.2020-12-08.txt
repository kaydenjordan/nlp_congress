 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is full of opportunity.   How else could a young Black kid from San Antonio, Texas, grow up to  come to Congress to represent a majority Latino district and get 17  pieces of legislation signed into law?   My mom always taught me: You are either part of the problem or you  are part of the solution. So, I ran for Congress, and over the past 6  years, I have done everything I can to work with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to get things done.   During my tenure, I have had some legislative lows, like being two  signatures short of a successful discharge petition which would have  led to a DACA fix being put on the President's desk.   We should never stop fighting for these folks who are part of our  American family. People like John Lewis taught us that this kind of  work may be long, and it may be hard, but it is righteous.   At the same time, I have had some legislative highs:   Being the lead Republican, with my friend Jose Serrano, to get the  National Museum of the American Latino Act unanimously passed out of  this House of Representatives--after 26 years, we finally did it.   Modernizing IT procurement laws so that the government provides  better digital-facing services and establishing a national strategy to  ensure the U.S. stays a leader in artificial intelligence are going to  pay off for years.   I came to Congress to make our Nation safer. When I was first  elected, ISIS was our biggest national security threat. As we look at  the years ahead, the nature of the threat is distinctly different.   The next generation-defining battle, which has already begun, is  against the Chinese Communist Party. China is trying to supplant the  United States as the sole superpower in this world by 2049.   Every American should care about this struggle because we face a  potential future where Mandarin and the yuan, not English and the  dollar, dominate the global economy. The winner of this generation- defining struggle will not just affect our economy but will shape the  rest of the century for the entire world.   Within this context of great power competition, I urge my colleagues  to confront this national security threat with a simple principle that  I learned from my time in the CIA: Be nice with nice guys and tough  with tough guys.   Back home, I have learned another simple principle: Show up. I was  willing to show up to places others weren't, listen to what folks had  to say, and work across the aisle to solve problems. We were able to  find solutions to some of the most difficult problems plaguing our  constituents by empowering people, not the government.   I could not have done any of this without my staff. From day one, my  team and I held the belief that no problem was too small and that no  goal was too big. This mentality is how we ended up helping a high- schooler who had an idea of preventing her friends from distracted  driving, and it is how we spent a year working on a national strategy  for artificial intelligence.   Despite these legislative successes, the thing I will remember most  is helping constituents whose names folks don't know battle the Federal  bureaucracy. Making a difference in the lives of those folks is  something I will cherish forever.   To all of my staff over the years, especially Nancy Pack, thank you  for  [[Page H6914]]  your late hours, thank you for your hard work, thank you for putting up  with me, and thank you for your dedication, not just to the folks of  the 23rd Congressional District of Texas, but to the entire American  family.   It has been a distinct privilege to stand on this floor for the past  6 years to debate issues and represent the people of the 23rd  Congressional District. Thank you for putting your faith and trust in  me.   Serving as a Member of Congress has not only taught me about this  incredible institution and how to legislate; it has proven a long-held  belief that way more unites us as a country than divides us.   My final message for my colleagues, as I depart this body: Don't  treat bipartisanship like a four-letter word. The only way big things  have ever been done in this country is by doing them together.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res.  1250, to create a national artificial intelligence strategy.   For decades, American leadership in emerging technologies has created  prosperity and security across the world, but this leadership is no  longer guaranteed. As the Chinese Communist Party continues to use any  means possible to become the next world power and world's leader in AI,  it is all the more vital that the U.S. have our own strategic plan.   For almost a year, Representative Robin Kelly and I worked with  policy experts, stakeholders, and the Bipartisan Policy Center to  develop guidelines that will prepare America's workforce, counter our  adversaries, promote research and development, and shape the ethics of  AI based on America's values.   This resolution outlines specific steps and actions the Federal  Government should take to ensure our global leadership in this emerging  technology. If we don't take advantage of AI, Mandarin and the yuan-- not English and the dollar--could dominate the global economy.   Vladimir Putin once said that whoever masters AI will master the  world. That is why America--not Russia and not China--must be at the  helm.   I came to Congress to make our Nation safer, and I am proud one of my  last pieces of legislation before this body will do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Robin Kelly, for  partnering with me on this critical effort and our staffs for making  this happen. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting  this resolution.                            ____________________
