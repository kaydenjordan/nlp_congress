 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Olympic  gold medalist Tori Bowie.   Bowie was born on August 27, 1990, in Sand Hill, Mississippi. Her  extraordinary track and field talents were apparent very early. In high  school, Bowie won five individual State titles in sprints and the long  jump, as well as three State relay titles.   At the University of Southern Mississippi, she was a two-time NCAA  Division I long jump champion before she switched to sprints full time.   At the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, Bowie's dedication to sprints paid  off. She won the silver medal in the 100-meter dash, a bronze medal in  the 200-meter dash, and a gold medal as part of the U.S. women's 4x100  relay team.   Her passing on May 2 was an American tragedy. Thanks to her  tremendous track and field success, Bowie will be remembered as one of  the greatest athletes in American history.   I raise that to say what a great and very distinguished career, but  Ms. Bowie committed suicide. A young lady with all those  accomplishments still found it necessary to take her life.   Madam Speaker, we need to find out what is going on with our children  and their lives that such an accomplished person would decide to end  her life by her own hands.                            ____________________
