 Mr. President, I want to add my thanks to my colleague from  Arizona. I came to speak on something else, and I will say this: If  there is one individual I have tried to emulate since the day I came to  the U.S. Senate, it has been Jon Kyl. He represented Arizona well, but,  more importantly, he represented the Kyl name well. Jon, I am grateful  that you would come back for this short period. Godspeed as you leave.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today--and it was my intent to ask  unanimous consent with my colleague, the vice chairman of the  Intelligence Committee--for the Senate to confirm Bill Evanina as  Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center.   Bill has served our Nation for over 23 years, including service as a  supervisory special agent and assistant section chief with the Federal  Bureau of Investigation. Prior to joining the NCSC, Bill served as the  chief of counterespionage at the CIA.   Bill has served honorably as the Director of the NSC since June of  2014, before the position required Senate confirmation, necessitating a  vote by the U.S. Senate. Here is a guy who has served for 3\1/2\ years,  and we changed the statute and said that this is a position that the  Senate needs to confirm in the future, and, all of a sudden, the same  guy who has been there is now being held up.   Intelligence threats facing our Nation are numerous. They are  growing, and they are significant. Bill is experienced, professional,  and understands the threats through real world experience. We need a  Director who can ably lead our Nation's counterintelligence security  activities during a period of unprecedented threats. We need someone  who can actively and effectively engage and educate the private sector  on the threats--something Bill has done time and again.   Director Evanina was unanimously approved by the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence in May, and it is time this body moved  forward. We cannot continue to let politics or nongermane issues get in  the way of confirming good people.   I ask this body to confirm Bill Evanina as Director of the National  Counterintelligence Security Center without further delay.   I yield to my vice chairman of the Intel Committee.
