 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1011 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1011         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 184) to       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise       tax on medical devices. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6311) to amend       the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act to modify the definition of qualified       health plan for purposes of the health insurance premium tax       credit and to allow individuals purchasing health insurance       in the individual market to purchase a lower premium copper       plan. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-83 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1011 provides for the  consideration of two bills aimed at removing some of the most  burdensome aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and, as a result, moving  toward lowering healthcare costs for the millions of Americans who are  confronted daily with rising premiums, rising deductibles, and rising  drug prices.   With each bill, we take one step closer to ultimately eliminating the  Affordable Care Act's government-run approach to healthcare and return  to a market-driven solution that puts patients first.   The first bill in today's rule, H.R. 184, the Protect Medical  Innovation Act of 2017, would repeal the excise tax on medical devices  imposed on American companies by the previously mentioned Affordable  Care Act.   The second bill in today's rule, H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to  Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health  [[Page H7096]]  Savings Accounts Act of 2018, expands the availability and the use of  health savings accounts to allow individuals and their families to save  their own money and budget for the healthcare needs they have that  otherwise would not be part of their budget.   Today's resolution provides for a closed rule for H.R. 184, the  Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2017. This is the standard practice  for a tax-related measure on the House floor. The rule provides for 1  hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the  ranking minority member on the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule  does provide the minority with the customary motion to recommit with or  without instructions.   The second part of today's resolution provides for a closed rule for  H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding  Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018. The rule provides for 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking  minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The customary  motion to recommit with or without instructions is provided to the  minority.   This week, Republicans in the House continue our efforts to increase  more healthcare options while driving down premiums in the individual  market. According to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services, premiums  on the exchange are 105 percent higher, on average, in calendar year  2017, compared to premiums in the individual market in calendar year  2013, which was the last year before the Affordable Care Act took  effect.   It is important that we continue to address the negative impact that  the Affordable Care Act has had on the individual market and to help  Americans across the country be more in charge of their healthcare  purchases.   Thus far, the Republican Congress has been successful in nullifying  the individual mandate, repealing the Independent Payment Advisory  Board, and delaying many of the harmful taxes on American businesses  and American consumers. I am also encouraged by the actions of the  administration in permitting more low-cost limited duration insurance  plans and allowing access to association health plans for more small  businesses.   These are choices that are provided to the American people so that  they, the American people, can be in the driver's seat, not the other  way around with the ACA's government-approved one-size-fits-all  healthcare model.   With that in mind, two bills we are considering this week seek to  expand and improve health savings accounts. Under the current rule,  H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plan and Expanding  Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018, will enhance the benefit of tax- preferred health accounts so that individuals can better plan and save  for their healthcare needs, and, also, these individuals will see lower  premiums on their healthcare plans.   For the last several Congresses, I have argued to improve the utility  of health savings accounts, and so I am pleased to see that these  important policies are being advanced through the House this week.   In addition to offering health insurance, many employers often  arrange to reimburse their employees and their dependants some of their  medical expenses that are not covered by health insurance. Health  flexible spending accounts and health reimbursement arrangements are  two of the more common arrangements offered by employers.   I have heard the frustration of employees, many of whom are my  constituents in north Texas, over forfeiting the remaining amounts in  their flexible spending account at the end of each plan year. We can  all agree that the healthcare needs and purchases vary from year to  year, where one year a person may have more medical expenses than the  next or the other way around.   One of the provisions in H.R. 6311 eliminates the arbitrary ``use it  or lose it'' rule and allows flexible spending account balances to be  carried over to the next plan year within a reasonable annual flexible  spending account contribution limit.   Another provision allows working seniors that are covered under an  HSA-eligible high deductible health plan and enrolled in Medicare part  A to continue to contribute to their health savings account. Just  because someone becomes eligible for Medicare because of age, they  should not be prohibited from continuing to contribute to a health  savings account.   Under current law, there are annual health savings account  contribution limits. In 2018, the limit for an individual was $3,450.  For families, that amount was $6,900. While these limits are updated  annually for inflation, they are significantly less than the combined  limit on annual out-of-pocket deductible expenses.   H.R. 6311 would allow individuals to increase their contributions to  equal to the combined annual limit on the out-of-pocket and deductible  expenses under their HSA-qualified insurance plan. That would be $6,550  for an individual and $13,300 for a family this year.   The Affordable Care Act limits the option of individuals enrolled in  bronze and so-called copper, or catastrophic, plans to make HSA  contributions. Also, only those under 30 or those that qualify for a  hardship exemption are actually able to purchase the so-called copper  health plan. That is a 50 percent actuarial value health plan.   So, today, I am pleased that a bill that I introduced with  Representative Roskam, H.R. 6314, the Health Savings Act of 2018, to  expand the eligibility and the access to health savings accounts by  allowing plans categorized as catastrophic and bronze plans in the  individual and small group markets to qualify for HSA contributions.  That is included in this bill.   Lastly, I appreciate working with the Ways and Means Health  Subcommittee Chairman Peter Roskam on H.R. 6311. One of the key  provisions of the bill is to provide an off-ramp from ObamaCare's  rising premiums and limited choices by allowing the premium tax credit  to be used for qualified plans offered outside of the law's exchanges  and healthcare.gov.   In addition, it expands access to the lowest premium plans available,  so-called copper or catastrophic plans, for all individuals purchasing  coverage in the individual market and allows the premium tax credit to  be used to offset the cost of such plans.                                time  1230    I recognize not everyone will choose to have a health savings  account, but they should have the option because HSAs represent a  powerful tool to lower prices and improve access to quality care for  everyone, and those are goals that we can all share.   Now, it is well documented that many of the provisions contained  within the Affordable Care Act have negative consequences on patients,  both in access to care and in affordability. One of the provisions that  has been universally criticized is that, on a large, bipartisan nature,  its repeal was called for almost immediately after the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. This is the tax on medical device manufacturers,  or more commonly referred to as the medical device tax.   It seems illogical that within a piece of legislation that was  purported to make medical care available, more accessible to all  Americans, the Federal Government would want to tax the very providers  of medical innovation that create devices to improve the delivery of  healthcare, but, nevertheless, that is exactly what happened when  ObamaCare passed in 2010, and it was done as a means to pay for the  astronomical price tag that accompanied the Affordable Care Act.   This tax burden is unfair, and it actually increases costs that  consumers pay at their doctors' offices. The tax has also been cited by  dozens of medical device manufacturers who have or are considering  moving their operations overseas so that they can continue to innovate  without the heavy burden of this tax stifling their growth. This tax  slows the creation of new techniques and devices, which will make the  delivery of medicine more efficient, and it puts at risk the jobs that  were created by the creation of such devices.   For anyone who thinks that we are merely talking about the largest  and most expensive pieces of technology found within a hospital-- basically, your MRI, CAT scans, and some surgical equipment--let's be  clear that  [[Page H7097]]  this tax covers every piece of medical equipment, from those large  machines to the smallest of items, including syringes used to deliver  lifesaving antibiotics and vaccines. It continues to negatively impact  a number of constituents in my district and, I am certain, in districts  around the country, and it does continue to create a burden on a number  of companies.   The medical device tax has led to the elimination of thousands of  good-paying jobs, and repealing it would be the first step to bringing  those jobs back and stem the loss of future jobs within this vital  industry that is helping to mitigate rising costs of healthcare due to  the burdensome provisions within the Affordable Care Act.   This is a tax on business, a tax on consumers, and a tax on  innovation. To date, 33,000 jobs have been lost in the medical device  industry since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and it is  projected that over 130,000 additional jobs are on the chopping block.   Why would anyone be surprised about this? Excise taxes--and that is  what this is, an excise tax--are meant to lead to a reduction in the  consumption of the goods being taxed. We place an excise tax on  cigarettes. We want to discourage people from smoking. We make it  burdensome to afford a smoking habit.   Did we really intend, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act by  congressional Democrats in 2010, to make it more burdensome to use more  efficient medical devices?   H.R. 184 has bipartisan, bicameral support, with currently 277  cosponsors. Republican leadership in the House has heard this request  and heard the calls from many Members within this body and is moving  this bill in a responsible way to put Americans back to work and lower  healthcare costs for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman is quite correct in identifying the other body as  sometimes an obstacle to good public policy, for it was 1 year ago that  the other body blocked a health care reform that this body had passed  the previous May.   But, Mr. Speaker, I want to draw the House's attention to an article  in today's Wall Street Journal. The title of the article is ``TrumpCare  beats ObamaCare.'' And I just want to quote a little bit from this  article.   To set the stage, in December, with the repeal of the individual  mandate, and quoting here: ``But while many people didn't realize it at  the time, it turns out that Mr. Trump has been helping to improve an  important source of insurance coverage since virtually the moment he  took office.''   Continuing to quote here: ``By prioritizing economic growth and  reducing the tax and regulatory burdens on U.S. business, Mr. Trump has  helped create an economy with more job openings than ever before. As if  by magic, the invisible hand of a freer marketplace is now generating  new benefits as employers compete to fill all those open positions.''    Continuing to quote here: ``For the first time in six years, the  share of U.S. workers offered health insurance through their employer  has risen, a sign a tighter labor market is prompting businesses to  offer more generous benefits.''   So, Mr. Speaker, I simply submit that the activities of the Trump  administration have, indeed, improved the healthcare landscape in this  country. That is something we should acknowledge and embrace.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The gentleman from Florida is making a point about open rules, and I  do feel obligated to point out in the 111th Congress--that was the  Congress that was the first 2 years of President Obama's  administration--in the 111th Congress, under Speaker Pelosi, the  majority had zero open rules. That is zero open rules in the 2 years in  which we saw the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the passage of  Dodd-Frank; the House-passed Waxman/Markey, which was a cap-and-trade  global warming bill, so significant pieces of legislation passed the  floor of this House, all under closed rules.   But, Mr. Speaker, today's rule brings forward two pieces of  legislation that will have a meaningful impact on Americans' healthcare  costs, including the premiums and the prices they pay for medicines.                                time  1300    H.R. 184, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2017, which will  repeal the Affordable Care Act's ill-conceived medical device tax, and  H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding  Health Savings Account Act of 2018, which will provide greater freedom  for Americans to use their own money to pay for medical expenses out of  their health savings accounts, both of these build on the House's work  over the past 2 years to make healthcare a more patient-centered  market.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to thank Representatives Paulsen and  Roskam for their work on these measures. I urge my colleagues to  support today's rule and move the debate forward on this legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 1011 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 3. Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following       new clause:        ``Restrictions on Consideration of Legislation That Would       Cut Medicare or Medicaid.        13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint       resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses,       or conference report which includes any provision described       in paragraph (b).        (b) A provision referred to in paragraph (a) is a provision       which, if enacted into law, would result in either of the       following:        (1) a reduction of guaranteed benefits for individuals       entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under the Medicare       program under title XVIII of 18 such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et       seq.); or        (2) a reduction of benefits or eligibility for individuals       enrolled in, or eligible to receive medical assistance       through, a State Medicaid plan or waiver under title XIX of       such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 5 et seq.).        (c) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a). As disposition       of any point of order under paragraph (a) or this paragraph       (except a point of order against an amendment pursuant to       paragraph (a)), the Chair shall put the question of       consideration with respect to the measure, order, conference       report, or rule as applicable. The question of consideration       shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating       the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but       shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except       one that the House adjourn.''                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member  [[Page H7100]]       who led the opposition to ordering the previous question.       That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an       amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of       amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1012 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1012         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6199) to       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include certain       over-the-counter medical products as qualified medical       expenses. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now       printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-82 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from July       27, 2018, through September 3, 2018--        (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 4.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar day for       purposes of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.       1546).        Sec. 5.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.        Sec. 6.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar or       legislative day for purposes of clause 7(c)(1) of rule XXII.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1012 provides for the  consideration of an important bill to return control of healthcare  spending and budgeting back where it belongs: with the patient.   H.R. 6199, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health  Savings Accounts Act of 2018, would amend the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to include certain over-the-counter medical products as qualified  medical expenses for the purposes of spending one's own dollars within  a health savings account.   Today's resolution provides for a rule to allow H.R. 6199, the  Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts  Act of 2018, the standard practice for a tax-related measure on the  House floor. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled between the chair and the ranking minority member of the  Committee on Ways and Means. The rule does, however, provide the  minority with the customary motion to recommit with or without  instructions.   Also included in the resolution before us today are the standard  provisions allowing the House of Representatives to continue to operate  while Members are home, working with their constituents during the  August district work period.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the rule on H.R.  6199, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings  Accounts Act of 2018. This rule includes the work of various Members of  Congress on the important issue of modernizing health savings accounts.  While this legislation did not move through the Health Subcommittee of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, my fellow members on the other  Health Subcommittee, that of the Ways and Means Committee, have done  quality work in moving this package. Each bill was reported favorably  out of the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I have long been a supporter of increasing flexibility  within our healthcare system, especially through the use of health  savings accounts. Health savings accounts allow patients to feel more  involved and to have more control over their healthcare spending. As  someone who has personally had a health savings account in the past, I  believe it to be a powerful tool but that qualified expenses have been  limited for too long.   This package will give more power to consumers by allowing them to  use their hard-earned savings that they put into their health savings  accounts on an expanded number of healthcare goods and services.   The first bill in this package, Promoting High-Value Healthcare  Through Flexibility for High-Deductible Health Plans Act, introduced by  Chairman Roskam, allows for first-dollar coverage flexibility for high- deductible health plans. Many individuals, especially in the post- Affordable Care Act world, have chosen to purchase high-deductible  health plans. While this is a reasonable choice for many consumers,  there are some who are faced with high out-of-pocket costs.   H.R. 6199 allows health plans to provide coverage for up to $250 per  year for individuals or $500 per year for families before they meet  their deductible. The goal of this provision is to incentivize services  that could reduce future healthcare costs, such as primary care visits  and telehealth services.   Additionally, under current law, individuals are unable to contribute  to an HSA if they participate in a direct primary care service  arrangement. Representative Erik Paulsen's Primary Care Enhancement  Act, which is included in this rule, enables patients to be able to  participate in a direct primary care service arrangement and remain  qualified to contribute to a health savings account. It also includes  direct primary care service arrangement fees as medical expenses.   Some individuals are fortunate enough to receive certain healthcare  services at or nearby their workplace through their employer.  Representative  Mike Kelly's bipartisan Health  [[Page H7101]]  Savings Account Improvement Act of 2018, which is included in this  package, addresses this issue.   While it is convenient and helpful to have access to such services,  these individuals should not be barred from having a health savings  account. This package creates a special rule that individuals can  receive free or discounted services offered by their employers onsite  or at retail medical clinics. These services may include physical  exams, immunizations, nonprescription drugs, treatment of employment- related injuries, drug testing if required as a condition of  employment, hearing or vision screenings, or other services that are  not considered significant benefits in the nature of medical care.   Mr. Speaker, the post-Affordable Care Act world is riddled with  flaws, but one of the biggest problems is its failure to promote  consumer-driven healthcare. Expanding the use of health savings  accounts could go a long way to reverse this trend. Health savings  accounts give consumers incentives to manage their own healthcare costs  by coupling a tax-favored savings account used to pay medical expenses  with a high-deductible health plan that meets certain requirements for  deductibles and out-of-pocket expense limits. The funds in a health  savings account are owned by the individual and may be rolled over from  year to year.   Health savings accounts are not a novel idea. They have been around  since 2004, but current health savings account policy is  extraordinarily restrictive, making it harder for consumers to take  advantage of it.    I have spent several years in developing extensive reforms to  increase the potential for health savings accounts for consumers, and  H.R. 6199 includes meaningful improvements that we can, in fact, get  across the finish line now to help families now.   One of these improvements is the ability for spouses to contribute to  a health savings account under certain circumstances even if their  spouse has a flexible spending account. Under current law, one spouse  can reimburse expenses for their spouses' and other dependents' medical  expenses; therefore, the other spouse is considered to be ineligible  for an HSA.   This provision enables the spouse without the flexible spending  account to reimburse for medical expenses, with certain restrictions.  This is critical, as it gives individuals increased flexibility to save  for their own healthcare expenses that a shared flexible spending  account for the whole family may not provide.   Additionally, this bill allows for individuals to terminate or  convert their flexible spending account and health reimbursement  accounts into a health savings account under certain circumstances.  Employers would be able to allow their employees to convert their  flexible spending account and health reimbursement account balances  into health savings account funds if they enroll in a high-deductible  health plan with an HSA. This is critical in empowering patients and  allowing them the flexibility to change health plans without losing  their savings.   There is a dollar limitation of $2,650 for conversions for  individuals, $5,300 for families, and the funds transferred into the  HSA would count toward the enrollee's HSA contribution for that taxable  year.   H.R. 6199, the bill introduced by Representative Lynn Jenkins from  Kansas, makes commonsense, patient-centered reforms to help defray  costs for individuals. Over-the-counter medications, allergy and cold  medicines, antibiotic ointment, and pain relievers are historically  ineligible expenditures for HSA and other tax-favored healthcare  accounts. The ACA created a requirement in Federal law that forced  account holders to go to their doctor to obtain a prescription for  over-the-counter medications before purchasing them with their health  savings account or flexible spending account. Individuals who fail to  jump through these hoops and purchase over-the-counter medications  without a prescription, in fact, face a tax penalty for making a  nonqualified distribution.   This policy drives unnecessary utilization of doctor services,  decreases access to over-the-counter medications, and discourages  people from taking control of saving for their healthcare needs. H.R.  6199 repeals this harmful provision, puts consumers back in the  driver's seat, and allows them efficient access to appropriate  medications.   Lastly, this legislation permits individuals to invest their hard- earned health savings account dollars into their physical fitness and  well-being. In many ways, income is a hurdle for individuals and  families who would like to participate in a physical activity, whether  they would like to pay for a membership at a fitness facility or pay  for their children to join a youth sports league. This legislation  opens the door for paying for such activities with health savings  account dollars.   Known originally as a standalone bill, the Personal Health Investment  Today Act, introduced by Representative Jason Smith, allows qualified  sports and fitness expenses to count as qualified medical expenses.  These particular expenses are capped at $500 a year for individuals and  $1,000 on a joint return.                                time  1315    Passage of this provision will assist individuals and families across  the Nation in investing in their physical fitness, which can lead them  to healthier lives and stave off conditions such as diabetes and  obesity. These bills are an important example of the work we are doing  right now to advance Member-driven solutions that will improve  healthcare for all Americans.   Deductibles, out-of-pocket limitations have been steadily growing.  Congress should be taking steps to make it easier for Americans to  save, not restricting their options. The rule and the underlying bills  included in this package strengthen consumer power and increase  flexibility for patients in paying for their medical expenses.   I appreciate all of the work that the Members have put into the  provisions of this bill. I urge my colleagues to support today's rule  and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to draw attention to an opinion  article in today's Wall Street Journal. The title of the article is  ``TrumpCare Beats ObamaCare,'' July 23, 2018, penned by James Freeman.   ``By prioritizing economic growth and reducing the tax and regulatory  burdens on U.S. business, Mr. Trump has helped to create an economy  with more job openings than ever before. As if by magic, the invisible  hand of a freer marketplace is now generating new benefits as employers  compete to fill all those open positions.''                                time  1330    ``For the first time in 6 years, the share of U.S. workers offered  health insurance through their employer has risen, a sign a tighter  labor market is prompting businesses to offer more generous benefits. .  . .''   ``The Trump plan is repairing at least some of the damage caused by  ObamaCare. Notes the Journal:   ``Among all private-sector workers offered medical benefits, 72  percent opted to take them,'' which is up from the 17 percent in 2010  when it began to decline.   Again, Mr. Speaker, this is to point out that this is all occurring  without a new government program. This is because of the strength of  the economy. This is what happens when you put the focus on creating  good jobs for American workers. This is the benefit that results.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was serving in the United States House of  Representatives when the congressional Democrats passed the Affordable  Care Act. I was serving in the House of Representatives when the  implementation of ObamaCare happened at the end of calendar year 2013.   I have got to tell you something. The President told me I had a junk  insurance plan. I was covered by a health savings account in those  years. Then-President Obama told me I had a junk insurance plan and  that I was going to get something better.   I have got to tell you something. I didn't get something better. I  went through healthcare.gov. I bought an unsubsidized ObamaCare policy,  the bronze plan. I am like any other consumer. I bought on price.   What is the cheapest thing I could afford? That was the bronze plan.  The premium was unbelievable. It was three times what I had paid for a  premium before for my so-called junk insurance which I had had for  years, which had covered every medical contingency that had occurred in  my family's life for a number of years. But now I have to buy this  policy that the premium was unbelievably high. But that wasn't the  worst part, Mr. Speaker. The worst part was the deductible.   Now, look, I had a health savings account. I bought one as soon as  the old medical savings accounts were allowed with the passage of the  Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in, I think it was, July of 1996. The rules got  written the next year. People were allowed to buy medical savings  accounts. I bought one. I converted to a health savings account in  2004.   I thought I knew what a high deductible was. That was the whole  purpose, after all, of having that medical savings account and, now,  health savings account. You have a higher deductible so your premiums  are going to be a little bit lower.   My premium certainly wasn't lower, but that deductible was something  unlike anything I had ever seen. I went from a $3,500 deductible in my  old health savings account with what then-President Obama said was a  junk insurance policy. I went from a $3,500 premium to a $6,800 premium  for just an individual. This is not a family policy, just for an  individual.   Now, let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker. Someone wakes up at 3 in  the morning with a kidney stone, the worst pain they have ever had in  their life. They go to the emergency room basically to get a shot of  morphine and an appointment with a urologist the next day and hopefully  pass the darn thing. That exercise can cost in excess of $4,000. If you  have a $6,800 deductible, guess what. That is all on you. Your coverage  is meaningless at that point. And at the same time, you are having to  pay a very expensive premium for coverage that is not there when you  need it.   I am not an expert on this, Mr. Speaker, but I would call that junk  insurance. That is what then-President Obama and the Congressional  Democrats brought us with the passage of the so-called Affordable Care  Act. I would far rather go back to those days before.   Most people don't understand why it is they have less coverage now  and it costs them more money. Yeah, they heard the argument, if you  like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; if you like your coverage,  you can keep your coverage. They recognize that perhaps that was  political hyperbole. But what they do not understand is: Why am I  having to pay so much more now to get so much less?   Mr. Speaker, I submit that the ability for individuals to buy health  savings accounts is not junk insurance. That is coverage that people  can use. That is help for right now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First off, Mr. Speaker, let me reference an article from the  Investor's Business Daily from April 10 of this year. I am quoting  Investor's Business Daily:   ``When the Congressional Budget Office released its updated budget  forecast, everyone focused on the deficit number. But buried in the  report was the Congressional Budget Office's tacit admission that it  vastly overestimated the cost of the Trump tax cuts because it didn't  account for the strong economic growth they would generate.   ``Among the many details in the report, the one reporters focused on  was the Congressional Budget Office's forecast that the Federal deficit  would top $1 trillion in 2020. . . .''   Most of the news accounts blame the tax cuts.   I am continuing to quote here:   ``But there's more to the story that the media overlooked.   ``First, the CBO revised its economic forecast sharply upward this  year and next.   ``Last June, the CBO said GDP growth for 2018 would be just 2  percent. Now it figures growth will be 3.3 percent''--this was last  April, Mr. Speaker; I suspect it is probably going to be higher at the  end of this quarter--``a significant upward revision. It also boosted  its forecast for 2019 from a meager 1.5 percent to a respectable 2.4  percent.''                                time  1345    Mr. Speaker, the tax cuts are working to boost economic growth.  Obviously, the story is far from completed, but the revenue generated  by that increased growth is more than enough to offset the tax cuts  that were passed by this body last December.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule allows the House to take another step in  fixing the problems created by the Affordable Care Act and returning  control of healthcare spending back to patients, where it belongs.   H.R. 6199, the Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2018, will allow  those Americans with health savings accounts to use those accounts to  pay for over-the-counter medications, the practice which existed up  until the Democrats took away that ability in the Affordable Care Act.  This is the right thing to do.   I want to thank Representative Jenkins for her leadership on this  legislation and the Members who contributed to the package that is  before us today. I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and  support the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 1012 Offered by Ms. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6479) to amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act       to include short-term limited duration plans in the       definition of individual health insurance coverage. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6479.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
