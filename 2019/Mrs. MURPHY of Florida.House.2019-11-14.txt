 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Thaddeus  Seymour, Sr., who passed away recently at the age of 91.   In the obituary that appeared in our local, hometown paper, the  Orlando Sentinel, Thad was described by one of his many admirers as a  community treasure, and I think that sums up his life and legacy  perfectly.   Thad moved with his beloved wife, Polly, and their children to the  Orlando area over 40 years ago when Thad was named the 12th president  of Rollins College, where I had the privilege to teach before being  elected to Congress.   Thad served for a dozen years as the president of Rollins, from 1978  to 1990, and although he had long left by the time I arrived, his name  was spoken on campus with respect and affection.   Thad was recognized as a popular and effective leader of the  institution, helping make this gem of a school shine even brighter.   One decision Thad made during his tenure may seem modest, but it was  meaningful to people who know Rollins best. In the 1950s, one of Thad's  predecessors established Fox Day. Each spring, as finals loomed and on  a day considered too beautiful to sit in a classroom, the school's  president would cancel classes and provide students with a surprise day  off.   The tradition was ended during the Vietnam war, but Thad brought it  back. As Thad would recall years later: ``The world had grown so grim,  I thought we needed to cheer ourselves up.'' It is a choice that  underscores both Thad's love of life and his belief that, at core, a  college should be a close-knit community where young men and women live  together; learn together; and, in many cases, become lifelong friends.  Because Fox Day helped foster a sense of community and shared  experience, Thad believed it mattered.   Thad left Rollins in 1990, but he never left central Florida, and he  never stopped caring about our community. In fact, he literally helped  build it, co-founding a chapter of Habitat for Humanity in Winter Park  and in Maitland.  [[Page H8831]]    There is a wonderful picture of Thad in the Orlando Sentinel  obituary. He is helping construct a home for someone less fortunate. He  is perched on a ladder. His shirt is splattered with paint. He has a  broad smile on his face. That is how I will always remember Thad:  happily helping, happily building.   May President Seymour rest in peace.                            ____________________
