 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man of profound  courage and vision: Jeromy Sullivan, the late chairman of the Port  Gamble S'Klallam Tribe.   From his early years, Jeromy was molded by his surroundings,  nurturing a love of the land and the water and their gifts.   His early experiences digging for clams or catching crab and salmon  imbued him with a deep connection to his culture and to his  environment. Besides being an experienced leader, he was still a  relatively young man when we lost him last month.   I loved to see Jeromy's pride and enthusiasm for the progress being  made by his Tribe. Once, he gave me a tour of the Tribe's new health  facility, and it mattered to him that Tribal members could get care in  a quality environment, that they had the respect and the dignity that  all Americans deserve.   He was proud that not only was the facility first class, but rather  that the care that people would receive would be first class as well.   Jeromy was also a passionate advocate for Tribal treaty rights.  Jeromy saw his role as Tribal chairman to be one of not only advocating  for today's fishermen or geoduck harvesters, he was a champion for the  rights of future generations of Port Gamble's S'Klallam Tribal members.   I can't tell you how many conversations I had over the last 10 years  about discussions with the Navy in which Jeromy was unbending in his  belief that he had a responsibility to ensure that his people could  enjoy the rights promised to them in their treaty.   Last year, I visited a new housing development the Port Gamble  S'Klallam Tribe was undertaking, and Jeromy beamed as he explained that  these weren't just investments in shelters; they were investments in  families. He said: Think of what this will mean to our Tribal members.   Jeromy often told me that he prayed for the leaders of his Tribe and  for the leaders of our country, that he asked for strength and wisdom,  and Jeromy showed those every day.   To those who loved him most, Jeromy was a loving family man, survived  by his wife, Toni; their children, Samantha and Jacob; and his  brothers, Chad and Corey.   In the musical ``Hamilton,'' they asked the question: What is a  legacy? Answering: It is planting seeds in a garden you will never get  to see.   Well, I am saddened that Jeromy won't get to see the fruit of some of  his projects. They will nourish the Tribe's members for generations.  Indeed, Jeromy's legacy will live on, reminding us to protect what we  love and to stand tall for our beliefs.   Jeromy Sullivan's memory will continue to guide his people and his  spirit will endure in the lands and the waters that he loved, the  waters that he healed, and the community he served so faithfully.   Mr. Speaker, the last thing Jeromy texted me were the words: ``I miss  you, my friend, and I hope we will connect soon.'' I miss him, too, and  I will always treasure our friendship.                              Honoring Rick Tift     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Rick Tift,  executive director of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, who has dedicated his  life to public service.   Rick is retiring after 45 years of service at Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard, 19 of those as executive director, Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard's top civilian management position.   The executive director oversees internal processes and administrative  processes and is the overall coordinator outside of direct maintenance  issues.   Rick has acted as a constant for 19 years when commanding officers  came and went, always advocating for the workforce, and acting as a  liaison to the community.   Rick has lived in Bremerton since 1962, a graduate of Central Kitsap  High, Olympic College, the University of Washington, and the University  of Puget Sound.   He serves as a member of the city of Bremerton's Planning Commission,  he was a former board member of St. Michael Medical Center, he was a  board member and past president of Leadership Kitsap, and sits on the  [[Page H3644]]  Chancellor's advisory board at the University of Washington Tacoma.   There are not enough words to express my gratitude to Rick for  everything he has done for our community and the tremendous help he has  been to me during my time in this office.   Rick is a fair, considerate, compassionate, and kind person who  really cares about the community he lives and serves in. Rick has been  instrumental in working with the community to find pathways for  employment at the shipyard. He has been a fierce advocate for the  shipyard, making sure elected officials, educational institutions, and  the greater community understand the opportunities for employment  within its workforce.    With the Federal Government being the largest employer in my  district, I appreciate his efforts as we are all invested in making  sure we have the next generation of workers and future leaders at Puget  Sound Naval Shipyard and IMF.   Those efforts really can't be understated. He has been a staunch  advocate for infrastructure and needed improvements to the shipyard  inside and outside of its gates, helping to bring elected officials at  every level and Navy leadership together to find ways to make needed  improvements.   That is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the positive impact  Rick has made with his time.   You will never find a more dedicated, loyal, considerate man than  Rick, and it has been an absolute pleasure to work with him.   Mr. Speaker, he will be dearly missed, and I wish him all the best in  his next chapter as he moves off into retirement. We wish him well, and  thank him for his friendship and partnership.                            ____________________
