 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), my colleague, for his leadership on this  issue, and to all the Members of our class who have joined together in  the shared belief that this institution is one of, by, and for the  people, not one belonging to a class of professional politicians or  partisan elites. Since being sworn in earlier this year to serve the  people of Bucks and Montgomery County, I have made it my mission to  advance commonsense bipartisan government reform agenda that includes,  perhaps, the single most important thing that I believe we need to do  in this Nation, and that is institute term limits.   For 14 years, serving as an FBI agent, most of that time being in the  political corruption units throughout the country, there was one  commonality that I saw very frequently--there was an unmistakable  correlation between the length of time in office and the instances of  corruption, and that the lines that were very bright for elected  officials coming into the system on day one weren't so bright in year  7, 8, or 9, and certainly not in year 15 or 20.   Even the most well-intended backbone individuals oftentimes can be  corrupted by a system that has the power to change some people. Those  lines become blurred over time. And it is with this background and  these real-world experiences that myself and my colleagues are pushing  this issue, in this House of Representatives, in this Chamber, for the  115th Congress.   I, myself, introduced House Resolution 7 on my first day, among other  reform-minded measures, on my first day in Congress. This was a  constitutional amendment that would, once and for all, set term limits  for Members of the House and the Senate.   As tonight shows, there is a wide range of support for this need of  reform. And, in a time of deep political division and distrust between  citizens and their government at an all-time high, term limits can be  the first step towards restoring the essential bond between the  American people and Congress.   So I urge my colleagues to join us in transitioning power away from  the political class here in Washington, D.C., and sending it back to  its rightful place--in the hands of the American people.                                time  1730    I thank my colleague, Mr. Fitzpatrick, not only for his leadership on  this issue, but on a host of issues related to congressional reform,  whether it is no budget, no pay, or a series of other bills that he has  introduced; and I look forward to working with him.   Mr. Speaker, just to show that this is an issue that transcends  parties, that transcends ideological divide, I am honored to yield to  my colleague from the great State of California (Mr. Khanna).
