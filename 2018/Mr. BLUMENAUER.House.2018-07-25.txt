 Mr. Speaker, every day there is a head-spinning  moment with someone who is willing to push the Presidential powers to  the point of abuse.   Trump is undermining freedom of the press with unprecedented attacks.   He cast doubt on the integrity and competence of United States  intelligence services.   He has an administration that is manipulating the data of a dishonest  agency evaluation of the impact of monuments status that protects  hundreds of thousands of acres and endangered species like the  magnificent sage-grouse.   Today's outrage is a plan to use the Commodity Credit Corporation to  funnel another $12 billion for a bailout of American farmers. You know,  most farmers and ranchers don't want a government bailout. They would  like to be able to farm. They would like to be able to market. They  would like to be able to sell their products without the threat of  Trump's trade war.   Soon after Obama took office, inheriting the worst economy since the  Great Depression, we have seen steady private sector employment growth  for 9 consecutive years. Now, after inheriting a strong and growing  economy, Trump and his enablers in the Republican Party are threatening  this progress with a trade war that increases prices for American  consumers, for American businesses, and is raising their costs.   It is hard to keep track of everything. Trump is involved with an  all-out war on the Affordable Care Act. After utterly failing in his  promise--remember, he was going to provide better healthcare for more  people at lower cost. Who knew healthcare was complicated. Instead, his  administration is raising insurance costs for millions in the  individual market while destabilizing insurance for the rest of us.   There were promises of tax reform, making it simpler and fairer.  Instead, we have hopelessly complicated the Tax Code. We have given  massive tax cuts for many people who didn't need them. We are going to  be watching for  [[Page H7160]]  taxes being raised on homeowners across the country over the next 10  years.   And, as a result of these actions for the budget and the taxes, we  have doubled the budget deficit this year, with the prospect of  deficits every year of a trillion dollars or more as far as the eye can  see.   After Republicans have cut over $2 trillion in taxes since 2001 for  just the top 1 percent, what is the solution our Republican friends are  offering to deal with the consequences? Look at the budget they just  passed. Mr. Speaker, $2 trillion of cuts in programs for everybody  else: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act.   At some point, the public is going to catch on to what is happening  to them. In fact, maybe they already are. Maybe that is the reason that  the Republican tax cuts are less popular than Bill Clinton's tax  increase.   It is time that we take a step back, while we still can, and get back  on the appropriate fiscal course. It does not mean trade wars and  providing money for people who don't need it.   Let's allow the economy to function without gimmicks and bailouts.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here with Ms. Jenkins, moving forward  on this legislation. It represents an opportunity for us to deal with a  series of, as she mentioned, bipartisan ideas, relatively simple, to  enhance service delivery.   I state from the outset that I am troubled that we were not able to  provide opportunities to pay for these. They carry a cost. In  committee, even though I thought they were a good idea, I voted against  some of them because they were rather expensive.   In the aggregate, these are things, moving forward, that will improve  healthcare, and I am hopeful that, as we move along the process, we can  find some ways to offset the costs involved.   Some of us have philosophical questions about the role of HSAs and  how it fits overall, but this legislation will make key consumer- friendly improvements to our existing system. Direct primary care  medical homes are an important example of successful delivery reforms  that will become easier to access under this legislation.   DPC arrangements offer individuals access to comprehensive primary  care and prevention services in a medical home setting for a flat  monthly fee, as opposed to concierge services that some people have in  mind. Most of these practices typically charge a low monthly fee,  perhaps $50 to $100, in most cases, and they serve low- and  [[Page H7654]]  moderate-income patients. These fees support the delivery of high- quality, coordinated care by providing better healthcare upfront in  primary care settings.   DPC practices reduce unnecessary hospital and specialty care, as well  as administrative expenses. This empowers the doctor-patient  relationship, enabling providers to resist financial incentives that  distort the decisionmaking process in primary care.   It also reduces the conveyor belt process, where people are typically  shuttled into the office in 8-minute increments. This is not the case  in direct primary care. It is not uncommon for appointments to last  half an hour or even an hour. So they build a better relationship with  patients, and they are able to better understand and address healthcare  needs.   By offering a high level of access to primary care, evidence shows  that direct primary care medical homes improve health outcomes and  reduce costs. Today, DPC medical homes serve individuals of all ages  and income in at least 47 States.   This legislation simplifies existing IRS regulations and clarifies  that direct primary care medical homes are qualified health expenses-- medical services--and not health plans.   I personally question the IRS ruling. We have debated with them, but  we have lost that. We fix it with this legislation.                                time  1600    As more individuals and employers seek to utilize the direct primary  care delivery model, it is important that this outdated tax barrier not  get in the way of patients accessing this successful model.   The legislation will allow HSA plans to cover onsite employee  clinics. Think for a moment about the nursing stations that we have  here in the House of Representatives to provide that service. They can  offer physical exams, immunization, over-the-counter drugs, drug  testing, hearing and vision screening, and other minor primary care  preventive services to help employers assemble a benefits package for  their employees that is both practical and can give them a competitive  edge.   Allowing employees to access this basic healthcare service at work  means it doesn't disrupt the worksite. It is more convenient for them;  it is better for the employer.   Another key consumer change made by this bill is to recognize that  employees change jobs. This bill allows individuals to streamline the  conversion of a medical savings account, flexible savings account, or  HSA so they won't lose savings when they change jobs. These reasonable  changes will help consumers make the most of their employer-sponsored  coverage.   Now--make no mistake--while this legislation will certainly help some  consumers, it doesn't atone for the systematic sabotage that we have  seen of the Affordable Care Act by the administration and some of my  Republican colleagues. By zeroing out the mandate penalty, estimates  are that insurance premiums will rise 15 percent. None of these bills  before us today undo that premium hike that is visited upon our  constituents unnecessarily.   These premium increases are coming after Republicans gave insurance  companies billions in tax cuts in their tax bills. Republican attempts  to expand HSAs is no replacement for the Affordable Care Act's  financial assistance. Attempts to expand HSAs are a continuation of a  platform of shifting families into health plans which provide fewer  health benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs, while providing greater  tax benefits for those who need them least.   HSAs and high-deductible healthcare plans shift costs to consumers  without bending the cost curve or addressing underlying costs of  medical care in the United States. I think we can and should do better.   For instance, the President has promised action on lowering  prescription drug costs. These bills today do nothing to lower the cost  of drugs consumers buy, and seek to move more people into plans that  provide only catastrophic coverage, exposing more people to pay the  full freight of drug price hikes.   Now, we have legislation before our committees that could move  forward to do something about this, and I am saddened, despite Trump's  talking about it, that we have really not taken action to do so. And we  could, on a bipartisan basis, if we were enabled to do so.   The collection of bills on the floor this week will reduce Federal  revenues by about $90 billion and will do nothing to reduce the number  of uninsured people that will increase as a result of policy changes my  Republican friends have done in this Congress. Their sabotage efforts  under the Trump administration have caused millions of people to lose  coverage, and millions more will do so in the future.   Now we are seeing, in the budget proposal, my Republican friends  proposing to cut Medicare and Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion to try and  pay for the deficits that have been exaggerated by tax cuts they have  enacted. The bills that we will be considering, especially the next  one, will only add fuel to that fire.   So, I am pleased that we have got some bipartisan pieces that we can  move forward. I am hopeful that we don't abandon a sense of fiscal  responsibility to be able to work together to pay for them, and I hope  that we can encourage some of my friends on the other side of the aisle  to dial back the assault on the Affordable Care Act, especially by the  administration, so that we don't destabilize the system further, drive  up costs, and increase the number of uninsured.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), a senior member of the Committee on Ways and  Means, author of several of these reform provisions, and a champion of  value over volume in healthcare, as well as fiscal restraint.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin 1  additional minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute just to respond  briefly.   Mr. Speaker, I was here in 2009. The very month President Obama took  office, there were 700,000 jobs lost. There was great fear that we were  going to have a complete collapse of the auto industry. There was a  whole range of things that we were in an emergency situation on, and  the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.   As it was, a major portion of that bill was tax cuts to try and  stimulate the economy. I do point out that as we move forward, our  healthcare bill was entirely paid for, and that is what we need to get  back to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis), a champion of healthcare, dealing with disparities in  the healthcare system, a champion for balance and vision, and I  appreciate him being here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I take modest exception to the notion that somehow the  Affordable Care Act failed. It represents the largest expansion of  healthcare that we have seen in decades. It is so popular and important  that, when my Republican friends attempted to repeal it, something they  have been working on for 7 years, it blew up in their face. Even  President Trump said their bill was mean. And it continues, even though  they are working to dismantle it bolt by bolt.   I would hope that we will return to sanity to be able to work to be  able to move forward on things like some of the elements in this bill  here today that we agree upon that could move us forward rather than  the continued battle over the notion that the Affordable Care Act is  something that needs to be destroyed. The American people deserve  better.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity for us to have this  discussion. It has been fun working with the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Paulsen) on this notion of direct primary care. It is a simple  notion that runs athwart IRS regulations. I still don't fully  understand why these should be classified as ``health plan'' rather  than ``payment for service.''   But, nonetheless, we were able to work together on a bipartisan basis  to move this forward. It is not expensive. The score is less than $2  billion out of $90 billion that we are tossing around here, and I  personally believe that it will result in substantial savings in order  to provide more efficient coverage.   But I must say that I am a little troubled by the continuing assault  on what we are doing with the fiscal future of this country.                                time  1630    We just saw the latest reports that because of what my Republican  friends have done with the budget and with the tax bill, we have  doubled the deficit this year. It is doubled.   Now, there were complaints from my friend from Kansas about deficit  spending when President Obama took office. Remember, he was only  President for one-third of that month and lost 700,000 jobs. The  economy was in free fall. Absolutely we took steps: cutting taxes and  moving in areas to try and strengthen parts of the economy that was  posing huge problems for people across the board. And this was broadly  supported by people in business. Economic experts actually agree that  probably we didn't do enough, and that slowed the economic recovery.  But the economy has recovered.   We have seen 9 consecutive years of private sector job growth. That  is what Trump inherited: over 7 years of job growth. The economy was  strong. It wasn't in free fall. Yet, in that strong position, we are  doubling the deficit this year. We are looking at trillion dollar  deficits as far as the eye can see.   And we just had the President announce that he wants to spend $12  billion more, not because we are in economic free fall, but because his  ruinous trade policies have resulted in losses to the farming sector.  They are going to provide extra government bailout, not because farmers  want it, but because they are being injured by these ruinous trade  policies.   There was a time when most of my Republican friends would rise up in  opposition. It is certain that if these were offered by Bill Clinton or  Barack Obama, they would be screaming at the top of their lungs. Most  of them are strangely silent now, but it is another $12 billion to try  to fix a problem that Trump has created by starting trade wars with our  friends, trying to punish China, and, in fact, we are punishing our  allies. And somehow auto imports are national security.   This is embarrassing that we are in this situation. But it is not  just embarrassing, it is dangerous. We are weakening ourselves  economically, while we pick fights with our allies, like Canada and the  European Union.   Mr. Speaker, on top of all of this, we are going to advance  legislation today that have some nuggets of positive things. I have  worked with my colleagues on some of them. There are important  advances, but they are coming at a price of $90 billion added to the  deficit, without even an attempt to work with us to offset. I think we  could have offset the direct primary care piece that we are talking  about here. It is relatively small potatoes compared to $90 billion,  and compared to $12 billion for tariff relief for a trade war we didn't  need.   Mr. Speaker, I enjoy the conversation about some of these items. I  think it is important to spotlight them. But I am hopeful that we are  able to return to fiscal stability, not having bailouts for farmers  that they don't want and wouldn't need if we had a rational tariff  policy. I am hopeful that we are not going to have a parade of other  things that undermine the Affordable Care Act and add unnecessary costs  to the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
