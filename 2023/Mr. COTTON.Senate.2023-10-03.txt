 Mr. President, today is the 30th anniversary of the  Battle of Mogadishu. At this very moment 30 years ago, nearly 100  Rangers and Delta Force operators were pinned down in the city, caring  for the wounded and fighting off thousands of heavily armed Somali  militiamen. Helicopter crews from the 160th Special Operations Aviation  Regiment--the Night Stalkers--provided aerial fire support.   One of the most intense battles of modern times had been going for 7  hours. It would continue through the night for another 8 hours. In the  end, 18 Americans died and more than 70 were wounded.   This epic battle was immortalized in the classic book ``Black Hawk  Down'' by Mark Bowden and dramatized in the movie of the same name.  What most Americans know about the battle comes from his excellent  reporting. What Bowden made clear is sometimes overlooked: These  warriors accomplished their mission.   The veterans of that battle should hold their heads high with pride,  and the Gold Star families of those 18 fallen warriors in Mogadishu  should know that their husbands, sons, and fathers were, indeed,  heroes--no less than the men who jumped into Normandy or stormed Iwo  Jima.   Unfortunately, their leaders in Washington failed these heroes. No  modern battle better reflects some enduring truths we ought to keep in  mind today. We should only commit our forces when our vital national  security interests are at stake, when the mission is so critical that  it justifies American casualties, if necessary.   Once committed, we should provide our troops with every last thing  they need to fight and win, without tying one hand behind their backs.  And we should be mindful of what dangerous lessons we teach our enemies  when we handcuff our troops or squander their battlefield victories.   Let's go back to how those Rangers, Delta operators, and Night  Stalkers wound up fighting for their lives in the streets of Mogadishu.  In 1992, an estimated 350,000 Somalis had starved to death in a famine  of biblical proportion. The American media highlighted the atrocious  suffering in Somalia, but the famine primarily resulted not from  natural disaster but from rival warlords fighting a brutal civil war.   The warlords stole food-aid shipments to profiteer, feed their own  clans, and starve their enemies. Hunger was just another weapon. After  the election and with the approval of President-elect Clinton,  President Bush decided to intervene. He acted against the counsel of  many of his senior advisers. CIA Director--and, later, Secretary of  Defense--Bob Gates summed  [[Page S4905]]  up their opposition by observing that ``no vital American interest was  at stake.''    Moreover, the humanitarian disaster was caused by the warlords; so  intervening to ensure the safe delivery of food aid merely addressed  the symptoms, not the causes, of the famine. Gates lamented ``the first  U.S. military intervention driven by CNN.''   In his diary, President Bush cited the shocking loss of life from the  famine and the perception that America didn't do enough to help Black  and Muslim nations as justification for intervention--not exactly core  national interests.   What everyone thinks of his decision, though, President Bush wisely  used overwhelming force to pursue strictly defined and limited  objectives. He deployed more than 25,000 troops to Mogadishu but only  to secure the port and distribute food aid to needy Somalis. He refused  the United Nations' proposal to expand the mission to disarming the  Somali warlords. Faced with such overwhelming power, the warlords  backed down and allowed the aid to flow freely into Mogadishu.   Then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell later  reflected that ``within weeks, we were so successful that we had upset  the economics of the marketplace. So much free food came pouring into  Somalia that it became tough to make a living by farming.''   When Bill Clinton took office in January 1993, he inherited a  successful, narrow mission that was drawing down. Unfortunately, he  snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.   He flipped President Bush's approach of overwhelming force with  limited and defined objectives on its head. By March, President Clinton  turned over the primary responsibility to the UN, reduced the American  presence to barely more than 4,000 troops, and expanded the mission to  encompass the grandiose objective of nation-building.   Our UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright proclaimed that ``we will embark  on an unprecedented mission aimed at nothing less than the restoration  of an entire country.'' Gates later called the plan ``a pipe dream''  and ``hopelessly unrealistic.'' Powell scoffed that ``since the  catastrophe had been provoked by feuding 14th-century style warlords,  the solution was a dose of 20th-century style democracy.''   What happened next was all too predictable. The warlords no longer  feared the shrunken American force and renewed their fighting against  each other and the UN peacekeepers. By June, the militia of the most  powerful warlord, Mohamed Farrah Aidid, massacred two dozen Pakistani  peacekeepers. Two months later, Aidid's men killed four Americans and  wounded another four in separate bombings. Faced with American  casualties, the inexperienced President felt compelled to respond, but  he only authorized half measures. He deployed 450 Rangers, Delta Force  operators, and Night Stalkers to capture Aidid and destroy his command  structure. Though these soldiers are among our Nation's very best, the  mission creep was extraordinary.   President Clinton simply asked too much of too small a force.  Mogadishu was a dense city of more than 1 million residents, including  thousands of Aidid's clansmen and fanatical supporters, some of whom  probably received training from al-Qaida operatives on how to shoot  down our helicopters.   Yet the elite forces immediately set themselves to the task of  rolling up Aidid's network.   Their mission on October 3 was straightforward enough for these  seasoned warriors. Intelligence reports placed key Aidid lieutenants in  downtown Mogadishu. Rangers would fast-rope from Black Hawks to the  street at the corners of the target house to establish a security  perimeter. Delta operators would hit the house and detain the targets.   Meanwhile, a convoy of Rangers would stage nearby, ready to transport  our troops and their prisoners back to the nearby American base.  Helicopters would provide covering fire throughout the operation. All  told, the mission was supposed to last only an hour.   But this operation occurred deep in the territory of Aidid's clan,  and the fighting was intense from the moment the helicopters hit the  target house. Aidid's militiamen and angry mobs rushed to the scene and  the streets erupted in gunfire and explosions. The Rangers and Delta  operators fought back ferociously, securing the house and beginning to  set in the defensive perimeter.   Then disaster struck. First, one Black Hawk was shot down, killing  the pilots. A downed helicopter was a contingency for which the task  force had planned, but it still greatly complicated the mission. Now,  rather than returning to base with the prisoners, the Rangers and Delta  operators first had to fight their way to the crash site, secure it,  and recover the dead.   And then another disaster struck. Militiamen shot down a second Black  Hawk, a contingency for which the task force lacked sufficient search- and-rescue assets. Two Delta snipers, Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart,  had been providing covering fire from another helicopter. Observing a  mob rushing toward the downed helicopter, they repeatedly requested  permission to be inserted to protect the crash site.   Once on the ground and with nothing more than small arms, they  heroically fought back the mob until they ran low on ammunition and  were overwhelmed. The injured pilot, Mike Durant, narrowly escaped  death and was, instead, taken prisoner. For their willingness to give  their lives for his in the face of impossible odds, MSG Gary Gordon and  SFC Randy Shughart posthumously received the Medal of Honor--the only  Medals of Honor awarded between Vietnam and Afghanistan, to give you a  sense of the intensity of the battle.   Meanwhile, the Rangers and Delta operators had moved by foot to  secure the first crash site and recover the remains of their fallen  comrades. One pilot was trapped under tons of wreckage, complicating  the recovery mission, but there was never any question that they would  stay until they succeeded. Their creed permitting nothing else: Leave  no man behind.   In any event, they had no way out because the supporting convoy was  decimated in the maze of downtown Mogadishu, a rat's nest of alleys,  flaming roadblocks, and enemy fire. Rendered combat ineffective, the  convoy had to return to base, leaving the dismounted Rangers and Delta  operators isolated at the crash site.   Bloodied and staggered, they hunkered down and prepared for the long  night ahead. With Night Stalkers heroically suppressing the Somalis  from the sky, the Rangers and Delta operators defended their position,  tended their casualties, and continued the efforts to recover the  remains of their fallen comrades. Their commanders cobbled together a  new and more heavily armed convoy from the nearby 10th Mountain  Division and Pakistani and Malay UN peacekeepers.   This convoy reached their position early in the morning of October 4,  as they still struggled to recover the pilot's body.   Even the endgame was frightful for these warriors. Once they finally  recovered the fallen and prepared to escape, nervous and poorly  prepared foreign drivers sped away before all the American troops could  load up, forcing several to run what became known as the ``Mogadishu  mile'' to a different rendezvous point. Miraculously, given all they  had been through, they nonetheless made it out alive.   It is hard to overstate the ferocity of the battle. Jeff Struecker  was a young Ranger who received the Silver Star for his actions.  Struecker had seen combat before Mogadishu and many times after.   Years later, he said of that night:         Nothing came close to Mogadishu. I mean not even close.    I once heard the saying from GEN Scott Miller, a legend with the  Special Operations world and our last four-star commander in  Afghanistan. He was a young Delta captain on the ground. He observed  that ``I've seen a lot of firefights these last twenty years, but  nothing close to Mogadishu.'' I have never spoken to a veteran of  Mogadishu who said anything different.   Against all odds and in spite of all of the horror, these warriors--I  want to stress again--accomplished their mission and returned bloodied  but victorious. They captured their targets, and they brought them out.  Tragedy indeed struck, with 18 troops killed in action and more than 70  wounded. But our troops inflicted far, far more casualties. Even  conservative estimates put enemy deaths over 500 and casualties over  1,000. As one Delta operator  [[Page S4906]]  put it to Bowden, ``they'd just fought one of the most one-sided  battles in American history.''   But the shocking videos of the bodies of American soldiers being  desecrated and an American pilot in captivity overshadowed everything  else. Most Americans had no idea we even had troops in Somalia, much  less that they were engaging in such ferocious battle.   President Clinton had failed to articulate what vital national  interest justified his decision to massively expand the limited mission  he inherited from President Bush. He neither deployed enough troops nor  gave them enough firepower and engagement authorities to complete that  expanded mission.   Now, faced with political controversy, he cut and ran. His decision  left many of our troops in Mogadishu confused and enraged. Many asked:  If the mission was worth 18 American lives, why would they abandon it  now? And if it wasn't, what were they doing there in the first place?  And what about vengeance for the dead and wounded?   President Clinton didn't trouble himself to answer these questions.  He shut down Task Force Ranger. He announced that the American forces  within the broader U.N. peacekeeping mission would come home by March.  He released the prisoners that Task Force Ranger had captured,  including the two targets from the raid on October 3.   President Clinton later wrote that ``I knew how President Kennedy  felt after the Bay of Pigs.'' I suppose so. He knew what it felt like  to bring humiliation and shame to a great and powerful nation--and  grave danger, because, among the unanswered questions was another one:  What kind of lesson would it teach our enemies if America packed up and  left at the first moment of bloodshed? For it wasn't just Americans and  Somalis watching. The rest of the world was also watching.   Among those watching was the obscure leader of a nascent terrorist  network called al-Qaida. Osama bin Laden concluded that America, in his  words, was ``a paper tiger and after a few blows ran in defeat.''   In fact, bin Laden regularly cited President Clinton's frantic  withdrawal from Somalia in his many fatwas, statements, and interviews  about America over the next 8 years.   That dangerous lesson is also an important reminder for us today. We  can control where we commit our forces, which we shouldn't do absent a  compelling national interest. We certainly shouldn't commit them to  quixotic, Wilsonian nation-building projects. But once American power  and prestige is committed, the whole world is watching, especially our  enemies, and, from Somalia to Kabul to Ukraine, they will learn  dangerous lessons when our leaders are timid, irresolute, and weak.   But one lesson our enemies will always take away from the battle of  Mogadishu is never challenge the American soldier on the field of  battle. Against all odds and despite political constraints, our troops  in Mogadishu fought with unparalleled bravery and skill. They brought  back their dead and wounded. They accomplished their mission. They made  their country proud.   On behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank the men who served  and sacrificed so much 30 years ago. God bless them. God bless their  families. May God continue to bless America with warriors just like  them.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.
