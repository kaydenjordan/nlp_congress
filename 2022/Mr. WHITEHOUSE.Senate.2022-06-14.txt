 Madam President, reserving the right to object.    I have been listening with interest to my two  distinguished colleagues discuss this measure, referring to it  repeatedly as ``governing American energy.'' But, of course, what it  really governs is fossil fuel energy. That is the intention here, and  that is the result.   Let's start with a basic factual proposition, which is that the price  of oil is set by oil companies.   In a market economy, the producer of a product chooses the price. And  what has happened in this instance is that the oil industry has chosen  to depart from market economics, to depart from the costs that were the  same just a few years ago, and instead to follow upward the  international cartel that our oil industry is a part of.   This international cartel has driven world oil prices extremely high.  And American oil companies have chosen--have chosen--to follow that  price, raise the prices at the pump, punish American drivers, in order  to blow out their profits.   We know that this is true because the companies themselves are  reporting unprecedented profits--massive profits. We know they are not  tracking the cost of production at a reasonable profit because their  profits have soared as they have chosen--chosen--to pursue this  international cartel price and punish American drivers. It is their  choice.   And then they have the colossal nerve to take their choice, what they  have done to American drivers, and then start using that for leverage  to try to get other fossil fuel industry prerogatives accomplished  politically.   And let me say, don't be mad at the gas station owner. The gas  station owner is not the one who is jacking up the prices. For a lot of  gas station owners, they don't even make money on the gas. You have got  to go in and buy a coffee or snacks to have them make money.   Your local gas station is not the problem with these prices. The  problem is Chevron, Exxon, Marathon, all of the big oil companies that  have chosen to drive gas prices through the roof so they can fill their  pockets with profit, so they can prepare for the fact that their  product has got an end point.   We can't keep polluting the Earth the way we are with the emissions  of fossil fuel. I noticed that neither of my colleagues mentioned that  this fossil fuel actually gets burned. We don't eat it; we burn it. And  when we burn it, it emits CO2 and other gases, and we are  seeing the effect of that all over the planet.   Pollution increases. CO2 levels continue to increase. We  constantly set new records for CO2 levels in the atmosphere.  Heat increases. We are heating the ocean so fast--there is a new term  that we have, a new term of measurement, a ``zettajoule.'' Do you know  what a zettajoule is? A joule is a unit of heat energy measurement. A  zettajoule is that unit with 21 zeros after it. It is an enormous  number. All of the fossil fuel burned by all of the people across this  entire planet amounts to less than half of a zettajoule of energy--all  of it, less than half.   And for the price of that--because of the emissions, because of the  pollution, because of the CO2, because of the methane--we  are heating up the planet so fast that every year 14 zettajoules of  excess heat go into the ocean, where my fishermen in Rhode Island see  their catches disappear, see their lives turned upside down, see  fisheries that their fathers and their grandfathers fished completely  upturned.   This comes home in Rhode Island. Our Coastal Resources Management  Council predicts that all that ocean warming is going to raise sea  levels so that in my lifetime we are going to start to see flooding.  Things that are now part of our State are going to become islands.  Warwick Neck becomes Warwick Neck Island. Bristol becomes Bristol  Island. Poppasquash Point becomes Poppasquash Island. Newport divides  into a mainland and an island.   We become the Rhode Island archipelago. We lose enormous amounts of  our shoreline to sea level rise. Never mention--never mention that  harm. So when you come here and say, we want to help more fossil fuel  get burned, remember that on the other end of that are places like  Rhode Island.   And if we want to have a conversation about how we solve price now  and how we protect against emissions later, that is a conversation I am  more than willing to have. But a one-sided conversation that is  only about more burning, more pollution, more emissions, more of that  for Rhode Island, I don't think so.    And it is not, of course, just Rhode Island. Other States are having  unprecedented wildfires. They are having unprecedented droughts. We are  seeing a planet whose basic operating systems are being changed by  fossil fuel emissions. And until we grapple with that seriously, you  can bet I will object--which I do.    Madam President, I would actually ask, in response,  that we pass a different measure, and I would ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be  discharged from further consideration of S. 4217, and the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    My colleague may care to object.    Or at least to the motion I propounded anyway.    Senator Whitehouse, of course, as well, but I think  the intention was to object to the measure.   I see that my friend Senator Barrasso has joined us. I had mentioned  zettajoules. I want to add one other figure. This is from a report by  the corporate accounting and consulting firm, Deloitte Consulting,  which has said that if we don't get ahead of this climate problem that  my colleague seems so scrupulously interested in ignoring, the cost to  society in the next five decades will be, if I remember correctly--the  number is $178 trillion in economic harm across those years.   You want to talk about big numbers? And if we do get it right, if we  grow up, treat this as a factual scientific problem and put in serious,  real economic solutions, then the win side is $43 trillion.   So the swing is $220 trillion. You want to talk about big numbers?  That is a big number. And it is going to depend on decisions we make  now, and I hope we start making good decisions.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here for the 15th time in my  series of ``Scheme'' speeches to call attention to the rightwing  donors' long-planned scheme to capture and control our Supreme Court.   What I will talk about today is that scheme's donor-funded doctrine  factory and a case in which the ``Court that dark money built'' could  weaponize dangerous, concocted doctrines to power up polluters and  threaten the basic function of government.   Before I get into this, let me say that I detest and condemn violence  or threatened violence against members of the Court, and I object even  to protesters making a racket in Justices' neighborhoods. There is a  lot to be angry about, but the solution is through democracy and laws,  not violence and noise. The capture of the Court by secret and special  interests is deadly serious under our laws, and we have to respond  seriously under our laws. Neighborhood noise and violent threats don't  help.   Let's remember that all three Trump Supreme Court Justices were  actually chosen and then campaigned for by a dark money donor  apparatus. Remember, the whole point of the scheme is to capture the  Court so it will deliver big wins for the big rightwing donors, no  matter how unpopular or radical those wins are. Remember that the donor  elite behind the scheme spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an  apparatus to capture the courts. It plotted for decades to seize this  power and set up a system to get its hand-picked, extremist nominees  onto the Bench. It instructs those Justices with coordinated flotillas  of amicus briefs so the Justices know how they are supposed to rule. It  is quite an operation.   But none of that works--none of that works if judges are following  the law as it is. Existing legal precedents are a problem for the  scheme. So, to accomplish its mission, a radical deconstruction of our  American laws, the big donor elite need to destroy decades of legal  precedent.   We got a preview in the looming effort, shown by the Alito leaked  draft opinion, to destroy precedent protecting women's right to decide  about abortion and relocate that right from women to State  legislatures. That is just the scheme's opening act, a sop to one  segment of its social issues base. The scheme is out to deconstruct  American law and destroy established precedent across many areas of the  law.   Now, if you are out to deconstruct American law and replace it with  what the big donors want, you need some intellectual weaponry. You  don't just need Justices who will do what you ask, you need legal  theories. You need to give the Justices you put on the Court the  intellectual artillery--the demolition theories--that will help them  destroy the precedents and deconstruct our legal system.   So that is a problem.   But when you are spending more than half a billion dollars on such a  scheme, you can find solutions. And sure enough, rightwing donor  interests found solutions. It took time, but the whole scheme took  time. It took a lot of money, but the whole scheme took a lot of money.  It took patience and planning, but what a payoff when you succeed.   And now it is payday.   The first thing you do is erect an array of legal think tanks, phony  institutes, the hothouses in which the deconstruction theories are  grown; the factories, if you will, where doctrines are crafted,  reverse-engineered from the results the big donors want so that  willing, complicit Justices have the ideological weaponry for  deconstruction of the law.   These think tanks do a couple of things. First, they nurture  rightwing legal scholars to formulate bogus legal doctrines. They pay  them comfortable salaries. They grant them nice titles. They cover  their trips to conferences and symposia with fellow hothouse scholars.  The whole thing apes regular academia, but this academia-resembling  performance has a very different mission: It has deliverables.   Second, they systematically cheerlead for their new legal doctrines.  They create an echo chamber of approval for their cultivated fringe  ideas. Once the hothouse conjures a fringe idea, the hothouse bounces  it among other so-called scholars and through other anonymously funded  affiliate groups and through law school debate clubs and conservative  conferences--also funded by secretive donors--and into flotillas of  scripted amicus curiae briefs and ultimately, the prize, into legal  opinions. They create a legitimization process, and of course they  concoct or retool the desirable theories.   The legal theories are actually pretty easy to come up with. You  reverse-engineer. You start with what big donor interests want and then  work backward. And what lots of big donors want--especially fossil  fuel companies--is to weaken and disable government regulation.    Government regulators stop all sorts of harmful corporate practices:  pollution of our air, water, and climate; dangerous factory floor  working conditions; crooked schemes that cheat investors; snake oil  medications that don't cure disease; unsafe products; insurance  policies that don't pay. The list is long. Demolishing that protective  network of regulations protecting America's health, safety, and  financial well-being is a scheme priority, and the destruction begins  by pejoratively naming the Agencies whose work protects us the  ``administrative state.''   There are many of these doctrine-growing hothouses. Two examples are  the Cato Institute, originally founded by the Koch brothers, and the C.  Boyden Gray Center for the Study of the Administrative State at George  Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, of course. Both of these  groups are funded to pump out and legitimize anti-regulatory fringe  theories and talking points.   Think of them as factories for ideological artillery designed for the  demolition of Federal Agencies' authority, particularly over polluters.   What do they manufacture? Well, the concocted doctrines fall into a  few buckets. There is the so-called unitary executive theory, cooked up  to argue  [[Page S2934]]  that safeguards set in place by Congress to protect Federal Agencies  against political interference are unconstitutional.   Now, if you are a big donor and you paid big bucks to get your man in  the White House, you want political interference by your guy in  regulatory decisions.   Congress built safeguards against that for a very good reason. But a  captured Court could disable Congress's ability to defend the Agencies  that Congress itself created. This unitary executive legal theory was  the pet theory of the Reagan administration. It was thoroughly debunked  by serious scholars and rejected initially even by the Supreme Court.  But the rightwing Court-capture apparatus has persistently kept this  theory a Federalist Society cornerstone and diligently packed the Court  with new Justices more amenable to this nonsense.   Other concocted doctrines also target Agencies. The so-called  nondelegation doctrine is so radical and meritless that the Supreme  Court dismissed it a century ago, except for rare cases that no longer  exist where Congress might give Agencies power with no direction  whatsoever.   This nondelegation idea has been retooled in the doctrine factories  to target Agency regulation generally. Under this doctrine as retooled,  the power is removed from Congress and given to unelected courts to  decide how questions should be assigned by Congress to Federal  Agencies. This gives big, regulated industries a big weapon to attack  the Federal Government's ability to regulate problems that they cause,  at a minimum allowing industries to tie public protection regulations  up in years, even decades, of litigation.   Federalist Society Justices on the Court long clamored for the  nondelegation doctrine, and as new Federalist Society Justices get  added to the Court, it becomes more probable. Certainly the dark money  front groups that provide instruction and encouragement to the  Federalist Society Justices--they are in full clamor, using amicus  curiae briefs to signal their wishes to the captured Court.   On now to yet another hothouse-grown doctrine, the major questions  doctrine, which provides a similar weapons platform to assault public  safety regulations. Where the nondelegation doctrine would require  Congress to set more specific regulatory standards for Agencies to  police, the major questions doctrine would let the unelected Court  determine that some questions are just too big to regulate--too big to  regulate at all.   Again, at a minimum, that lets big industries snarl Agency  protections up in litigation. At worst, it forces Congress into  detailed, complex questions that Congress already determined--already  determined--should better be handled by expert Agencies.   Perhaps I should mention here how hard the Federalist Society  Justices have worked to create avenues of corporate political  influence, including anonymous, unlimited, corporate political  spending, allowing corporate interests to blockade action in Congress;  but while it is relevant here, that is a longer story for another day.   All of these concocted doctrines share the premise that Congress may  not deploy Agency regulation against certain problems and that the  power to grant Agencies authority to regulate in certain areas is,  instead, to be decided by unelected courts--in present circumstances,  decided by a captured Supreme Court with Members installed by big  special interest money.   What could possibly go wrong?   All of these concocted doctrines overlook the robust oversight of  Federal Agencies by the people's Representatives in Congress and by  courts, tasked by Congress, with applying the Administrative Procedure  Act. If an Agency were to go rogue, Congress can immediately intervene.  Congress can reverse the decision of the Agency. Congress can change  the underlying law the Agency enforces. Congress can redirect, defund,  or even eliminate the errant Agency. Moreover, if Agencies don't follow  the law as Congress directed or if the Agencies behave illogically or  unfairly or don't give evidence proper consideration, there are avenues  of legal relief in court.   But the donors behind the scheme don't want relief from improper or  misguided Agency action. They want relief from lawful, legitimate, and  correct Agency action. This is a power grab by regulated interests  using the Court, and they can do it because of the scheme. It is not a  bug that these doctrines threaten harm to an array of basic government  functions; it is their purpose.   Let's go back to what the rightwing, corporate-funded propaganda  machine likes to deride as the ``administrative state''--their little  code word. What has really gone on in these Agencies? I will tell you  what has gone on.   Over nonstop quarreling by big special interests, regulatory Agencies  made life better. They made drinking water safer. They cleaned up  smokestacks. They put airbags in cars and required better seatbelts.  They protected us from contaminated food. They made medication safer  and more effective--no more snake oil mysteries. They made financial  markets safer places for retirement funds and college savings plans to  grow. They made it harder for stockjobbers to sucker innocent  investors. They required insurance policies to actually pay when an  insured risk occurs. They put an end to people dying from disasters  like boiler explosions that used to be a regular thing. Americans live  longer; highways are no longer carnage; products are safer; markets are  stronger; and the American economy is more robust. So, whenever you  hear the phrase ``administrative state,'' it should ring in your head a  little alarm bell that special interest mischief is afoot, which brings  me to the ruling expected from the Supreme Court in a case called West  Virginia v. EPA.   The fossil fuel interests behind the case are challenging the Federal  Government's power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing  coal-fired power plants. Put simply, they want to make it harder to  fight climate change. I can't think of a more important protection for  the American people than a livable planet, and I can't think of a  Member of Congress who has done more work to achieve those protections  than the Presiding Officer, but the fossil fuel industry is desperate  to continue to pollute for free.   The first thing to know about this case is that there is no case. The  Constitution requires ``a case or controversy''--that is the language  in the Constitution: ``a case or controversy'' before the Court can  intervene--and, here, there is no case because there is no Agency rule  to challenge. The Trump administration's rule, which was a sop to  polluters, was thrown out--gone. The Obama-era rule is not being  pursued--gone. Biden's EPA has announced that it is formulating a new,  different rule that it has not yet produced. It is not out. There is no  rule in place right now.   That does not seem to bother the scheme's new donor-selected  majority. A few Republican States, bolstered and probably directed by  an armada of rightwing, dark-money front groups, sued to challenge the  EPA's authority, and the captured Court jumped right in.   Think about that for a moment.   With no actual rule to review, the Court is, apparently, going to  decide this case based on what the Biden administration might do or  issue some general observations about the EPA. Where I come from, there  is a name for that. It is called an advisory opinion, and our Supreme  Court is forbidden to do that under our Constitution.    This is actually a big deal at the heart of the separation of powers,  but the Federalist Society Justices, packed onto the Court with fossil  fuel dark money, are on a mission to deconstruct the administrative  state. So why let the Constitution get in the way? Just throw out more  precedent about case or controversy. What is one more smashed precedent  in the captured Court's cascade of precedent demolition? The donors  don't care. They are not finicky. They want results.   Fossil fuel is the political 800-pound gorilla in this country. The  industry spent decades blocking climate action in Congress. It lurked  behind this web of climate denial front groups that sowed false doubt  about climate science. It was their job to mischaracterize the science.  It is behind what watchdog group Influence Map calls the biggest  climate-obstructing trade organization in Washington--the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce. Boom.  [[Page S2935]]  It maintains its own trade group hitmen, like the American Petroleum  Institute. It funnels secret money by the tens of millions into  Republican super-PACs and other secret, partisan political spending  fronts in a not-so-hostile takeover of the Republican Party, and it  wrote some of the biggest checks to pay for the scheme, funneled  through dark-money conduits like DonorsTrust and the Judicial Crisis  Network.   When I say we now have the Court that dark money built, it is  probably more accurate to say that we now have the Court that dark  fossil fuel money built. So watch out for the six-Justice supermajority  that is poised to rule in this no case ``case.''   It is no surprise that the amici--the amicus curiae, the so-called  friends of the Court--gathered in this case read like a who's who of  fossil fuel polluter front groups. The Competitive Enterprise  Institute, for instance, produces hothouse attacks on the EPA's  authority, and is funded by ExxonMobil, Murray Energy, the American  Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute,  and the Koch brothers' political groups. Fossil fuel front groups, as  amici and litigants, sing a harmonious chorus of ``unitary executive''  and ``nondelegation'' and ``major question''--all concocted doctrines  targeting the administrative state they so resent.   Back before the takeover, here is what the Court said in a case  called Mistretta.   The Court said this:         In our increasingly complex society, replete with ever       changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot       do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad       general directives.    That is the language of the Court:         In our increasingly complex society, replete with ever       changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot       do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad       general directives.    That is the precedent of the Court. That is the law of the land, and  it is the law that special interests sent these Justices to the Court  to deconstruct. So get ready.   To be continued.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
