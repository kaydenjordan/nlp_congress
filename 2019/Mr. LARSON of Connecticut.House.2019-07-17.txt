 Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague on  the Ways and Means Committee,   Mike Kelly, for his hard work and  diligence in bringing this bill to the floor, as he acknowledged, in a  bipartisan way.   I think the gentleman and everybody in this body understand and  respect the persistence, hard work, and dedication of   Joe Courtney.  From its introduction and inception, from its first letter to its more  than 370 sponsors, ultimately, he has demonstrated that, yes, in this  body, we can arrive at solutions across the aisle, working together in  the common interest of every American citizen.     Joe Courtney was chairman of the Public Health Committee in the  Connecticut Legislature. He has forgotten more about these programs  than most people will ever remember. But it is his diligence,  persistence, and ability to work across the aisle that has brought this  legislation here today to be passed unanimously.
