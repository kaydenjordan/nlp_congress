 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness  that I rise today to recognize the departure of a long-term servant of  the House, Brandon Renz.   Brandon has served the House of Representatives for nearly two  decades and has been a trusted leader of my staff for well over a  decade. Most recently, he has worked with me and fellow Members on the  Education and Labor Committee as Republican staff director and has  provided trustworthy counsel and excellent organizational prowess.   He also served as my chief of staff during my time in leadership as  House Republican Secretary and was a respected liaison for me and other  Members, staff, and House offices over my eventful time in that office.   While Brandon has been a tremendous asset and key contributor in all  those significant positions, he did some of his best work in the same  trenches that many of our staff do, in positions and in rooms that do  not receive attention from C-SPAN or grab headlines.   Brandon started as a staff assistant for a Member from his home State  of Iowa, Representative   Steve King, reluctantly coming to Washington  on the recommendation of a friend and only after committing to himself  that he would stay only 1 year.   In less than 3 years on Capitol Hill, Brandon earned a reputation as  an astute legislative mind with bedrock conservative principles and  became my legislative director. In him, I found a partner who shared my  commitment to accurate, grammatically correct documents of all types.   He labored with me on constituent letters and on many important  legislative projects, including providing the Puerto Rican people with  an opportunity to express all their preferences when considering their  territory's future, developing legislation to lessen unfunded mandates,  and expressing Congress' disapproval of the bailout funds expended on  the TARP program.   He also worked as a rules associate with the House Rules Committee,  sitting through interminable hearings at all hours of the day and  night. He did important work there, ensuring Members' voices were heard  and that the House could work its will on legislation considered on the  House floor.   After several years guiding my legislative staff and agenda, he  accepted my request to serve as chief of staff and used his terrific  skills to benefit constituents and ensure my offices paid back the  trust given to them by America's taxpayers.  [[Page H1051]]                                     time  1015    After seeing his success there, it was easy to entrust the  responsibilities of staff director to him when I became the chairwoman  of the House Education and Workforce Committee.   Both then and now in the minority, Brandon has been a leader on the  issues before the committee, including education and regulatory reform,  government accountability, and this week on the issue of surprise  medical billing.   It has been a joy to work with and learn from Brandon as a colleague  and as an individual. While his parents clearly reared him right, his  wise, beautiful wife, Kate, has been a key part of his recent life. She  was, herself, a fine staff member in both the U.S. House and Senate and  is here today. It is comforting to know they are passing on their  principles to their sons, Cole and Hunter. Brandon and Kate are an  example to us all.   As Brandon leaves the service of the House to embark on new  responsibilities in the private sector, I thank him deeply for his  years of dedication to the work of the House, to me and my  constituents, and to our Nation.   He truly has lived up to the oath he swore when he first started with  the U.S. House of Representatives, to ``support and defend the  Constitution of the United States,'' and to ``well and faithfully  discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.''   Mr. Speaker, I know he will continue to faithfully discharge the  duties of his future offices, as he did so honorably for me. So, sadly,  I discharge him to that work, so help him God.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, the Boy  Scouts of America celebrated its 110th anniversary. With over 2 million  active participants, it is one of the largest youth organizations in  the country.   Since its founding in 1910, the Boy Scouts of America has shaped the  lives of young men by teaching them character development, self- reliance, and principles of responsible citizenship.   In my district, the Old Hickory Council of the Boy Scouts of America,  originally a single troop organized in Winston-Salem, serves over eight  counties and has almost 5,000 members. In 2018, they provided more than  17,600 service hours at local charities and organizations.   I congratulate the Boy Scouts of America on 110 years of service, and  I am confident that they will continue to positively impact communities  across our country for many years to come.                            ____________________
