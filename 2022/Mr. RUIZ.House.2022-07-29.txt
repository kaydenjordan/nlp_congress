 Madam Chair, I rise today with my daughters in strong  support of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act.  This legislation includes my bill, the Salton Sea Projects Improvements  Act, which will take strong action to address the crisis at the Salton  Sea.   In our region, drought and reduced water flows into the Salton Sea  have led to deteriorating water quality and toxic dust that threatens  local communities' health.   My bill will authorize $250 million the Bureau of Reclamation can  spend on the Salton Sea and expand the types of transformative projects  at the sea. This will ultimately strengthen our all-hands-on-deck  approach to this environmental and public health crisis by expanding  the bureau's ability to work with State, local, and Tribal partners in  the area.   I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this drought and wildfire bill,  and I urge the Senate to do the same.
