TITLE I--FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS       SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) According to a February 2016 report by the Department       of Commerce's International Trade Administration, 12 million       United States workers, equivalent to 8.5 percent of the labor       force, have jobs resulting from foreign investment, including       3.5 million jobs in the manufacturing sector alone.        (2) In 2016, new foreign direct investment in U.S.       manufacturing totaled $129.4 billion.        (3) The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic       Analysis concluded that in 2015, foreign-owned affiliates in       the United States--        (A) Contributed $894.5 billion in value added to the U.S.       economy;        (B) exported goods valued at $352.8 billion, accounting for       nearly a quarter of total U.S. goods exports;        (C) undertook $56.7 billion in research and development;       and        (D) the seven largest investing countries, all of which are       United States allies - the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany,       France, Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands - accounted       for 72.1 percent of U.S. affiliate value added and over 80       percent of affiliates' R&D expenditures.        (4) According to the Government Accountability Office       (GAO), from 2011 to 2016, the number of transactions reviewed       by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States       (CFIUS) grew by 55 percent, while agency staff assigned to       the reviews increased by 11 percent.        (5) According to a February 2018 report (GAO-18-249), GAO       noted: ``Officials from Treasury and other member agencies       are aware of pressures on their CFIUS staff given the current       workload and have expressed concerns about possible workload       increases.''. GAO concluded: ``Without attaining an       understanding of the staffing levels needed to address the       current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if       legislative changes to CFIUS's authorities further expand its       workload, CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its       objectives and address threats to the national security of       the United States.''.        (6) On March 30, 1954, Dwight David Eisenhower - five-star       general, Supreme Allied Commander, and 34th President of the       United States - in his ``Special Message to the Congress on       Foreign Economic Policy'', counseled: ``Great mutual       advantages to buyer and seller, to producer and consumer, to       investor and to the community where investment is made,       accrue from high levels of trade and investment.''. He       continued: ``The internal strength of the American economy       has evolved from such a system of mutual advantage. In the       press of other problems and in the haste to meet emergencies,       this nation - and many other nations of the free world - have       all too often lost sight of this central fact.''. President       Eisenhower concluded: ``If we fail in our trade policy, we       may fail in all. Our domestic employment, our standard of       living, our security, and the solidarity of the free world -       all are involved.''.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) foreign investment provides substantial benefits to the       United States, including the promotion of economic growth,       productivity, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation,       thereby enhancing U.S. national security;        (2) maintaining the commitment of the United States to an       open investment policy encourages other countries to act       similarly and helps expand foreign markets for U.S.       businesses;        (3) at the same time, national security risks related to       foreign investment, particularly those emanating from       countries such as China and Russia, warrant an appropriate       modernization of the processes and authorities of the       Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States;        (4) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United       States, as a complement to domestic and multilateral export       control regimes, plays a critical role in protecting the       national security of the United States;        (5) in order to maintain the Committee's effectiveness and       guard against mission creep, CFIUS should remain narrowly       focused on confronting risks related to national security;        (6) it is essential that the member agencies of the       Committee are adequately resourced and able to hire       appropriately qualified individuals in a timely manner so       that CFIUS may promptly complete transaction reviews,       identify and respond to evolving national security risks, and       enforce mitigation agreements effectively;        (7) the President should carry out international outreach       to promote the benefits of foreign investment for global       economic growth, while also assisting United States partners       to address national security risks; and        (8) it is the policy of the United States to       enthusiastically welcome and support foreign investment,       consistent with national security considerations.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.         The following is the policy of the United States:        (1) To use export controls only after full consideration of       the impact on the economy of the United States and only to       the extent necessary--        (A) to restrict the exports of items which would make a       significant contribution to the military potential of any       other country or combination of countries which would prove       detrimental to the national security of the United States;       and        (B) to restrict the export of items if necessary to further       significantly the foreign policy of the United States or to       fulfill its declared international obligations.        (2) The national security and foreign policy of the United       States require that the export, reexport, and transfer of       items, and specific activities of United States persons,       wherever located, be controlled for the following purposes:        (A) To control the release of items for use in--        (i) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or of       conventional weapons;        (ii) the acquisition of destabilizing numbers or types of       conventional weapons;        (iii) acts of terrorism;        (iv) military programs that could pose a threat to the       security of the United States or its allies; or        (v) activities undertaken specifically to cause significant       interference with or disruption of critical infrastructure.        (B) To preserve the qualitative military superiority of the       United States.        (C) To strengthen the United States industrial base.        (D) To carry out the foreign policy of the United States,       including the protection of human rights and the promotion of       democracy.        (E) To carry out obligations and commitments under       international agreements and arrangements, including       multilateral export control regimes.        (F) To facilitate military interoperability between the       United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization       (NATO) and other close allies.        (G) To ensure national security controls are tailored to       focus on those core technologies and other items that are       capable of being used to pose a serious national security       threat to the United States.        (3) The national security of the United States requires       that the United States maintain its leadership in the       science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing sectors,       including foundational technology that is essential to       innovation. Such leadership requires that United States       persons are competitive in global markets. The impact of the       implementation of this subtitle on such leadership and       competitiveness must be evaluated on an ongoing basis and       applied in imposing controls under sections 813 and 814 to       avoid negatively affecting such leadership.        (4) The national security and foreign policy of the United       States require that the United States participate in       multilateral organizations and agreements regarding export       controls on items that are consistent with the policy of the       United States, and take all the necessary steps to secure the       adoption and consistent enforcement, by the governments of       such countries, of export controls on items that are       consistent with such policy.        (5) Export controls should be coordinated with the       multilateral export control regimes. Export controls that are       multilateral are most effective, and should be tailored to       focus on those core technologies and other items that are       capable of being used to pose a serious national security       threat to the United States and its allies.        (6) Export controls applied unilaterally to items widely       available from foreign sources generally are less effective       in preventing end-users from acquiring those items.       Application of unilateral export controls should be limited       for purposes of protecting specific United States national       security and foreign policy interests.        (7) The effective administration of export controls       requires a clear understanding both inside and outside the       United States Government of which items are controlled and an       efficient process should be created to update the controls,       such as by adding or removing such items.        (8) The export control system must ensure that it is       transparent, predictable, and timely, has the flexibility to       be adapted to address new threats in the future, and allows       seamless access to and sharing of export control information       among all relevant United States national security and       foreign policy agencies.        (9) Implementation and enforcement of United States export       controls require robust capabilities in monitoring,       intelligence, and investigation, appropriate penalties for       violations, and the ability to swiftly interdict unapproved       transfers.        (10) Export controls complement and are a critical element       of the national security policies underlying the laws and       regulations governing foreign direct investment in the United       States, including controlling the transfer of critical       technologies to certain foreign persons. Thus, the President,       in coordination with the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense,       the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the       heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, should have       a regular and robust process to identify the emerging and       other types of critical technologies of concern and regulate       their release to foreign persons as warranted regardless of       the nature of the underlying transaction. Such identification       efforts should draw upon the resources and expertise of all       relevant parts of the United States Government, industry, and       academia. These efforts should be in addition to traditional       efforts to modernize and update the lists of controlled items       under the multilateral export control regimes.        (11) The authority under this subtitle may be exercised       only in furtherance of all of the objectives set forth in       paragraphs (1) through (10).       SEC. 813.

(c) Application of Controls.--The President shall impose       controls over the export, reexport, or transfer of items for       purposes of the objectives described in subsections (b)(1) or       (b)(2) without regard to the nature of the underlying       transaction or any circumstances pertaining to the activity,       including whether such export, reexport, or transfer occurs       pursuant to a purchase order or other contract requirement,       voluntary decision, inter-company arrangement, marketing       effort, or during a joint venture, joint development       agreement, or similar collaborative agreement.

The absence of any such notification does not excuse the       United States person from compliance with the license       requirements of subsection (d), or any regulation or order       issued under this subtitle.        (f) License Review Standards.--The Secretary shall deny an       application to engage in any activity described in subsection       (d) if the activity would make a material contribution to any       of the items described in subsection (d)(2).

The President may       delay imposition of the sanction for an additional period of       up to 90 days if the President determines and certifies to       the Congress that the government is in the process of taking       the actions described in the preceding sentence.

(2) Exceptions.--The President shall not be required to       apply or maintain a sanction under this section--        (A) in the case of procurement of defense articles or       defense services--        (i) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the       exercise of options for production quantities to satisfy       United States operational military requirements;        (ii) if the President determines that the person or other       entity to which the sanctions would otherwise be applied is a       sole source supplier of the defense articles or defense       services, that the defense articles or defense services are       essential, and that alternative sources are not readily or       reasonably available; or        (iii) if the President determines that such articles or       services are essential to the national security under defense       coproduction agreements;        (B) to products or services provided under contracts       entered into before the date on which the President publishes       his intention to impose sanctions;        (C) to--        (i) spare parts;        (ii) component parts, but not finished products, essential       to United States products or production; or        (iii) routine servicing and maintenance of products, to the       extent that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably       available;        (D) to information and technology essential to United       States products or production; or        (E) to medical or other humanitarian items.        (d) Termination of Sanctions.--A sanction imposed pursuant       to this section shall apply for a period of at least 12       months following the imposition of one sanction and shall       cease to apply thereafter only if the President determines       and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees       that reliable information indicates that the foreign person       with respect to which the determination was made under       subsection (a)(1) has ceased to aid or abet any foreign       government, project, or entity in its efforts to acquire       chemical or biological weapons capability as described in       that subsection.        (e) Waiver.--        (1) Criterion for waiver.--The President may waive the       application of any sanction imposed on any person pursuant to       this section if the President determines and certifies to the       appropriate congressional committees that such waiver is       important to the national security interests of the United       States.        (2) Notification of and report to congress.--If the       President decides to exercise the waiver authority provided       in paragraph (1), the President shall so notify the       appropriate congressional committees not less than 20 days       before the waiver takes effect.

(a) In General.--The President shall appoint, by and with       the advice and consent of the Senate, an Under Secretary of       Commerce for Industry and Security who shall carry out all       the functions of the Secretary under this title and such       other provisions of law that relate to the implementation of       the dual-use export system.        (b) Assistant Secretaries of Commerce.--The President shall       appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,       two Assistant Secretaries of Commerce to assist the Under       Secretary in carrying out the functions described in       paragraph (1).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr Hensarling), chairman of the Financial  Services Committee,  [[Page H5691]]  and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, over the past decade, we have seen rapid technological  advances. We have seen an increase in foreign investment in the United  States, but we have seen it especially from countries like China and  Russia that pose national security concerns to us.   Of great alarm, our regulatory system has not kept pace. Mr.  Pittenger's bill before us today seeks to change that.   The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018  represents a broad bipartisan agreement to reform our regulatory  systems to protect both our national security and to protect our  economic prosperity. Specifically, this bill strengthens national  security reviews of certain commercial transactions conducted by CFIUS,  as well as reforms and modernizations in order to bring up to date  outdated U.S. export control systems.                                time  1345    That regime is reformed here.   I want to thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr.  Hensarling, for his leadership on this issue.   The Committees on Armed Services, on Intelligence, Energy and  Commerce, Budget, and Oversight and Government Reform also played  important roles in shaping this legislation. This has been a truly  collaborative process.   Mr. Speaker, this body has not addressed exports of dual-use items-- products and services that have both commercial and military  application--since the Export Administration Act of 1979.   Since that lapse, nearly 25 years ago, successive administrations  have relied on emergency authorities that have not kept pace with  technological advances.   Today, we are acting to fix that problematic lapse because the United  States' position as the world's largest exporter of goods and services  is at risk. We will lose many good-paying jobs if we don't better  secure advanced technology and if we don't better secure intellectual  property.   That is why, this spring, the Foreign Affairs Committee passed the  Export Control Reform Act of 2018. We passed this legislation. And  under this approach, reflected in title VIII of the bill before us,  modernized U.S. export control laws and regulations will continue to  have broad authority governing the transfer of dual-use items and  technology to foreign persons, whether that transfer takes place abroad  or if that transfer takes place here in the United States.   Let me just highlight a few critical features of the export control  provisions of the legislation.   This title of the bill requires that export controls be calibrated  and continually updated to ensure lasting U.S. leadership in these  fields: science, technology, engineering, manufacturing, and other  sectors critical to the industrial base.   It ensures that sensitive manufacturing know-how, which may include  such items as written or oral communications, blueprints, engineering  designs, specifications, are subject to appropriate export controls  regardless of the nature of the underlying transaction.   And lastly, it establishes a new authority for the U.S. export  control agencies and the Department of Defense to identify and  appropriately control emerging and foundational technologies that may  be critical to U.S. national security.   This includes artificial intelligence, robotics, augmented and  virtual reality, new biotechnologies, new financial technologies, and  advanced materials.   Ten years ago, Mr. Sherman and I held a series of hearings to examine  China's increasingly aggressive policies in the wake of the EAA'S  expiration. I appreciate his passion for these issues and his  understanding of the need to balance our economic and national security  interests.   We do need a nimble, adaptable system that protects but doesn't  unduly burden our world-class industries.   Modernized U.S. export controls and CFIUS reforms are both critical  to the challenges posed by China and by Russia and by others.   This bill will help keep America safe, help keep us strong.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 5841, the Foreign Investment       Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas, and I ask unanimous consent that he may control  that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank several of my  colleagues, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.  Engel, as well as, of course, Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member  Waters, and Mr. Pittenger.   I want to thank them for incorporating as title VIII the text that I  authored as H.R. 5040, this is the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.  This is the measure we put out of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   This title modernizes and reforms outdated export controls designed  to impose trade controls on the old Soviet bloc. It was long past due  that we update these controls to reflect the realities of modern  international commerce and the national security threats of the century  we are in right now.   I would urge my colleagues to join us in modernizing both the CFIUS  and export controls process which we do now in this combined bill. A  ``yes'' vote will ensure continued U.S. leadership in high technology  industries essential to the health of our economy and essential to our  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
