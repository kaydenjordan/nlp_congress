 Mr. Speaker, Americans are suffering. They are  suffering in the face of an unseen enemy, a natural disaster that we  can only defeat together.   I have spent hours on the phone with Ohioans, national leaders,  doctors, researchers, elected officials, and business and community  leaders, listening to what they are doing to help us through this  crisis and asking what they need.   This bill is not perfect, but it does provide emergency relief  legislation that helps our healthcare workers, our hospitals, and our  businesses with liquidity, and it helps keep our workers on the  payroll, as well as helping Americans most in need.   We see businesses retooling their industry. We see groups donating  supplies and others seeking cures. We are learning many lessons,  finding many flaws that we must fix so we have the opportunity to come  back even stronger and more responsible than ever.   We need to pass this bill. This time is very unprecedented. Let's get  it done.
