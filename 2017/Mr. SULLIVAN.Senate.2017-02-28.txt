 Mr. President, like my colleague from the great State  of Alaska, I also rise in support of the confirmation of Congressman  Ryan Zinke to be our Nation's next Secretary of the Interior.   There has been a lot of discussion about Congressman Zinke, and he  comes to this job with great qualifications. He is a patriotic and  ethical man, from a patriotic and ethical part of America: the American  West. He is a Navy SEAL who has dedicated decades of his life to  protecting our great Nation. He is a lifelong sportsman. He is a  trained geologist. He is a strong advocate for energy independence. He  has a keen interest in protecting our environment, while not stymying  much needed economic growth.   There is probably no position more important to the future of our  great State of Alaska than the Secretary of the Interior, and I think  it is great that we will have a new Secretary--in addition to the  chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my colleague  Senator Murkowski, from our great State. There are no more important  positions than those positions. The Federal government owns more than  60 percent of Alaska, and we are a big State. I don't have to come here  and talk about how big we are, but we are the biggest by far. Sorry,  Texas.   In my State, as with many States in the West, our land is our  lifeblood. It feeds us. It is what drives our economy and our culture.  Congressman Zinke understands this. He hails from Montana, which has a  similar view of how important the land is. He understands that  responsible energy development goes hand in hand with robust  environmental protections, and he understands the very important point  that we as Americans can do both. We can responsibly develop our  resources and protect the environment. No country has a better record  of doing that than the United States of America.   Congressman Zinke has committed to working with Alaska as a partner  in opportunity, rather than acting as a roadblock to success. Why is  this so important? This would be an enormously welcome change from the  past administration. I served as Alaska's attorney general, as  commissioner of natural resources in my great State, and now as a U.S.  Senator, and I witnessed, unfortunately, how the former Obama  administration tried to stop, stymie, and slow roll literally every  economic project in Alaska--every one.   Alaska and so many States across our country have tremendous  resources to be developed right now. America is undergoing an energy  renaissance. We are once again the world's energy superpower, yet our  Federal Government was not helpful in that renaissance at all. It can  be now, and we are looking toward a bright future when we have a  Federal Government that is going to be a partner in opportunity, not an  obstacle. I am hopeful that we are going to see a new renaissance of  economic growth and job creation in Alaska and across the country,  buoyed by Federal agencies like the Department of the Interior under  Congressman Zinke's leadership that want to help us seize  opportunities, not undermine them.   Like my colleague Senator Murkowski, I encourage all of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to vote for Congressman Zinke to be our next  Secretary of the Interior. He is a man of integrity, a man of  patriotism, a man of experience, who in my view, is going to make a  great Secretary of the Interior.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
