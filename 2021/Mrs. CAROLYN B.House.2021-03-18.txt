 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of the millions of Dreamers who call America home and  contribute to the rich tapestry of our country, yet have seen their  dreams of a permanent home deferred over and over again.   These Americans, in every way but on paper, deal with uncertainty  each day that we fail to act. Now that the House has acted, the Senate  must immediately pass the American Dream and Promise Act.   In our melting pot of a city, New Yorkers have shown again and again  that it is our diversity that makes us strong and that immigrants and  the American Dream are linked.   So, today, the House made clear that immigrants are welcome here and  that Dreamers deserve to know their home will not be taken away. I  thank all of my colleagues who voted ``yes'' to providing this  commonsense pathway to citizenship, and I urge the Senate to do the  same.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself and               Mr. Connolly):        H.R. 2042.
