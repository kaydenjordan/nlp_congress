 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15,  the Senate consider the Shriver nomination; and that at 2:30, the  Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination, as provided under the  previous order.    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Indian Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of S. 5087 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Schatz substitute  amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
