 Mr. President, from dark prison cells in Tehran to the  FSB's prison in Moscow, autocrats and dictators are unjustly detaining  innocent Americans as pawns to advance their geopolitical goals. So I  come to the floor today, as families of these Americans have gathered  in Washington, to shine a spotlight on the plight of their loved ones  and to support passage of the Supporting Americans Wrongfully or  Unlawfully Detained Abroad Act of 2023, which is a bipartisan effort I  am leading with the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee,  Senator Risch, as well as Senators Shaheen and Hagerty.   This bill would make a simple yet meaningful change to lessen the  burden on these families as they work toward the release of their loved  ones. It would allow the State Department to cover travel and lodging  costs for families to advocate for their loved ones' release in  Washington. It would also advance efforts to support the mental health  and well-being of detainees and their families.   It will eliminate a completely arbitrary distinction under U.S. law.  Currently, if your loved one is being held hostage by a nonstate  actor--for example, a terrorist group like ISIS or al-Qaida--the  government pays the costs for limited family travel to Washington, but  if your loved one is being unlawfully detained by a foreign  government--Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and the like--there is no such  funding available. This doesn't make any sense, and Senator Risch and I  are trying to fix it on behalf of American families who find themselves  in unbearably difficult and painful circumstances.   This bill passed unanimously out of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. Let me repeat that--unanimously. It is not and should not be  controversial. This is the least we can do for families who lie awake  wondering if their son or daughter, sister or brother will return home,  who wonder if there is something else, just one more thing they could  do to make a difference that would break the deadlock of their loved  one's captivity--maybe one more meeting with a U.S. Government official  or a Member of Congress; maybe the right confluence of events to bring  their child back home.   So I ask this body to give these families just a little bit of peace  as they navigate an unimaginable nightmare. Surely cutting a bit of  redtape, getting them a train ticket or a plane ride to Washington once  or twice a year, is not too much to ask.   I am here to seek passage of this bill. I was going to seek a  unanimous consent request. I understand that my colleague, the Senator  from Kentucky, Senator Paul, has a fiscal issue. I just met with him.  We look forward to hopefully working it out and then being able to  return to the floor to seek its passage.   Until then, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of  Dr. Gupta's nomination as Ambassador at Large for Global Women's  Issues.   Around the world today, women's rights and fundamental freedoms are  under attack. In Ukraine, an untold number of women and girls are  undergoing the brutal sexual violence accompanying Putin's war. In  Iran, security forces have killed female protesters in the street. In  Latin America, a wave of femicides has gone unanswered. In Saudi  Arabia, women still need a man's approval to marry. In Afghanistan, the  Taliban are erasing women from the public sphere, denying them the  right to an education or the ability to work. In China, the government  has sent ethnic minority Uighurs into concentration camps, forcing  Uighur women onto birth control, forcing them to have abortions, and  even forcing them to be sterilized.   This has got to stop, and it is unacceptable. We cannot and must not  stand idly by as such horrors continue.   One way we can fight back is by making sure U.S. diplomacy and  foreign assistance prioritizes the protection of women and girls in all  corners of the globe.   Dr. Gupta is an excellent and well-qualified choice to lead such an  effort. She would bring decades of experience working to empower women.  She has fought to increase the economic security and political  participation of women. She has pushed for an end of pervasive violence  against women and girls.   And from her time as Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF to her work  as President of the International Center for Research on Women, Dr.  Gupta has demonstrated global leadership on women's issues and  commitment to advancing gender equality through U.S. foreign policy  efforts.  [[Page S1529]]    As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am confident  that, as Ambassador of Global Women's Issues, she will work tirelessly  and effectively to advance the rights of women and girls worldwide.   Dr. Gupta should have been confirmed last Congress, but we cannot go  back in time. But what we can do is act now. Mr. President, I strongly  support Dr. Gupta's nomination and urge my colleagues to vote for  cloture.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that the vote that was supposed  to take place at 1:45 p.m. commence immediately.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION            Latvia--Naval Strike Missile Coastal Defense System         The Government of Latvia has requested to buy a Naval       Strike Missile Coastal Defense System (NSM CDS), including       tactical, telemetered, and training missiles; containers;       mobile operational platforms; integration equipment; ordnance       handling equipment (OHE); training equipment and aids;       technical publications and data; training; spares; U.S.       Government and contractor technical and product support or       assistance; and other related elements of logistical and       program support.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Latvia's capability to meet       current and future threats in the Baltic Sea maritime domain.       Latvia's increased coastal defense capability and       interoperability with U.S. and NATO armed forces will       contribute to both U.S. and Latvian defense and security       objectives in the Baltics. Latvia will have no difficulty       absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor is to be determined. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.  [[Page S1532]]         Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Latvia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
