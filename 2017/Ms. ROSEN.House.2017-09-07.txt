 Mr. Speaker, I am disgusted by House Republicans'  continued efforts to end DACA and help this heartless administration  tear families apart. Yesterday, House Republicans had a chance to  rectify the Trump Administration's despicable decision to betray  DREAMers in Nevada and across this country.   Instead, they chose to block the immediate consideration of the  bipartisan Dream Act. And then last night, House Republicans in the  Rules Committee doubled down on this President's cowardly assault on  DREAMers by blocking an amendment that I helped file with my colleagues  Julia Brownley and Luis Correa.   That would have prohibited funds from being used to deport DACA  recipients. In Nevada, DACA has allowed more than 13,000 young people  to come forward, pass background checks, and live and work legally.  These young men and women who are brought here as children are  patriotic and brave. They include college students, members of our  military, and so many others who are contributing to our society.   They fear they will be taken from their homes and their families torn  apart. President Trump's decision to end DACA is an affront to  everything our Nation stands for and only cements his legacy of  shortsighted cruelty.   House Republicans ought to be ashamed of themselves for helping this  administration push DREAMers one step closer to deportation. I will  continue to fight for our values, our principles, because as Americans,  we do not turn our backs on people who represent the best of our  Nation.   We must take the Dream Act up without delay.
