 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Black History  Month and to pay tribute to a Pennsylvanian who has dedicated her life  to public service.   Today, we honor former Philadelphia councilwoman Marian Benton Tasco,  whose 50-year career in public service has improved the lives of  countless people in our State. Throughout her career, Marian Tasco  consistently fought for the people of her community. From her first  days as a typist working in the city of Philadelphia to the end of her  seventh term serving on  [[Page S1205]]  the city council, Marian Tasco's life has been dedicated to helping  people. Today we celebrate Marian's commitment to public service.   Born during the days of segregation in Greensboro, NC, Marian Tasco  was joyfully raised through the love and care of her mother, Mazie  Benton; her great-grandmother, Susie Short; and her grandparents, Alice  and Thomas Benton. At an early age, Marian expressed an interest in  community service through volunteer activities with the Brownies and  Girl Scouts of America. Even as a child, Marian Tasco was inspired to  help others.   It was at this point in her life that Marian imagined that she would  go on to become an educator. With that goal in mind, she began her  education at Bennett College, a historically Black liberal arts college  for women, which is located in Greensboro. Marian worked during the  summers to pay for her tuition. After 2 years, Marian had to leave  Bennett when she could no longer afford to pay the cost of tuition.  Later in life, Marian would return to Bennett College as a member of  the board of trustees and actively work to support the growth of the  college.   After leaving Bennett, Marian Tasco moved to Philadelphia to be with  her family and to continue her education at Temple University. Again  working to pay her way through school, she attended classes at night  until her graduation.   While she maintained a strong interest in serving others, she decided  that, rather than education, politics and government would be her venue  for service. In 1959, Marian began her work for the city of  Philadelphia as a clerk typist I in the Philadelphia Police  Department's Pawn Brokers Division. As a result of her diligent work,  not long thereafter, she was promoted to clerk typist II. In this new  role, she was reassigned to the registrar's office of the Philadelphia  Museum of Art.   Like many others who have served the public, Marian Tasco's story in  politics began on the frontlines of the community--the community she  would later go on to serve.   Under the leadership of a distinguished lawyer, Charles Bowser,  Marian served as a task force coordinator for the Greater Philadelphia  Urban Affairs Coalition. This is an organization that she continues to  serve today as a board member. One of Marian's greatest accomplishments  was the creation of a youth-focused summer work program that still  exists today. Her experience at the Urban Affairs Coalition affirmed  her interest in public affairs and community outreach and helped  increase her understanding of the needs of the African-American  community in Philadelphia.   As her career progressed and new opportunities emerged, Marian Tasco  remained committed to the path of service. Following her work as an  assistant to the former secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,  C. Delores Tucker, Marian brought her passion for service to the office  of the late U.S. Congressman William H. Gray III. He also, of course,  served as House majority whip and chairman of the Budget Committee. She  worked as both campaign manager and director of constituent services  for Congressman Gray.   Serving with Secretary Tucker and Congressman Gray made Marian Tasco  worthy of recognition, but Marian wanted to do more. She decided that  with her years of experience in community activism and public service,  she would seek elected office. It was at the urging of Marian's mentor,  former Representative, City Councilman, and Secretary of Public Welfare  John White, Jr., that she made the decision to seek elected office.   In 1983, Marian became the first African American elected  Philadelphia city commissioner. Instantly, she helped develop voter  education and registration programs in the city and worked to grow  civic education focusing on Philadelphia's young people.   In 1988, Marian began her first term on the Philadelphia City Council  as a representative for the ninth district of the city. For over 27  years, she served in a number of communities, including East Oak Lane,  West Oak Lane, Mount Airy, Olney, Logan, Lawncrest, and Oxford Circle.  She would go on to be reelected seven times and pioneer initiatives to  improve the quality of life for Philadelphians young and old.   Throughout her tenure in office, Councilwoman Tasco's role continued  to grow in responsibility and scope. She eventually rose to serve as  Philadelphia City Council's majority leader, as well as majority whip.   Marian Tasco has served as ward leader for the 50th Ward of  Philadelphia for the last three decades. She was also unanimously  elected by the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee to represent  Pennsylvania on the Democratic National Committee. In this DNC role,  Councilwoman Tasco's reach grew beyond Philadelphia into the national  political arena.   She helped institute meaningful change in Philadelphia and literally  across the Nation. Among other issues, she worked to fight predatory  lending, and her work in that area positively impacted the lives of  many Philadelphians. Her commitment to ``protect Americans from  unscrupulous dealings of financial institutions'' spanned both Broad  Street and Wall Street and helped inspire some of President Barack  Obama's work. Her advocacy on this issue dates back to the early 1990s,  when she worked with community organizations to alert Philadelphia  residents about the potential harm of money offered by loan sharks. In  2004, she briefed then-State Senator Obama on the issue during his  campaign for the U.S. Senate. In commemoration of her efforts,  President Obama invited Councilwoman Tasco to join him for the signing  of the historic Dodd-Frank legislation.   Marian Tasco's accomplishments in public office made Philadelphia a  better place to live and work, and the people of Pennsylvania's largest  city remembered. Her retirement celebrations had over 1,200 attendees,  including elected officials, labor leaders, community leaders, clergy,  and, of course, constituents--the people she served. Councilwoman Tasco  is a beloved figure throughout the city of Philadelphia and beyond. She  is beloved by her peers and those she represented as a councilwoman.   Marian's work in public service was a shining example for others to  follow. Philadelphia mayor and former city council member Jim Kenney  and former mayor and councilman Michael Nutter have both cited the  councilwoman as a mentor. In fact, Mayor Kenney even noted that  Councilwoman Tasco ``raised him'' from the age of 32, when he was a new  council member.   She also has a proven legacy of recognizing and developing young  talent on her own team. Two current members of the Philadelphia City  Council, Derrick Green and Cherelle Parker, and the late Judge Brenda  Frazier-Clemons all served as members of her staff.   Councilwoman Marian Tasco's lifetime of service has been the subject  of commendation. She has received a notable list of awards and honors,  including an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Lincoln University.  Her years of work to improve the city of Philadelphia resulted in a  lifetime appointment to the Board of Directors of City Trusts, the  Philadelphia Cultural Fund, and the Pennsylvania Convention Center  Authority Board, just to name a few. For her advocacy on behalf of  behavioral health programs and work to push local healthcare reforms,  the former Lindley Court senior living apartments were renamed in her  honor.   Marian Tasco has spent the better part of her life working to improve  her community, and she has inspired the next generation of public  servants. As we celebrate this Black History Month, we honor those who  have made a real commitment to serve others. Marian Tasco has always  honored that commitment.   On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the city of  Philadelphia, and all those whose lives have been impacted and inspired  by her work, it is my privilege on this day to pay tribute to Marian  Tasco, a former member and leader of the City Council of Philadelphia  and a devoted public servant who worked her way from clerk typist I to  citywide leader with national impact.   Well done, Marian. Your adopted city and our Commonwealth are proud  of your noble work.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize and honor  Reading Terminal Market as it celebrates the 125th anniversary of its  founding in Pennsylvania.   Reading Terminal Market officially opened on February 22, 1893, under  the Reading Railroad Company and is one of the Nation's oldest farmers'  markets. The market was a result of the city's consolidation of public  markets in the early 19th century due to the mass number of merchants  and health hazards that became associated with merchant stalls.   Reading Terminal Market opened with approximately 78,000 square feet,  including 800 spaces for merchants to sell their goods. The market was  prosperous during the Great Depression and World War II due to local  farmers coming to the city because of high demand and fair prices.  Individuals living in the suburbs could have their groceries delivered  for free through the use of the train station. Employees at the Reading  Terminal would load carts of groceries onto trains and deliver them to  each station as the customer requested. Much of Reading Terminal  Market's customer base and services relied on the Reading Railroad  Company.   When the railroad company failed, the market suffered and experienced  financial hardship from the 1960s to the early 1990s. A $30 million  investment in infrastructure resuscitated the market, and it has  thrived as an economic hub ever since.   Today, Reading Terminal Market, housed in a National Historic  Landmark building, is home to 80 merchants of all different cultural  backgrounds with products ranging from fresh, locally sourced produce,  meats, handmade wares, and clothing, to a broad range of ethnic food  and global goods. With an estimated 100,000 people experiencing the  market on a weekly basis, Reading Terminal Market is one of the most  prosperous, public markets in both the Commonwealth and in the Nation.   I commend Reading Terminal Market, its employees, and its merchants  on the 125th anniversary of its founding. As the market has reached  global recognition, I am honored it calls Pennsylvania home. Rich in  both diversity and tradition, let it serve as a symbol of culture,  history, opportunity, and inspiration for us all.                            ____________________
