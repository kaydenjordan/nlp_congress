 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished  gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to thank her for her leadership,  for being one of the prime cosponsors of the bill, H.R. 7, along with  Mrs. Black, Ms. Foxx, Mrs. Wagner, Mrs. Blackburn, Mrs. Noem, Mrs.  Hartzler, and all the others who have joined in as sponsors of this  lifesaving legislation.   I would also like to thank Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy,  Whip Scalise, and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers for their  extraordinary leadership in defending the most innocent and the most  vulnerable among us, unborn children, as well as providing protections  for their mothers, and for bringing this legislation, H.R. 7, to the  floor.   Forty years ago, Madam Speaker, Congress enacted the Hyde amendment,  a law that continues to this day to proscribe Federal Medicaid funds  from being used to subsidize abortion in most circumstances.   More than 20 peer-reviewed studies show that more than 2 million  people are alive today, 2 million, because of the Hyde amendment. Two  million people who would have been aborted, instead, survived because  public funds were unavailable to effectuate their violent demise, while  their mothers benefited from prenatal health care and support; 2  million survivors who have had the opportunity to live and to enjoy the  most basic and the most elemental of all human rights, the right to  life.   Madam Speaker, we are experiencing a megatrend in America,  consistently reflected in polling data, including the most recent  polling data from the Marist Poll yesterday, that showed that 61  percent of Americans are against public funding for abortion, and most  want, even those who identify as pro-choice, more restrictions to  protect the innocent unborn.   People are seeing the truth of who abortion actually destroys, as  today's proudly shared, first baby pictures are most often of  ultrasound imaging photos depicting the amazing miracle of the  developing child in the womb.   Growing numbers of Americans are often shocked to learn that the  methods of abortion include dismemberment of a child's fragile body,  including decapitation, and the severing of arms and legs, or the use  of drugs like RU-486 that literally starve the child to death before  forcibly expelling her or him from the safety of the womb.   Yet, the billion-dollar abortion industry continues to cleverly  market the chief sophistry of choice, while going to extraordinary  lengths to cover up, ignore, and trivialize the battered victim child  in the womb.   Madam Speaker, pro-life Americans struggle for the day when abortion  violence will be replaced by compassion and empathy for women and  respect for  [[Page H622]]  the weak and most vulnerable among us, the child in the womb. They  believe, as do my pro-life colleagues, that we ought to love them both,  mother and child, and not fund the destruction of children through  abortion.   Lawmakers also need to hear the courageous voices of women who are  silent no more, a rapidly expanding number of women who share the agony  and heartbreak that they have endured after procuring an abortion.   As I mentioned, yesterday there was a poll that came out, and, again,  it found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for  abortion, and only 35 percent support it, which is precisely what we  seek to accomplish with enactment of H.R. 7. It would make the Hyde  amendment and other current abortion funding restrictions permanent and  government-wide.   I would note, parenthetically, that soon after the Hyde amendment was  enacted in 1976, other abortion funding riders were enacted into law,  and Hyde itself was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1980.   In 1983, I authored the ban on funding abortion in the Federal  Employees Health Benefits program. Most must be renewed legislatively  each and every year. This legislation would make it permanent.   The legislation ensures that the Affordable Care Act, until repeal,  conforms with the Hyde amendment.   I would remind my colleagues that just a few feet from where I stand,  on September 9, 2009--and I have his speech right in front of me--the  President of the United States said: ``And one more misunderstanding I  want to clear up--under our plan, no Federal dollars will be used to  fund abortions, and Federal conscience laws will remain in place.''   Well, on the latter, the conscience laws remained in place, but they  were just simply not enforced.   And of course we know now, as my good friend, Ms. Cheney, mentioned,  we know that, according to the GAO--because people kept saying in the  early years, oh, there is no funding, public funding for abortion, so  we asked GAO to look into it. They came back and said there is much-- over 1,000 plans pay for abortion on demand.    Madam Speaker, I will just remind Members  that, in order to gain votes of several pro-life Democrats needed for  passage of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama issued an executive  order on March 24, 2010, and it said:         The Affordable Care Act maintains current Hyde restrictions       governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to       newly created health insurance exchanges.    The problem is, it never happened.   There were people who are saying even today that there is no taxpayer  funding for abortion. Yes, there is. We finally went to the GAO. We  asked them to do a study, an audit. They spent a full year on it and  confirmed that the plans that we were subsidizing with taxpayer dollars  covered abortion.   I remind my colleagues that, under the Hyde amendment, plans that pay  for abortion are precluded from receiving government funding. 1,036  Affordable Care Act exchange plans were found to have abortion on  demand being paid for by the taxpayers.   So if the Hyde amendment had been applied as former President Obama  had said it would, there would have been zero coverage for abortion,  except in cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother.    Madam Speaker, I want to first thank the  distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend Diane Black, for her  extraordinary leadership. I also want to say to my colleagues--and I  hope this really is accepted for the profound change that it  underscores--the Hyde amendment has saved 2 million lives; 2 million  survivors who would have died had Medicaid funding for abortion not  been available.   This is over the course of 40 years, but 2 million lives, some of  whom are 39, 38. It is about 60,000 children every year. And if you  look at where this comes from, much of the mega-analysis comes from a  peer review done by the Guttmacher Institute in 2009. They have found  that there is a 25 percent  [[Page H637]]  reduction in Medicaid abortions when Medicaid money is not available to  effectuate the dismemberment and the chemical poisoning of an unborn  child.   Defense of the unborn child is a human rights issue of our time,  Madam Speaker. We talk about the unborn child, we degrade them, we  treat them as if they are tumors or warts to be excised rather than  children growing, developing, and maturing.   Ultrasound imaging, as we all know, has shattered the myth that  somehow an unborn child is anything but human and alive. And I hope  that the science, which is very readily available, catches up with the  policy.   This makes Hyde and all of the other amendments permanent. We know  that every year we have an annual battle over several of those  amendments. It also, finally, title II, takes out of ObamaCare the  facilitation and the funding of abortion.   When President Obama did his executive order in December of 2010, he  said that the Hyde amendment would be applied to the ObamaCare  exchanges. For months and years after that in-House debate, people have  said that has happened. It did not. We know beyond any reasonable  doubt--and we enlisted GAO to look at that--well over 1,000 plans pay  for abortion on demand in the ObamaCare exchanges.   So that got the votes the pro-life Democrats needed to effectuate the  passage of the Affordable Care Act. But, frankly, it hasn't happened.  Title II of this bill says the Hyde amendment will be applied to the  ObamaCare exchanges. Had that been done faithfully by the President,  there would be no need for title II of this bill.   I remember when the President stood right there in September of 2009  and said: Under our plan, no taxpayer funding will be used to pay for  abortion. Absolutely untrue. This language in H.R. 7 makes that true.  We don't want to be complicit in the killing and the maiming of unborn  children. As we know now, beyond any reasonable doubt, post-abortive  women increasingly are coming forward and speaking out, those  especially who found peace and reconciliation to say abortion also  hurts women.   There are two victims in every abortion: mother and baby. Two million  lives saved. That is what we should be all about, life affirming and  the saving of human rights.    I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, my distinguished colleague said ``prove it'' about the  2 million. Well, there is a very extensive study done by Michael J.  New. The Review of Literature done in June of 2009 by the Guttmacher  Institute found: ``Approximately one-fourth of women who would have had  Medicaid-funded abortions instead gave birth when this funding was  unavailable.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Indiana, Jim Banks, as our first speaker tonight, a former State  senator in Indiana. He served since 2010, a new Member of the House. He  served as chairman of the senate Veterans Affairs and The Military  Committee with great distinction, and now he has actually joined the  Veterans' Affairs Committee as well as other committees here in the  House.    I thank my good friend for his remarks.   I now yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, who  has been outspoken for years on behalf of the innocent and inconvenient  unborn children.    I want to thank the distinguished chairwoman  of the Education and the Workforce Committee for her kind remarks and  again thank her for her leadership for so many years.   I now yield to the gentleman from Arizona, Congressman Andy Biggs.  While a new Member of the House, he is a very experienced lawmaker,  having served 14 years in the Arizona Legislature.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona for his leadership in the legislature before. As the gentleman  so aptly pointed out, the numbers of abortion come down when even  modest restrictions are passed. The law is a great teacher. We are so  happy to have the gentleman from Arizona here in  [[Page H670]]  the House, and I know I speak for many of us on the Pro-Life Caucus.   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan for his eloquence, for his commitment, his passion, and for  that steadfastness that will one day yield the result when the unborn  are protected in our laws against the violence of abortion. I thank the  gentleman from Michigan for participating, but most importantly for his  years of service on behalf of his constituents and the unborn.   I now yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Iowa's leadership, which has been over many decades. I want to thank  him for his eloquence and his steadfastness. The day will come when the  unborn are protected, and he will be a major part of that.   I would also concur with the gentleman from Iowa fully in how much we  miss the great Henry Hyde. He was extraordinary. He was irreplaceable.  And the fact that his amendment has saved 2 million lives, at least-- some estimates put it even higher--is a testimony to his vision, which  we now carry on with.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert). I again thank him  for his outspokenness on behalf of the weakest and most vulnerable.    I thank the gentleman for his very  passionate and incisive remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure, the Agriculture, and  the Natural Resources Committees. I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.    I thank the gentleman so very much for his  kind remarks, but also his very eloquent concern for post-abortive  women and those who may be contemplating abortion. You know, the  Pregnancy Care Network, 4,000 strong throughout the United States, is  there as a front line to say: We love you both, mother and baby.   So I thank the gentleman for bringing attention to that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice), a member of the Oversight and Government Reform, and the Natural  Resources Committees.    Thank you very much for your eloquence and  reminding us all that the Supreme Court itself said that we need not  resolve the difficult question of when human life begins; then they  went on to say that any child, at any point until birth, could be  killed by way of an abortion. They resolved it, but they  [[Page H673]]  resolved it in the negative without science, without the information.  Ultrasound certainly has shattered that myth, and I thank you for  reminding all of us about that.   I also would remind my colleagues that Jean Garton--a great leader-- ran Lutherans for Life for years. She was preparing a presentation on  abortion that included some actual pictures of aborted babies. It was  late at night, but her young child walked in while she was doing this  and said: Mommy, who broke the baby?   So even a small child could recognize--and did recognize--that  abortion destroys the life of a baby. Sadly, the Court has not been  able to. With all of their much-vaunted intelligence capacity, they  missed it by a mile. So thank you for reminding us of that.   Mr. Speaker, how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ex-President Barack Obama, the abortion President, has  done serious harm. No human rights abuse, however, need be forever.  Today, we have an extraordinary opportunity. We have, I would submit, a  duty to protect the weakest and most vulnerable and to reassert  protections that have been sadly lacking for the last 44 years.  Protecting unborn children and their mothers is the most important  human rights cause on Earth. And this week, on Friday, thousands are  expected to march for life, to march for this fundamental human right-- the right to live.   Now, as never before, we must work, pray, and fast for that day when  every life is cherished as a gift; every life loved, despite one's  disability, race, sex, color, religion, or condition of dependency; and  every life welcomed, no matter the inconvenience. Earlier in this  Special Order, Steve King talked about caring for people at every stage  of development--every stage--including the unborn. Birth is an event  that happens to each and every one of us. It is not the beginning of  life.   Again, ultrasound imaging of the unborn child has just opened up  everyone's eyes to the little child--twins if there are two--that  resides within.   He also talked about, and I would agree with him, children with  disabilities need to be welcomed. A prenatal diagnosis of disability  should mean empathy and concern for the child, not exclusion or a death  sentence, because every life is a gift.   Mr. Speaker, it is very encouraging as to how many young people are  stepping up to protect and lead in this human rights cause.  Increasingly, the young people on college campuses, Students for Life,  and so many young people in their 20s, the millennials--and the polling  shows the millennials are pro-life--are stepping up.   Tom Brokaw often talked about the Greatest Generation. They are  stepping up as the next Greatest Generation who by their compassion,  faith, and determination will transform America into a culture of life.   All of us in the pro-life movement are especially thankful for the  growing number of courageous women who are silent no more. Some of the  groups are called the Silent No More Awareness campaign. For example,  women, all of whom have had abortions, have suffered psychological and  emotional harm, and yet they, thank God, have found reconciliation and  peace, often through faith. But now they blaze a hope-filled path for  other post-abortive women to find healing, reconciliation, and inner  peace. They admonish society not to offer the false solution of killing  an unborn child.   There are two victims in every abortion: the baby, the most obvious,  but equally the mother. Women deserve better than the false solution of  dismembering or chemically poisoning unborn children. The other side of  the issue seldom talks about the child, if ever, don't even use the  word abortion much anymore, just choice or reproductive rights, and  just refuses to accept or to acknowledge or to debate what the deed  actually does.   Children have their arms and legs torn off their bodies by the  abortionist as well as decapitation. Chemicals literally starve the  child to death. RU-486 is euphemistically called medical abortion like  the other pills that are provided. First, the child starves in the  womb, and then another chemical brings on labor.   For the pro-life movement, we all acknowledge that the way forward is  fraught with obstacles that must be overcome. The promotion of human  rights is never easy. The promotion of human rights is never obstacle  free. If past is prologue, the history of the pro-life movement,  however, shows that we will never quit.   Earlier today, the House voted on the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, H.R. 7, to end  taxpayer complicity and funding of abortion. I especially want to thank  our very principled leadership, great people like the Speaker, Paul  Ryan; Kevin McCarthy, our majority leader; Steve Scalise, our whip; and  Cathy McMorris Rodgers; and so many others who take a principled stand  for the unborn and equally for their mothers.   No matter what The Washington Post or The New York Times might say,  they are willing to stand into the wind rather than to go along with it  because the sanctity of life--the preciousness of those children and  equally of their mothers--demands it. I want to thank them for their  extraordinary leadership. As we all know, the bill passed 238-183.   The extraordinary news is about the Hyde amendment and its  consequences. It has saved the lives of over 2 million children, and  that is a conservative estimate. There may be many more. Other funding  bans at State levels, as well as our funding bans in our Federal  policies, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, have  also saved lives because the money was not there to facilitate the  demise--the violent demise--of those children.   Even the Guttmacher Institute, the former research arm of Planned  Parenthood, acknowledges that about 25 percent of the Medicaid  abortions that otherwise would have occurred do not occur. Those  children go on to be born, and that is where the 2 million figure,  about 60,000 per year--children who evade the scalpel or the chemical  poisoning of abortion.   Forty years ago, Congress enacted the Hyde amendment. It has been  continued every year, and now it will be made permanent if this bill  were to become law. We know, as was said during the debate by my  friends on the other side of this issue, that they are determined to  eviscerate the Hyde amendment, and those 2 million children, had they  had their way over the last 40 years, would have been killed.   We also want to take abortion out of ObamaCare. The President stood  right at that podium, Mr. Speaker, in September of 2009, and said:  ``Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions. .  . . ''   We know that is absolutely untrue. He also signed an executive order  where he said that the Hyde amendment would be applied to the plans in  the exchanges. So we went to the Government Accountability Office and  asked for a study. It took about a year, and they came back and said  that 1,036 insurance plans across the country paid for abortion on  demand with taxpayer funding. H.R. 7, title II, would end that  complicity of the taxpayer with the procurement of abortion.   Let me also say that we hope to bring up in this House a bill that  was sponsored last Congress and is again today by Trent Franks of  Arizona, a great champion of life. It is called the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act to legally protect most babies at 20 weeks  postfertilization. Of course, many of those kids die of dismemberment.  Again, we need a national debate on abortion because the methods have  been hidden by the facade of the abortion industry. They have been very  good at cloaking, concealing, and diminishing any focus on what happens  to the baby. Even when abortion is through ultrasound-guided abortions  and the mother is there, semi-sedated, they turn the screen away from  her so she doesn't see the dismemberment of the child, because,  obviously, as Dr. Nathanson, the founder of NARAL and an abortionist,  once said--he came to the conclusion after having killed 60,000  children and then became a pro-lifer--he said that if wombs had  windows, if everyone, including the woman, could see the child, she  would run out of that abortion mill.   So, again, I want to say thank you to Trent Franks. I know he is  here, and  [[Page H674]]  I hope that he will join us tonight. He has led on born-alive  legislation, which is also transformative.   Imagine that the former President of the United States, Barack Obama,  said that he would veto a bill that would provide a standard of care,  including a right to private action, when the child is born alive from  a later term abortion. We can't even help that child? Yet Obama, the  abortion President, said: No, we can't. Trent Franks, again, has been  the leader on that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus)  who is a good friend and colleague, and then to close, Congressman  Trent Franks.    I thank the gentleman so much for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
