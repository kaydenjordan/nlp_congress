 Madam Speaker, when the coronavirus shut down this  country, first responders and healthcare professionals kept our  communities going and safe. The essential services they provide can't  be done from behind a computer screen, Madam Speaker.   Joe Biden's vaccine mandate undermines the preparedness of these  services. The Americans we celebrated for the last 20 months are now  forced to get the coronavirus vaccine or be fired from their jobs. It  is disgusting that the Biden administration is threatening these public  servants' livelihoods over these issues.   Our country cannot afford labor shortages in essential services. Look  at law enforcement, for example. The defund the police movement  continues to embolden criminals and lower morale among the law  enforcement community.   On top of these problems, thousands of police officers are facing  termination thanks to Biden's vaccine mandate.   This is a recipe for disaster amidst rising crime. I guarantee that  if you are in danger of or a victim of crime, the last thing on your  mind will be the vaccination status of the responding officer.   Congress needs to stand up for these essential workers under attack  from Joe Biden's vaccine mandate. This week, I will introduce  legislation allowing these workers to decide for themselves on taking  the coronavirus vaccine, free from threats of termination if they  decide against getting the shot, Madam Speaker. No American citizen  should be fired for making a healthcare decision they believe is in  their best interest.                            ____________________
