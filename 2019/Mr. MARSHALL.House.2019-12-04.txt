 Mr. Speaker, this week is Second Amendment Week in our  office to celebrate our God-given right to keep and bear arms.   Each year at the start of the hunting season, I can't wait to get out  in the field and enjoy one of my very favorite pastimes. Hunting is an  American tradition shared across generations; and this Thanksgiving  weekend I was able to sneak away with my oldest son to go duck hunting  near our home in Great Bend.   Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you, I have never seen so many ducks. The  folks at D.U., all the conservation groups are doing an incredible job.   Many Kansans use firearms for hunting, but also, in many of our most  rural parts of the State, carrying a firearm can be the difference  between life and death. In over 70 counties in Kansas, the closest law  enforcement officer is often 30 minutes to an hour away; and, thus, you  may need a firearm to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your  property.   In both rural and urban areas, many Kansans responsibly open or  conceal carry on a daily basis for self-defense. Many more Kansans keep  a gun for home defense as well, maybe locked away in a master bedroom  or in a safe down in the basement.   Whether it be a handgun, rifle, or shotgun, whatever a citizen's  firearm of choice, the right to defend ourselves must not be infringed  upon. As I represent Kansas in Congress, I remain staunchly opposed to  any laws restricting what kind of firearms a law-abiding citizen can  buy or keep in their possession.   Any politician trying to implement mandatory buyback programs, which  I really call gun confiscations, or unconstitutional red flag laws in  Congress will be met with a groundswell of opposition because these  types of laws violate our Second Amendment rights.   In Congress, we need to keep fighting for programs that address the  underlying cause of gun violence, which is mental illness, to reach out  to those who are struggling so they can get the proper care and  attention early so they don't fall through the cracks and harm  themselves or others.   We also need to make sure our existing background check system is  working properly to continue to prevent tragedies, while not infringing  on the rights of mentally stable, law-abiding citizens.   The solutions to preventing gun violence can be found at dinner  tables, in our churches, and in our communities. Individually, we must  practice and promote responsible gun ownership while collectively  ensuring every law-abiding citizen's Second Amendment right is upheld  with due process.   Gun ownership and hunting have been a tradition for my family and for  this great land for many generations, each one passing on their  knowledge and skills to the next. That is our way of life in Kansas. We  must continue to uphold it and our constitutional right to keep and  bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and individual freedom.                                Pass USMCA Now     Mr. Speaker, today marks more than 1 year since  President Trump signed the USMCA trade agreement, and it is still  collecting dust on Speaker Pelosi's desk. That is an entire year that  Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have made Kansas businesses, farmers,  ranchers, and workers wait.   There is no excuse for holding up this trade agreement, which is  expected to create 176,000 jobs across America and deliver a $70  billion boost to our United States economy. In Kansas, it would mean  thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars. This agreement  will make us stronger in our next trade negotiations with China as  well.   With all due respect, Speaker Pelosi, there are no more excuses. It  is time. Let's deliver a win for our economy and pass USMCA now.                      Impeachment is All About Politics     Mr. Speaker, this week, House Republicans produced our  report showing specific facts that dismantle the Democrats' claims on  impeachment. This evidence shows:   Number one, President Trump has a deep-seated, genuine, and  reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive  corruption;   Number two, the evidence does not establish that President Trump  pressured Ukraine to investigate Burisma Holdings, Vice President Joe  Biden, Hunter Biden, or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election for  the purpose of benefiting him in the 2020 election; and   Number three, the evidence does not support that President Trump  covered up the substance of his telephone conversation with President  Zelensky by restricting access to the call summary.   Speaker Pelosi previously said that the conditions for impeachment  must be ``overwhelming'' and ``bipartisan.'' Currently, there is only  bipartisan support in opposition to impeachment.   I guess the facts really don't matter, and Democrats moving forward  show that this is all about politics.                            ____________________
