 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and our President.   This pandemic has upended life for everyone. I have heard from  workers living from paycheck to paycheck who face an uncertain future.  I have heard from struggling farmers. I have heard from small business  owners who suddenly can't make payroll or rent. I have heard from  courageous healthcare professionals and first responders who  desperately need personal protective equipment to continue to care for  the sick.   These are incredibly trying times. While the CARES Act won't solve  every unique challenge, help is on the way.   America has faced periods of profound adversity in the past. Each  time, we prevailed. Together, as Americans, we will do so again.   But may we remember that, while our Nation is locked down, our  creator, God, is wide open to our prayers. Let's use them as we put  hands and feet, together, to our prayers.
