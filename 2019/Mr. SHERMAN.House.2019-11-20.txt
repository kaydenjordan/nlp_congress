 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will close when the gentleman has closed  on his side, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   We vote today on S. 1838, but this is not just a Senate bill. This is  a bill very similar to the one introduced in this House by the  gentleman from New Jersey. This House has already voted on this bill  and supported it overwhelmingly. Today, once again, we show the world  our commitment to the people of Hong Kong and to the preservation and  protection of Hong Kong's autonomy, given China's aggressive attempts  to undermine the ``one country, two systems'' approach.   With this important legislation, we send a clear signal that the  United States will hold those undermining Hong Kong's rights and  autonomy accountable and that the American people stand shoulder to  shoulder with the people of Hong Kong. With few exceptions, the people  of Hong Kong have fought for their rights through peaceable protest,  and we stand with them.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting the  passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2710) to prohibit the commercial export of covered munitions  items to the Hong Kong Police Force.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2710         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. SUNSET.         The prohibition under section 2 shall expire one year after       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H9097]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on S. 2710.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Senator Merkley for his hard  work on this legislation. The House a few weeks before passed a similar  measure, the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, authored by the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), whom I was about to refer to as the Chair  but has now joined us here in the regular seats of the House.   Such bipartisan, bicameral legislation supporting the people of Hong  Kong is a testament to the relationship between our two peoples, but it  is also an indication of Congress' deep concern over the growing  violence in Hong Kong.   In recent weeks, we have seen an escalation in the conflict between  Hong Kong's security forces and the people of Hong Kong. The same  police forces sworn to protect the people are now indiscriminately  targeting people with tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons. I am  particularly heartbroken over the images of students under siege and  parents begging the police not to shoot their children.   We have seen similar images before, just 30 years ago in Beijing. The  fact that these horrors are now taking place in Hong Kong, a beacon of  democracy and human rights, is worrisome. I am deeply concerned by the  recent escalation of violence, and I call on all parties to exercise  restraint and seek a peaceful solution to address the very legitimate  concerns of the people of Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important measure and ensure that U.S. companies are not contributing  to the suppression of Hong Kong's people in their fight to secure their  freedoms and their democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Members of this House will remember that,  just a few months ago, we passed very similar legislation in the House  to the bill that is in front of us today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), who is an important leader on this issue. The gentleman  wrote the House version of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, we have watched as the Chinese Communist Party works to  break down and undermine the ``one country, two systems'' framework  that has paved the way for a strong relationship between Hong Kong and  the United States.   This has motivated millions of Hong Kongers, the people of Hong Kong,  to take to the streets for months to protest in defense of their basic  human rights. These prodemocracy activists have faced tear gas, pepper  spray, and rubber bullets by a police force sworn to protect them, and  now they face lethal force as well.                                time  1615    The passage of this bill demonstrates, once again, to the people of  Hong Kong that the United States stands with them in their protest of  China's erosion of the autonomy and the way of life that was promised  them back in 1997.   It takes a step to ensure that U.S. companies demonstrate a  commitment to U.S. values in this regard, making sure that U.S.  companies aren't facilitating violence against the protestors by  selling what we, sadly, know can be lethal crowd control mechanisms.   This bill is an important part of Congress' response by the effort of  Beijing to deprive Hong Kong of the autonomy and democracy that it was  promised back in 1997.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
