 Mr. Chairman, I want to spend 1 minute and thank my  friend, Congressman Walden. I know the work that he puts in when it  comes to healthcare for America.   Mr. Chairman, I know of a bill that Mr. Walden has in to protect  preexisting conditions. We have asked many times to mark it up or bring  it to the floor--no, not brought. It is talked about a lot, Mr.  Chairman, but no bill to bring it here.   I know your care when it comes to not just healthcare, but the type  of treatment one is able to get, the quality of care out there,  because, Mr. Chairman, there are people out there who will run health  facilities for the seniors but don't do a very good job. The quality is  not there.                                time  1800    People have lost their own healthcare within there. People have been  fined by the way they have treated individuals and seniors. People have  lost eyes just because the treatment had been poor.   Mr. Chairman, we are here today on this floor because we all know  that drug prices are too high. That is why the Energy and Commerce  Committee worked tirelessly to pass three healthcare bills unanimously  to address that.   Now, how often is that said on this floor? Not very often. It was a  moment that I heard from almost every member on that committee, a  moment of pride.   We could have legislation passed in a bipartisan fashion today. We  could take it from that committee and bring it to the floor, and we  would have the exact same thing happen. We could have the Republicans  and the Democrats coming together to lower the price of drugs.   You know who wins? All of America.   Sadly, however, these good faith efforts have been unnecessarily  thrown into a partisan and senseless attempt to bail out pieces of the  Affordable Care Act.   Now, I don't say that--but I guess I just did, Mr. Chairman. I knew  it because I happen to be a Member of Congress. I watched it because I  watched the committee work together, find common ground in a place  where it is really difficult.   But when I looked at The Washington Post, it was very interesting.  This is what they said. They actually put it best. Democrats are  putting a ``political pothole''--yeah, that is what they said--a  ``political pothole'' in the way of real drug pricing reform.   You know, if you ever spend time back in your district or across this  country, I would promise you one of the top three issues you will get  is the price of drugs. I think everybody in this body was looking  forward to this day, prior to the Democrats playing with political  potholes.   Make no mistake, the drug pricing component of H.R. 987 is very  strong. The three drug pricing bills in this legislation get to the  heart of the problem, the lack of competition in the generic drug  market. Increased competition for generic drugs would lead to lower  prices and make medication more accessible. Two things, I think,  anybody in America would desire.   Just think for a moment. You would get more competition, more choice,  and lower prices.   We were so close. We got out of committee. The Members on both sides  said yes. The only step you had left: Go to the Rules Committee and  come to the floor.   But as you pass through that committee to get to the Rules Committee  and get to the floor, I guess it had to go through leadership.  Leadership made a choice: Politics before people.   These reforms would have removed barriers to generic drugs entering  the market, making healthcare more affordable for patients. It is a  real change.   That would have been a positive moment we all could have celebrated.  But you know what is going to happen here? It is going to be a partisan  vote and a bill that goes nowhere.   It is going to be a pothole that most people will say elected  officials are supposed to fix, not create. It is the opposite of what  elected officials are supposed to do. They are supposed to fill in the  potholes, not dig them.   But if you read The Washington Post, they will tell you exactly who  created them--the Democrats.   There are a lot of things that happen on this floor that at times are  reckless, irresponsible, and just downright embarrassing. Mr. Chairman,  this is one of them. Why at a time when both sides say they want to  lower the prices of drugs and give people more options?   It goes to the core of the individual, of their own health. Well, it  goes to the core of what the Democrats want to do. They don't want to  make law. They love playing politics.   You know what happens when they play politics? Not only do keep drug  prices high, but they break another promise.   I happen to have been in this body, Mr. Chairman, when I heard those  words, that if you like your healthcare, you could keep it.   I thought those millions of Americans who lost their healthcare that  time, that that would be the end. But no, Mr. Chairman, the Democrats  took the majority again. I thought that was enough.   Had you taken enough health policies away from millions of Americans?  The answer was no. They had a few more to go. Mr. Chairman, 1.5  million, the Congressional Budget Office says.   So think, tomorrow when Americans wake up, there was a moment the  prices could be lower. But, no. Would they ever think that not only are  you not going to lower them, but you are going to take my healthcare  away?   That is exactly what is going to happen here today. That is the  poison pill they added to the bills.   Mr. Chairman, 1.5 million Americans will lose their plans. Now, if  you listen to the other side, they say, no, no, it is net neutral. You  know what it is? The CBO says, no, it goes down to 500,000.   I have heard them use the Congressional Budget Office thousands of  times, Mr. Chairman, on the floor. I haven't heard them use it today.   Mr. Chairman, if you read books about politicians, if you read ``The  Prince'' and you read Machiavelli, it is interesting, the ends justify  the means. That is what it says. You see, it is about control. It is  really about who can control what you can have.   There was a moment there that you would have greater options and  lower prices. No, we will tell you what you need and what you can have.   There was a moment there that you would have even greater options  when it came to healthcare. No, that is not going to be. We are going  to take that away from you. And you know what? It is going to cost you  more when we do it.   Mr. Chairman, I would say I would be shocked that this was going to  happen. I can't say I am shocked anymore because, Mr. Chairman, on one  side of the aisle in this Chamber, half of the entire majority party  has cosponsored a bill, Medicare for none.    Not only are they taking more than 1.5 million Americans' plans away  today, but they also have a plan to take more than 150 million  Americans' plans away. They are going to bankrupt Medicare. They are  going to deny you if you have private healthcare now.   But that is okay. The ends justify the means. Why? Because they have  control.   That is exactly what happened here, Mr. Chairman. You had a committee  that worked in a bipartisan manner. It is really irresponsible that the  Rules Committee or the leadership would undercut their own chair of  that committee to put a poison pill on three bills that came out in a  bipartisan manner, with an idea that they would work in good faith,  with an idea that they would put people before politics.  [[Page H3900]]    When you study history, and they talk about elected officials, they  will tell you even from the most local places you get elected, the jobs  you are going to have are filling in potholes. I never heard someone  say your job as elected officials is to create potholes, but that is  what we witnessed today.   It is a sad day for this House. We could do so much better. We did in  committee.   Is it just, Mr. Chairman, that the majority doesn't want to solve a  problem? Because, Mr. Chairman, I have searched. They have been in  power for quite some time, and I have not found one problem they have  solved yet. I found a few potholes they created. I think we have enough  problems.   When we have that moment that we can come together inside of a  committee, could we just keep it a little longer so it can get to the  floor?   Mr. Chairman, there will be an option. There will be an amendment in  this body that gives you an opportunity. If you were in that Committee  on Energy and Commerce and you voted on these bills without the poison  pill, it will be your moment of truth. It will tell a lot to America,  Mr. Chairman, whether you serve your constituents or you serve your  leadership.   That is what we will be watching. That is what America will be  wondering. That is what we all hope will happen.
