 Mr. Speaker, right now, our Nation is  facing a growing workforce crisis.   For anyone who is paying attention, the most recent jobs report was  incredibly disappointing, but it wasn't a surprise. Nearly everywhere I  go across my district in Pennsylvania, I see ``help wanted'' signs.   Every day, I hear from small businesses that are struggling to hire  and struggling to keep staff. Despite the progress that we are making  in our fight against the COVID-19 virus, Democrats are continuing their  Big Government, socialist plans. This alarming workforce trend is  rooted in the Democrat's scheme to keep paying people to stay at home,  and it must end now.   Thanks to American innovation and the success of Operation Warp  Speed, our Nation is winning the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.  Safe vaccines are the key to restoring our personal liberties,  eradicating this virus, getting our kids back to school full time, and,  yes, getting the American people back to work.   Just like every previous challenge in our history, I know that our  Nation has the potential to recover from this pandemic and to recover  stronger than ever before. This truly is the American way.   To succeed, we cannot allow President Biden and the Democrats to  sabotage our forward momentum. From day one in office, the President  has promised Big Government interference that comes with higher taxes  and more regulation for American businesses.   Now, in the name of so-called infrastructure reforms, the Biden  administration is flaunting job-killing plans that would crush  America's and Pennsylvania's robust manufacturing and energy  industries.   Mr. Speaker, job-killing schemes and higher taxes are not the answer  to the problem that lies in front of us. The dignity of work is a core  tenet of our national fabric. This belief has motivated the generations  of courageous Americans who built and forged our Nation.   Now it is once again time to get America safely back to work.  Alongside President Trump, I worked hard to advance a pro-growth agenda  to support the workforce and create American jobs for American workers.  We need to return to these solutions today to secure our success for  tomorrow.   American workers are the key to our recovery. They are truly  essential. For centuries, hard work has been the key to uplifting  families and achieving the American Dream. We cannot allow this  longstanding tradition to be lost.   For the sake of our workforce and for our communities, we must uphold  the dignity of work. We must support the workforce, and we must get our  Nation back on the road to recovery.                            ____________________
