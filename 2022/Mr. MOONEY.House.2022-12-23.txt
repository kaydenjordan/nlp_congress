 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some historic news out  of the Second Congressional District of West Virginia.   Born and raised in the eastern panhandle, Tyson Bagent is the  quarterback for the Shepherd University football team.   Last month, the Rams blew out host Indiana, 48-13, in the national  quarterfinals. Bagent completed 19 of 28 passes for 231 yards and had  four touchdowns.   Impressively, Tyson took the all-time lead for passing touchdowns in  all NCAA college divisions with 158 in the game.   This remarkable achievement is just one of many for Tyson. He had a  decorated career at Martinsburg High School, where he led the Bulldogs  to consecutive Class AAA championships in 2016 and 2017.   Congratulations to Tyson, and I wish him and the Rams continued  success.                            ____________________
