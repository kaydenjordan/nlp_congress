 Madam Speaker, over 6 years ago, our former colleague  Carlos Curbelo and I launched the Climate Solutions Caucus to have a  bipartisan effort to address climate change. We did it because where we  live in south Florida, climate change is not a partisan issue.   Republican and Democratic leaders alike, Republican and Democratic  business leaders and elected officials, all understand that sunny-day  flooding, and sea-level rise brought by climate change are happening  right now, and we need to respond to it.                                time  1015    So we launched action here to try to responsibly address climate  change, just as so many are in South Florida and around the country.  The 7 years that we have just endured are the 7 hottest years on  record. In 2021, the U.S. endured over 20 weather disasters, costing a  billion dollars or more. Hurricanes, and floods, and wildfires, all of  them made worst by climate change.   Last year, there were at least 688 people who died in the United  States attributed to climate change: $150 billion in damage.   And so where are we now?   Well, our country and our world are reeling from the devastating  impact of climate change. For the first time ever, temperatures in the  U.K. exceeded 104 degrees; Ireland hit record highs of over 90 degrees;  Portugal 117. More than 1,100 people in Spain and Portugal died in this  heat wave.   Wildfires are scorching Europe. More than 100 million people in the  U.S. have  [[Page H6887]]  been under a heat alert. A mega drought is gripping our West and  Southwest, drying up critical sources of fresh water and addressing our  demands for electrical power. And a deep drought has much of North  Africa on the edge of famine.   This has happened in one week. Yet, these heat waves will become more  frequent and intense for decades to come. We will continue to see the  intense heat waves that have been scorching Europe and the U.S. put  immense pressure on our infrastructure and continue to put lives at  risk.   Madam Speaker, we need innovators and entrepreneurs in climate tech.  We need young people to stand up and demand a world that will be safe  for them. We need the Biden administration, and we need this Congress.   My colleagues, we need to be bold. It is not about comfort. It is not  about staying cool. For people across the globe right now, at this  moment, it is and continues to be about survival. It is time for us to  act on climate change. The future of our planet depends on us.                            ____________________
