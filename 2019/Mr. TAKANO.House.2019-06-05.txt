 Madam Speaker, I rise today in gratitude for the bravery  and sacrifices made by American and Allied Armed Forces on D-Day, June  6, 1944.   This week marks the 75th anniversary of that longest day, a moment in  history when servicemembers from across the globe stormed the shores of  Normandy, France, to defend liberty and fight against the tyranny of  Nazi Germany.   And as we pause to honor and express our gratitude to the tens of  thousands of American soldiers, sailors, and airmen who bore the battle  that day and for many days after until victory was achieved, we are  reminded again that the cost of freedom can be very high.   As chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it is my  duty to ensure the promises we made to veterans and their survivors are  kept.   To those veterans that remain with us still to those D-Day veterans  who perished on that longest day and to those who lived to tell the  stories of that day, I say to you that the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs is committed to honoring your legacies by improving VA  healthcare, providing accountability for the fair and timely delivery  of benefits, and to ensure that we honor your memories.   Today I ask that all Americans reflect on the sacrifices made by the  greatest generation in Europe 75 years ago and to join me in thanking  those of this generation who have stepped up and every intervening  generation who have answered the call to serve.                            ____________________
