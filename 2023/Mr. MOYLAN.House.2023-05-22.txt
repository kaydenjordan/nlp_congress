 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday afternoon, Guam, a territory of  the United States, my district, and my home, will be moving to  Condition of Readiness 1 as Typhoon Mawar makes its way to the Marianas  region.   On its current track, the system is expected to bring tropical-storm- force winds as early as Tuesday afternoon, with the possibility of  typhoon-force winds of 81 to 110 miles per hour by Wednesday morning,  along with gusts projected to reach 100 to 120 miles per hour. This,  along with heavy rainfall, certainly places Guam and the Northern  Mariana Islands in a serious predicament, with a major natural disaster  at our doorstep.  [[Page H2467]]    While our community is resilient and has overcome such perils of  Mother Nature many times in the past, when it comes to a typhoon of  this magnitude, a direct impact over any of the islands will sadly lead  to severe damage of homes, businesses, crops, and livelihoods, and will  certainly lead us to a long road toward recovery.   Within these sacred Halls, I humbly ask my colleagues to pray for  Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands and that we can dodge this  massive bullet called Typhoon Mawar.   God Almighty, please protect our community and our people.                                time  1215              Celebrating the Philippines 125th Independence Day     Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 2023, the Philippines will be  celebrating the very day in 1898 when the Philippines declared its  independence from Spain. They will, in essence, commemorate 125 years  of independence.   While it still took nearly another half decade for the Treaty of  Manila to be signed to secure its full independence from the United  States, it is still recognized as a historic transition to allow the  country to preserve the very culture, language, and traditions that we  appreciate today.   The proud relationship between the Philippines and Guam has been  prosperous over the decades. A good percentage of our island's  population either relocated from the Philippines or have roots tied  back to the Philippines.   Due to Spanish influence, there are many similarities with our  cultures, food, traditions, and language. Many of the surnames are also  similar.   Our island has developed greater ties with the Philippines, which  includes medical tourism for islanders to seek medical care in one of  the many world-class facilities in the Philippines.   Our H2B labor solely arrives from the Philippines and has been  remarkable for our economy. Flights to and from Manila are almost  always full on any day of the week, to continue the enhancements of  economic activity for both Guam and the Philippines.   While we recognize the independence of the Philippines, I take this  time to honor and commend the Filipino Community of Guam. The FCG is a  nonprofit umbrella organization for 29 Filipino member-associations in  Guam.   For 69 years, the FCG has continued to perpetuate and promote the  culture of the Philippines on Guam and in the region. On June 3, they  will be hosting the Philippine Independence Ball to highlight this  historic occasion.   To president Patrick Luces; vice presidents Romy Angel, Elizabeth  Cena, and Loisa Cabuhat; secretaries Trixie Naholowaa-Torres and Nilfa  Milan; treasurers Frank Huelar and Allan Camacho; auditor Linda Caasi;  public relations officer Eileen Igcasenza; and to the board of  trustees, on behalf of a thankful Nation and island and under these  sacred Halls of democracy and history, I say thank you for your service  to the community and for your efforts to keep the Filipino traditions  thriving on Guam and the region.   Finally, to the Philippines, an ally of the United States, a friend  of Guam, a country of hardworking people with pride and humbleness,  Happy 125th Independence Day. ``Philippine Independence Day,'' ``Araw  ng Kalayaan.''                            ____________________
