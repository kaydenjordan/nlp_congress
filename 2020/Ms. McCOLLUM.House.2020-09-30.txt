 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the over 200,000 Americans  who have lost their lives to COVID-19 and the over 7 million people who  have been infected.   The pandemic has put great stress on our communities and wreaked  havoc on our economy. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and,  with it, their health insurance.   During the pandemic, common sense would say we should strengthen our  national healthcare system. President Trump and the congressional  Republicans continue their assault on the Affordable Care Act, urging  the courts to strike the law down.   The House has passed 340 bipartisan health bills. The Senate refuses  to take them up.   The President signs executive orders that do nothing. They do not  protect people with preexisting conditions or cover preventative  medicine. The ACA does.   The President claims to have a healthcare plan to replace the ACA,  but he only intends to release it after the election.   This is no way to govern. It is time to end the political stunts, to  work across the aisle, and to get serious about the health of the  American people.                            ____________________
