 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5517) to affirm the friendship of the governments of the United  States of America and the Republic of India, and to establish a  bilateral partnership for collaboration to advance development and  shared values, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5517         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gandhi-King Scholarly       Exchange Initiative Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The peoples of the United States and India have a long       history of friendship and  [[Page H6080]]       the interests of the peoples of the United States, India, and       the world will benefit from a stronger United States-India       partnership.        (2) Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.,       were dedicated leaders fighting for social justice and social       change, peace, and civil rights in their respective       communities, and countries and in the world.        (3) The use of nonviolent civil disobedience is a shared       tactic that has played a key role in defeating social       injustice in India, the United States, and in other parts of       the world.        (4) Mohandas Gandhi, who was born on October 2, 1869, was       murdered on January 30, 1948, after dedicating his life to       the peaceful empowerment of the people of India and to the       end of British colonial rule.        (5) Martin Luther King, Jr., who was born on January 15,       1929, was murdered on April 4, 1968, after a life dedicated       to peaceful movements against segregation, discrimination,       racial injustice, and poverty.        (6) In February 1959, Dr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott       King, traveled throughout India. By the end of his monthlong       visit, Dr. King said, ``I am more convinced than ever before       that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent       weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for       justice and human dignity.''.        (7) Fifty years after Dr. King's visit, All India Radio,       the national radio station of India, discovered a taped       message by Dr. King that emphasized the intellectual harmony       between the messages of Dr. King and Mohandas Gandhi on       nonviolent social action.        (8) On August 22, 2011, the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,       National Memorial opened to the public in Washington, DC.       This newest memorial on the National Mall pays tribute to Dr.       King's national and international contributions to world       peace through nonviolent social change.        (9) The 116th Congress coincides with both the 150th birth       anniversary of Mohandas Gandhi and the 90th birth anniversary       of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.        (10) Mohandas Gandhi, who employed the principle of       satyagraha, or ``fighting with peace'', has come to represent       the moral force inspiring many civil and social rights       movement around the world.        (11) Dr. King's effective use of Gandhi's principles was       instrumental to the American civil rights movement.        (12) There is a long history of civil and social rights       movements in the United States and in India. As the       relationship between the United States and India evolves, a       binational foundation through which the governments of each       country can work together and catalyze private investment       toward development objectives would provide an ongoing,       productive institution and symbol of the friendship and       common ideals of the respective governments and their       peoples.        (13) There is a global goal of ending tuberculosis by 2030,       the United States and India seek a TB-Free India by 2025, and       the United States-India Gandhi-King Foundation will help       address gaps across the TB value chain in prevention,       detection, diagnosis, and treatment, and would catalyze       market-based strategies to bridge the service gap for the       ``last mile''.        (14) Leaders in both countries belonging to both major       political parties have prioritized the United States-India       relationship and on a bipartisan basis continue to support a       strengthened United States-India partnership, recognizing       that it will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st       century.       SEC. 3. GANDHI-KING SCHOLARLY EXCHANGE INITIATIVE.         In order to further the shared ideals and values of       Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr, the Secretary of       State shall establish, in cooperation with the appropriate       representatives of the Government of India, a professional       exchange program known as the ``Gandhi-King Scholarly       Exchange Initiative''. The initiative should be comprised of       the following:        (1) An annual educational forum for scholars from the       United States and India that focuses on the social justice       and human and civil rights legacies of Mohandas Gandhi and       Martin Luther King, Jr., which shall--        (A) be held alternately in the United States and in India;        (B) include representatives from governments,       nongovernmental organizations, civic organizations, and       educational, cultural, women's, civil, and human rights       groups, including religious and ethnic minorities and       marginalized communities; and        (C) focus on studying the works of Gandhi and King, and       applying their philosophies of nonviolent resistance to       addressing current issues, including poverty alleviation,       conflict mitigation, human and civil rights challenges,       refugee crises, and threats to democracy and democratic norms       in countries around the world.        (2) An undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate student       exchange for students in the United States and India to--        (A) study the history and legacies of Martin Luther King,       Jr., and Mohandas Gandhi;        (B) visit historic sites in India and the United States       that were integral to the American civil rights movement and       the Indian independence movement; and        (C) research and develop papers on the importance of peace,       nonviolence, and reconciliation in current conflict regions.       SEC. 4. GANDHI-KING GLOBAL ACADEMY.         (a) In General.--The president and chief executive officer       of the United States Institute of Peace shall create a       professional development training initiative on conflict       resolution tools based on the principles of nonviolence. Such       training initiative shall be known as the Gandhi-King Global       Academy and shall--        (1) target representatives from governments,       nongovernmental organizations, civic organizations, and       educational, cultural, women's, civil, and human rights       groups, including religious and ethnic minorities and       marginalized communities in countries with ongoing political,       social, ethnic, or violent conflict;        (2) include a specific focus on the success of nonviolent       movements, inclusion, and representation in conflict       resolution;        (3) develop a curriculum on conflict resolution tools based       on the principles of nonviolence; and        (4) make the curriculum publicly available online, in       person, and through a variety of media.        (b) Prohibition.--The United States Institute of Peace may       not, in the course of any activity authorized by subsection       (a), enter into any contract with an outside entity to       conduct advocacy on its behalf.

(3) Charter.--The Governing Council of the Foundation shall       adopt a charter for the operation of the Foundation, which       shall include provisions to--        (A) identify development priorities or a process to       identify development priorities;        (B) define criteria for application, merit review, and       awarding of grants by the Foundation;        (C) establish an annual organization-wide audit by an       independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted       auditing standards, the results of which shall be made       immediately available to the Board, the Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development, and the       appropriate Government of India counterpart;        (D) assist in the creation of project specific timetables       for each of the projects funded by a grant from the       Foundation;        (E) establish an oversight role and march-in audit rights       for the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development and the appropriate Government of       India counterpart; and  [[Page H6081]]         (F) establish an annual report on the activities of the       Foundation to be made publicly available.

(3) Sunset.--The authorities provided under this subsection       shall terminate on the date that is five years after the       establishment of the Foundation.       SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Initial Reports.--Not later than 120 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act--        (1) the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a       report on the Secretary of State's plan to establish the       initiative authorized under section 3;        (2) the president and chief executive officer of the United       States Institute of Peace shall submit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a       report on the president and chief executive officer's plan to       establish the initiative authorized under section 4; and        (3) the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development shall submit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a       report on the Administrator's plan to establish, not later       than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,       the organization authorized under section 5.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5517, the Gandhi-King Scholarly  Exchange Initiative Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of the Gandhi- King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act, a measure championed by our  late friend and colleague, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia.   In 2009, John traveled to India to commemorate the 50th anniversary  of Dr. Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King's journey to explore  Gandhi's teachings on the use of nonviolent direct action to advance  social justice. John's trip and his decades of civil rights work in  public service--what he would call ``good trouble''--led to the Gandhi- King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act.   This legislation honors the longstanding friendship between the  people of the United States and India and establishes an educational  exchange program to advance the teachings of Mohandas Gandhi and Dr.  King. It also establishes a development foundation that would allow  India and the United States to work together to address pressing  issues, like climate change, education, and public health.   At a time when our country is struggling to come to terms with the  reality of systemic racism, I can think of no better time to advance  the work of Gandhi; King; and John Lewis, our friend and colleague.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure, and I hope all of my  colleagues will do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud we are considering this excellent measure  written by our dear friend, John Lewis. I know we all miss John dearly,  but his legacy of advancing the cause of righteousness and justice  lives on, and this is a good example.   John championed the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act to  further the teachings of Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Their  work on civil rights and social justice should be a beacon for us all,  and I am pleased we can pass a measure today to continue their  invaluable work for humanity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and partner, Mr. McCaul. It is a  pleasure once again to work with him on the committee and to work on  legislation for the country and the world.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1819) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956  to provide for rewards for the arrest or conviction of certain foreign  nationals who have committed genocide or war crimes, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1819         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``War Crimes Rewards Expansion       Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PROGRAM.         Paragraph (10) of section 36(b) of the State Department       Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708(b)) is amended       by striking ``defined under the statute of such tribunal;''       and inserting the following: ``defined under--        ``(A) the statute of such country or tribunal, as the case       may be; or        ``(B) United States law;''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1819, the War Crimes Rewards  Expansion Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the War Crimes Rewards Expansion  Act, and I thank Congresswoman Foxx for her hard work on this bill.   This bipartisan measure enhances the War Crimes Rewards Program,  which enables the United States to pay rewards to individuals who  provide information that leads to the arrest or conviction of foreign  nationals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide.   This initiative has led to the capture of fugitives who committed  atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. This War Crimes Rewards  Expansion Act will strengthen this rewards program and ensure that it  can be used to bring perpetrators to justice, whether it is in domestic  courts or international tribunals.   Mr. Speaker, American foreign policy should reflect our values,  including the promotion of human rights, and we must do everything  possible to bring justice to victims of atrocities and hold  perpetrators accountable. This legislation is an important step in that  direction, and I am pleased to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I echo the words of Mr. McCaul. I am pleased to support  this legislation, and I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 996) expressing the sense of Congress that the  activities of Russian national Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affiliated  entities pose a threat to the national interests and security of the  United States and of its allies and partners, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 996         Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin is a Russian national who has       maintained close personal ties with President Vladimir Putin       since the early 2000s;        Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin is the patron and funder of the       Wagner Group, also known as the Private Military Company       (PMC) Wagner, a Russian mercenary organization staffed by       current and former military and intelligence officers, and       the Internet Research Agency (IRA), an organization engaged       in online influence operations;        Whereas the IRA has conducted online information operations       against the United States in an attempt to sow division and       discord among the American electorate, as well as the       electorates of our European allies and partners;        Whereas entities funded by Yevgeniy Prigozhin have been       used by the Government of the Russian Federation to conduct       military action, subversive operations, and disinformation       campaigns on its behalf while giving it an appearance of       plausible deniability;        Whereas the Wagner Group was involved in the Russian       Federation's military invasion and attempted annexation of       Ukraine's Crimea region in February and March 2014, and in       the subsequent insurgencies in the eastern Ukrainian regions       of Donetsk and Luhansk;        Whereas the Wagner Group has been providing military       support to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria since 2015,       fighting alongside its forces and helping it recapture       significant parts of the country;        Whereas, on February 7, 2018, the Wagner Group led an armed       assault on United States troops near the city of Deir al-Zour       in eastern Syria, prompting a United States counterattack, in       what has been described as ``the deadliest U.S.-Russia clash       since the Cold War'';        Whereas the Wagner Group has supported Khalifa Haftar and       his``Libyan National Army'' by providing mercenaries,       artillery, tanks, drones, and ammunition, with Yevgeniy       Prigozhin personally attending a meeting between Haftar and       Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow on November       7, 2018;        Whereas a United Nations report made public on May 6, 2020,       concluded that the Wagner Group has operated up to 1,200       military contractors in Libya, including snipers and       specialized military teams, serving as ``an effective force       multiplier'' for Haftar's army.        Whereas mercenaries from the Wagner Group were deployed to       Venezuela in January 2019 to provide support for the regime       of Nicolas Maduro in the face of popular protests against his       dictatorship;        Whereas Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affiliated entities have       spearheaded operations with the intent to influence political       processes in Africa on behalf of the Government of the       Russian Federation in several countries, including       Madagascar, South Africa, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and the Central       African Republic;        Whereas the Wagner Group has deployed mercenaries to the       Central African Republic since 2018 and has provided security       detail for Central African Republic President Faustin-      Archange Touadera, including Russian national Valery       Zakharov, a former security official with close ties to the       Wagner Group, who serves as the National Security Adviser;        Whereas, on July 31, 2018, Russian journalists Orkhan       Dzhemal, Kirill Radchenko, and Alexander Rastorguyev were       murdered in the Central African Republic while working on a       documentary about the activities of the Wagner Group in that       country;        Whereas according to an investigation by the London-based       Dossier Center, the journalists had been tracked by officers       of the Central African Republic gendarmerie who were in close       communication with Russian nationals tied to the Wagner       Group, including Valery Zakharov and Alexander Sotov;        Whereas associates of Yevgeniy Prigozhin were reported to       discuss plans to set up camps ``for combat prep and training       in sabotage'' with the goal of stoking racial violence and       carrying out domestic terror attacks in the United States in       the run-up to the November 3, 2020, presidential election;        Whereas associates of Yevgeniy Prigozhin have set up online       influence operations based in Ghana and Nigeria to target       social media audiences in the United States with the goal of       inflaming racial tensions and provoking social unrest in the       run-up to the November 3, 2020, presidential election;        Whereas, on December 20, 2016, the Department of the       Treasury designated Yevgeniy Prigozhin under Executive Order       13661, ``Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing       to the Situation in Ukraine'', for having ``materially       assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or       technological support for, or goods or services in support       of, senior officials of the Russian Federation'';        Whereas, on June 20, 2017, the Department of the Treasury       designated the Wagner Group under Executive Order 13660,       ``Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the       Situation in Ukraine'', for being ``responsible for or       complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly,       actions or policies that threaten the peace, security,       stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of       Ukraine'';        Whereas, on March 15, 2018, the Department of the Treasury       designated Yevgeniy Prigozhin, his affiliated entities,       including the Internet Research Agency, and his subordinates       under Executive Order 13694, ``Blocking the Property of       Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-      Enabled Activities,'' for being ``involved in interfering       with [U.S.] election processes or institutions'';        Whereas on July 15, 2020, under Executive Orders 13848,       13694 (as amended), and 13661, the Department of the Treasury       designated entities located in Sudan, Hong Kong, and Thailand       that have enabled Yevgeniy Prigozhin's ability to evade       United States sanctions as well as Prigozhin-linked entities       that have attempted to suppress and discredit protestors       seeking reforms in Sudan;        Whereas, on September 23, 2020, pursuant to Executive       Orders 13848, 13694 (as amended), and 13661, the Department       of the Treasury designated a network of entities and       individuals working on behalf of Yevgeniy Prigozhin seeking       to advance Russia's influence in the Central African       Republic;        Whereas, on October 15, 2020, the European Union sanctioned       Yevgeniy Prigozhin for engaging in ``and providing support       for Wagner Group's activities in Libya, which threaten the       country's peace, stability and security''; and        Whereas current and former Administration officials have       affirmed that the malign activities of Yevgeniy Prigozhin       around the world pose a significant threat to United States       national security interests: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns any and all attempts by the Government of the       Russian Federation and associated actors to influence the       domestic politics of other countries and sow division among       their peoples, particularly the United States and its allies       and partners;  [[Page H6084]]         (2) condemns the activities of Russian national Yevgeniy       Prigozhin and his affiliated entities that pose a threat to       the democratic values, democratic institutions, and security       of the United States and its allies and partners;        (3) urges countries and entities engaging with Yevgeniy       Prigozhin and his affiliated entities in business or advisory       capacities to cease these engagements;        (4) supports the additional designations made by the       Department of the Treasury on September 23, 2020, and by the       European Union on October 15, 2020, and calls on the United       States Government and the European Union to continue to       target the ability of Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his affiliated       entities to conduct operations globally and to interfere in       the democratic processes of the United States and its allies       and partners; and        (5) calls for close coordination between the United States       Government and the governments of United States allies and       partners to ensure that sanctions regimes against Yevgeniy       Prigozhin and his affiliated entities are enforced and       coordinated.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 996.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for joining me to introduce this measure condemning one of the  principal architects of Russian aggression around the world. Yevgeniy  Prigozhin is one of Vladimir Putin's key cronies, with a long history  of working against American interests on behalf of the Russian  Government. His Internet Research Agency disinformation campaigns have  worked to sow division and undermine democratic elections right here at  home and also among our allies.   Yevgeniy Prigozhin is also the leader of the Wagner Group, a Russian  mercenary organization, that has spread deadly conflict across the  globe, engaging in violent and subversive operations in Ukraine, Syria,  Libya, and sub-Saharan Africa. He has directed human rights violations  in Syria, undermined U.S. operations in the Middle East, and played a  key role in invading and destabilizing Ukraine.   We must hold Prigozhin accountable and take action to stop his  nefarious activities. This resolution condemns Prigozhin and his  Kremlin partners, expresses strong support for the U.S. and European  Union sanctions on him, which were announced this fall, and calls for  the imposition of additional targeted sanctions.   As Putin and his henchmen, like Prigozhin, continue their attacks on  democracies across the world, Congress must send a strong, unified  message that we will not tolerate their destabilizing actions and that  we are ready to hold them accountable. Passing this resolution does  just that.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure, urge all my colleagues  to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, Yevgeniy Prigozhin is an enemy of democracy and an  adversary of the U.S. and our allies.   From sowing discord and division through disinformation campaigns to  stoking violent conflicts around the world, Prigozhin is a dangerous  Putin crony.   This bipartisan measure condemns Prigozhin's nefarious activities and  demonstrates Congress' support for continued cooperation between the  United States and our European allies to hold him and his Kremlin  partners accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting its  passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 958) condemning the practice of politically  motivated imprisonment and calling for the immediate release of  political prisoners in the Russian Federation and urging action by the  United States Government to impose sanctions with respect to persons  responsible for that form of human rights abuse, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 958         Whereas the right to liberty and security of a person and       the protection from arbitrary imprisonment are among the       principal human rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article       23 of the Concluding Document of the Vienna Meeting of the       Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and Article       5 of the European Convention on Human Rights;        Whereas the Russian Federation, as member of the United       Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in       Europe (OSCE), and the Council of Europe, is bound by       international commitments with regard to human rights and the       rule of law;  [[Page H6085]]         Whereas, on October 3, 2012, the Parliamentary Assembly of       the Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1900 (2012) which       defined anyone whose ``detention has been imposed in       violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the       European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocols'' and       ``is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and       . . . appears to be connected with political motives of the       authorities'' as a political prisoner;        Whereas based on the criteria of the Parliamentary Assembly       of the Council of Europe Resolution 1900 (2012), the Memorial       Human Rights Center, a Russian nongovernmental organization,       estimates that there are currently more than 300 political       prisoners in the Russian Federation, a six-fold increase       since 2015;        Whereas the Memorial Human Rights Center list of Russian       political prisoners includes journalists, civil society       activists, human rights advocates, participants of peaceful       organizations, and Ukrainian citizens from illegally annexed       Crimea;        Whereas the Russian Federation's longest-detained political       prisoner, Alexey Pichugin, has been incarcerated since June       19, 2003, in violation of two rulings by the European Court       of Human Rights and the opinion by the United Nations Working       Group on Arbitrary Detention;        Whereas investigative journalist and former editor of the       independent newspaper Noviye Kolyosa, Igor Rudnikov was held       in pretrial detention from November 1, 2017, until June 17,       2019, on alleged extortion charges, which were later dropped       by the court;        Whereas Igor Rudnikov's detention and charges were       criticized by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media       and Reporters without Borders, calling them ``clearly       trumped-up'' and ``an act of political revenge'',       respectively;        Whereas opposition activist Konstantin Kotov was sentenced       to 1.5 years imprisonment on April 20, 2020, for       participating in peaceful demonstrations, in a ruling Amnesty       International has described as ``a profound injustice'';        Whereas Anastasia Shevchenko, an activist in the Open       Russia movement, has been held under house arrest since       January 23, 2019, on the charge of belonging to an       ``undesirable'' organization and has been designated by       Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience;        Whereas Yuri Dmitriev, a leader of Memorial Society's       branch in the Republic of Karelia region of the Russian       Federation who has worked to document mass burial sites from       Stalin-era executions, has been held in detention since June       28, 2018, on charges of child pornography that Human Rights       Watch has described as ``bogus'' and part of an ongoing       ``smear campaign'', and was sentenced to 13 years in prison       on September 29, 2020;        Whereas Dennis Christensen, a Jehovah's Witness and a       Danish citizen, was sentenced to 6 years' imprisonment on       February 6, 2019, in a decision condemned by the United       States Commission on International Religious Freedom as part       of the broader pattern of the Russian Government ``engaging       in or tolerating severe violations of religious freedom'';        Whereas, on February 10, 2020, 7 activists from Russia's       Penza Oblast were sentenced to terms of 6 to 18 years for       alleged membership in a terrorist group following a detention       marked by torture, ill-treatment to extract confessions, and       periods held incommunicado;        Whereas Human Rights Watch described the case as an example       of the Russian authorities ``abusing counterterrorism laws to       silence critics and deny fundamental human rights'';        Whereas, on August 6, 2020, a court in Moscow sentenced       seven activists to between four years suspended and sevem       years in prison for participating in an alleged extremist       organization, ``The New Greatness'', after an investigation       marked by the use of provocateurs, torture, ill-treatment,       and forced confessions, in what the Memorial Human Rights       Center and the Moscow Helsinki Group have described as a       ``politically motivated case'' aimed at ``suppressing the       freedom of expression'';        Whereas, on June 18, 2019, the Department of State affirmed       that ``the United States is deeply concerned by the growing       number of individuals . . . identified by credible human       rights organizations as political and religious prisoners       held by the Government of the Russian Federation'' and called       on the Government of the Russian Federation ``to release all       those identified as political or religious prisoners       immediately and cease its use of the legal system to suppress       dissent and peaceful religious practice'';        Whereas, on January 28, 2020, 43 parliamentarians from 16       European countries introduced a Resolution in the       Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to appoint a       rapporteur ``to examine the growing crisis with politically       motivated imprisonments in the Russian Federation''; and        Whereas, on June 29, 2020, the Parliamentary Assembly of       the Council of Europe's Legal Affairs Committee appointed       Icelandic lawmaker Thorhildur Sunna Aevarsdottir to serve as       the rapporteur on political prisoners in Russia: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the practice of politically motivated       imprisonment in the Russian Federation that violates the       country's international obligations on human rights and the       rule of law and expresses its solidarity with all those       unjustly imprisoned in the Russian Federation;        (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       immediately release individuals designated by the Memorial       Human Rights Center as political prisoners under the criteria       of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe       Resolution 1900 (2012), including Alexey Pichugin, Konstantin       Kotov, Anastasia Shevchenko, Yuri Dmitriev, and Dennis       Christensen;        (3) urges the United States Government, in all its       interactions with the Government of the Russian Federation,       to raise individual cases of Russian political prisoners and       advocate for their release; and        (4) calls on the Secretary of State and the Secretary of       the Treasury to use their authority under the Sergei       Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of       Public Law 112-208), the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law       114-328), and other applicable United States statutory       authorities to designate officials of the Government of the       Russian Federation who are responsible for human rights       abuses in the form of politically motivated imprisonment.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 958.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 958, which condemns  politically motivated imprisonment by the Russian Government and calls  for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Russia.   According to the Memorial Human Rights Center, there are more than  300 political prisoners in Russia today. These prisoners are human  rights advocates, journalists, Ukrainians from Crimea, and American  citizens like Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed.   It has been common practice for the Kremlin to target opposition  figures as an act of political revenge. Russian authorities regularly  abuse counterterrorism laws and Interpol's Red Notice system to silence  critics and deny them fundamental human rights.   We must not only condemn these abuses, but we must increase the  economic and political cost for Russian officials who engage in unjust  imprisonments and political retaliation.   This resolution calls on the Departments of State and Treasury to use  the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and the  Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to pursue Russia  officials who are responsible for or complicit in politically motivated  imprisonment. I remember in 2012, we all worked together to put this  very important law on the books.   No one deserves to be used as a political pawn by Vladimir Putin. It  is critical that Congress strongly condemns and takes action against  Russia's wrongful imprisonments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend, the ranking member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. It has been a pleasure  working closely with him on so many pieces of legislation. I know that  the work will continue, and we will continue to keep in touch and make  sure that we go the right way in trying to stop these human rights  abuses all over the world.   The number of political prisoners in Russia has increased by sixfold  since the year 2015. This is what we have come to expect from Vladimir  Putin's Russia: Blatant disregard for human rights and rule of law.   The United States must stand firm against Russia's practice of  politically motivated imprisonment and impose sanctions against anyone  responsible for these human rights abuses. It is really important that  the U.S. Congress stand up and do this. It is really important that we  do it, regardless of political party.   It is really important to send Putin a message that we are not going  to sit idly by and allow him to do his bad work. He has interfered with  our elections. He has tried again. He succeeded some of the time; he  didn't succeed in other times. But we want him to stay away, and we  want the people of Russia to have a government where they can feel  free, not one where they feel the boot on their neck all the time.   We need to stand firm against Russia's practice of politically  motivated imprisonment and impose sanctions against anyone, even Putin,  responsible for these human rights abuses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H. Res. 958, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 17) expressing concern over the detention of Austin  Tice, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 17         Whereas Austin Tice is a 39-year-old veteran, having served       in the Marine Corps as an infantry officer, a Georgetown law       student, and a graduate of Georgetown University, from       Houston, Texas;        Whereas Austin is an Eagle Scout, National Merit       Scholarship finalist, and eldest of seven children;        Whereas Austin was a contributing freelance journalist to       McClatchy Newspapers, the Washington Post and other media       outlets, and a recipient of the 2012 George Polk Award for       War Reporting;        Whereas, in May 2012, Austin crossed the Turkey-Syria       border to report on the intensifying conflict in Syria;        Whereas, on August 11, 2012, Austin celebrated his 31st       birthday in Darayaa, Syria;        Whereas, on August 14, 2012, Austin departed for Beirut,       Lebanon, was detained at a checkpoint near Damascus, Syria,       and contact with family, friends, and colleagues ceased;        Whereas, in late September 2012, a video clip appeared on       YouTube showing Austin blindfolded and being prodded up a       hillside by masked militants;        Whereas in the years since Austin's disappearance, no group       has claimed responsibility for his capture;        Whereas the Syrian government has never acknowledged       detaining Austin and has denied the same to Austin's parents;        Whereas officials of the United States believe Austin is       alive and being held in Syria and that the Syrian government       should assist in locating and returning Austin to his family;        Whereas Austin Tice's parents, Marc and Debra Tice, have       been diligent in their efforts to find their son, repeatedly       meeting  [[Page H6087]]       with senior officials of the United States Government, the       Syrian government, the United Nations, and many others;        Whereas the Tices have traveled to the Middle East multiple       times, most recently in December 2018, seeking Austin's safe       release, and Debra Tice spent four months living in Damascus,       Syria, for the same purpose;        Whereas the Tices have partnered with Reporters Without       Borders to launch campaigns with nearly 270 newspapers and       media organizations, highlighting Austin's case in their       publications and on their websites;        Whereas institutions and organizations, including       Georgetown University, Georgetown Law Center, the National       Press Club, the Committee to Protect Journalists, McClatchy,       and the Washington Post, have collaborated to raise and       maintain public awareness of Austin's detention;        Whereas, on November 18, 2018, then-United States Special       Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Robert O'Brien, said       that the United States Government believes Austin Tice is       alive;        Whereas at a press briefing on March 19, 2020, President       Trump expressed concern for Austin and called on the Syrian       government to release him;        Whereas Majd Kamalmaz is a 62-year old Syrian-American       psychotherapist, father of four, and resident of Texas;        Whereas Majd is a well-known mental-health professional       with experience in disaster relief and post-traumatic care;        Whereas in February 2017 Majd traveled to Syria to visit an       elderly family member and aid civilians traumatized by the       Syrian civil war;        Whereas on February 16, 2017 Majd's family received word       that he had been detained at a checkpoint on his way to       Ghouta, outside of Damascus, Syria;        Whereas since February 2017 Majd's family has not heard       from him;        Whereas the Syrian government has never publicly       acknowledged detaining Majd;        Whereas Majd's family and the Syrian-American community       have advocated tirelessly for his immediate release;        Whereas in July 2020, United States Ambassador and Special       Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens       publicly stated, ``The U.S. Government is in frequent contact       with the Kamalmaz family to provide support and information''       and that ``Bringing home Majd, along with all U.S. citizens       held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad, has the attention       of the highest levels in the U.S. government.''; and        Whereas, as described in the Caesar Syria Civilian       Protection Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 8791 note), Congress calls       on the regime of Bashar al-Assad to release all political       prisoners forcibly held within its prison system and to allow       access to the same facilities for investigations by       appropriate international human rights organizations: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses its ongoing concern regarding the capture of       Austin Tice in August 2012 and Majd Kamalmaz in February       2017, and their continuing detention;        (2) encourages the Department of State, the intelligence       community, and the interagency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell       to jointly continue investigations and to pursue all possible       information regarding Austin and Majd's detention;        (3) encourages the Department of State and the Special       Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs to engage the Syrian       government to facilitate Austin and Majd's safe release and       return;        (4) encourages the Department of State to work with foreign       governments known to have diplomatic influence with the       Syrian government; and        (5) requests that the Department of State and the       intelligence community continue to work with and inform       Congress and the families of Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz to       the extent possible regarding efforts to secure their safe       release and return from detention in Syria.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 17.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in August 2012, American journalist and Marine veteran  Austin Tice was abducted while reporting on the ongoing conflict in  Syria. Eight years later, Tice continues to be held captive, his family  and friends unaware of his condition and whereabouts.   Five years later, another American citizen, Texas resident and  psychotherapist Majd Kamalmaz, was detained without cause in northern  Syria while visiting an elderly family member and aiding civilians  traumatized by the civil war. Kamalmaz has been imprisoned by the Assad  regime in Syria ever since without access to the outside world.   The Tice and Kamalmaz families have worked tirelessly to secure the  immediate release of their loved ones. Still, Austin and Majd continue  to suffer inside Syria. H. Res. 17 encourages the Department of State,  the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and  other U.S. Government entities to work jointly to facilitate Tice and  Kamalmaz' safe release and return.   This legislation does not legitimize the Assad regime. I would never  do that. For years and years, I have called them out on all of their  human rights violations. It is a brutal regime, murdering men, women,  and children in the hundreds of thousands.   So, this doesn't legitimize the Assad regime, nor does it legitimize  the deplorable tactic of hostage-taking. In fact, it does the opposite.   Passing this resolution is a recognition that our country stands with  Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz and those like them who have been victims  of the Assad regime.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Al Green for introducing this  important legislation. I want to also recognize, once again, our  committee's ranking member,   Michael McCaul, for his leadership on  this issue. I am proud to support this measure, and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                        Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2020.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Committeee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I write concerning H. Res. 17, a       resolution that expresses concern regarding the 2012 capture       and detention in Syria of Austin Tice--a U.S. Citizen,       journalist, and veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps; and       encourages the Executive Branch to take further actions aimed       at bringing about Mr. Tice's immediate and safe return.       Certain provisions in the resolution fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (HPSCI), as set forth in Rule X of the House of       Representatives for the 116th Congress.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. By waiving consideration of H. Res. 17, HPSCI does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subjects       contained in the bill which fall within HPSCI's Rule X       jurisdiction. I also ask that our exchange of letters be       included in the Congressional Record during consideration of       the measure on the House floor.        I continue to be grateful for our committees' longstanding       cooperation, both regarding this matter and others. And I       continue to strongly support this and other efforts to secure       Mr. Tice's immediate and safe return to the United States.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 23, 2020.      Hon. Adam B. Schiff,      House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Schiff: I am writing to you concerning H.       Res. 17, expressing concern over the detention of Austin       Tice, and for other purposes. I appreciate your willingness       to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence under House Rule X, and that your Committee will       forgo action on H. Res. 17 to expedite floor consideration. I       further acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with       respect to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional       claim over the matters contained in the bill that fall within       your jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence conferees       during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green), the author of this important resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green), the author of this important resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   Today's resolution calls for the immediate release of American  citizens Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz, who have been unjustly held in  Syria. It is time the Assad regime heeds our calls and works with the  U.S. Government to secure their return home.   I have been a critic of the Assad regime in all the years I have been  in Congress, which is 32 years. The Assad regime has been brutal with  its own people, has murdered so many of its own people, and I know that  Mr. McCaul will remember not so long ago, on the Foreign Affairs  Committee, someone smuggled in a bunch of photographs that were taken  in Syrian prisons. They were horrific and reminded one of the 1930s and  1940s with the genocide in Europe.   It is time the Assad regime heeds our calls and works with the U.S.  Government to secure the prisoners' release home. The immediate release  of American citizens Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz is very important to  us.   As you have heard, they have been unjustly held in Syria, and we are  not going to let it go. We are not going to stop until they are  released. It is the right thing to do, and it is the only thing that we  can do.   I again thank Congressman Green for introducing this bipartisan  resolution. I thank Mr. McCaul for working with us on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1115) calling for the immediate release of Trevor  Reed, a United States citizen who was unjustly sentenced to 9 years in  a Russian prison, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1115         Whereas United States citizen Trevor Reed is a resident of       Granbury, Texas, and a United States Marine Corps veteran;        Whereas Trevor Reed traveled to Moscow to visit his       girlfriend on May 16, 2019;        Whereas Moscow's Police Service detained Trevor Reed on       August 16, 2019;        Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grabbing the arm of the       police officer driving the vehicle and elbowing another       officer while en route to the police station, causing the       vehicle to swerve and therefore endangering the lives of the       police officers;        Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed       numerous diplomatic complaints with the Russian Foreign       Ministry regarding Trevor Reed being denied consular access,       communications, medical treatment, family visitations, and       other violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular       Relations;        Whereas Trevor Reed's defense team presented video evidence       from traffic camera footage to the courts that disproves the       police officers' statements of supposed endangerment and       wrongdoing;        Whereas Trevor Reed's defense team was denied access to       additional video evidence from the police vehicle and police       station that had the potential to prove his innocence;        Whereas the police officers claimed emotional and physical       damages, but did not sustain any visible injury, or claim any       time missed from work;        Whereas the Constitutional Supreme Court of the Russian       Federation and the Second Court of Cassation of General       Jurisdiction concurred that Russian procedural law was       violated in the way that Trevor Reed's bail was revoked;        Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed       complaints with the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding denial       of communications with Trevor Reed;        Whereas during the trial, the defense counsel presented 59       minutes of traffic camera video that showed the police car--        (1) did not change direction or leave its lane;        (2) did not swerve; and        (3) did not stop or slow down;        Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky District Court Judge       Arnout read a verdict that dismissed all defense evidence,       witnesses, and government experts and included information       from the investigator's case files that were not discussed or       read into the court files;        Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed to 9 years in       prison camp and was ordered to pay 100,000 rubles to each       police officer for moral and physical injuries;        Whereas Trevor Reed had already been detained in Russia for       1 year at the time of the judge's verdict; and        Whereas, the United States Ambassador to Russia, John       Sullivan, upon Trevor's sentencing, stated that the       prosecution's case and the evidence presented against Mr.       Reed were ``so preposterous that they provoked laughter in       the courtroom'', the conviction and sentence were       ``ridiculous'', and ``justice was not even considered'': Now,       therefore, be it--        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses support for Trevor Reed, Paul Whelan, and all       prisoners unjustly imprisoned in the Russian Federation;        (2) condemns the practice of politically motivated       imprisonment in the Russian Federation, which violates the       commitments of the Russian Federation to international       obligations with respect to human rights and the rule of law;        (3) urges the United States Government, in all its       interactions with the Government of the Russian Federation,       to raise the case of Trevor Reed and to press for his       release;        (4) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       immediately release Trevor Reed and all other prisoners       arrested for political motivations;        (5) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       provide unrestricted consular access to Trevor Reed while he       remains in detention as required under the Vienna Convention       on Consular Relations;        (6) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation--        (A) to provide Trevor Reed any necessary medical treatment       and personal protective equipment;        (B) to notify the United States Embassy in Moscow of any       medical problems or complaints that arise during his       detention; and        (C) to provide the United States Embassy in Moscow with       full access to all of Trevor Reed's medical records;        (7) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       respect Trevor Reed's universally recognized human rights;       and        (8) expresses support to the family of Trevor Reed and       commitment to bringing Trevor Reed home.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 1115.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1115, calling for  the immediate release of Trevor Reed.   I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Conaway, for introducing this  bipartisan resolution.   In 2019, U.S. citizen and former Marine Trevor Reed traveled to  Russia. While on his trip, Moscow's Police Service detained and held  Reed for over a year. On July 30, 2020, Reed was convicted of trumped- up assault charges and sentenced to 9 years in a Russian prison camp.   During his sham of a trial, Mr. Speaker, traffic camera footage  disproved the charges, and even the Russian judge laughed at the  prosecution's absurd attempts to provide evidence. Despite this, Trevor  Reed's defense team was denied access to additional video footage from  the police vehicle and station that could have provided further proof  of his innocence.   While it is no surprise that Putin and his cronies didn't conduct a  fair trial, it is appalling that Trevor is being held without medical  treatment during a global pandemic and being denied consular access and  communication with his family.   H. Res. 1115 not only calls for the immediate release of Trevor, but  expresses support for all unjustly detained prisoners in Russia and  urges U.S. officials to raise Trevor's case during all interactions  with the Russian Government. The resolution also demands that Russia  provide the regular consular access and proper medical care afforded to  Trevor through the Vienna Convention.   Again, I thank Mr. Conaway for his commitment to bringing Trevor, a  fellow Texan, home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. Conaway for his work on this  bipartisan measure that calls on the Russian Government to drop the  trumped-up charges against Trevor Reed and immediately release him from  prison.   Trevor and all those unjustly detained in Russia deserve to be  released and safely reunited with their families for this holiday  season.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this measure and I urge all  Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, let me comment on my friend's remarks. It has been a  pleasure for me to work with Mr. McCaul as the ranking member of the  committee and when he was the chairman. We have done incredible work on  our committee, both Democrats and Republicans, working together in a  bipartisan way. I am very proud of the work we have all done and very  proud of the work I have done personally with Mr. McCaul. I know we are  going to continue to fight the good fight, because we stand for  something. We are so blessed to live in this country, and we want to  make sure that other people get the same kinds of freedoms that we  have.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I support this measure, and I urge all Members to  do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.
