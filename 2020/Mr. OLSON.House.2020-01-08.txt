 Mr. Speaker, every time I come home from Washington, D.C.,  I am welcomed by the sight of Clements High School.   Clements High School has a marquee on the corner of Sweetwater and  Elkins that tells information about their school. That marquee was  heartbreaking for the Ranger Nation this past week. One of our icons,  tennis coach John Furlow, ``Mr. Clements,'' put on angel wings and flew  to Heaven last Thursday.   Coach Furlow was our coach since 1983. He wasn't just content with  winning titles. He wanted each of his players to win with class,  dignity, and respect the Furlow way.   His players loved him. They loved the fact that coach always had warm  Shipley Do-Nuts for that bus ride at 6 a.m. before dawn for a Saturday  meet. When they were coming home, they had to stop at Whataburger.   Coach, thank you for the Shipleys, the Whataburger, and for your  love. All of us are better off because of you. I  [[Page H53]]  will close with your final statement: ``Once a Ranger, always a  Ranger.''                            ____________________
