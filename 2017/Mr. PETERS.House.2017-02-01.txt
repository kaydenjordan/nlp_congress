 I thank Mr. O'Rourke for putting together this Special  Order to talk about what is really an important issue and, with all of  the things going on, something that has even got a little bit lost.   Madam Speaker, for the region that I represent in San Diego, the  border is an economic engine--it is a job creator. Home to the Otay  Mesa, San Ysidro, and Tecate ports of entry, San Diego-Baja is the  busiest border crossing in the world. From life sciences to  electronics, San Diego is an attractive place to start a business and  to manufacture goods, in part, because of our proximity to border  crossings and international trade.   Last month, Mr. O'Rourke and other members of the Congressional  Border Caucus and I held a hearing with local leaders from chambers of  commerce from around our districts to discuss real pragmatic solutions  and issues around the border. I was joined by Jerry Sanders, who San  Diegans well know as the former mayor. He is also the former police  chief of San Diego and is now the current president of the San Diego  Regional Chamber of Commerce. During that hearing, Mayor Sanders said  that an efficient border is a safe border, and he knows something about  safety from his time as a police chief. We also know that 99 percent of  what gets screened at border crossings is safe and that there is no  need to worry about its coming into the country. What we need is to get  more efficient at approving the 99 percent of safe cargo and travelers  and better at stopping the 1 percent that we don't want to come in.   One of the big challenges that we faced when I first came to Congress  was in border delays. We saw that delays at the border crossing were  costing us, at that point, $7.2 billion of economic activity in our  county and 35,000 jobs annually--numbers so big that they are almost  unbelievable, but those numbers came from independent assessments.   One of the great successes I have had in Congress, in working with my  colleagues within our congressional delegation, is to have worked  together to secure more than $500 million to finish the expansion and  the improvements at the San Ysidro border crossing. We did that in  working with Democrats Juan Vargas and Susan Davis and with Republicans  Duncan Hunter and Darrell Issa because we all understood how important  the United States-Mexico border is to our regional economy.    By investing in infrastructure and innovation in San Diego, Tijuana,  and across the border, we are keeping Americans safe and supporting the  export of goods made in America by American workers. In San Diego and  in other communities, we are embracing this forward-looking approach of  opportunity and job creation.   Now President Trump wants to put us in reverse by building a wall,  which we have assessed at $15 billion. I mean, I have heard estimates  of its being from $18 billion to $20 billion. By any count, it is a  waste of money. Let's say, for purposes of argument, it is $15 billion.  It took Congress more than a year to approve $170 million to help  Flint, Michigan, recover from a crisis that has poisoned children and  left an entire city without clean water--$170 million compared to $15  billion for a wall that nobody needs. We are talking about spending 100  times the money for Flint to build a wall that will do nothing to make  us more secure, to make our children safer, or to make us more  prosperous.   $15 billion is exactly how much the American Society of Civil  Engineers says we will need to fill the funding gap for infrastructure  needs at all of our Nation's ports for the next decade. So, if you took  the money you were going to spend on this wall, you could cover all of  the investment we would need at our ports around the country for the  next decade. We are going to spend it on a wall.   $15 billion is also three times as much money as the Federal  Government spends to help the homeless every year. For the cost of this  wall, we could build the Navy the 11th aircraft carrier that it needs.  For 60 times less--or 1-60th--we could finish the modernization of the  Otay Mesa border crossing, which is the third busiest commercial port  of entry along our southern border and which facilitates $35 billion in  trade every year.   What are we doing here?   Unlike President Trump's wall, this investment will support long-term  job creation and increase revenues and is a much more responsible way  to spend American taxpayer dollars. Let's be clear. American taxpayers  are going to foot the bill for this wall, not Mexico. It is the leader  of the Senate and Speaker Ryan who have committed they are going to  spend $15 billion on this wall. That is American taxpayers. That is not  Mexico.   Instead of trying to turn his campaign rhetoric into policy, we would  prefer that President Trump listen to those who understand what  business is like at the border, to those who understand that border  cities are safe, like El Paso, like San Diego, and that the border is  an opportunity for America, not a threat. We don't need a wall. We need  to hire more Customs officers. We need newer screening technologies. We  need to modernize and expand our infrastructure at other border  crossings like we are already doing at San Ysidro. That is how you  would create jobs in America. That is how you would keep us safe.   I thank my friend Beto O'Rourke for his leadership and for his  hosting this conversation today. I look forward to working with the  gentleman in diverting this money from this silly proposal--this  dangerous proposal--to the kinds of things and investments that our  country needs from Texas to California.   Mr. O'ROURKE. I thank the gentleman from California for sharing his  community's perspective and for reminding us that, when it comes to  Mexico and our shared connection with Mexico--the U.S.-Mexico border-- we have much more to look forward to than we do to fear.   In fact, in the State of California, there are hundreds of thousands  of jobs that depend on U.S.-Mexico trade. In the State of Texas, it is  just under a half a million. In fact, every single State in the Union,  including Alaska, has tens--if not hundreds--of thousands of jobs that  depend on the flow of U.S.-Mexico trade, which happens at our ports of  entry and comes through at our border. There are 6 million jobs in this  country, which represent hundreds of millions of dollars in salaries  and economic growth and add-on effects, that are dependent on U.S.- Mexico trade. When we begin to prioritize  [[Page H863]]  our separation, in sealing Mexico off from the United States literally  physically, we deprioritize those connections that make us stronger,  that grow our economy, and that create more jobs in the United States.   One thing that we should know, as long as we are talking about  sharing facts and confronting some of these unfortunate, untrue myths  about the border, is that, when we export to Mexico, of course, we  win--we are building things in our factories; we are sending them to  Mexico; the Mexican consumer buys them; those dollars are flowing back  to the U.S. worker. It also happens that, when we import from Mexico,  we win as 40 cents of every dollar of value that we import from Mexico  originates in the United States. Literally, factory floor jobs in Ohio,  in Iowa, in Michigan are producing things that go to Mexico and that  are part of the final assembly that is reimported to the United States.   We certainly make things in America today, but we make a lot of  things in the United States and in Mexico concurrently. Our economies,  our production platform--our future--is inextricably connected, and to  try to break that apart is not simply going to hurt Mexico. It is going  to hurt the United States. It is going to hurt the U.S. worker. It is  going to hurt our economy. It is going to hurt our opportunity at  growth.    If we continue to cast Mexico as the enemy, if we threaten trade wars  or to pull out of free trade agreements, if we construct a wall to try  to humiliate that country at a time that it poses no security threat to  the United States, the consequences are not going to be good. You may  remember that I reminded you that migration from Mexico over the last 4  years is less than zero. More Mexicans are going south than are coming  north to the United States. If you build a wall, withdraw from our  trade agreements, try to de-link our economies, where you do not have a  security or an economic problem today, you will in the future have one.  You will give people in Mexico a reason to flee that country and to  seek opportunity and jobs and connections and safety and shelter  somewhere else, and that somewhere else, in many cases, is, in fact,  going to be the United States.   If we want to make this country safer, if we want to make this  country more prosperous, if we want to protect the American worker,  then the policies that this President has adopted in the first 10 days  in office are precisely the wrong way to go about doing it. They will  make us less secure; they will slow down this country's economy; they  will jeopardize the 6 million jobs that depend on U.S.-Mexico trade.   If the U.S.-Mexico border is as secure as it has ever been--look at  any metric, and you will see that I am right--if we are having record  low levels of northbound migration and apprehensions, if we are  spending record amounts, if we are using new technologies, like drones,  to patrol the border, if we have 20,000 Border Patrol agents, which is  also a record high, why is there so much concern, why is there so much  interest, why is there so much anxiety, why is there so much fear built  up around the border?                                time  1730    I will tell you, this is a long time in coming. And when we say that  there are real issues with where these border measures are coming from,  let me give you an example of some of those.   One of our colleagues, when describing young Mexican immigrants  coming to this country, said: Look at them. They have calves the size  of cantaloupes. They are bringing drugs into this country.   When you have a Presidential candidate dismiss Mexican immigrants as  rapists and criminals, despite the fact that immigrants commit crimes  in this country at a much lower level than native-born U.S. citizens,  when you have this kind of rhetoric, when you have this kind of  mischaracterization, when you have this kind of vilification of an  entire people and their connection to us at the U.S.-Mexico border,  then you be the judge of where these priorities are coming from and  what they are about and why they in no way reflect the real concerns,  threats, and issues that we have in this country today.   My colleagues, the fact of the matter is Mexico presents opportunity  to the United States and it always has. Whether it is the $90 billion  in U.S.-Mexico trade that passed through just the points of entry in El  Paso, the city I have the honor of serving in Congress, and Ciudad  Juarez, the city with which it is connected, whether it is the 6  million jobs that we already have in the United States economy, whether  it is our security cooperation to ensure that we are disrupting  transnational criminal organizations that are trying to move drugs and  human chattel into this country, whether it is our work to address the  real security issues in the northern triangle countries of Central  America that border Mexico, we will lose a very valuable partner. We  will lose those things that we want most: job growth, economic  development, security for the people that we represent.   When we begin to humiliate that country and its leadership--and  President Pena Nieto has canceled a trip to visit the United States in  just 1 week of this administration--nothing good will follow that.   We cannot wall Mexico off from the United States. We cannot wish them  to disappear. They will always be there, and they should always be  there. And we should be grateful that they will always be there because  they have always been a part of our history, our success, those things  that are best about the United States; and, God willing, they will  always be part of our future.   I think it is going to take each and every one of us--every  Republican, every Democrat, every person who doesn't feel affiliation  to a party--to stand together behind and with the facts, with the  truth, with this country's best interests in mind. I am confident that  if we do that, if we will simply look at what is happening today, what  has happened historically with that country, where our interests lie,  we will make better policy. We will not be constructing walls between  the two countries.   We will, at some point--hopefully, sooner rather than later--tear  down the 600 miles of fencing that already separates us. We will build  more bridges that connect us, not just for trade, not just for economic  growth, but for the reasons that the people I represent are so grateful  for and proud of, the place that they call home, a city that, with  Ciudad Juarez, forms the largest binational community in the world,  where last year alone 32 million times people from El Paso and Juarez  crossed into each other's cities.   Our families are on both sides of the border. Our business partners  are on both sides of the border. Students at the University of Texas at  El Paso, who live in Ciudad Juarez and are Mexican nationals, are  granted instate tuition because we want to attract the very best and  the very brightest. And we are going to find them all over the world-- in the United States, certainly, but also in Mexico.   I want to read to you a comment that a constituent of mine posted on  our Facebook page this evening when I let my constituents know I would  be on the floor talking about the border, asking them to share the  truth and the reality, their perspective versus the myth that we hear  so often here in Congress, on national TV, and from those who don't  live on or understand the border.   Lisa Esparza said:         The border has been great because I grew up in Ciudad       Juarez. I came to El Paso, paid for an education at a private       school, learned English. I love the fact that I am       binational, and I can think and speak in two languages.    Lisa and millions of fronteriza and fronterizo border residents  exemplify the best of this country, literally, of what makes America  great.   El Paso, for those of you who do not know, has, for more than a  century, served as the Ellis Island of the Western Hemisphere. If you  came up from Mexico or your family did--or El Salvador or Guatemala or  Honduras or Costa Rica or Argentina--there is a good chance that you  came through the ports of entry in El Paso, Texas; that your family may  have, before they went on to a destination further in the United  States, settled in Segundo Barrio or in Chihuahuita. This is a  community where they learned our laws, our values, where they learned  to speak English, where they went to school, where they not just  participated and believed in the American Dream, but became net  contributors to it. It is one of the reasons that El Paso,  [[Page H864]]  Texas, is the safest city in the United States.   It is the safest city not in spite of the large number of immigrants  who live in my community--and, by official counts, 24 percent of the  people that I represent were born in another country. It is not in  spite of those people who were born in another country that El Paso is  so safe. It is, in large part, because of their presence.   Families made extraordinarily difficult decisions to leave their home  country--their home city, their families, the language they knew, the  customs that they loved--to come to a new country. They make sure that  they follow our laws. They make sure that their kids follow our laws.  They make sure that their kids are doing the right thing by this  country so that they can get ahead, have an opportunity and a crack at  the American Dream. Not only is there nothing wrong with that, there is  something profoundly great about that. It is what has helped make El  Paso the safest city, a wonderful city in America, a great country.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan  Grisham), someone else who understands the value of our relationship  with Mexico, the special character of border people, and the value of  immigration and immigrants.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, the people  who, in fact, know the border issues the best--whether it is companies  or lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, border communities, trade  groups, economists, and law enforcement officials--all agree that  building a wall is unnecessary, impractical, ineffective, and it is a  complete waste of time and taxpayer money.   This wall, in fact, damages New Mexico's economy, and that is without  taking into account President Trump's idea to now impose a 20 percent  tax on Mexican imports to pay for it. In the end, we know that it is  American jobs, American consumers, and American companies that will be  hurt.   Given that the United States already maintains approximately 650  miles of border fence, drones, cameras, motion detectors, thermal  imaging sensors, ground sensors, and 21,370 Border Patrol agents, the  wall is completely unnecessary for the stakeholders who are, in fact,  most impacted. The only person it truly benefits is President Trump by  furthering his isolationist, divisive, and anti-immigrant agenda.   I agree that this country should be building, and I agree with my  colleague from El Paso, Mr. O'Rourke, that there is a wonderful thing,  an incredible thing about building bridges, building highways, building  buildings, and refocusing our energy on making sure that everyone has a  fair shot and that we are looking at those economic values and those  economic indicators. That is not what we are doing here. We are  diverting our attention for an unnecessary, huge, colossal mistake that  hurts the progress that border communities and border States have made.   Mr. O'ROURKE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) for bringing her State's experience and  perspective to bear on this issue and for being a champion for the best  in our traditions and our values.   I would like to build on the gentlewoman's remarks and talk about one  of the consequences of building walls. I have already made the case  that the border is as secure as it has ever been. Those who study and  understand security issues have come to the conclusion that extra miles  of wall don't deter migrants.   The lower levels of migration that we have seen to this country have  a lot more to do with the U.S. economy and its struggling performance  in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession and throughout that  road to recovery and, relatively speaking, the performance in other  countries, including Mexico, that has afforded Mexican nationals more  opportunity to stay there.   The border is as secure as it has ever been. We have recently doubled  the size of the Border Patrol. We are using the latest and greatest  technology to remain as vigilant as possible, which we should.   It is also important to know the character and quality of the Border  Patrol agents and Customs and Border Protection officers who man the  line, who are at our ports, and who have one of the most difficult,  dangerous jobs that anyone has in the Federal Government. The  conditions in which they work, the situations which they must  anticipate, the constant vigilance that they must maintain, and the  kind of threats that they have to be aware of--which include drug  smuggling, which is critically important to stop; which include human  smuggling, which we must deter and stop; and which includes, even  though there has never been a terrorist or terrorist act connected to  the U.S.-Mexican border, includes the possibility that sometime that  might happen--those men and women are literally on the front line  protecting this community.   I would like to see some of the $14 billion to $20 billion proposed  for the construction of a wall put behind our Border Patrol agents to  improve their salaries, their working conditions, and the ability for  them to do their job and to keep us safe.   I would like to hire more Customs and Border Protection officers, the  men and women in blue at our ports of entry who facilitate legitimate  trade and travel at our ports of entry. They are the ones who help to  keep this economy humming while keeping us safer.   Madam Speaker, one of the consequences, though, of building walls,  while it doesn't make us safer and while it uses a lot of resources  that could be better put toward other more legitimate security  challenges, it does do one thing that I want all of us to know about.  It does ensure that migrants coming to this country will unnecessarily  suffer, and many will die.   In the same time where we have gone from 1.6 million apprehensions a  year--that was the year 2000, 1.6 million apprehensions on our southern  border--to last year, when there were just a little over 400,000, so a  quarter of the level that we had 15, 16 years ago, in that same time  that we have had record low levels of migration, we have maintained  record high levels of migrant deaths. So those few migrants who do try  to cross in between our ports of entry and do encounter physical  barriers are going to more remote sections of the border. They are  dying of thirst. They are dying of exposure. These are otherwise  preventable deaths.   So I ask you to think about it this way. Whether you are looking at  the moral dimension of this--the otherwise preventable deaths, the  effort to humiliate our closest partner in the country, of Mexico-- whether you look at the economic dimension of this, if you want to  protect those 6 million jobs that depend on a strong U.S.-Mexico  connection, whether you look at the security dimension and taking our  eye off the ball when it comes to real threats, proven threats that we  have in this country at our international airports, at our  northern border with Canada or increasingly homegrown radicals in the  United States radicalized over the internet, if you want to remove  resources from those real threats, then go ahead and build a wall if it  makes you feel good. But it is going to make us less safe, it is going  to make us less economically secure, and it is going to be to our  lasting shame. It will haunt us, and it will haunt us for generations  for anyone who supports this or does not stand up and speak against it.    I would like to leave you with two anecdotes that I think exemplify  the beauty, the strength, and the safety of the border. The first is a  story of an event that took place this weekend in El Paso and Ciudad  Juarez, where we are joined by the Rio Grande River channel. Right now,  all that water is stored up at the Elephant Butte Reservoir in New  Mexico. Really, there is just a little trickle in the river channel not  more than a couple of inches deep.   Thanks to the Border Network for Human Rights and thanks to the  Border Patrol who allowed this, they were able to organize 300 families  from Mexico and El Paso who were allowed to meet--one family at a  time--in the middle of that river channel, both sides clearly  identified so there would not be any security or immigration issues.                                time  1745    And those families got to spend a total of 3 minutes together,  families who, in some cases, had not seen each other for decades. A  young woman  [[Page H865]]  posted on Facebook that she drove down from Oklahoma City to see her  dad who she had not seen in 10 years.   You had folks meeting grandchildren they had never seen before, sons  or daughters-in-law that they had never seen before, weeping, crying,  laughing, hugging, holding, kissing for 3 minutes.   That, to me, is absolutely beautiful. That, to me, is family values.  That, to me, shows you the extent to which people will try to be  together, to be with each other, to do the things that perhaps you and  I, as U.S. citizens, take for granted. And that happened in El Paso,  Texas, thanks to the Border Network for Human Rights, thanks also to  the men and women in the Border Patrol.   It didn't compromise our security. It didn't add any new immigrants  to this country. It was just doing our best under the current  conditions.   The other anecdote that I would like to share with you, and which I  will close on, involves another outstanding organization in the  community that I have the honor to serve, Annunciation House, led by  Ruben Garcia, who--when we faced unprecedented numbers of young  children and young families, young moms in their teens and twenties,  coming up from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador, which have  become the deadliest countries, not just in Central America, not just  in the Western Hemisphere, but in the world, the deadliest countries in  the world; kids being murdered and raped and sold into slavery.   Those kids fleeing that horrific brutality and violence, coming up  the length of Mexico, sometimes riding on top of a train known as la  bestia, or the beast, to come and present themselves at our border, not  evade detection, not try and escape, not try to do anything against the  law; literally, as the law proscribes, presenting themselves at our  points of entry to a Border Patrol agent, or a Customs and Border  Protection officer, and asking for help and for shelter, depending on  the best traditions inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, counting on the  United States in their moment of need.   Well, the Border Patrol were outstanding. The agents themselves, out  of their own pockets often, were buying toys and gifts for these young  children, taking care of them, having their hearts broken, doing their  best to serve them. Agents who work for ICE and immigration were doing  their best as well.   As that flow of people, the number of people became too many  temporarily for us to hold and to process, they got in touch with Ruben  Garcia at Annunciation House, which is a charity operated in El Paso,  Texas. And Ruben took those asylum seekers, those refugees, and housed  them, clothed them, fed them, insured they had showers and medication  and a visit with a doctor, the ability to talk to their families deeper  in the interior of the United States and, most importantly, especially  for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, had a full and  complete understanding of their legal obligations under U.S. law, what  they were allowed and not allowed to do, what their court expectations  were, and that they must appear in court, and that their issue must be  adjudicated, and that they may or may not be able to stay in this  country.   Annunciation House, Ruben Garcia, the volunteers who work for him,  and hundreds of other El Pasoans who contributed did this at not a  penny's cost to the Federal taxpayer or to our government.   So $20 billion to build a wall or Annunciation House taking care of  refugees, asylum seekers, little kids who need our help for free?   That is the border. That is the best of us. That is the best of this  country. That is what we need to think about. Those are the folks we  need to listen to. Those are the facts we need to understand before we  even contemplate building a wall, separating ourselves from Mexico,  giving in to the nativist sentiment and instinct that was so proudly on  display during this Presidential election.   I think if we look at the facts, if we take the best from the border,  we are going to get the best policy and the best outcome from the  United States.   And after all, isn't that why we were all sent here? Isn't that what  we are supposed to do when our voters sent us here to do the work of  the American people?   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
