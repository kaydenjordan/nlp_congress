Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  4872, the End the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution through  Tuesday that would immediately reopen the government while negotiations  continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parity, reauthorizing  the Children's Health Insurance Program and other critical healthcare  programs, addressing DREAMers, and providing assistance to Americans  impacted by natural disasters.
