 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3670) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to ensure  access to appropriate temporary shelter, food, and water for  individuals apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3670         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Short-Term Detention       Standards Act''.       SEC. 2. ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TEMPORARY SHELTER, FOOD, AND                     WATER DURING SHORT-TERM DETENTION.         Paragraph (1) of section 411(m) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211(m)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(1) Access to appropriate temporary shelter, food, and       water.--The Commissioner shall make every effort to ensure       the provision to an individual apprehended by U.S. Customs       and Border Protection of appropriate temporary shelter with       access to bathroom and shower facilities, water, appropriate       nutrition, hygiene, personal grooming items, and sanitation       needs.''.       SEC. 3. AUDIT AND INSPECTIONS OF DETENTION FACILITIES.         (a) OIG and GAO.--The Inspector General of the Department       of Homeland Security and the Comptroller General shall carry       out regular audits and inspections, including unannounced       audits and inspections, of processes (including       recordkeeping) utilized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection       to conduct intake and process individuals apprehended by U.S.       Customs and Border Protection. The Inspector General and       Comptroller General shall, to the extent possible, share       information and coordinate to ensure that Congress is       provided timely audit and inspection information.        (b) Congressional Access.--The Commissioner of U.S. Customs       and Border Protection may not--        (1) prevent a Member of Congress or an employee of the       United States House of Representatives or the United States       Senate designated by such a Member for the purposes of this       section from entering, for the purpose of conducting       oversight, any such facility: and        (2) make any temporary modification at any such facility       that in any way alters what is observed by a visiting member       of Congress or such designated employee, compared to what       would be observed in the absence of such modification.        (c) Photographs.--The Inspector General of the Department       of Homeland Security, Comptroller General, a Member of       Congress, or an employee of the United States House of       Representatives or United States Senate shall be authorized       to take photographs or video or audio recordings of       conditions in a facility but may not publish photographs or       video or audio recordings with personally identifiable       information without permission.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3670, the Short-Term  Detention Standards Act.   This legislation is very simple. It requires humane conditions for  migrants detained in short-term detention facilities at our ports of  entry.   This legislation is premised on a very simple idea that defending our  country's security and upholding humanitarian standards are not  mutually exclusive. Anyone who believes that we can have only one or  the other misunderstands America's core values.   Under current law, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 only requires  that migrants in short-term detention have ``adequate access to food  and water.'' But we know from the heart-wrenching images that we have  seen on TV and in news reports, and the findings of the Department of  Homeland Security's own inspector general, that, too often, migrants  are going without basic necessities.   In the last 2 months alone, the DHS inspector general released two  management alerts, detailing poor conditions  [[Page H7437]]  and extreme overcrowding in El Paso and in the Rio Grande Valley of  Texas, where I just visited.   That is why I have introduced this bill, which expands the current  requirement under law so that Customs and Border Protection must also  provide migrants not only food and water but bathroom and shower  facilities, appropriate nutrition, hygiene, personal grooming items,  and sanitation needs.   Based on the reports we have all seen and the outcry from  constituents in my district, I traveled to the southern border last  week in one of the only bipartisan trips to have made it to the border.  What I saw, from beginning to end, was tragedy and misery for every  link in the chain.   It was misery for migrants, who were fearing death and persecution at  home and risked their lives to walk 1,000 miles, often with their  children, in the heat to seek asylum in the United States.   It was misery for the thousands of additional migrants who were just  seeking a better life and to come to work in this country but have no  easy, legal way to do that.   It was misery for the Customs and Border Protection officials and the  Border Patrol officials who were not stood up and set up to do this,  who have been demonized in the press, many of whom are first-generation  Americans, in a situation they were never trained for.   It is misery top to bottom. That misery, for me, turned to anger  because it is because of the inability of Washington to produce  comprehensive immigration reform that that misery is happening.   There is so much more to do to alleviate the crisis at our southern  border. I think all of my bipartisan colleagues, when we traveled to  the border, felt that it was our duty to work on bipartisan legislation  so that we can create a situation where people who we need in this  country can come here legally, people who are seeking asylum can do it  legally, and we do not have to put our customs and border officials in  this kind of stressful situation.   I thank my Republican colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee  who voted unanimously with me on this bill. I believe this is the first  bill on standards at our southern border to be bipartisan. I am very  proud of that. It is a commonsense proposal that I think Democrats,  Republicans, and independents can all support.   To my colleagues who have not yet made up their minds, the standards  outlined in this bill are simply the same standards for our inmates in  our prisons that the Bureau of Prisons upholds. They are the same  standards under the Geneva Convention that any U.S. soldier must uphold  when we take in a prisoner of war.   Those are our bare minimum standards that represent our values, and I  offer they should also be the exact same standards we afford people  coming over our southern border.   The number of migrants coming over our southern border is  overwhelming. It would overwhelm any administration, any political  affiliation, but it does not abrogate our responsibility to maintain  basic humanitarian standards in alignment with our values.   The Department of Homeland Security must do better. From my own trip  last week, I know they want to do better.   As I said, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle who voiced support for this bill and who came on as  cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, help our  country aspire to higher standards, and support H.R. 3670, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address the specific points raised by the  gentleman across the aisle.   The gentleman is correct. This bill is not meant to fix everything.  It doesn't get to the root of the problem.   What it does is establish very basic humanitarian standards similar,  almost exactly, to what we have for our prisoners of war and our  prisoners. That is taken from the Geneva Convention. That is the  international standard, and I want to meet those standards.   In many cases, the men and women of Customs and Border Protection and  Border Patrol are absolutely meeting those standards. I think probably,  at this point, most areas are. So, then, it shouldn't be a problem to  enshrine it in actual law.   I also agree that we have a major problem in our immigration system.  I believe that strongly and even more strongly after I went to the  border this past week, and I look forward to my colleague working with  us on bipartisan immigration reform.   I think this is a minimum standard. It is a humanitarian standard in  line with our values. It is what our law enforcement officers and our  uniform military already have to provide whenever they are in a  position of detention.   I think this isn't difficult if we are already achieving, in most  cases, these standards across the board.   Regarding the complaint that it doesn't solve every problem, it was  never meant to. So let's focus on the bill at hand.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and the spirit with  which they were delivered.   Let me say, as someone who is from Michigan, we depend upon our  Customs and Border Protection agents, our Border Patrol agents, every  single day for our own security, for awareness of what is coming over  our border.   Mr. Speaker, we are a border State, so you are never going to find a  bigger fan of Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol. I was  visiting with them in the past 10 days. They are doing yeoman's work,  and I asked for their advice before I went to the southern border.   But we know that, despite their best efforts, the overwhelming number  of people, combined with the complete inability to be prepared for such  numbers, means that people were going without showers, and people were  going without access to medical care. People were going without.   That is not what anyone wanted. I do not believe at all that people  wanted that, but that was the reality. So I felt it was important to  lay down a clear standard. I think the vast majority are adhering to  that standard, and I think it is the bare minimum.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615
