 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on NDAA, for the past six decades,  Congress has worked on a bipartisan basis to pass an annual Defense  bill without fail. After today, this year will be no different.   Later this morning, the Senate will hold a vote to pass NDAA  legislation for fiscal year 2022 that has been negotiated on a  bipartisan, bicameral basis. After it is approved by this Chamber, the  bill will go to the President's desk for his signature.   With so many priorities to balance, I thank my colleagues for working  hard over these last few months, both in committee and on the floor, to  get NDAA done. I want to particularly recognize my colleague Chairman  Reed for his work shepherding this important process through.                            Build Back Better Act    Mr. President, now, for a Build Back Better update, this week,  Democrats also continue working on getting the Senate into a position  where we can vote on the President's Build Back Better legislation. We  are also continuing to hold conversations, as Senate Democrats, on the  urgent work of advancing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.   There is universal view in our caucus that we need to pass  legislation to protect our democracy. What the Republican legislatures  are doing--on a purely partisan basis--is undermining, destroying our  democracy.   We believe that we can restore the Senate to work the way it is  supposed to and at the same time deal with voting rights. And that is  what we are aiming to do.                             Judicial Nominations    Mr. President, now, on judicial nominations, in addition to our  legislative agenda, the Senate is also making good progress this week  on confirming more of President Biden's nominees, both to his  administration and the Federal bench.   Today, we will vote to confirm two more of the President's judicial  nominees, and it is possible I will file cloture on more today. At the  district  [[Page S9171]]  level, we will confirm Samantha Elliott to serve as district judge for  the District of New Hampshire. And we will also vote on the  confirmation of Jennifer Sung to sit as a circuit judge for the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   Throughout her career, Ms. Sung has proven herself to be an  exceptional and impartial adjudicator, a valiant advocate for working  Americans, and I am confident she will be an excellent judge who adds  to the personal and professional diversity of the Ninth Circuit.   For much of her time in private practice, Ms. Sung dedicated herself  to representing workers in disputes against unscrupulous employers. The  folks she has fought for over her career haven't been privileged  individuals. On the contrary, they have been everyday working  Americans: low-income workers, minority workers, and largely  underserved communities--folks who just want a fair shake.   As a member of the Oregon Employment Relations Board, where she has  served in a quasi-judicial role adjudicating disputes between workers  and management, Ms. Sung has displayed immense skill striking a  delicate balance between protecting the interests of working Americans  while applying the law fairly and impartially and without  preconception. This balance is crucial for anyone under consideration  for the bench, and that is the point.   We are having, of course, demographic diversity. Ms. Sung represents  that as an Asian American. But we are also having professional  diversity, where people from different walks of life and different  experiences serve in these very important courts, not just prosecutors  and people from big law firms. So this is a very, very important change  that we are making to the bench.   This year, we have made progress in adding that new level of  diversity to the bench, but we still have a lot of work to do to make  our courts reflect the diversity and richness of our democracy.   And on one more judge, Ali Nathan, earlier this morning it was my  honor to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to introduce Ali  Nathan, nominated by President Biden, on my recommendation, to serve as  circuit judge for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.   Judge Nathan is a remarkable and barrier-breaking nominee for the  Federal bench. A graduate of Cornell Law School, a clerk for both the  Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court, under Justice Stevens, and a  member of President Obama's White House counsel and the Office of the  Solicitor General in New York, Judge Nathan's resume is nothing short  of impeccable.   I can happily say that this will be the second time I have  recommended Judge Nathan to serve on the bench. A decade ago, I urged  President Obama to consider Ali Nathan to serve as district judge in  the Southern District.   I am glad President Obama listened. And after a decade of admirable  service on the bench, it is clear that appointing her was the right  decision. And, one more important point, if confirmed to the Second  Circuit, Judge Nathan would only be the second LGBTQ woman to serve as  a Federal appellate judge in the United States--another important step  in tearing down the barriers in the halls of justice.   If confirmed, I am confident that Judge Nathan will serve with  distinction and excellence on the Second Circuit.   So, thanks to Senate Democrats, President Biden has more total  circuit and district judge nominees confirmed before December 15 of his  first year than any President since Ronald Reagan. By the end of the  day, the tally will stand at 31 new judges confirmed in 2021.   Let me repeat that. By the end of today, the Senate will have  confirmed 31 judges in President Biden's first year--20 to the district  courts and 11 to serve as appellate judges on the Federal circuit.   Four years ago, under President Donald Trump, Republicans lacked any  robust legislative agenda and focused almost entirely on rubberstamping  the parade of far-right, unqualified, and highly ideological  nominations to the Federal bench.   This year, we are administering the antidote: All year long the  Democratic majority has begun rebalancing our courts with mainstream,  highly qualified, and diverse judges--historically diverse both in  their profession and personhood.   Over half of the new judges are women, over half are people of color,  and all of them are immensely qualified by virtue of their skills,  their experience, and their unique perspectives they bring to the  Federal bench.   We are going to continue working as much as we can for the rest of  this year to confirm more judges. And you can be sure that we will push  even harder in 2022.   Mr. President, one more point on Republican nomination obstruction,  besides judicial nominees, we have a responsibility in this Chamber to  confirm President Biden's nominees to his administration. Every  President--and this one too--deserves to have his administration  filled, and for years in the past, both sides have worked together when  possible. But this year, we are seeing a new low from Senate  Republicans. Because of the cynical blockade of a handful of Members on  the other side, the Senate now faces a backlog of at least 150  nominees, many of whom would have sailed through the Chamber in years  past.   We have now had to file cloture on twice as many nominees at this  point in President Biden's administration as Republicans had to do  under President Trump.   Let's be clear about the nominees at issue. We aren't talking about  partisan firebrands or candidates who come out of left field. The bulk  of these men and women are uncontroversial, by the book, professional  public servants. Many of these nominees would work on issues like  supply chains and national security, which our Republican colleagues  say they want to address. But now those lives, and the lives of their  families, have been thrown into total limbo, all because a handful of  Republicans have hijacked the rules of the Senate to slow the  confirmation process to a glacial pace, against precedent and common  sense.   We have been working over the past day to secure a lift on many of  these holds. I want to echo what Senator Menendez has made clear: If  the Senator from Texas offers a proposal that does not include lifting  all State, Treasury, and USAID nominees, we cannot come to an  agreement.   Democrats are working to clear as much of the backlog as possible by  consent. If we can't make too much progress, we may need to stay and  hold votes on nominees this weekend and next week until we do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S9200]]     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.
