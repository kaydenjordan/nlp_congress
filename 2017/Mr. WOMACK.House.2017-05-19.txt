 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of drug courts  and veterans treatment courts in America.   No one disputes the issues of rampant drug use and abuse in our  Nation and the tremendous hardship it is placing on families, on  businesses, and our criminal justice system. Recently, I met a  remarkable young man from Arkansas who epitomizes the critical need to  expand these lifesaving programs.   Blayne was facing 20 years in prison because of a 10-year addiction  to opioid prescription drugs that spiraled out of control while  experimenting in college. Today he is a father to three beautiful  children, owns his own home, and is giving back to his community--all  because a drug court in Arkansas saved him.   This month is National Drug Court Month. Drug courts represent one of  our Nation's most successful strategies for intervention.   I support drug courts and veterans treatment courts. I am counting on  my colleagues to ensure they are properly supported and funded. The  return on investment is incalculable.                            ____________________
