 Madam Chair, I rise to enter into a short colloquy with  the distinguished gentlewoman from American Samoa.   As it is in your district, it is in my district. Sometimes we have to  leave our home and travel by airplane to a place where we can receive  the medical attention we need for VA services for our veterans.   I would like to discover, which I think I may already know the  answer, but just for the record, a veteran who lives, say, in Saipan  going to Tripler or Spark M. Matsunaga VA Medical Center in Hawaii,  that childcare is provided for that time, including the travel time and  the time when the veteran is receiving medical attention in Hawaii and  until that veteran returns home.   Is that an appropriate or correct interpretation of this legislation?    I yield to the gentlewoman from American Samoa.    It happens many times that a veteran, again, has to  leave. For example, in my district, they would have to leave the island  of Tinian or the island of Rota, fly to Saipan even to have a  teleconference, a telemedicine video, with their licensed social  worker, their psychologist, or their psychiatrist, and it takes time.  Flights are just once a day, for example, or a flight to Guam requires  an overnight stay.   So for the time that the veteran leaves home, goes to Guam, for  example, gets the care and comes back, I was hoping that that  restriction is appropriate.    Madam Chair, I would like to engage the gentleman from  Tennessee in a colloquy.    I yield to the gentleman.    I thank the ranking member of the committee and my  distinguished colleague from American Samoa.  [[Page H1424]]         Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment  clarifying that telemental health services furnished by the VA are  included in the list of covered healthcare services under H.R. 840.   Making it easier for veterans to get mental healthcare services by  providing childcare while they are receiving treatment just makes  sense. Most parents are not going to use the mental health services the  VA provides if it means leaving their kids at home alone. Worrying  about their children will only worsen the mental stress for veterans in  need of care.   So I support H.R. 840, but I want to make sure the childcare the bill  offers will be available to veterans in my district who can only  receive mental health service by videoconference.   We do not have a VA psychologist in the Marianas. For that matter, we  do not have a community-based outpatient clinic or a vet center or a  VBA specialist, services that veterans in the rest of America can take  for granted. So my vets must sit in front of a video monitor to get  mental health counseling--not exactly the best arrangement, in my  opinion.   So let us at least try and make sure that veterans in the Marianas-- or anywhere else in the Nation--or anywhere else the VA only offers  telemedicine instead of real person-to-person care, that those veterans  do not have to worry about the safety and well-being of their children.  Let us be sure there is no ambiguity in H.R. 840.   I ask my colleagues for their support of my amendment, backed by the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, so we can be sure that even vets receiving  mental health services by video can have the cost of childcare covered.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I very much thank the chairman of the  committee, the gentleman from California, and the ranking member, the  gentleman from Tennessee, for their leadership on the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee.   Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my colleague, Ms. Brownley, for  introducing this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Takano), the chairman of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers. I ask for support  for H.R. 840, and I yield back the balance of my time.
