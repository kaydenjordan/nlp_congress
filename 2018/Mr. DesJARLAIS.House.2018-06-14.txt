 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize the  recent retirement of director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation,  a native of Tennessee's Fourth District, Mark Gwyn. Throughout Mark's  30-year career, he served as the standard for Tennessee law  enforcement.   Beginning as a patrol officer for the McMinnville Police Department  in 1985, Gwyn quickly joined the TBI as a special agent, where he  showed superb investigative ability, leadership skills, and work ethic.   Eight years later, he was promoted to executive officer, then to  assistant director, overseeing the forensic services division, and,  finally, to director of the TBI in 2004.   Serving longer than any of his predecessors, Gwyn implemented many  policies and programs that helped the bureau evolve over the past  several years. He steered the bureau's fight to combat illegal  methamphetamine production in the State and took great steps in  combating human trafficking.   He oversaw the development of Tennessee's nationally recognized  fusion center, which provides numerous services that help link local,  State, and Federal resources together to improve the safety of all  Tennesseeans.   As we look ahead, there will almost certainly be new challenges that  TBI will face and difficulties that its future leaders will have to  overcome. But with the foundation built during his tenure, I am certain  that TBI will face these challenges with the same professionalism,  efficiency, and grace that Director Gwyn has exhibited.   I thank Mark Gwyn for his service and wish him well in his  retirement.                            ____________________
