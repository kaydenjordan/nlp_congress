 Madam President, it is a privilege to extend my  congratulations to Jolene Molitoris as APTA honors Jolene for her  extraordinary career and achievements for the public with APTA's  Lifetime Achievement Award.   My partnership with Jolene goes back decades, to our early work  together in State government in Ohio when Jolene served on the staff of  the Ohio Rail Transportation Authority. I introduced Jolene at her  Senate confirmation hearing in 1993 for Federal Railroad Administrator,  the first woman ever to head that Agency. Jolene went on to become the  longest serving FRA Administrator. Jolene blazed more firsts when in  2009 Ohio Governor Ted Strickland appointed her as the first woman to  lead the Ohio Department of Transportation, and in that role, she also  chaired the Ohio Rail Development Commission.   Recognized by WTS as Woman of the Year in 1995, Jolene has helped  boost the women transportation stars who shine today, in addition to  her own achievements. While at FRA, she served on the Amtrak board of  directors when Amtrak launched the Acela in the Northeast Corridor,  promoted rail revitalization with innovative new investment programs,  and expanded the number of contracts her agency awarded to women-owned  businesses to new Federal highs. At ODOT, Jolene oversaw ODOT's largest  construction budget ever to that time and secured $400 million to bring  robust rail service back to Ohio.   Jolene's absolute passion for safety has meant the most. As recent  tragic events in Ohio have again unfortunately demonstrated, safety  demands unwavering commitment. At FRA and ODOT, Jolene urged Vision  Zero, that we must passionately pursue zero incidents and zero  casualties. She focused her agencies on safety root cause, expanding  focus beyond mere blind compliance by the regulated community. During  her FRA tenure, the railroad industry achieved 7 of the safest years to  that time.   Nearly 30 ago in 1996, Jolene brought together rail labor, rail  management, and other stakeholders to form the FRA Railroad Safety  Advisory Committee to develop new regulatory standards through a  consensus process.  [[Page S1600]]  RSAC continues to operate to this day as one of the few standing  negotiated rule-making committees in the Federal Government, offering  an elevated voice for rail labor and other advocates in our unceasing  pursuit of safety.   Jolene's promotion of Transportation safety excellence, rail  passenger, and freight investment, of equity and inclusion--her vivid  passion to do the right things for the people of Ohio and for our  Nation--drive this APTA honor. I am proud to count Jolene as my partner  and my friend, and I salute APTA for presenting this Lifetime  Achievement Award to a most distinguished leader: Jolene  Molitoris.                            ____________________
