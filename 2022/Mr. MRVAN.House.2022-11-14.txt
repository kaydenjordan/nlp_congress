 Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that  I rise to congratulate Michael Schrage, Chief Executive Officer and  Chairman of the Board of Centier Bank as he celebrates his 50th work  anniversary.   Under his outstanding leadership, Centier Bank has been recognized as  the largest private, family-owned bank in the State of Indiana and,  since 2007, has annually been named one of Indiana's best places to  work. I believe that this is due to Michael's value-based work ethic  that fosters a supportive and thoughtful work environment.   I also appreciate that Michael has proven himself to be a pillar in  the community, volunteering his time and efforts to countless charity  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Michael Schrage on this  incredible accomplishment and his commitment to our region and helping  those in need.                            ____________________
