 Mr. President, almost 1 year ago, on December 10,  2021, multiple tornadoes touched down all throughout western Kentucky,  including one historic supercell tornado that affected multiple States  and ended in Kentucky. Lives were upended as homes, businesses, and  towns were completely destroyed. In many places, the destruction was  total and absolute. At a time when families were to be preparing for a  joyous holiday season, they were instead greeted by sorrow and loss,  while being surrounded by an uneasy reality of wreckage and despair.   Immediately, local citizens, Kentuckians around the Commonwealth, and  people from across the country converged on western Kentucky to help in  any way they could. Disaster relief teams sprang into action to meet  the needs of those who were impacted and who had lost everything. I am  grateful that Kentuckians rose up in the face of this crisis to do  whatever was necessary to help and to provide care for our neighbors.   While outside organizations and ministries provided essential  services, the real heroes of the story are the communities themselves  that were destroyed by the tornado. Through this historic crisis, the  men and women of western Kentucky have demonstrated resilience and  compassion as they care for the communities they call home. From  [[Page S6960]]  the first responders to the local officials to each man, woman, and  child involved, there was remarkable strength demonstrated in the face  of adversity. Communities have grieved together, served together, hoped  together, and rebuilt together. Today, almost 1 year later, we look  back on what has been lost, but also resolve to look forward to what  can be achieved together.   As we pause to reflect on the destruction of December 10, 2021, we  can see the hope that now shines through as towns are rebuilt and  communities regain shape. Even in tragedy, Kentucky has shown itself to  be resilient and unified. We will continue to press forward and care  for our communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Slainte Public House of Georgetown, KY, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   The dream behind Slainte Public House was born thousands of miles  away from its home in the Blue Grass State, dating back to 2015 when  owners Matt and Ashley Nunn traveled to Ireland in celebration of their  10th wedding anniversary. Upon their arrival in the Old Country, the  Nunns witnessed how pubs across Ireland offered a space where  communities could gather. The couple was struck by how these businesses  were so entrenched in their communities, serving a purpose far greater  than the stated goals of a typical American bar. Thus, upon their  return to their home State, the Nunns decided to try their hand at  emulating the communal attraction of the Irish pubs they enjoyed and,  in the spring of 2016, opened Slainte Public House.   Matt and Ashley's goal for Slainte Public House, or ``The Pub'' as  regulars like to call it, is for their community to be strengthened by  friendships made onsite. The Nunns sought to create a space that offers  its patrons something more profound than just food or drink, but a  place where lively discussion is encouraged, hearty laughter is  unavoidable, and a tear can be shed every now and then. Today, 6 years  after opening, you can ask any Georgetown local, and they will tell you  that the Nunns have succeeded in their goal. However, the story of its'  Irish inspiration is not the only notable fact about Slainte Public  House's creation. In opening Slainte Public House, Matt and Ashley Nunn  opened the first licensed bar to operate in Scott County since the days  of Prohibition, when the purchase and consumption of alcohol was  outlawed. Therefore, the Pub's 6 years in operation makes Slainte  Public House the oldest operating licensed bar in Georgetown, KY, a  title the Nunns are proud to bare.   Though the pub has been operating less than a decade, the building in  which the pub is housed has a history of its own. Constructed in 1793,  the building once served as the home of George Algair, who resided  there in the 1850s. As chairman of the Independent Ticket, Algair  represented a group who opposed efforts to outlaw alcohol in  Georgetown. Ann Bevin, a Scott County historian, uncovered a quote from  Algair that reads ``Give `em license, for they drink with or without  it.'' Perhaps Mr. Algair had a talent for clairvoyance as his former  residence now gladly serves as the local watering hole for the good  citizens of Georgetown.   Following Scott County's transformation from a ``dry county'' to a  ``wet county'' in 2009, there were many Georgetown citizens who were  apprehensive about the opening of Slainte Public House 7 short years  later in 2016. Though Matt had long dreamed of owning his own bar, his  wife Ashley initially was not on board with the idea. However, when the  two traveled across the Atlantic, Ashley finally understood what her  husband had been dreaming about. A new convert to the idea, the Nunns  took special care in making Slainte Public House a place that could  foster the style of fellowship they witnessed in the Irish pubs.  Walking into Slainte Public House today, you will find overstuffed  chairs, conversation nooks, and tables for board games and cards.  Overall, the pub has an atmosphere that is warmed by its regular  patrons and the kindness of a tightknit community that has embraced  Slainte Public House as a beloved fixture of Georgetown.   The Nunns understand that their role in the community extends beyond  the walls of Slainte Public House, therefore, the couple has opened  their doors to many charitable organizations and causes. Today, the pub  sponsors the Finley 5K, Kaden's Cause, Scott County Youth Baseball, the  Gathering Place Mission, the Amen House, and Elizabeth's Village. They  also have a Charity of the Month Program where donations to different  charities are made through sample sales and customer donations. The  Nunn's also host fundraisers for various nonprofits, and their pub  serves as a meeting place for various local groups, including Scott  County firefighters and Bible study groups. In recognizing their  contributions to the community Slainte Public House was awarded the  2017 New Business of the Year award by the Georgetown-Scott County  Chamber of Commerce. Needless to say, the Nunns' dream of giving back  to their community what they witnessed in Ireland has come true, as  Slainte Public House has become a beloved institution of Georgetown.  Congratulations to Matt and Ashley Nunn along with the entire team at  Slainte Public House. I look forward to seeing your continued growth  and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
