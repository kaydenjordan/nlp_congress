 Madam President, let me join the Democratic leader in  expressing my dismay in what has been going on on the Senate floor with  respect to healthcare.   For over 7 years, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  been talking about how they intended to repeal the Affordable Care Act  in order to replace it with something better and improve our healthcare  system. President Trump has said time and again that he would provide  better healthcare at a lower cost. He said that everyone would be  covered. Yet we have seen no solutions from the other side that would  accomplish these goals. We have been trying to work with Republicans,  not just this year but for the last several years to improve our  healthcare system. In fact, we worked with them to craft the Affordable  Care Act in the first place, holding public hearings and meetings with  both Democrats and Republicans around the table. The Affordable Care  Act included well over 150 Republican amendments. Yet they refused to  work with us on our final passage of the law and refused to work with  us on the current law and healthcare ever since.   However, today we have seen a couple of glimpses of bipartisanship.  First, the Senate voted last night, both Democrats and Republicans, to  reject the TrumpCare bill that would have provided tax breaks to  special interests while decimating Medicaid. I am glad the Senate has  spoken on that issue and said that we do not support this effort. This  afternoon, Democrats and Republicans voted to reject a bill that would  have repealed the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. A majority  of Senators voted to say that effort was unacceptable.   Now that we have taken those votes, Senators have had their say on  what they think is the best path forward, and to me, these votes show  that most Senators want to work in a bipartisan fashion to improve our  healthcare system. I have heard many of my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle say just that, as Senator McCain said so eloquently  yesterday.   I think, if my colleagues are willing to sit down and negotiate in  good faith  [[Page S4267]]  on legislation to improve our healthcare system and bring down costs,  we could come up with a bill that would get the support of the majority  of this body. My colleague Senator Shaheen, for example, introduced  legislation to help stabilize the individual market, something I think  most of us would agree is an important step forward in improving the  Affordable Care Act. However, we are now hurdling toward a vote with  absolutely no plan to improve the healthcare system. My Republican  colleagues are scrambling to get enough votes just to pass anything at  all.   Right now we are debating the bill, but what does that mean when we  have not yet seen the bill we are eventually going to vote on? This is  not a meaningful exercise with opportunities to amend and improve  legislation. We are simply killing time so that the Republican  leadership can unveil a new bill, if they are able to come up with one,  that they can convince enough of their Members to support. Hours or  minutes before final passage this could be sprung upon us, and we would  then be forced to take a vote. That is not the way the legislative  process should work.   What kind of message does this send to our constituents? This is an  example of legislating at its worst.   This is why many Americans don't trust Washington to have their  backs. We don't know what Republicans intend to pass at the end of this  debate, but we do know that they intend to pass something that is  harmful. The CBO score, which the Democratic leader suggested, based  upon the reports of what is pending, suggests significant losses in  coverage across the country and significant increases in the cost of  healthcare insurance for Americans. Based on what we have seen so far,  each proposal would send the healthcare market into a death spiral,  impacting all of our constituents--not just the Medicaid recipients,  not just those who are in the exchanges--and even private employers who  provide insurance coverage for their workers would see increases.    As I mentioned earlier, the bill we voted on this afternoon would  repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. In that case, the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this would cause 32  million Americans to lose health insurance over the next decade,  including 17 million next year alone, and health insurance markets  would collapse.   As I indicated, fortunately, that failed, with both Democrats and  Republicans voting against it, but it looks like Senate Republican  leadership is still trying to cobble together yet another version,  taking some of the worst elements of the repeal act. What is worse,  there will be no opportunity to review the bill, no chance for CBO to  analyze the bill and provide feedback, no opportunities for  stakeholders, patients, and States to weigh in.   It is telling that the only path forward they have for their repeal  effort is to pass a bill no one has literally read. The only chance  they have to get support for their effort is to hide, essentially, the  impact of the bill because on the merits it appears devastating to our  constituents.   Nevertheless, as much as they try to hide this bill, the American  people will find out. They will find out when they get the bill for  their health insurance. They will find out when they go to their doctor  and discover the treatment they had last year that was covered under  the Affordable Care Act is no longer covered. They will find out when  the only insurance company in their State decides to leave. They will  find out when their employer says: We are no longer providing  healthcare to our employees. They will find out when they start a  family and discover that maternity care is no longer covered and, if  the child needs medical care early in life, the insurance company can  say: No, thank you; we don't have to cover the child. There is a  preexisting condition.   Just last night I got a call from a woman in Charlestown, RI--Amy.  She urged me to continue fighting to preserve the Affordable Care Act.  She is a hairdresser and her husband is a commercial fisherman. Because  they are both self-employed, they are not able to get coverage through  work. They have been able to access care through our State's health  insurance marketplace, HealthSource RI. As Amy said, she and her  husband are hard-working, middle-income taxpayers, but they never have  been able to afford coverage without the help of the Affordable Care  Act. They would not have been able to do that. Amy recently got sick  and had to be hospitalized. She has coverage because of ObamaCare. She  was able to get the treatment she needed. Without coverage, she would  have been left to pay a bill of $78,000. Amy told me that she and her  husband would have had to sell their house to afford that, and,  probably even with that, they would have been left impoverished.   Is that really what my colleagues want for their constituents?   My constituents know what is at stake. I have heard from thousands  and thousands of them throughout the year, urging me to keep fighting  for healthcare, asking me to put an end to this repeal effort. However,  Democrats cannot do this alone. We need more Republicans like some of  my colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, to come forward  and say: Enough is enough. Even if you have problems with the current  system, let's try to work together to solve the problems. We might not  always agree, but we will try our best to come to a consensus. There is  no harm in trying to come up with a bipartisan solution. It is not too  late to reverse course and return to regular order, to start again, to  start right, and to do it, as my colleague on the Armed Services  Committee, Chairman McCain, said, the good old fashioned way, with  Senator Alexander and Senator Murray on the HELP Committee and my  colleagues on the Finance Committee working their way through,  carefully and deliberately, listening, amending, moving forward  legislation so that we can come to this body not with a few minutes'  notice but fully prepared to vote on something that is critical to  every family in the country.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1628 and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.   I move to commit the bill, H.R. 1628, to the Committee on Finance  with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not  counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes  that, No. 1, are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and No. 2,  ensure that no senior will lose access to long-term care service  including nursing home care and home and community-based care under the  Medicaid Program. Medicaid is the largest payer of nursing home care,  with 900,000 individuals across the country and 4,756 individuals in  Rhode Island who reside in nursing homes having their care paid for by  Medicaid. This bill would decimate Medicaid, harming seniors and their  families. This motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Shaheen.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Motion to Commit With Instructions           Mr. Reed moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that no senior will lose access to long term       care services (including nursing home care and home and       community-based care) under the Medicaid program.     Madam President, I have a motion to commit the bill, H.R.  1628, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same  back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate  is not in session, with changes that, No. 1, are within the  jurisdiction of such committee; and No. 2, ensure that any cuts to  Medicaid shall cease to apply in States with fewer than 26 weeks of  unemployment insurance under State law and shall be reversed in States  with increased unemployment in a quarter and include a study on  available job opportunities for those most likely to lose health  insurance coverage in the next 10 years as a result of the bill. Like  most of the country, Rhode Island was hit hard by the recession, and  Medicaid provided a critical safety net. Medicaid can adapt to cover  those who have lost their jobs or are facing other economic hardships,  saving families from having to choose whether to take their kids to the  doctor or put food on the table. Under this bill, States will be unable  to expand coverage during a recession to those in need and will likely  be forced to make devastating across the board cuts.   I ask unanimous consent that the motion be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Reed moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance of the Senate with instructions to       report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting       any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes       that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that any cuts to Medicaid shall cease to apply       in States with fewer than 26 weeks of unemployment insurance       under State law and shall be reversed in States with       increased unemployment in a quarter, and include a study on       available job opportunities for those most likely to lose       health insurance coverage in the next ten years as a result       of the bill.
