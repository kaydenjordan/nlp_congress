 Madam President, I thank you for the recognition, and I  thank Senator Gardner for his hard work on this excellent piece of  legislation.   Today, our Nation is in pain. It is the pain of centuries of deeply  embedded racial injustice. This Nation has watched in horror as the  last 8 minutes and 46 seconds of George Floyd's life were cruelly and  needlessly taken from him by a police officer.   Our Nation grieves for the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery,  and so many other innocent Black men and women violently taken from  their families and loved ones. This is a pain all too familiar for too  many Black Americans. This is a moment of reckoning for our Nation.   Black Americans have borne the brunt of this systemic racism, as have  Hispanic and Native American communities in New Mexico and across the  Nation.   So many of our officers protect and serve with honor and integrity,  but we cannot continue to sweep police brutality and racial inequality  under the rug, ignoring these painful legacies until the next tragedy.  There are thousands of Americans of every political stripe across the  Nation who have come out in peaceful protest demanding change.   Now, we know there are a few--a very small few--who are exploiting  our Nation's pain and using violence to disrupt. We unequivocally  condemn all acts of violence and call for nonviolent but urgent action.  By calling for the U.S. military to quell protests, as the President  and some in this body have done, that crosses a line between civilian  and military rule that is antithetical to American traditions. Instead  of calling for American soldiers to repress their fellow citizens  exercising their First Amendment rights, I am calling for action from  this body.   Today, Senators Booker and Harris introduced the Justice in Policing  Act, a bill I am proud to cosponsor. This landmark bill holds police  misconduct accountable in courts of law. It shines a light on police  practices, requiring transparency, and ends racial profiling and  mandates racial bias training. It bans choke holds and requires body  cams and makes lynching a Federal crime.   This is a moment of reckoning for our Nation. I call upon the Senate  majority to join with us to pass this long overdue legislation as soon  as possible.                                  H.R. 1957    Madam President, I now turn to the bill before us, the Great American  Outdoors Act. Our country's public lands are at the very core of our  national identity. They protect our national heritage, our lands,  waters, and our wildlife for future generations. Our national parks,  monuments, and wildlife refuges are irreplaceable treasures--sources of  beauty, of solitude, recreation, and of renewal.   From the Grand Canyon to Stonewall National Monument to the city park  in our neighborhood, our public lands sustain our people, and we owe it  to these special places and to ourselves and to our children to sustain  them for the future.   Today, I stand here in strong support of the Great American Outdoors  Act, legislation that at long last fully and permanently funds the Land  and Water Conservation Fund and invests in our public lands for the  future.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund was passed in 1964. My father,  Stewart Udall, was Secretary of the Department of the Interior at the  time, and I am proud he helped establish the LWCF. As Secretary, he was  troubled by how difficult it was to expand public lands. At that time,  the Federal Government would redesignate existing Federal lands to  create a new national park or a new wildlife refuge or rely on private  donations to expand, but the Congress itself resisted appropriating  funds to create new public lands.   At a wilderness conference in 1963, my father bluntly said: ``[T]he  path of land conservation that our government has used for more than  half a century is running into a dead end.''   But he had conceived of a new path forward, ``an entirely new  watershed in the history of the conservation movement in the United  States,'' he told them. Just 3 weeks before the conference, President  Kennedy had sent Congress a new piece of legislation called the Land  and Water Conservation Fund Act. My father and others conceived of a  Federal fund that would both generate money to acquire new Federal  lands and provide States with funding to expand recreational  opportunities. The bill passed Congress the next year.   The LWCF has been called our Nation's most successful conservation  program. It is wildly popular with the American people, and it has  touched every corner of our Nation--in rural and urban areas with  parks, forests, wildlife refuges, trails, wild and scenic river  corridors, historic monuments, and cultural sites. LWCF has funded  42,000 stateside projects. In my home State alone, it has helped over  1,200 such projects found in every 1 of our 33 counties.   After the LWCF was enacted, it became clear that the initial funding  sources were too limited. My father persuaded President Johnson to  support using Federal revenues from oil and gas leases in the Outer  Continental Shelf to fund the program. His plan converted revenue from  a nonrenewable source into a permanent protection for our renewable  natural world.    While Congress amended the act to include this funding source and  later  [[Page S2758]]  authorized the fund to actually annually accrue $900 million, the full  promise of LWCF was not yet fulfilled.   Throughout my career, I have championed increases to the LWCF, but it  deserves the dedicated funding my father and many others envisioned.  Last year, Congress finally permanently authorized the fund, a historic  victory for conservation.   It is long past time we take the next step and permanently direct the  full $900 million to the fund every year. Not only has the LWCF met its  conservation mission 100 times over; it has helped fuel the outdoor  recreation economy and support local economies, especially in rural  areas throughout the Nation.   Since the creation of the fund, the outdoor industry has grown  tremendously. It is now an $887 billion industry that powers 7.6  million jobs. That includes nearly 100,000 direct jobs in New Mexico,  driving $2.8 billion in wages and nearly $10 billion in consumer  spending.   Fully and permanently funding LWCF will translate directly into  economic growth. We need to energize our economy now more than ever as  we work our way out of the financial crisis created by COVID-19.   Throughout our history, we have seen investing in public lands  energizes both our economy and our national spirit. Conservation must  be a centerpiece of our recovery at this challenging time for our  Nation.   Indeed, the economic benefits of the LWCF are great, but the human  benefits to ourselves, our families, and our communities may be  greater.   One of the most recent LWCF projects in New Mexico is the Valle de  Oro National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban wildlife refuge in the  Southwest. Here is a photograph of our State's newest refuge: Valle de  Oro. The Rio Grande runs along this refuge, which boasts an amazing  array of wild birds, including sandhill cranes--which you see here--the  greater roadrunner, and the American kestrel. The $6 million  contribution from the Land and Water Conservation Fund helped make the  vision of this urban oasis a reality.   Valle de Oro is special to me because it introduces young people-- often Hispanic young people with limited means and limited access to  nature--to their first outdoor experience. It introduces kids to a  world of wonder and a lifetime of connection to nature. And it is just  down the street.   As Richard Louv discussed so eloquently in his seminal book ``Last  Child in the Woods'' and backed up with peer-reviewed study after  study, our children need nature, and we suffer spiritually and  physically when that bond is lost.   So as we take this historic action to add to our national heritage, I  am glad we are also addressing the $19 billion worth of deferred  maintenance on our existing public lands. Like the other days of the  Civilian Conservation Corps, this work is especially timely and will  help our economic recovery at a time of historic unemployment.   It is good news that use of our public lands has increased so  dramatically over time. More than 1 billion visitors enjoy our Federal  public lands each year. The infrastructure on these public lands--our  roads, bridges, and trails; our campgrounds, marinas; and our drinking  water and sewer systems--are wearing out. Historic buildings are  falling apart. Trails are washed out. Roads and bridges can't be used.  Water lines and sewer systems don't function. The list is long--$19  billion long.   In New Mexico alone, we have $121 million worth of deferred  maintenance needed at iconic places like Carlsbad Caverns, White Sands  National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, the Gila Cliff  Dwellings, and Bandelier National Monument.   The Great American Outdoors Act represents a substantial downpayment  toward maintaining, repairing, and renovating the infrastructure on our  public lands--allocating up to $1.9 billion annually for 5 years. This  represents Congress's most significant commitment to date to the long- term future of our public lands.   The American people own these precious resources. We need to maintain  the American people's public spaces so that all of us can continue to  safely and enjoyably visit these special places. How we take care of  these public places says a lot about our Nation.   Our Nation's conservation heritage is uniquely American. The bill  before us strengthens our Nation's commitment to conservation, to  protecting our wild places, to preserving our history and cultures, and  to nurturing our bonds with nature and the great outdoors.   I urge every Member here to wholeheartedly support our heritage and  vote in favor of this bill.   I yield the floor.
