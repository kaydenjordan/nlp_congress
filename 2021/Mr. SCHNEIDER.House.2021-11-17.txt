 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues  to act on the opioid epidemic roiling our Nation.   Today, we learned that between May of 2020 and April of 2021, more  than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, a grim, grim record.   Drug overdoses now surpass deaths from car crashes and gun violence.  Fentanyl alone was responsible for more overdoses than there were in  all of 2016, just five years ago.   We must expand access to medications like naloxone, which reverse an  opioid overdose, and mental health services to crack down on overdose  deaths from synthetics and opioids. Congress cannot do it alone.   In every community across the country, there are dedicated public  servants and committed groups working to combat these figures and help  individuals and families. Groups like the Lake County Opioid Initiative  in my district, cofounded by Mike Nerheim and Chelsea Laliberte-Barnes.   After 8 years, Mike is stepping down as chair, and Chelsea is  stepping up. I thank Mike for his leadership, and as the cofounder and  advocacy strategist for Live4Lali. I know Chelsea will continue the  great work of LCOI at this critical time.   Now Congress must help Mike, Chelsea, and the countless others around  the country for whom this fight is so personal.                            ____________________
