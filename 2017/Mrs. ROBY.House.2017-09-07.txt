 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Make America Secure and  Prosperous Appropriations Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support  this rule.   As a pro-life conservative, I have long fought to make sure that  taxpayers' dollars aren't being used to fund abortions or to fund  abortion providers. Whether it is in the Appropriations Committee or  here on the House floor, I have repeatedly made the cause for  increasing protections for life under the law. Those fights haven't  always been easy, and we haven't won every time. But Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased that the appropriations bill before us does contain important  pro-life provisions.   First, the bill states: ``None of the funds made available by this  act may be used to conduct or support research using human fetal tissue  if such tissue is obtained pursuant to an induced abortion.''   We all remember the 2015 scandal that revealed how Planned Parenthood  officials were systematically altering abortion procedures in order to  preserve the organs of babies to sell them to researchers. I said it at  that time, and you don't have to be staunchly pro-life like me to be  appalled by the thought of harvesting and trafficking aborted babies'  body parts for profit.   Our bill will prevent these atrocities from removing any incentives  abortion providers might have to harvest and sell babies' organs.  Instead, the bill directs agencies to find research using modern, more  efficient alternatives to human fetal tissue.   To be clear, I am a strong supporter of the National Institutes of  Health. Their research is critical for development of lifesaving  medical breakthroughs. However, I believe we must set a clear line of  distinction between what is acceptable and what is not.   Second, the bill expressly prohibits the Department of Health and  Human Services from steering Title X public health funding to abortion  providers. Of course, the Hyde amendment has long made it against the  law to actually pay for abortions with taxpayer dollars. But the Obama  administration had a bad habit of pushing hundreds of millions of  dollars to Planned Parenthood in forms of grants and reimbursements for  other services. This amounts to a pipeline of funding propping up the  Nation's largest abortion provider. It is an abuse of taxpayer money,  and I am pleased that this bill cuts it off.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my chairman, Tom Cole, for including these  important pro-life provisions in our base bill for the first time.                                time  1315    It represents real progress for the pro-life movement, and I will  continue to fight to see it through the process.   Mr. Speaker, I am unapologetically pro-life, and I believe that every  human life is precious and our laws and policies should reflect that.
