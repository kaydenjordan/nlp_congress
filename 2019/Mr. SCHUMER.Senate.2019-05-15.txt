 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for always  staying on top of things like this.   Mr. President, first, I would like to talk about Police Week. Today  we observe Peace Officers Memorial Day, the heart of National Police  Week. We all remember the men and women in law enforcement who have  made the ultimate sacrifice, and we pause to say thank you to all of  our police officers who work day and night to keep our communities  safe.   I want to share a special thanks to all of our law enforcement  members visiting from New York, who, in my view, are the gold standard  in police work.   I grew up in a neighborhood where police officers lived. I played  with their children at their houses. You would always know sort of  instinctively, even as a kid, when that phone rang and the spouse-- almost always, in those days, the wife of a police officer--heard the  phone ring, what went through her head a little bit is this: I hope  that is not the call I dreaded. This is the job of police officers and  their families--that is, to risk their safety for our safety--and they  do a great job.   As we recognize their contributions, we should acknowledge what we  could do in Congress to make their jobs safer and easier. We can make  our streets safer by passing comprehensive background check  legislation. We can help law enforcement combat foreign opioid  trafficking by passing the bipartisan Fentanyl Sanctions Act and the  POWER Act, which provides handheld scanning devices. When a police  officer is on a drug bust, they can tell if fentanyl is part of a crime  scene there, and they can take precautions to protect themselves,  because we know how deadly fentanyl is, even if it gets on your skin or  in your nostrils. We can also do more to care for the families of  fallen officers.   That is why I have been so proud to fight alongside my colleague  Senator Gillibrand and so many others to make sure that the September  11th Victim Compensation Fund has the necessary funding.   Last Friday, the New York Police Department, or the NYPD, added the  names of nearly 50 police officers to the 9/11 memorial wall, all of  whom died in 9/11-related illnesses. It is our duty to take care of  these families, and the first step is making sure that the Victims  Compensation Fund has enough funds to compensate them.   I say to our law enforcement officers two words: Thank you. Thank you  for your service. It is an honor to represent you in the Senate, and we  are all grateful for the sacrifices you make every day.    Madam President, first, I want to thank the Senator from  Minnesota--the senior Senator--for all of the great work she has done  in working to reduce the high cost of drugs for the American people.                               The Middle East    Madam President, on a much different subject but a very important  one--Iran and the Middle East--I have returned to the floor this  afternoon amid several concerned reports about the Trump  administration's position on Iran.   Earlier this week, it was reported that the administration's national  security team discussed a plan that would deploy at least 120,000 U.S.  troops in the Middle East. Today we learned that personnel were removed  from the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. The President himself initially denied  there was a plan and then seemed to confirm the reports by saying that  he would ``absolutely'' send troops, and, if he did, ``it would be a  hell of a lot more than 120,000.''   The news comes as quite a surprise to the American people, who have  grown quite tired of wars in the Middle East, of the loss of life and  fortune when there is so much that has to be done in America.   The American people deserve to know what is going on here. We are  talking about not only putting 120,000 troops in harm's way in this  possible deployment but also about the safety and the actions of the  thousands of troops we have stationed in the Middle East right now.   So I am calling on Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan and the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, to come testify before the Senate  Armed Services Committee in an open setting before the end of the week.  The hearings that are done in secret do not inform the American people  of what is going on, and they are entitled to know because the lessons  of history teach us that when things are done in secret, behind closed  doors, mistakes can be made and momentum built for a course of action  that the Nation ultimately regrets.   So I repeat: The American people deserve to know what is going on. If  the President and Republicans in Congress are planning to take the  United States into a conflict, even a war in the Middle East, the  American people deserve to know that, and they deserve to know why.   I yield the floor.
