 Madam President, I rise today as our country takes an  important step forward to protect the rights and freedoms of all  Americans. Together with broad bipartisan support, the Senate will  provide certainty to millions of Americans in loving marriages and  enshrine into law the basic protections afforded all Americans while  respecting our country's critical principle of religious liberty.   This historic milestone builds off of years of incredible strides we  have made advancing freedom and equality, including hard-fought  victories I have been honored to help lead.   Nearly two decades ago in 2006, at a time when our country was just  beginning to debate marriage, Arizona proposed a ballot proposition  banning same-sex marriage in our State's constitution. This issue was  personal to me and to many other Arizonans. Similar ballot provisions  had passed in States across the country, red and blue States alike, and  the stakes were high. The pundits didn't give Arizona much of a chance.   I knew that in order to buck the trend and win, we would need to run  a different kind of campaign that expanded the conversation, cultivated  a diverse group of unlikely partners, and moved past the tired,  partisan talking points.   That is why I worked across the aisle and teamed up with my good  friend Steve May, a Republican. Now, we faced some criticism at the  time for how we chose to run our campaign. Some wanted us to run a  partisan campaign, convinced that highlighting the divides in our  community and focusing exclusively on the LGBTQ community would put us  over the top.   But I knew we couldn't do it just by talking amongst people who  already agreed with our position. The polling showed it. And, frankly,  we felt that in order to do right by our friends, our neighbors, and  our fellow members of the LGBTQ community in Arizona, we had to do more  than run a campaign that made our core supporters feel good but  ultimately didn't build the broad-based coalition of Arizonans needed  to win.   That is why we expanded the conversation to include how the  proposition would harm all unmarried couples across Arizona, not just  those in the LGBTQ community but people in domestic partnerships,  people in common-law marriages because here is the truth: When we reach  beyond partisan talking points to find common ground, we expand what is  possible in Arizona and in our country.   We had open and honest conversations about the hopes and dreams that  unite us, instead of the superficial differences that divide us.   In Arizona, we value our independence. We are proud of our families  and our communities, and we work hard to protect them. We have our  differences, but we share a strong sense of service, hard work, and  self-determination.   We believe that everyone has the right to define his or her own  destiny and that no one should be treated differently under the law. By  focusing on these shared values, we found success. We defeated that  ballot proposition--the first State in the country to do so--and I  learned lessons that have shaped my work for Arizonans ever since.   Since 2006, we have seen long-term progress that makes today's  important debate in the U.S. Senate possible. This work is ongoing. But  the work can't and shouldn't be attributed to any one politician, any  political party, or any piece of legislation. This work happens because  people choose to be their most authentic selves and live their lives  freely.   Being gay is normal. Being yourself is normal. Showing up to life  every day happy to be who you are is normal. And being authentic with  your friends, your family, your colleagues, and your community, that is  also normal. That normalcy is what helps us listen to each other,  understand each other, and grow in our community together. It is what  changes hearts and minds in Arizona and around the country, and it is  what, little by little, piece by piece, delivers sustainable progress.   Whether at home in Arizona or here in the U.S. Senate, in order to  deliver real results to the Americans we serve, we need to work  together. Working together means listening with open hearts, bridging  divides, shutting out the noise, and focusing on our shared goals.   I have seen time and time again how this approach helps us overcome  tough challenges.   A little over 6 months ago, it was thanks to that same approach that  I stood here on the Senate floor and delivered remarks on the passage  of our Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a historic law we negotiated  and passed with broad bipartisan support that makes our schools and  communities safer and saves lives.   And before that, this same approach helped us pass our landmark  legislation, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, into law,  strengthening America through upgrades and repairs, creating good- paying jobs, and expanding economic opportunities across the country.  Beyond these historic accomplishments, our approach of focusing on  common goals and shared ideals has helped us pass a number of other  lasting solutions, including long-awaited and necessary postal reform,  support for Ukraine in its fight against Putin, and most recently, the  passage into law of our bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, legislation  that boosts America's global leadership, spurring job creation and  addressing our supply chain challenges.   As we can all see, this approach has proved successful, and right now  we need this approach more than ever. You know, this summer Arizonans  and Americans across the country were confused, and some were scared,  following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Women  felt their health and well-being was endangered and our own abilities  to make critical decisions about our futures were suddenly thrown into  question. This fear trickled into other communities--including the  LGBTQ community--as leaders with extreme ideologies mused about what  other challenges could come next. But sadly, in response, we saw  elected officials on both sides of the aisle exploit this fear and use  it to fuel clicks, book cable news appearances, and drum up outrage to  further their own partisan political agendas.    Outrage can help propel political stars, but it doesn't solve  problems. It doesn't make life better for everyday people.   But amidst the noise, a few hard-working Senators from across our  country and across the political spectrum understood there was a need  to provide certainty to the American people, and we came to the table  to get something done.   Senator Tammy Baldwin, our groundbreaking leader on this issue,  partnered with my old friends Senators Susan Collins, Rob Portman, Thom  Tillis, and myself, all of us no strangers to bipartisan success in a  divided Senate. Together, we Senators all focused on the same goal, to  help ensure married same-sex couples across the country are afforded  the same protections as all other married American couples.   Along the way, we overcame obstacles; we made certain our language  respected religious liberty; and we were careful to ensure that in  shoring up some rights we did not infringe upon others.   We made our case to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We  listened to those who disagreed with us. We didn't pick fights. We  didn't call names. We  [[Page S6725]]  just kept moving forward. And I am proud to say that by refusing to  demonize each other and by focusing on our shared goals, we will  deliver real, lasting results for the LGBTQ community.   We will make our country stronger and safer for American families in  a way that honors and respects our diverse viewpoints on marriage, on  family, and society.   I thank the many faith communities that helped us expand this policy  conversation and ensure that our amendment would include robust and  commonsense religious liberty protections.   In particular, I thank the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints that provided thoughtful suggestions and contributions. They  summarized our holistic outcome when they wrote in their statement:         We believe this approach is the way forward. As we work       together to preserve the principles and practices of       religious freedom together with the rights of LGBTQ       individuals, much can be accomplished to heal relationships       and foster greater understanding.    Not every American agrees on marriage or lots of other issues, and  that is OK. Honest disagreements don't make us any less decent or  honorable, especially if we see that disagreement as an opportunity to  learn and grow.   If more of us dedicate ourselves to better understanding one another  and our lived experiences, if we strive to see an issue from another  person's point of view, and if we all work to practice a bit more  patience and grace, I know we can continue finding paths forward  together.   It may not seem like it in today's partisan world, but there has  always been more that unites us as Americans than divides us.   The bipartisan support we have garnered in the Senate today proves  this issue isn't a matter of one party being right or the other party  being wrong. This issue is bigger than angry tweets and bombastic  fundraising emails. This is about ensuring American families, who share  the ideals of all marriages--love, devotion, and sacrifice--can  continue to count on the basic rights and responsibilities that come  with their marriages. It is about protecting the beliefs that unite us  as Americans: the right to define our own destinies, the understanding  that no one should be different in the eyes of the law, the freedom to  reach for every opportunity and fulfill our greatest potential.   The truth is, if we allow our basic values of honor and dignity to  become just another political football, we all lose.   As I learned back in 2006 in Arizona, we have to work together. We  have to find willing partners in both parties, and we must bridge our  divides before they rip us apart for good.   Our work is not done. As a body, we must resolve to do the right  thing to continue this mission and keep working together to deliver  lasting results. Our country deserves it, the American people deserve  it, and the stakes are too high to stop our progress now.   I yield the floor.
