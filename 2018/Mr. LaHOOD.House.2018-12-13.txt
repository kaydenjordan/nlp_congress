 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the  life of an American hero and son of Illinois.   Last Thursday, Corporal Daniel Baker of Tremont, Illinois, was aboard  a KC-130 refueling aircraft that collided with an F/A-18 Hornet during  a training mission over the ocean south of Japan. Following a search  and rescue mission, Corporal Baker was declared deceased this past  Tuesday morning. He was 21 years old.   Born and raised in Tremont, Illinois, Daniel Baker was known by  friends and family to be a man of deep faith who was kind,  compassionate, and sincere.   In 2015, Daniel graduated from Tremont High School and felt a deep  calling to serve his country in the military. Corporal Baker served 2  years in the United States Marine Corps. He received the National  Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.   Corporal Baker was taken from this world way too early, but he  embodied every quality we seek to impart upon young men and women in  this country, and he will be deeply missed by his friends, family, and  the Tremont community.   May we continue to keep Daniel and his family in our thoughts and  prayers. We will never forget his selfless sacrifice to our country.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would request that the House of  Representatives honor his service with a moment of silence.                            ____________________
