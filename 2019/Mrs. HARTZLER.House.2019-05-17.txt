 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  5, a deceptively named bill that is anything but equalizing. In fact,  this bill legalizes discrimination, government-imposed, top-down  discrimination against those with time-honored views of marriage and  gender.   This bill should be renamed the ``Inequality Act,'' as its policies  at the State level have already been used to eliminate safe spaces for  women, irreparably harm children, trample parental rights, undermine  the free exercise of religion, and dismantle female athletics.   As a mother, teacher, and former track coach, I am deeply concerned  about the implications of this bill on and off the playing field.   Title 9 of the Civil Rights Act, the provision guaranteeing girls the  same educational opportunities as boys and which launched competitive  female sports into the arena, is rendered irrelevant and outdated under  the Inequality Act.                                time  1015    Under H.R. 5, high school female athletes will miss competitive  opportunities because boys take home the medals.   Selina from Connecticut trained hard, set goals, and persevered, but  she couldn't overcome the biological advantage men have over women when  two biological boys who identify as female outpaced her in a recent  girls' track meet.   On average, there is a 10 to 12 percent performance gap between elite  males and elite females in athletics. The gap is smaller between elite  females and nonelite males but still insurmountable. It is no surprise  that men are taking home the gold in women's sports.   In future Olympics, it would only take three biological males who  identify as female to prevent the best female athletes from reaching  the medal stand and eight to keep them off the track entirely.   If we continue down this track, how long will it be before nations  recruit men identifying as female to out-medal other countries and  ultimately uproot the ancient tradition of the Olympics?   To put in this perspective, Olympic, world, and U.S. champion Tori  Bowie's 100-meter lifetime best time was beaten 15,000 times by men and  boys. In another case, Olympic, world, and U.S. champion Allyson  Felix's 400-meter lifetime best was outperformed more than 15,000 times  by males.   In case after case, men identifying as women are outcompeting,  outrunning, outfighting, and outcycling women. Welcome to the brave new  world of women's sports under H.R. 5.   The importance of Title IX is found not just on the field. As Duke  law professor Coleman testified before the House Judiciary Committee,  ``Tens of thousands of girls and women are now eligible for college  scholarships, ensuring educational opportunities that for many wouldn't  be realistic otherwise.''   Unfortunately, H.R. 5 erases these educational opportunities, further  disenfranchising women. Women-only scholarships would be a thing of the  past if this bill passes.   Mr. Speaker, either we want a level playing field for American women  or we don't.   I remind my colleagues that next week marks the centennial  anniversary of this Chamber's historic passage of the 19th Amendment  granting women the right to vote. It is an honor and a privilege for me  to stand here on this House floor 100 years later celebrating this  milestone.   I find it eerily ironic that today many of my colleagues will  exercise their 19th Amendment right to turn back the clock on women and  girls across this country.  [[Page H3942]]    A vote for this bill is a vote against women. Members from both sides  of the aisle, especially those who claim to be pro-women and pro-child,  need to stop this devastating legislation. The future of our girls'  rights, privacy, protection, and athletic potential depends on it.
