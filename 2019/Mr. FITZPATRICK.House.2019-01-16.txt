 Mr. Speaker, on Monday we recognize Martin Luther  King Day and we celebrate his legacy of civil rights and his promotion  of opportunity for all.   Today, I am proud to recognize an individual from Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, who has spent his life and career dedicated to the  advancement of equality.   Norval Reece of Yardley remembers witnessing Dr. King's ``I Have a  Dream'' speech and marching with him on the third march from Selma to  Montgomery. He worked closely with Dr. King to enact change and in 1967  spent several hours with Dr. King in Philadelphia.   Norval credits his devotion to civil rights activism to his Quaker  faith. He served in India with the American Friends Service Committee,  and later continued to work on their behalf upon his return home. He  later became a successful businessman, building his own media company  that helped bring cable television to then-Communist Poland.   Mr. Speaker, Norval's life and dedication to the service of others is  truly inspiring, and we thank him, his wife, and their sons, Tim and  Stockton, for their service to their community and our country.      Recognizing the Food Center at the Morrisville Presbyterian Church     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a faith community  in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is going the extra mile to minimize  the negative impact felt by Federal workers and their families during  this prolonged government shutdown.   Last Friday, an estimated 800,000 Federal employees missed their  paychecks. Understanding the undue hardship these Federal employees are  facing, the Food Center at the Morrisville Presbyterian Church stepped  up to the plate, opening their door to furloughed Federal workers and  their families with the opportunity to receive food.   Mr. Speaker, I am truly blessed to represent such thoughtful and  compassionate constituents.   As I did in this same exact spot yesterday, I urge my colleagues to  put aside their differences and reopen our government. Our inaction is  putting Federal workers in an untenable position.   We would like to extend our heartfelt thank you to the Reverend  Rachel Rhodes and all the staff and volunteers at the Food Center at  Morrisville Presbyterian Church for their work. Each and every one of  them makes our community a special place.                           Stalking Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, January is Stalking Awareness Month,  and I rise today to bring attention to the critical need for action to  empower survivors and protect victims of this crime.  [[Page H611]]    Yesterday, I proudly joined my friend and colleague Representative  Stephanie Murphy from Florida along with Pennsylvania Senators Pat  Toomey and Bob Casey to reintroduce the Combat Online Predators Act.   This bill would increase criminal penalties for the stalking of  children and help ensure law enforcement officials evaluate and update  practices to combat online stalking of children.   Mr. Speaker, there are few things more sinister than preying on  innocent children. Millions of Americans, including the most vulnerable  among us, are harmed each year by stalkers. Here in Congress, we must  work in a bipartisan manner to eliminate the digital footprint of  predators to protect the kids in our communities and in our Nation.   I am deeply grateful for the support and advocacy of the Zezzo family  of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who serve as an inspiration for this  piece of legislation, the Combat Online Predators Act, and for  survivors everywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I pledge to work with all of my colleagues, Democrat and  Republican alike, to advance this legislation and other solutions to  stop stalking in all of its forms.                            ____________________
