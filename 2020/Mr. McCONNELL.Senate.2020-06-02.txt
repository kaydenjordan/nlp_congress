 Madam President, last night, the streets of major  American cities were again the scene of looting and violent rioting  that serves no purpose except to hurt innocent people and undermine  peaceful demonstrations.   Every one of us has an obligation to distinguish peaceful protests  over the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery  from the violent riots that continue to see innocent people hurt,  businesses and neighborhoods destroyed, and law enforcement officers  assaulted. The former is a cherished constitutional right that every  single citizen should support, and the latter is an unacceptable  scourge that State and local leaders should have ended days ago. So I  want to thank Federal, State, and local leaders who are taking  seriously their obligation to restore peace, protect the innocent, and  stop this senseless violence.   In some places, like my home State of Kentucky and here in  Washington, last night was comparatively more calm and safe. But in too  many other places, like New York City, it appeared to be open season  for lawlessness, looting, and attacking law enforcement for yet another  night. And for what? For what? Rioting for the thrill of it? For the  chance to steal some expensive items? So people can say they were on  social media?   This selfish violence takes us further away from any national healing  or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer; it  simply pushes it further away.   These rioters need to listen to what George Floyd's brother Terrence  said in Minneapolis just yesterday. Here is what George Floyd's brother  said:         I understand [you all] are upset. I doubt [you're] half as       upset as I am. So if I'm not over here blowing up stuff, if       I'm not over here messing up my community, then what are [you       all] doing?    George Floyd's brother.   [[Page S2636]]              [You're] doing nothing. Because that's not going to bring       my brother back at all.    So the legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will  never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate- glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers  who have been assaulted or shot in the head.   Our Nation is united in horror and opposition to the violent killing  of Mr. Floyd. We are united. It is well past time that we also unite on  the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities. We need  to unite against these violent rioters, who seek only to aggrandize  themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a totally different matter,  obviously and unfortunately, this turmoil is not the only great  challenge before us. Lest we forget, the healthcare fight against the  worst viral pandemic in a century is still upon us. Our Nation is  trying to smartly and safely reopen. Just as small businesses in some  cities are sweeping up broken glass, American workers and entrepreneurs  across the Nation are trying to rebuild the shattered prosperity our  Nation was experiencing just a few months ago. Meanwhile, beyond our  shores, our enemies and adversaries would be only too eager to catch  the United States with our guard down.   So there is plenty of work before the Senate, and unlike the  Democratic House of Representatives, which I understand may next appear  here in Washington in about a month--in about a month--the Senate is  present and working.   We are continuing to conduct oversight of our historic rescue  package, the CARES Act, as it continues taking effect. I expect we will  soon consider further bipartisan legislation to help the Paycheck  Protection Program--the signature policy from Senators Rubio and  Collins that has kept tens of millions of Americans employed--continue  to work for our country.   As we pivot toward reopening, the Senate is also working on  significant COVID-related legal protection so our Nation's schools,  healthcare workers, and employers are not swamped with frivolous  lawsuits and taxpayer dollars do not just stimulate the pockets of  trial lawyers.   At the same time, critical vacancies remain throughout the Federal  Government, and qualified nominees stand ready to fill them. So the  Senate will work through two nominees to the Federal district courts  and a number of important executive branch positions, including  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities;  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense; and the new Special Inspector  General for Pandemic Recovery.   What is more, we also have all the important legislation that needed  to get done before the pandemic arrived in the first place. This month,  we will turn to bipartisan legislation led by Senators Gardner and  Daines to provide stable support for the Land and Water Conservation  Fund and lasting stewardship of our natural resources. Their bill will  safeguard our Nation's public lands for recreation and conservation and  help generations of Americans continue to access and enjoy these  treasures.   In the coming weeks, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee  will begin marking up the 60th consecutive, annual National Defense  Authorization Act. I know our colleagues need no reminder of how  important that task is; neither do our men and women in uniform. The  COVID-19 crisis makes it more urgent, not less urgent, that we continue  to authorize investments in our servicemembers and their families and  in advancing and accelerating our national defense strategy. From  honing our competitive edge against would-be rivals on land and sea to  expanding our reach in the air and space, achieving our Nation's  strategic priorities begins right here this month with the NDAA.   So Congress's to-do list is clear, and the Senate is manning its  essential post, working to get the American people's business done.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 697.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate resume consideration of the Mercado nomination.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first  and foremost, I am a First Amendment absolutist. The right to peaceful  protest is absolutely sacrosanct. It is a core American liberty. When  peaceful demonstrations occur within the bounds of the law and with  respect to the needs of law enforcement, leadership at every level has  an obligation to respect and honor them.   Our Nation must not turn a deaf ear to the anger, pain, or  frustration of Black Americans. Our Nation needs to hear them. There is  no question that the killing of George Floyd was horrific. In my view,  it absolutely appears to have been a heinous act of criminal violence.  It is totally unacceptable that Mr. Floyd is dead. There is no doubt  that residual racism continues to be a stain on our country. We need to  do more to address it.   Over the last few days, we have seen peaceful protests hijacked on a  nightly basis into a rolling series of riots that engulfed great  American cities in wanton destruction and violent crime.   These are the two issues the American people are focused on: justice  for Black Americans in the face of unjust violence and peace for our  country in the face of looting, riots, and domestic terror. Those are  the two issues that Americans want addressed: racial justice and ending  riots.   Unfortunately, this resolution from my friend the Democratic leader  does not address either one of them. Instead, it just indulges in the  myopic obsession with President Trump that has come to define the  Democratic side of the aisle. It pays more attention to the precise  ways that Federal law enforcement protects Presidential movements  around the White House than to the fact that great American cities,  including my colleague's beloved New York, have been consumed by  rioting, looting, and violence against police for several nights in a  row, with no end in sight.   Outside of the Washington, DC, bubble, there is no universe where  Americans think Democrats' obsession with condemning President Trump is  a more urgent priority than ending the riots or advancing racial  justice. There is no universe in which the dynamics of Lafayette Park  before the President seeks to exit the White House is a more urgent  national priority than the shattered glass, destroyed businesses, and  brutal attacks on law enforcement that are happening nationwide in  places like Lafayette Street in New York City.   I will object to my distinguished colleague's thin resolution and  will offer something more full-throated in its place.   My resolution would condemn a long pattern of unjust police violence  toward Black Americans. It would champion the First Amendment and  praise the peaceful protests that followed Mr. Floyd's death. It would  clearly condemn the violent rioting that has paralyzed places like New  York City and insist that local authorities finally get serious about  protecting the innocent.   I hope my distinguished colleague will not object. America is united  and outraged at the death of Mr. Floyd, and I hope we can unite to  condemn these senseless riots and move forward together as one Nation.  Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, as in if legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 601 submitted earlier today. I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motions with  respect to the Anderson and Tipton nominations ripen at 12 noon  tomorrow; I further ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on  the Anderson nomination, the postcloture time expire at 2:15 tomorrow;  further I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the  Tipton nomination, the postcloture expire at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow;  finally, if either of the nominations are confirmed, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, June 3; further that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Anderson nomination under the previous order.    So if there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of Senators Booker and Van  Hollen.
