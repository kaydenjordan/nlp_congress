 Mr. President, I do not believe Chairman Pai should  have been confirmed to serve a full 5-year term as Chairman of the  Federal Communications Commission, FCC. Since assuming the leadership  role at the Commission, Chairman Pai has systematically advanced  policies that advance corporate interests at the expense of American  consumers.   Chairman Pai's decision to open an NPRM that will eventually reverse  the 2015 open internet order is an egregious example of his misplaced  priorities. In 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  confirmed that the open internet order was a lawful exercise of the  Commission's regulatory authority. Broadband service providers must  provide fair and equal access to all users, regardless of socioeconomic  status. Over 18 million Americans submitted comments urging the  Commission to maintain regulations that impose transparency and prevent  ISPs from throttling or discriminating against certain data. Numerous  polls have shown that Americans, across the political spectrum,  overwhelmingly support regulations that would prevent broadband  companies from discriminating against certain data.   Chairman Pai claims that the 2015 order caused a decrease in  broadband investment, but the evidence suggests otherwise. I wrote to  Chairman Pai about the evidence that he frequently cites to support his  allegations of depressed investment--evidence, which I believe, is  incomplete and inconclusive. As technology develops and consumers  become even more dependent upon internet access, it is imperative that  the FCC ensures that the internet is not divided between the have and  the have-nots.   I was also disappointed by Chairman Pai's support for Congress's  actions to repeal the Federal Communications Commission's broadband  privacy rules. These rules are especially important in light of recent  data breaches. Every website we visit and every link we click leaves an  unintended trail that tells a story about our lives. ISPs can collect  information about our location, children, sensitive information, family  status, financial information, Social Security Numbers, web browsing  history, and even the content of communications. ISPs sell this highly  sensitive and highly personal data to the highest bidder without  consumer's consent or knowledge. The Commission's rules empowered  consumers and gave them tools to protect their privacy though  transparency, choice, and data security. In supporting the rule's  repeal, Chairman Pai demonstrated that he does not believe that  Americans should have control over their data.   The rise of the internet of things, telehealth, and smart agriculture  means that American consumers need an FCC that is on watch and  committed to protecting their interests. I hope that Chairman Pai will  reverse course and will stop putting the interests of big corporations  ahead of the interests of American consumers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week my constituent Caroline  Burkhart of Baltimore, MD, is on a historic trip to Japan of  remembrance and reconciliation. A guest of the Japanese Government, she  will follow the journey of her father, Thomas F. Burkhart, who was a  prisoner of war of imperial Japan 75 years ago. Her trip will include a  visit to the site of the camp in which her father was held as a POW.   At the start of WWII, Lieutenant Burkhart served in the Philippines  with the Headquarters Company of the 45th Infantry, Philippine Scouts,  an elite U.S. Army unit composed of American officers and Filipino  enlisted men. After Japan's December 8, 1941, invasion of the  Philippines, his battalion helped defend the withdrawal of American  forces on Luzon to the Bataan Peninsula. Barely a month after being  promoted to first lieutenant, on January 24, 1942, Lieutenant Burkhart  earned a Silver Star for ``Gallantry in Action'' at the Battle of  Abucay Hacienda, January 15 to 25, 1942, which maintained the first  battle position on Bataan.   Sick with malaria, Lieutenant Burkhart was in the open-air general  hospital No. 1 near the tip of Bataan when Major General Edward King  surrendered the peninsula to Japanese forces on April 9, 1942. Soon  thereafter, the patients were taken by truck, boxcar, and foot up to  Camp O'Donnell, an overcrowded, makeshift POW camp. In early June, the  Japanese, fearing the deaths of the prisoners from the horrific  conditions in the camp, began to release their Filipino POWs and  transfer the others to a new facility at Cabanatuan. It is estimated  that 1,550 Americans and 22,000 Filipinos died at Camp O'Donnell, the  overwhelming majority within the first 8 weeks.  [[Page S6397]]    On November 6, 1942, Lieutenant Burkhart was among 1,500 prisoners  packed into the coal bunker of the unmarked ``hell ship'' Nagato Maru  to Japan. It took three torturous weeks for the ship to make its way  from the tropics to the cold of Northeast Asia. Lieutenant Burkhart,  nearly blind from malnutrition, was used as a slave laborer for the  construction company Toshima Group--today's Tobishima Corporation. He  was soon moved to the Hiroshima No. 1-B Zentsuji POW Camp on the island  of Shikoku. The enlisted men at Zentsuji were slave stevedores for  Nippon Express Co.--Nippon Tsuun--at Sakaide Rail Yards and the Port of  Takamatsu. As an officer, Lieutenant Burkhart worked in the camp  garden. On June 23, 1945, he and 334 officers were transferred to POW  Camp 11-B Rokuroshi, deep in the Japanese Alps. Food was scarce,  conditions were overcrowded, and winter clothes were unavailable,  leading many to fear that they would not survive the harsh winter.  Lieutenant Burkhart was liberated from this camp in early September.   Lieutenant Burkhart remained in the Army and had a distinguished  career with the quartermaster corps, retiring in 1957 as a lieutenant  colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve. Throughout his life, he was plagued  by health problems most likely caused by the illnesses and hardships of  being a POW. In 1972, at age 57, he passed away and was buried in  Arlington National Cemetery.   Thomas Burkhart's daughter Caroline has honored his memory by working  tirelessly to preserve the history of the POW experience and to teach  its lessons of American perseverance and grit. Ms. Burkhart is an  active member of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor  Memorial Society. In this year, the 75th anniversary of the fall of the  Philippines, we appreciate the effort by Japan to reach out to Ms.  Burkhart and the American POWs in the spirit of reconciliation and  healing.   I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Caroline Burkhart a safe  and meaningful journey and in expressing our gratitude and appreciation  to Thomas F. Burkhart and all veterans of the war in the Pacific for  their heroic service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
