 Madam Speaker, I rise in the name of liberty and  justice for all. I rise in the name of liberty and justice for all  because the criminal justice system is on trial. It is on trial in the  court of world opinion. It is on trial for crimes committed against  human beings in this country.   Some of the complainants would include Eric Garner, Tamir Rice,  Breonna Taylor, George Floyd.   I rise in the name of liberty and justice for all because we have  reached a point in our history wherein there is one case now that seems  to have reached the pinnacle of the system, such that everyone is  waiting to see how this case will eventually address liberty and  justice for all.   One of the complaints is that in this country we have allowed  arresting officers, that we confer enormous power on, literally, the  power to execute when necessary.   But the question is: Will these arresting officers not only have the  power to arrest, but also the power to be judge, jury, prosecutor, and  executioner?   This is the question before the court of world opinion.   We have a case that embraces decades, perhaps even centuries of  misdeeds. My hope is that we will receive a just ruling. My prayer is  that, if there is not a just ruling, we will have peaceful protests. I  believe in peaceful protests. I have gone to jail participating in  peaceful protests. I have gone to jail with John Lewis participating in  peaceful protests. Twice, he and I were jailed together.   So I rise in the name of liberty and justice for all, understanding  that we have an opportunity now to demonstrate to the world that we  will not allow an arresting officer to be judge, jury, prosecutor, and  executioner. But I also understand, given the history of this country,  unfortunately, that things don't always work out as I believe they  should.   So my hope is that there will be peaceful protests, but I do hope  that the protests will take place if there is not a just verdict. There  is nothing wrong with peaceful protests in this country. There is  nothing wrong with confronting injustice in this country. There is  nothing wrong with standing up for the rights of those who are being  denied liberty and justice for all in this country.   I want to see peaceful protests if the wrong verdict is rendered.  And, in my opinion, the verdict that we should have is arresting  officers can't be judge, jury, prosecutor, and executioner. There are  those who would say that I don't have the right to come to these  conclusions at this time, and they are wrong.   In the court of public opinion, world opinion, many have already come  to this same conclusion. I am merely echoing what they have said. As  such, I am a messenger, and the message is: Let's pray for a just  decision in the court of world opinion.                            ____________________
