 Mr. Speaker, today's debate on H.R. 3905, Minnesota's  Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, also known as the  MINER Act, is not just important to the great State of Minnesota: this  legislation is critically important to the United States.   The MINER Act will reverse the misguided last minute actions of the  Obama administration to stop any exploration of one of the most  valuable precious metal deposits in the world. The MINER Act will  ensure that the people of Minnesota will have the opportunity for jobs  and economic prosperity that would come if the deposit can ever be  mined in an environmentally safe and responsible manner.   The MINER Act will renew the Federal Government's commitment and  promise to the citizens of Minnesota. When the Superior National Forest  was created in 1909, and later when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area was  established in 1978, there was an express agreement between the Federal  Government and the State of Minnesota that mining and logging could  continue in the Superior National Forest.                                time  1330    In fact, according to the most recent Superior National Forest Land  and Resource Management Plan, mining and logging are considered  desirable conditions in the forest.   This is about more than 10,000 jobs, which are now at risk because of  the lameduck actions of the Obama administration. This is about  billions of dollars in revenue for Minnesota's economy and billions  more in potential education funding for Minnesota's schools that are  now on the line.   This is also about strategically important metals and minerals, which  are used by Americans every day. The MINER Act, again, is about  protecting Minnesota's right to explore and, if environmentally  appropriate, to mine valuable precious metals--precious metals that are  not only necessary to our everyday technology, but which are critically  important to our Nation's national defense.   There are some who would like to deny Minnesota the right to explore  and potentially mine these precious metals. They argue that any mining  activity could negatively impact our beloved Boundary Waters Canoe Area  Wilderness. This concern, however, ignores the fact that if a mine is  ever proposed--and one has not, but if one is ever proposed--in the  Superior National Forest, it would have to satisfy all current local,  State, and Federal environmental review and permitting requirements  before it could ever be approved to proceed.   We can and we will protect the Boundary Waters. I have no doubt we  could find a way to preserve Minnesota's pristine landscape without  permanently destroying any future job creation or economic development  in Minnesota.   By passing the MINER Act today, we protect thousands of jobs and  billions of dollars in revenue and education funding while leaving an  extensive process intact to protect and preserve the environment and  our State.   In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the MINER  Act, because we know that someday someone might find a way to mine  these important precious metals in a safe and environmentally  responsible way. And if that happens, Minnesota deserves the  opportunity and the jobs and economic prosperity that will ensue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, today's debate on H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic Rights  in the Superior National Forest Act, also known as the MINER Act, is  not just important to the great State of Minnesota.

In fact, according to the  most recent Superior National Forest land use management plan, mining  and logging are considered a desired condition in the forest.   This is about more than just the 10,000-plus jobs which are now at  risk because of the lameduck actions of the Obama administration. This  is about billions of dollars in revenue for Minnesota's economy and  billions more in potential education funding for Minnesota's schools  that are now on the line. This is about strategically important metals  and minerals which are used by Americans every day. This is about  undoing a last-ditch effort to further a political agenda at the  expense of the livelihoods that Minnesotans have relied on for  generations.   The MINER Act, again, is about protecting Minnesota's right to  explore and, if environmentally appropriate, mine valuable and  important precious metals, precious metals that are not only necessary  to our everyday technology, but which are critically important to our  Nation's national defense.   There are some who would like to deny Minnesota the right to explore  and potentially mine these precious metals. They argue that any mining  activity could negatively impact our beloved Boundary Waters Canoe  Area. This concern, however, ignores the fact that, if a mine is ever  proposed, and to date there has been no mine proposed, if one is ever  proposed in the Superior National Forest, it would have to satisfy all  current local, State, and Federal environmental review and permitting  requirements before it could ever be approved to proceed.   We can and we will protect the Boundary Waters. I have no doubt that  we can find a way to preserve Minnesota's pristine landscape without  permanently destroying any future job creation or economic development  in Minnesota.

[[Page H9501]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the additional  time, and I recognize my esteemed colleague, the Representative from  Minnesota, for his love of the Boundary Waters that we both share.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address the Representative from California  first on the claim that H.R. 3905 solely benefits a foreign mining  company.   I think you should ask the people of our State. You should ask a  gentleman by the name of Dan Forsman, who, as a Minnesotan, has a  family heritage of benefiting by mining in our State. He was recently  ridiculed by environmentalists in The New York Times because, while he  loves the place where he lives, he also wants to make a living in the  place where he lives. There are several other companies exploring the  area.   Teck has nonferrous mineral holdings within the proposed withdrawal,  the potential development of which would be greatly impacted by the  withdrawal.   Encampment Minerals, Inc., also has a nonferrous mineral holding  within the withdrawal area and is awaiting Federal agency action on a  submitted preference right lease application.   Future expansion of the Northshore Mining taconite mine could extend  into the withdrawal area and, thus, be impacted by the withdrawal.   PolyMet has invested hundreds of millions on projects that will be  negatively impacted by the proposed mineral withdrawal, one of which we  voted on here last night.   Further, the withdrawal proposal will seriously hinder the State's  ability to seek mineral development of more than 90,000 acres of State  school trust fund lands within the withdrawal area.   Twin Metals is a Minnesota company and has been part of the  northeastern Minnesota community for 10 years. The company has invested  more than $400 million in project development activities, investing in  new facilities in the city of Ely, providing local employment  opportunities and supporting hundreds of local jobs in the  construction, consulting, and contracting sectors. By the way, they  also support all the outfitters, the wonderful businesses of tourism.  Twin Metals has also contributed more than $320,000 to local  philanthropic needs and organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I would add that nothing in this bill alters any current  environmental law or protection. The Antiquities Act, the Federal Land  Policy and Management Act, NEPA, and all the other laws still apply to  Minnesota.   At the end of the day, we are protecting the Boundary Waters, we are  protecting the Superior National Forest, and we believe both the  economy and tourism, the environment, can coexist in northern  Minnesota.
