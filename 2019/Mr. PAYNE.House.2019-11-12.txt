 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise my colleagues in this  Chamber for the support of the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   This bill will make it easier for elderly and disabled citizens to  get the lifesaving and life-preserving medications they need at prices  they can afford.   It would finally give Medicare the power to negotiate directly with  the drug companies to get these prices lower. Once they agree on a new  price, this bill would make that price available to the American people  with private insurance as well as those with Medicare. Then it would  take some of the savings from these lowered prices and use it to find  new cures for cancer and other diseases through NIH.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this bill and my party's continued  commitment to people over profits.                            ____________________
