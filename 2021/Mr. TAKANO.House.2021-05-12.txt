DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM ON DOG                     TRAINING THERAPY.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of the Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall commence the conduct of a pilot program to provide       canine training to eligible veterans diagnosed with post-      traumatic stress disorder (in this section referred to as       ``PTSD'') as an element of a complementary and integrative       health program for such veterans.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1448, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am so pleased that we have reported Congressman    Steve Stivers' bill, the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act, favorably out  of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and are bringing it to the floor  today with the support of over 300 Members on both sides of the aisle.   I am especially pleased to have negotiated, with the help of Ranking  Member Bost, a new bipartisan version of the bill in time for  Congressman Stivers to see it move before he leaves Congress.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has been a leader in offering  veterans with PTSD and other invisible wounds of war a wide spectrum of  evidence-based treatment options and adjunctive approaches to promote  their mental health and well-being. This bill ensures that veterans can  participate in service dog training through pilot program partnerships  between VA and accredited service dog training nonprofit organizations  across the country.   Madam Speaker, the bill also removes current impediments to VA's  ability to prescribe mental health service dogs for veterans with PTSD,  and a newly added section ensures that VA's current veterinary  insurance benefit is also extended to those veterans receiving mental  health service dogs through VA.   I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the PAWS for  Veterans Therapy Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), my good friend and member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee and original cosponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I am delighted that the Veterans' Affairs  Committee can, once again, unite America, including Michiganders and  the Buckeye State.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice), my  good friend and former member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and  lead Democratic cosponsor.   Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 1448, the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. No group in America is  more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress and other mental  health conditions than our veterans.   Tragically, as my friend Congressman Stivers just said, this means  that 22 veterans are dying every single day by suicide. This is a  crisis. We cannot look the other way. We must make sure that our  veterans have access to every available mental health resource out  there.   The research on this issue is clear. Service dogs are proven to help  people suffering from a wide array of mental health conditions,  including PTSD. I have seen the evidence of this with my own eyes.  Veterans have told me that they would not be here today if it weren't  for their service dog. That is how much these dogs mean and that is why  this bill is so critical.                                time  1245    By creating a pilot program on dog training therapy at the VA and  providing service dogs to veterans, this bill won't just improve lives;  it will save them.   I am incredibly proud to co-lead this bipartisan bill, and I thank my  friend, Representative   Steve Stivers, who is a great American and a  true gentleman, for introducing it.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill today. Madam  Speaker, I also thank the great chairman of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, Congressman Takano.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also thank my colleague, the ranking  member, Congressman Bost from Illinois, for his bipartisanship.   I do believe that H.R. 1448 is now in a form that would be acceptable  to the Senate, and I am hopeful that it will pass.   I wish our colleague from the State of Ohio (Mr. Stivers) the best of  luck on this new chapter in his life.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  1448, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 958) to codify maternity care coordination programs at the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 958         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Moms Who Served       Act''.       SEC. 2. SUPPORT FOR MATERNITY CARE COORDINATION.

(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary $15,000,000 for fiscal       year 2022 for the maternity care coordination program. Such       amounts are authorized in addition to any other amounts       authorized for such purpose.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``community maternity care providers'' means       maternity care providers located at non-Department facilities       who provide maternity care to veterans under section 1703 of       title 38, United States Code, or other provisions of law       administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.        (2) The term ``non-Department facilities'' has the meaning       given that term in section 1701 of title 38, United States       Code.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON MATERNAL MORTALITY AND SEVERE MATERNAL                     MORBIDITY AMONG PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM                     VETERANS.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Maternal mortality.--The term ``maternal mortality''       means a death occurring during or within a one-year period       after pregnancy, caused by pregnancy-related or childbirth       complications, including a suicide, overdose, or other death       resulting from a mental health or substance use disorder       attributed to or aggravated by pregnancy-related or       childbirth complications.        (2) Postpartum and postpartum period.--The terms       ``postpartum'' and ``postpartum period'' refer to the 1-year       period beginning on the last day of the pregnancy of an       individual.        (3) Pregnancy-associated death.--The term ``pregnancy-      associated death'' means a death of a pregnant or postpartum       individual, by any cause, that occurs during, or within 1       year following, the individual's pregnancy, regardless of the       outcome, duration, or site of the pregnancy.        (4) Pregnancy-related death.--The term ``pregnancy-related       death'' means a death of a pregnant or postpartum individual       that occurs during, or within 1 year following, the       individual's pregnancy, from a pregnancy complication, a       chain of events initiated by pregnancy, or the aggravation of       an unrelated condition by the physiologic effects of       pregnancy.        (5) Racial and ethnic minority group.--The term ``racial       and ethnic minority group'' has the meaning given such term       in section 1707(g)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 300u-6(g)(1)).        (6) Severe maternal morbidity.--The term ``severe maternal       morbidity'' means a health condition, including mental health       conditions and substance use disorders, attributed to or       aggravated by pregnancy or childbirth that results in       significant short-term or long-term consequences to the       health of the individual who was pregnant.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 958.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the United States is the only industrialized nation  where the maternal mortality rate is on the rise, and we have one of  the highest rates of maternal mortality in the developed world.   Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native moms die from complications  from pregnancy at approximately three times the rate of White, Latina,  Asian-American, and Pacific Islander women, regardless of income or  education levels.   Today, women veterans are the fastest-growing cohort in the veteran  population, and more than 40 percent of women veterans using VA for  their healthcare are of reproductive age. Black women serve in high  numbers and represent nearly one-third of women using VA for their  healthcare.   The Protecting Moms Who Served Act, introduced by Congresswoman  Lauren Underwood, would codify maternity care coordination in law and  provide additional resources to the Department of Veterans Affairs to  ensure that veterans receive the best prenatal and postpartum care  possible.   Madam Speaker, we do not yet know if pregnant veterans have better,  worse, or equal rates of maternal mortality compared to nonveterans.  This bill would address this knowledge gap by requiring the Government  Accountability Office to conduct a comprehensive study on maternal  mortality and morbidity among veterans.   This study would not only examine racial and ethnic disparities in  maternal mortality and morbidity but also would seek to capture data  from Federal programs besides VA, including TRICARE and Medicaid as  well as the Indian Health Service, private insurance, and the  uninsured.   While there is not yet enough data to make an authoritative  conclusion, there is some evidence that veterans who use VA have lower  maternal mortality rates than nonveterans. The study mandated by this  bill would identify what best practices VA has implemented that result  in better maternal health outcomes.   Madam Speaker, last year, approximately 6,000 veterans using VA  became new moms. Moms who have served our Nation exemplify strength and  resilience. Supporting moms means ensuring gender equity, and that  begins with health equity. I, therefore, ask my colleagues to join me  in supporting the Protecting Moms Who Served Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), my good friend and chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Health, and also the cosponsor of this important piece  of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood), my good friend and  author of this bill, and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee  on Health.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted that we are taking this significant  step in addressing the terrible mortality rates that we are facing  among our Nation's moms, especially our moms of color. And to the  extent that we can shed light on this issue through this very important  legislation being brought forward by Ms. Underwood and Ms. Brownley, I  think that this is truly, truly a tremendous step forward.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 49 to designate  the Pulse nightclub as a national memorial site and to honor those  whose lives were taken by a gunman with hate in his heart.                                time  1330    I thank the gentleman for his leadership and his response with H.R.  49 along with Congresswoman Murphy. I visited with Mr. Soto in Florida  near Orlando and actually toured the Pulse nightclub site, and what a  poignant visitation that was.   Almost 5 years ago, the Nation awoke to the heartbreaking news of a  mass shooting that unfolded at a nightclub in Orlando. Forty-nine lives  were taken, and 53 others were injured. It was another devastating loss  to the LGBTQ-plus community and our Nation.   The gunman had targeted Pulse nightclub, a nightclub frequented by  Orlando's Latino and LGBTQ-plus communities. This was a safe place for  many of the people who were there that night. The shooter violated a  safe space where LGBTQ people, and, in this case, LGBTQ-plus people of  color were able to be themselves and to live and dance freely without  fear or judgment.   Our community--that is, the LGBTQ-plus community--is still healing  from this attack, and families and friends are still mourning the loss  of their loved ones. I will never forget waking up in my Washington,  D.C. apartment as I was scrolling through the news, and I was just in  disbelief that another shooting had occurred. Since then, we have had  so many other senseless shootings.   By designating the Pulse nightclub as a national memorial site, we  can always remember the vibrant lives of those we lost. This memorial  will serve as a reminder that we cannot stop fighting for equality.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  49.
