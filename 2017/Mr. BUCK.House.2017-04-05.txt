 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 242 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 242         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1219) to       amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to expand the       investor limitation for qualifying venture capital funds       under an exemption from the definition of an investment       company. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  . On any legislative day during the period from       April 7, 2017, through April 24, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 4.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar day for       purposes of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.       1546).        Sec. 5.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's Innovators  Act of 2017, will allow America's small businesses to thrive, creating  jobs, developing incredible products and services, and growing our  Nation's economy.   Starting a business, designing a product, developing a service, these  projects often require upfront capital. For entrepreneurs and startups  in this country, access to capital is one of the biggest hurdles they  will face. Without it, they may not have the cash on hand for research  and development, the funds to make payroll at the end of the month, or  the raw material needed to start production.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1219 seeks to provide more sources of funding for  our small businesses by raising the cap that requires a group of  investors to register as an investment company. This change in the law  is important. It allows angel funds, which are basically a pool of  accredited investors, to permit up to 250 investors in one fund as  opposed to the 100 permitted by current law.   As long as the fund does not exceed $10 million in capital  commitments, it would be considered a qualified venture capital fund  that is exempt from costly registration with the SEC.   Angel funds allow individuals who may not otherwise invest in  startups to join together and direct their investment dollars to  promising young companies. Without raising the cap on the size of these  funds, we may be pushing potential investors out of the market.   Small businesses, in their earliest stages, often have nowhere to  turn for credit. While banks have historically been a source of funds,  in recent years, small business loans from banks have declined. That is  where these groups of individual investors come in. In many cases, they  are providing just enough cash to push businesses off the ground to the  next level of funding; but by overregulating groups of angel investors,  we are blocking significant sources of capital from ever reaching  startups.   We need to wisely regulate in this country, and this legislation  doesn't eliminate the need for larger investment funds to register with  the SEC. It simply raises the cap for smaller groups of individuals to  contribute a limited amount of funds to the American small business  community. For businesses on the receiving end, these funds may be the  difference between success and bankruptcy.   Thankfully, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act has already  raised the cap requiring companies to register with the SEC from 500  investors to 2,000 investors. By allowing small companies  [[Page H2709]]  to seek more individual investors, these businesses can expand the  number of individuals who have a stake in the company's future, the  number of individuals who will ensure the venture succeeds.   H.R. 1219 is a natural complement to the JOBS Act, allowing those  potential investors to more easily join their resources to efficiently  and successfully invest in America's small businesses. In fact, the  current limit on the number of investors who can join together, set by  the Investment Company Act of 1940, is a relic from nearly 80 years  ago. In the past 80 years, our financial market and our economy have  drastically changed. The barriers to entry for small businesses in many  industries are lower than ever.   Just yesterday, I spent time with Etash Kalra. Etash is a young man  from my district who won the Congressional App Challenge. Already, in  high school, he takes computer science classes and codes smartphone  apps. He even started a club to teach others programming.   He and students like him have many of the skills needed to start a  small business. They have the ability to create software programs that  consumers want and need. They may start small, they may start in high  school, but they hold great potential.   Many individual investors may see that potential. This bill allows  those investors to make a down payment on the future of these young  entrepreneurs. Without growing the sources and amount of capital  available to these businesses, we will end up stifling the innovation  and entrepreneurial spirit that our country is known for.   Our Nation is successful because Americans are innovators and hard  workers. Those Americans who start businesses embody this spirit. We  are not here asking for the government to help these people succeed.  No, these individuals are fully capable of building businesses on their  own. But we are here asking the government to step out of the way so  that our fellow citizens can help American small businesses succeed.   This rule and the underlying legislation should not be controversial.  Last Congress, similar legislation passed the Financial Services  Committee by a vote of 57-2. It then passed the House by a vote of 388- 9.   Yesterday, I came to the House floor and spoke about the importance  of passing bipartisan bills. Many Americans see their Capital awash in  partisanship and bickering. They suffer under poorly crafted policies,  while politicians in D.C. fail to find consensus on legislation that  would help. They wonder why politicians who talk about bipartisanship  on the campaign trail can't come together in Washington to pass  commonsense legislation.   The challenge before us is to find solutions to our Nation's problems  that overlap the principles held by both parties. That is why this bill  is refreshing. It stands as an exemplar of the sort of consensus-driven  legislation that can earn America's trust.   Everyone can agree that innovative companies help the American  economy grow and add to the quality of life in our Nation. Everyone  recognizes how important access to capital is for small businesses.   This bill was reported out of the Financial Services Committee with  overwhelming support. I ask now that the entire House support the rule  and this underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an inquiry for the Speaker, if I may.  What is the title of this bill?    That is all right, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate it.   I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my  friend.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of an old Western movie, ``The Man Who  Shot Liberty Valance,'' and a line in that movie: ``When the legend  becomes fact, print the legend.''   It turns out, Mr. Speaker, that this bill was marked up without any  amendments on March 9, 2017, in the Senate Banking Committee and was  favorably reported unanimously and without any amendments offered. It  was also marked up on March 9, 2017, in the Financial Services  Committee and was reported out with a 54-2 vote.   There were no amendments offered on this particular legislation, Mr.  Speaker, in the Rules Committee; and, as a matter of practice, it is  considered a closed rule because there were no amendments offered. So  the idea that somehow this legislation has been hidden and that we are  engaging in some sort of subterfuge is not accurate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hultgren), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Massachusetts quoting me  yesterday, and I would love to just emphasize a few of the words that  he said a moment ago: I also shudder to think if Hillary Clinton won  the Presidency.   My friend was kind enough to focus his half hour on H.R. 1219,  Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017. It is, in fact, a great  piece of legislation, and I am proud to close now on that bill.   We have the opportunity today to improve access to capital for  America's entrepreneurs and startups. The men and women who start  companies in this Nation put everything on the line. They give of their  time and their financial resources. They give of their weekends and  evenings and vacations.   Our economy relies on the small businesses that these men and women  create. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. They  provide jobs and important products and services. They contribute to  the life of their communities.   If we want to grow our economy, if we want to increase hiring, if we  want to improve our quality of life, then we need to unleash America's  entrepreneurs and startups. That is why we need to support this bill.   We must expand access to credit for small-business owners. We need to  make it easier for angel investors to take a risk on young companies.  We are not asking the American taxpayer to take a risk or spend any  money on this. We are simply asking the Federal Government to allow  angel investors to join together in larger groups to invest in  promising young American companies.   I am encouraged that this bill represents a bipartisan effort to make  small-business owners in this country more rewarding. When the cost of  starting a small business is outweighed by the reward, our country will  benefit from the resulting innovation and job creation. We simply need  to give entrepreneurs the tools they need to succeed, and one of those  tools is access to capital.   America's entrepreneurs and startups need H.R. 1219. Americans who  want to work for small businesses need H.R. 1219. Americans who want to  buy great products, access incredible services, and visit amazing  websites all need H.R. 1219.   I thank Chief Deputy Whip McHenry for introducing this important  bill, and I thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing this legislation  before us. I also thank Representative Velazquez, Representative  Hollingsworth, Representative Sherman, and Representative Gottheimer  for cosponsoring this legislation.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on  the bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 242 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend  [[Page H2715]]       the rule because the majority Member controlling the time       will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the       same result may be achieved by voting down the previous       question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous       question is defeated, control of the time passes to the       Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous       question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may       offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of       amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
