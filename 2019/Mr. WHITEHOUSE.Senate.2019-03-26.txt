 Mr. President, I will speak very briefly.   Rhode Island is a coastal State, and we are now looking at maps that  our coastal agency, the local university, and the scientists at NOAA  tell us will create a new face of Rhode Island in the decades ahead if  we don't address climate change. We turn into an archipelago. We lose  enormous amounts of waterfront, and as a small State, frankly, we don't  have a lot to give back to the ocean. This is deadly serious for us.   I join in my colleague's sense of offense that the other side thinks  this is something funny. This is not funny for Rhode Islanders; this is  deadly real. You may disagree with us, but the one thing that, I think,  we are owed on this subject is sincerity, but there is nothing sincere  about the vote that is going to be held on the Green New Deal.   This is a vote that will be based on a cartoon version of the Green  New Deal that was cooked up by the Koch brothers, who have their oily  hands all over this mess, and it was instructed by the fossil fuel  mouthpiece of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page. It took only  days for the majority leader to hop up and do the bidding of these  farces.   We are owed better than this. If you disagree with our measures,  fine. Have one of your own. We have five or six different bills and  strategies that we are willing to work on. This is the time to be  serious, to be sincere, and to quit mocking a concern that across the  board is recognized as real. In fact, there is not a Republican here  who can't go to his home State university and be told about the truth  of climate change.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    I appreciate the comments of my distinguished  chairman on the Environmental Works Committee about carbon capture  technology, and I am wondering what part of the carbon emissions  problem he thinks carbon capture will solve, because leaders of the  carbon capture technology sector have said it is their vision to  capture 1 percent--1 percent--of carbon emissions.   What I conclude from that is that carbon capture technology is  important, but to rely on it at the expense of the course of action  that we really need is profoundly misguided.    I am interested in the other 99 percent.                                Cloture Motion
