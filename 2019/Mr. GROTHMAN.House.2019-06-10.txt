 Madam Speaker, I would like to spend today addressing  the events over the weekend with regard to President Trump's decision  and then decision to withdraw the threat of a 5 percent tariff on goods  coming in through Mexico.   I particularly want to comment with regard to observations that I  have made, because 10 days ago I was in Mexico in the Laredo sector of  the border, and about 4 months ago I was in the Tucson sector of the  border. Both times, I received a thorough tour of the border from our  great Border Patrol, and the observations that I have made down there  lead me to believe that we ought to stick with President Trump as he  does what he can to defend our border. Indeed, my analysis in both  Arizona and Texas is that, right now, we are facing one of the greatest  threats to the future of America.   Before going into it in general, I would like to thank our Border  Patrol for all the wonderful things they are doing.    I don't know how many Americans know that, right now, our Border  Patrol has 2,000 empty positions. The Border Patrol should have 21,000  people. It has got only 19,000 people on the border.   Right now, we are in the position in which the Border Patrol is  processing over 130,000 people a month, up from only a bit over 40,000  a month just 7 or 8 years ago. This means, since, like everything else  in the world, a lot of paperwork is required wherever something is  done, that the Border Patrol is woefully underfunded and understaffed.   I would like to apologize to the Border Patrol for a statement made  by one of my colleagues in which she stated:         With five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their       families, I feel like the evidence is really clear that this       is intentional. It is a policy choice being made on purpose,       and it is cruel and inhumane.    Madam Speaker, I will tell you, those Border Patrol folks and the  customs people are working as hard as they possibly can. Maybe people  don't realize that, last month, over 13,000 unaccompanied minors came  across the border. That is not people who are separated from their  families. Those are minors who come in separated from their families.  Many of these people have spent days coming through Mexico to come  here.   We were told that one of the problems they had is that, when Border  Patrol began to take care of kids, some of these kids were used to  having one meal every 2 days. It took a while for their bodies to get  used to having three meals a day. They are receiving medical care  within the first 48 hours they are here and thorough medical care  within 72 hours after they come here.   I would say that people coming here are getting better medical care  than perhaps they have ever had in their life--and surely better  nutrition than they have had in a long time, better education than they  have had in a long time.   For Members of Congress to respond to the great deal that the Border  Patrol is doing when, inevitably, despite their best efforts, a couple  of people have come here without medical treatment for weeks, to claim  that the Border Patrol or somehow the administration is intentionally  allowing kids to die after they worked so hard to save the kids is one  of the most embarrassing things I have seen in this Congress.   I assure members of the Border Patrol that, at least among the people  I hang around with, we respect the job they are doing, and I invite all  of my colleagues to come down to the border so they don't make a  ridiculous statement that, when a few people are not able to be kept  alive down there, it is something done on purpose.                                time  2015    Let's look at the crisis down there and the hand Donald Trump is  being dealt.   In May, the Border Patrol itself--and this is before Customs, just  the Border Patrol--found over 130,000 people crossing the border. The  vast majority of those came here seeking asylum, which means they  aren't going to be kicked out. They are given a court date 3, 4, or 5  years out in the future and given a green card to go find a job.  [[Page H4386]]    This is a much worse situation than when large numbers of people  crossed the border 12 or 15 years ago. At that time, people would come  across, and they would be told to go back. They would try again, and  they would go back. We might have the same person counted three or four  times.   Here, with the vast majority being asylum claims, they will stay  here, and they will get green cards. We are in a situation in which our  Border Patrol is overwhelmed, not to mention we are no longer picking  our immigrants, as we do when people are sworn in legally, as we do  when they get regular work permits. Instead, we are getting people who  are sneaking in here or claiming asylum under questionable  circumstances.   We also find that when we are, in essence, telling the world that we  have open borders, more and more people come here. When we talked to  Customs, which is a small segment of the number of people who are  coming here, we were getting people from beyond Mexico or Central  America. We are getting people from Venezuela. We are getting people  from Cuba. We are getting people from Africa. In other words, the whole  world is finding out that, right now, we are not enforcing our  immigration laws.   It is not surprising that when a lot of people come here,  particularly when we are dealing with a border controlled by dangerous  cartels, that people die trying to get in here. In the Tucson sector  last year, almost 250 people were found dehydrated to death. The reason  they were found that way is because the cartels may escort them to the  United States, but they don't escort them to civilization. They just  direct them to go one place or the other, and they wind up dying in the  desert.   In the Laredo sector, it is not unusual to have people drown in the  Rio Grande River. Again, because there is a perception that America  doesn't enforce its immigration laws, people try to walk across the Rio  Grande. They are swept under, in the undertow, and they wind up dying.  They wind up drowning.   Again, these deaths are the fault of a system in which people believe  that we do not enforce our immigration laws.   What was President Trump to do? The obvious thing to do would be to  tell Congress that we need more Border Patrol agents so that people  don't sneak in here. The obvious thing to do would be to tell Congress  that we need more judges to make sure that when people claim asylum,  their claims are heard immediately, and they can be sent back rather  than sit around here for 3 or 4 years. The obvious thing to do would be  to build a wall, which may cost $7 billion or $8 billion.   If we do those three things, we would send a message to the world  that our immigration laws are supposed to be respected. We would no  longer have so many people drown in the Rio Grande. We would no longer  have so many people dehydrate to death. We would no longer have a  situation in which the U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for probably over  $100 billion a year between medical expenses, education expenses, and  criminal justice expenses. That is what would happen if we began to  enforce our immigration laws.   However, when President Trump asked for help from this body, this  Congress that is so quick to spend money on everything, this Congress  that last time around increased discretionary spending over 11 percent  in 1 year, this House of Representatives that is about to pass a series  of appropriations bills increasing discretionary spending by 4 or 5  percent a year, all of a sudden, this Congress decides to get frugal on  the one thing that is the biggest crisis of all.   So, President Trump is in a box. Because we won't give him any more  money, eventually, he decides that perhaps by imposing tariffs on  Mexico, he can stop what amounts to an invasion of the United States.   What does President Trump get? He gets Senators from his own party  shooting at him from behind. He gets American businesses looking at  their profit and loss for the next quarter, profit and loss for the  next year, not considering the damage that is done to America over the  next 2, 3, 4, or 5 years as unlimited people are coming here. They are  shooting him in the back. Shame on the Republicans.   I am not afraid of being critical of President Trump. He tweets a  little too much. But I will tell my colleagues that when President  Trump is finally trying to get us to enforce our borders, he is being  shot at by his own team, by members of the Chamber of Commerce and by  Republican Members of the Senate. This has to stop, or we are going to  lose our country.   It is important that the American people stand up and let their  elected representatives know this cannot go on any longer. We have to  do something about the border.   It is embarrassing how little this body is doing. It is embarrassing  the small amount of money or no money that is being spent in the areas  that it has to be spent. Quite frankly, it is embarrassing that more  Congressmen are not speaking out on what is going on at the southern  border, other than our friend from Illinois, who kind of implies that  when somebody dies in the horrible system that exists right now, that  it was done intentionally.   In any event, I encourage American businesses to stop looking at just  what is going on in their profit and loss statements next quarter or  next year. I encourage the Republican representatives, all  representatives, to understand that President Trump, when he tries to  do something at the border, he is trying to protect America in the  future and not get cheap political points by implying that we can  continue to go ahead with the current system of over 130,000 people  coming here.   I do want to point out that President Trump, who is very pro- immigrant, is not talking about reducing the 700,000 new people sworn  in as Americans every year. President Trump is not talking about  reducing the 4 million people who are here every year on work permits.  Indeed, President Trump has made it clear that we could increase that  number of people coming here legally.    We have to stop people coming across the border on bogus claims of  asylum and sneaking across the border and other places.   It is time for this House to act. Fill those vacant 2,000 slots on  the Border Patrol and add another 2,000 or 3,000.   It is time for this body to act and get some judges on the border to  adjudicate the asylum claims.   It is time for this House to act and make sure that we have a secure  border through a wall.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
