 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge Congress to help  the neediest and most vulnerable flood victims from our Nation's recent  hurricanes.   Our district in Houston and Harris County, Texas, is familiar with  hurricanes and disaster recovery. We rebuilt our communities after  Allison in 2001, and again in 2008, after Hurricane Ike.   Texans are proud and independent people. We take pride in our self- reliance and can-do attitude. However, many members of our community-- low-income families, seniors, and disabled Americans--are in the  greatest need and must rely on others for help.   Current rules can prevent the neediest victims from receiving  assistance they need to recover and rebuild their homes, including  denying individuals Federal assistance for being able to afford flood  insurance premiums that can exceed over $4,000 a year. That is out of  range for most of these folks.   As America's elected representatives, we have a moral responsibility  to act and protect our Nation's most vulnerable disaster victims,  especially our seniors and disabled, from being left with nothing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to stand with the  hundreds of thousands of Texas families victimized by Hurricane Harvey,  and urge our state and federal officials to use available resources to  help our fellow Americans in their time of need.   With nearly four-and-a-half feet of rain and 130 mile per hour winds,  Hurricane Harvey is the largest and most expensive natural disaster to  hit Texas in living memory. At least 270,000 homes and residences were  damaged in our state. Most tragically, over 75 innocent people lost  their lives as a result of Harvey, most of them in Harris County.   Later today the U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on a  $36.5 billion disaster supplemental bill to sustain relief and recovery  efforts in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   This is not a perfect bill. I would have strongly preferred Congress  provide dedicated funds to rebuild Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast,  especially dedicated funding towards our region's flood control  infrastructure and immediate housing needs for hurricane victims.   However, this supplemental will sustain the current recovery efforts  till the damages caused by these devastating hurricanes can be fully  assessed. Today's supplemental is on top of $15 billion in emergency  funding Congress passed last month in the immediate aftermath of  Harvey.   The bipartisan Texas Congressional Delegation is committed to  securing the substantial federal funds Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast  need to rebuild and be prepared for the next big storm before the  holiday season.   Our local officials, in particular the Governor of Texas and the  state legislature, have the opportunity right now to act and ramp-up  rebuilding efforts through our state's Economic Stabilization Fund.   Popularly known as Texas's ``rainy day fund,'' the ESF currently has  over $10 billion available for emergencies. There can be no question  that the destruction caused by Harvey and the immediate needs of tens  of thousands of Texans are an emergency and are the reason why our  state has been investing in a rainy day fund in the first place.   Harris County Judge Ed Emmett and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner have  already called on Governor Greg Abbott to use his authority to tap the  rainy day fund and help Texans in need and rebuild our infrastructure.   I join Judge Emmett and Mayor Turner in calling on the governor to  immediately authorize emergency funding through our rainy day fund and  help rebuild Houston and Harris County.
