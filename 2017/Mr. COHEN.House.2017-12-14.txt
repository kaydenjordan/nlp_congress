 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter  be considered as the first sponsor of H.R. 3771, a bill originally  introduced by Representative Conyers of Michigan, for the purposes of  adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of  rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Biggs). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am a little late and I don't know exactly  what has been discussed. I serve on the Judiciary Committee with the  gentleman, and what we have seen in the Judiciary Committee is scary.   I am honored to be a Member of the United States Congress. I am  honored to be an American citizen. I see a threat to the independence  of the United States Congress in upholding its oath and looking out for  the best interests of its people and to our country.   I have Republican friends, as the gentleman does, on the other side  of the aisle, and I know that they, in representing their constituents,  are not fond of the totalitarian Russian Government and philosophy that  threatens NATO countries like Lithuania, and Estonia, and Latvia, and  Ukraine, and Georgia, with the power of the Russian military.   They do not like democracy. They do not like America, and they do not  like what we represent. They don't like freedom of the press. They  don't like freedom of religion. They don't like freedoms of elections.  They don't have really free elections. They say they do, but they kill  their opponents or they put them in jail on trumped-up charges, and  they count the votes. There is nothing good about Russia in regards of  democracy, and even within their constitution after they formed a  country after the Soviet Union fell apart.   Our Republican colleagues are like sheep, following the President in  attacking the FBI; in attacking the Justice Department; in attacking  heroic Americans who have risked their lives in the FBI, and heroic  Americans like Robert Mueller, who served in Vietnam and risked his  life and was wounded there, I believe. And they threaten them and talk  to them as if they are complicit with the Clinton campaign and trying  to do something to harm President Trump.   Mr. Mueller is a Republican, appointed first by a Republican, Bush,  and then later by a Democrat, Obama. He is as fine a human being as I  have come in contact with in my 11 years in Congress, and maybe as fine  a human being as I have come in contact with in my 68 years on Earth.                                time  1345    Mr. Rosenstein said glowing things about him yesterday and how heroic  he is and how strong he is, how dedicated he is, how patriotic he is,  and how honest he is.   For the Republicans to be trying to take this man down and to take  down others who serve in the FBI, the only reason they are doing this  is because they are finding information in their charge that implicates  the President of the United States in activities that are questionable  as far as his oath of office and border on treason. Because of that,  they attack the FBI, which is the top layer or the cream of the crop of  law enforcement.   And the President goes out and talks about our wonderful first  responders, but the top of the line he is against because they question  him.   That is when your country no longer exists, when it is all about the  leader, not about institutions, and not about other individuals who are  doing their jobs in a proper manner.   FBI Director Wray said nothing but good things about Robert Mueller.  I think Robert Mueller's job is in jeopardy from this President, who  likes to fire people, which is what he did on television, and he still  thinks he is on television. It is a big performance art. It is all  about performance art, and the star is Donald Trump. He acts and he is  the show; and the show goes on, and there is nothing else.   To fire Mueller is part of the show, to question what he has done in  arresting Manafort and Gates, guilty pleas, I think, from one of the  gentlemen he arrested--was it Papadopoulos?--and then a guilty plea  from Flynn. They don't plead guilty unless they are guilty.   Mueller is doing his job. He is trying to protect America. I think he  is the man of the year and will be the man of the year next year. He is  the one person between us and a kleptocracy and group of oligarchs, but  kleptocrats who are using their positions in government to benefit  themselves financially and to build up their wealth.   This tax bill we are talking about is part of the same thing. It is  oligarchs. No inheritance tax, meaning they get hundreds of millions of  dollars--hundreds of millions of dollars--and the President goes and  says to a middle class family earning $75,000: You will have $2,000  that you can spend any way you want, or you can even save it.   $2,000 is tip change at Orange Julius to those people, the big money,  hundreds of millions and hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars  as the inheritance tax being repealed and the AMT being repealed and  other changes.   And then they said: Oh, well, we only reduced the tax on the  wealthiest from 39 percent to 37 because they weren't going to get to  deduct as much of their State and local taxes, and it was going to hurt  them more.   Well, there are people who aren't in the top bracket who aren't going  to get to reduce their State and local taxes, and they gave them nada.  They gave all of it to the wealthiest.   And that is what this is about. This is about the wealthiest people  taking this country over and an oligarchy, and Trump is representative  of them. It is about him. It is not about institutions. It is not about  the Constitution. It is not about people. It is not about the First  Amendment.   So many of the people who support him are good, hardworking, decent  American people who don't want to be in bed with Russia and don't want  to give up our democracy and don't want to give up our free elections  to hacking and to internet social media games, and that is what we have  had.  [[Page H9934]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for having this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I have a bill I took over for Mr. Conyers with Mr.  Walter Jones, a Republican, that says you can't fire Mr. Mueller  without cause and gives a redress in court. Sheila Jackson Lee has  another. We have to be aware and alert. And if this happens, the people  have to let their Representatives know, and particularly the Republican  Representatives know, that they won't stand for it and they won't have  another Saturday Night Massacre, because Rosenstein said Mr. Mueller  has done nothing to be fired. He probably would not fire him, which  means Rosenstein will be fired, and that is the end of the rule of law,  and that is what makes us different from other countries, makes us  different from dictators and autocrats.
