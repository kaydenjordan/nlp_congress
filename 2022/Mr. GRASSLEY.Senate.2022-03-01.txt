 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, two things, and the first one is very  short but something that is sorrowful that we have to talk about,  Senator Feinstein losing her husband. Senator Feinstein is a friend of  mine. You get very well acquainted with people when you work with--like  when I was chairman of the Judiciary, and she was ranking member. For  years before that, she and I chaired or cochaired the drug caucus.   So we all know that she lost her husband of 42 years over this  weekend. We know that he had a long battle with cancer. Dick and Dianne  supported each other during everything life threw at them, and they had  fun along the way. Together, they were even stronger. Dianne has  dedicated herself to working for the people of California, and she had  no better confidant and supporter than her husband Dick.   Many Americans think that Senators of opposing political parties  don't get along, and that is not the case. All 100 of us know that  here. It is too bad that journalists always make controversy the center  of everything, so people--at least in Iowa--have an extraordinary view  that we never speak to each other, and that is not the case.   And I would just point out how Senator Feinstein and I have worked  together. Barbara and I express our deepest sympathy to Dianne and her  family on Dick's passing, as they grieve the loss of a life well lived.                             Biden Administration    Mr. President, now to another point that I have come to talk to my  colleagues about.   In Biden's inaugural address a year ago, he called repeatedly for  unity. He said:         We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can       join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.       For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and       fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage.    I was glad to hear him say all of those good intentions. I took it,  really, as an invitation for bipartisanship. It sounded like the Joe  Biden that I knew as a Senator for the 28 years that he and I worked  together. So I reached out early on to offer to work with him on  lowering the cost of prescription drugs.   But right out of the gate, he rejected good-faith offers from all of  us to work together on another COVID relief package, as Republicans and  Democrats had on five others throughout the year of 2020.   Even with the narrowest of margins, and you can't get much more  narrow than a 50-50 Senate, President Biden let his party's agenda be  dictated by the most radical progressive wing of his party. The extreme  radicals refused to compromise on a wish list having nothing to do with  COVID.   President Biden should instead have listened to Professor Larry  Summers. He was President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and President  Obama's Chief Economic Adviser. Professor Summers warned that all the  spending the progressives were insisting on would fuel the fires of  inflation, and now we know how right Professor Summers was.   But that $2 trillion spending binge just whet the appetite of the  very young radicals in the Democratic Party who don't remember the  1970s' stagflation. And if they had memories of stagflation, they  willingly ignored history.   Instead of offering to find common ground on issues like prescription  drug pricing, the Democrats wasted much of the year trying to spend  another $4 trillion on a slew of brandnew entitlement programs.   His one significant bipartisan achievement, passing a bipartisan  infrastructure bill, was all but gift wrapped and handed to him by a  bipartisan group of Senators.   Even then, liberal Democrats nearly derailed it by insisting its fate  be tied to the passage of their unrelated liberal spending spree that  is referred to as Build Back Better. Opponents called it ``Build Back  Worse.''   Thankfully, moderate Democrats in the House successfully delinked the  two bills, as we did in the Senate, and sent the infrastructure bill to  the President's desk. So that was a bipartisan victory for the  President, and it was a victory for bipartisanship in this Senate.   Now, even more importantly, thanks to the leadership of Senator  Manchin, along with the principled stand of Senator Sinema, Democrats  multibillion-dollar liberal spending spree floundered--Build Back  Better floundered. As a result, we avoided piling even more gasoline  into the inflation fire.   But as Larry Summers warned and Senator Manchin feared, the fire of  inflation is already burning brightly. It is picking the pockets of  hard-working, middle-class Americans, who are paying more for gas and  groceries, and, for that matter, everything else.   President Biden's reluctance to stand up to the radical voices in his  own party or listen to moderate criticism has led to failure after  failure.   There is President Biden's decision to shut down the Keystone  Pipeline day 1 of his administration and, more recently, to not shut  down Russia's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   But now, thanks to Germany and the Ukraine situation, that is shut  down--but no thanks to President Biden.   He pulled the few remaining troops out of Afghanistan in a chaotic  hurry, leaving Americans stranded.  [[Page S851]]    He has even accused friends across the aisle, people of my political  party whom he has long worked with, as being Jim Crow racists.   This isn't the uniting President that he promised that he would be on  January 20 of last year.   The good news is that it is not too late to change course. So,  hopefully, he will get a big voice from both political parties about it  is not too late to change course and work in a bipartisan way.   There is reason to believe that he is trying to be Franklin Delano  Roosevelt. But trying to be FDR without FDR's popularity and FDR's  supermajority in the Congress--that approach has failed.   I invite President Biden to face reality, ignore the radicals in his  political party, whether in Congress or on his staff, and work across  the aisle in a way I know we can. I saw that regularly for 28 years. Be  the President you promised to be at your inauguration, in other words.   The American people want action on issues that they are facing this  very day: inflation, spike in violent crimes, prescription drug costs,  open borders, and you could have a myriad of other things.   I could name three things that I am part of a bipartisan effort to  get things done: One, take on Big Tech, Klobuchar and Grassley; take on  the big meatpackers, Grassley and Tester and Fischer and Wyden; and  take on prescription drugs, as Wyden and I worked on that prior to last  year, when Democrats took over, and they forgot all about it.   Let's get some of these things done.   I yield the floor.
