 Mr. Speaker, you have heard in the last round of 60- second comments a sense of urgency around healthcare. I share that  sense of urgency, as I know everybody on my side of the aisle does.   But for the next 1 hour, Mr. Speaker, we are going to be talking  about what purports to be the House budget, the budget that would tell  us what our Medicaid priorities are, the budget that would tell us how  we are going to save Medicare, the budget that would tell us how we are  going to protect Social Security, and the budget that would tell us  what our values are as a nation. That is what the law requires: that we  bring such a document to the floor and that we do it by April 15.   But for the next hour, Mr. Speaker, what you are going to hear is  that the House is producing no such budget, that the House is silent on  protecting Medicaid, silent on protecting Medicare, and silent on  protecting Social Security.   We can do better, as my colleagues have challenged us to do. It is  going to take a partnership, though, not empty accusations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friend from New York for yielding me the customary 30  minutes. And, at the risk of opening this debate like I opened so many  others in 2019: Mr. Speaker, we have taken an opportunity to do  something very productive and very bipartisan and we have turned it  into something that is going to be very partisan and wholly  unproductive.   Neither of the bills we are considering in this rule today are going  to be moving through the Senate. Neither of the bills we are  considering today are going to be signed by the President. But the good  foundation in both of those bills could have been, and we have missed  yet another opportunity.   Let me start with H.R. 1644, Mr. Speaker, the so-called Save the  Internet Act. I can't speak for everyone else's internet, but my  internet is still thriving. I haven't seen any nefarious internet  shortages or blockages in recent days.   For the millions and millions of Americans trying to livestream C- SPAN right now, they are having no problems whatsoever. It is going  right through the pipes the way it always has, Mr. Speaker. And, if it  is in need of saving, it is certainly not in need of saving from this  institution.   I understand, Mr. Speaker, that my friends on the other side of the  aisle are upset with the Trump administration's FCC.   You will recall that the Obama administration and its FCC took the  regulations that had governed the internet from its inception through  its explosion of productivity and innovation, all the way through 2015,  and threw all those rules out entirely, replacing it with a command- and-control government structure.   In its wisdom and with my great support, the Trump administration and  the FCC threw those new rules out, taking us back to those rules that  provided the foundation for the internet and all of the productivity  that it has provided.   It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that so many folks are afraid of  internet freedom that we need to try to find a way to clamp down on  internet freedom and bend the internet to the will of the government.   I would argue that the Wild West innovation style that has driven the  internet and tech companies from day one shouldn't be boxed in by the  government and certainly shouldn't be replaced with a 1930s-era, Ma  Bell telephone regulatory scheme.   That is what we are talking about here today with this bill, Mr.  Speaker, is turning over regulation of the internet to title II of the  Communications Act.   If you have not looked at title II recently, Mr. Speaker, it is  almost 100 years old. It was created to govern that wonderful emerging  technology called the landline telephone and the monopolistic telephone  companies that existed at that time.   I don't know how many of your staffers still have landline  telephones, Mr. Speaker. I know your grandchildren probably don't even  know how to operate one these days.   We certainly should not be relying on those regulations to bring us  forward with innovation. The heavy hand of government regulation always  takes us backwards.   The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that, if you see legitimate challenges  out there, we do have some bipartisan solutions to help address those:  Former Chairman Walden's H.R. 1101, one such bill that could have been  on the floor today; Mr. Latta's H.R. 1006, another bill that could have  been on the floor today; Mrs. McMorris Rodgers' H.R. 1096 could have  been on the floor today, just to name a few.  [[Page H3143]]    But none of those bipartisan options were seriously considered.  Instead, we are left with a single option, in true government,  monopolistic fashion, and that option is to support the Obama  administration's failed government takeover of the internet.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose that. I oppose the legislation. I hope my other  colleagues will as well.   It did not have to be this way. This could have been a productive  partnership discussion about how to take what is obviously a productive  and innovative tool fueling, not just urban America, not just suburban  America, but rural America, and we could have talked about how to grow  it together. But we chose a different path, digging partisan ditches  even deeper early in 2019.   If that is not disappointing enough, Mr. Speaker, there is a second  bill that this rule makes in order. That is H.R. 2021. That bill comes  out of another committee that Mr. Morelle and I serve on, the House  Budget Committee.   I love serving on the House Budget Committee, I have to tell you, Mr.  Speaker. It is a wonderful committee on which to serve. Mr. Morelle and  I are both lucky to be on it, and we have two fabulous leaders on that  committee: Mr. Yarmuth of Kentucky leading the Democratic side of the  aisle and Mr. Womack of Arkansas leading the Republican side of the  aisle.   If you were going to task two leaders in this institution with  crafting the kind of budget that I talked about from the well earlier,  Mr. Speaker, a budget that would protect Social Security, protect  Medicare, protect Medicaid, a budget that would lay out priorities for  America, talk about where it is that we want to see our children and  our grandchildren go in the 21st century, those are the two leaders who  could have brought us together for the first time in a long time around  a unified vision.    But, instead, the order came down from on high, Mr. Speaker. There  was to be no budget. I assume that is true. We have considered  absolutely no budget in the so-called Budget Committee. We have had no  budget markup in the Budget Committee. We have had no discussions of  budget in the Budget Committee.   Instead, what we have before us today is a bill that is sometimes  referred to as a caps deal. You have heard ``caps deal'' before, Mr.  Speaker.   It is those times in years past where we have taken what are those  discretionary caps, those limits on how much Federal money we can  spend, and we have adjusted those so that we can invest in some shared  priorities on the one hand while reducing spending in some other, lower  priority places.   We have done that in a bipartisan way not once, not twice, but three  times. We could have been here today, Mr. Speaker, for a fourth time.   If we are not going to actually do a budget, we still could have been  here on a caps deal. But this is not a caps deal. This is not a caps  bill that had input from Republicans in the House. This is not a caps  deal that had consultation with the Senate. This is not a caps deal  that has been done in bipartisanship with the White House.   This is a caps deal that is just a deal among warring factions of a  divided Democratic Caucus, and that bill has come to the floor today-- again, a bill that will not be considered in the Senate and a bill that  will not be signed by the President.   We can normalize partisan failure in this institution, Mr. Speaker.  We can. We can also normalize bipartisan cooperation.   I don't fault the other side for the struggles that are, inevitably,  going to happen when a new majority takes over in the U.S. House of  Representatives. Leading is a very difficult, difficult thing to do.   But, at the end of the day, the majority is tasked with doing exactly  that--leading. The Budget Committee should produce a budget. The United  States of America should have a budget.   It is not easy to do. It is not easy to pass this House floor. It is  not easy to pass through a committee. But it is what the law requires  us to do; it is what we have the right leaders on the Budget Committee  to do; and it is what every single Member in this institution knows in  their heart that we should do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of this rule, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my friend from  New York, but I just have too many speakers who have come down to the  House floor today to speak about this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), a member of the Rules Committee, our ranking member on the Rules  Committee, a member of the Appropriations Committee, and one of the  most thoughtful Members of the Republican Conference.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say that  my friend's criticisms of the Trump budget are perfectly legitimate.  What he failed to mention, though, is the reason he can make those  criticisms is because the law required the administration to offer a  budget, and it did. The law also requires this House to offer a budget,  and we have not.   We are better than that. This is not an Article II responsibility.  This is an Article I responsibility, and we will rue the day that we  decided that we would rather talk about what Article II was doing  instead of doing the work ourselves here at Article I.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Meuser), a new Member of this institution and a member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and  the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from New York is right: They did make a number of  amendments in order, but not enough amendments to solve some underlying  problems.   One amendment they didn't make in order was an amendment to provide  disaster funding to so many of our communities that have been waiting  on disaster funding--not for a day, not for a week, not for a month,  but, now, into the new year.   If we defeat the previous question today, we can correct that  injustice, and I will bring up an amendment to the rule to make this  disaster funding possible. It is critically important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Austin Scott) to talk about that, one of the greatest advocates for  that language here in the House.    Mr. Speaker, as we have heard so often on the House  floor, hopeful wishes are not enough for our constituents. We need to  deliver results.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Dunn), who has been working hard in that direction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  I would say to my friend from New York, we do not have any further  speakers remaining, so if he would like to get this show on the road, I  am prepared to close if he is.   Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for my friend from New York on the  Rules Committee, and I really do enjoy serving with him on the Budget  Committee.  [[Page H3147]]    It is neat to be on the Budget Committee as a freshman because you  are working with the biggest issues that we have in this country. We  all care about healthcare and how it gets implemented, but we can't  implement it if we can't pay for it, so the Budget Committee grapples  with those issues.   We all want our seniors to be protected. They have been paying into  Medicare and Social Security their entire lives, but we know those  programs are headed toward bankruptcy. We can't solve those problems  except in the overarching look of a Federal budget process. It is what  the law requires.   We get to talk about those big ideas. We get to think those big  thoughts. We get to come together to make big and, yes, Mr. Speaker,  difficult decisions.    President Trump, in his budget, made difficult decisions. I dare say  I could go Member to Member in this Chamber and find 435 people out of  435 who would find at least one flaw in the President's budget. I bet I  could.   It is hard to write a budget for the United States of America, but  the law requires that we do it. More importantly, even if the law  didn't require that we do it, Mr. Speaker, we know that we should. We  know the Constitution lays out that responsibility, the power of the  purse, for the House. We have constituted an entire committee called  the Budget Committee.   I don't want to wow you, Mr. Speaker, with my eloquence, but do you  know what the responsibility of the Budget Committee is? It only has  one: write the budget.   For years, there was a time when the Senate was not taking up budgets  in its Budget Committee. I wondered why they didn't disband the Budget  Committee because the only job the Budget Committee has is to write the  budget.   We know we need to do that together. We know we do, but we are not.   The second bill this rule makes in order is the government takeover  of the internet bill. Again, if you think the internet is broken and  the benevolent hand of government can fix it, this is the bill for you.  If you think the internet is not broken and perhaps government ought to  stay where government is, and the freedom of the internet should  continue, this is not the bill for you.   We need to defeat both of these bills, and we need to defeat the  rule.   I do want to point out, for the Rules Committee, we were working just  beyond those doors last night, Mr. Speaker, and I think the Rules  Committee did the best it could with the material that it had to work  with. I see the staff director of the Rules Committee sitting over  there. He has a tough job.   I think the chairman did the best he could. You cannot solve the  problem of a flawed, partisan committee process with the inclusion of  amendments in the Rules Committee. You just can't do it. But they tried  as hard as they possibly could, making in order as many amendments as  they could to try to satisfy as many concerns as they could.   The problem is not the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker. That is not why  we need to defeat the rules today. The problem is the leadership  decision that has been made to bring up these two flawed products that  were created in a partisan way when we could have brought to the floor  two positive products created in a collaborative way.   We have to make a decision in this Chamber. Either we are in the  business of making a point or we are in the business of making a  difference. So far, the first 4 months of this year, we have been great  at making a point, but we have been struggling to make a difference.   Like it or not, we have a Senate that has to pass this legislation  and a President who has to sign it if we are to make it the law of the  land. The two products today fail that test.   Let's not waste another moment on them, Mr. Speaker, not another  moment. Let's reject this rule. Let's not bring these two pieces of  legislation to the floor. Let's go back to the drawing board  collaboratively, as we know we can. Lock any bipartisan group of  Members into a room together, Mr. Speaker, and they will craft a better  solution. We have the right leaders in this Chamber for this time. We  just need to free them up to lead.   Defeat this rule. Defeat the previous question.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I ask unanimous  consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with  extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous  question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
