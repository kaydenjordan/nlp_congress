 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on behalf of this amendment,  which would guarantee the United States Secret Service receive a 2.6  percent pay increase with the rest of the civilian workforce.   The underlying bill will nullify the President's executive order that  froze pay for Federal workers. It is important we include all employees  of the Secret Service in that correction.   The Secret Service's most well-known mission is to spend every day  protecting the President of the United States. That is why it is  unfortunate. First, he froze their pay, and then he didn't pay them for  35 days in the longest government shutdown in history.   I represent a district right outside of Washington, D.C., and a lot  of my friends and fellow constituents are Federal workers. I was  disheartened to learn in December they would not be receiving a pay  increase. They go to work every day to serve our country. They are  American workers; they are patriots; they are friends; and they deserve  better.   This amendment will ensure that no Secret Service employees are  inadvertently left out of a much-needed pay raise. They work every day  to protect the President and the Vice President from harm and protect  against crimes of our Nation's financial and banking infrastructure,  and they deserve recognition, and they deserve a raise.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that this is just  a clarifying amendment.   The Secret Service has pay authority for certain positions. We want  to be sure that none of those positions are inadvertently left out of  this underlying bill. In short, the amendment guarantees all Secret  Service employees are treated the same--fair and simple.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1305]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the Rules Committee for making this  amendment in order. I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
