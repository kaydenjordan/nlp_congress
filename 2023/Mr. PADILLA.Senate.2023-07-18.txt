 Madam President, I rise to introduce State and Local  General Sales Tax Protection Act. This legislation would clarify  congressional intent around a 1987 amendment to the Federal Aviation  Administration's authorization regarding the use of local excise taxes  on aviation fuel for airport purposes.   In 2014, the FAA implemented a policy change to require State and  local governments to use general sales taxes collected on aviation fuel  for airport purposes. This contradicted congressional intent clearly  stated in the 1987 conference report and 29 years of practice, which  applied this requirement only to local excise taxes on fuel and not to  other taxes imposed by State and local governments.   This legislation would overturn the 2014 FAA policy and remove any  ambiguity in Federal interpretation by distinguishing State and local  sales tax measures of general application from aviation fuel excise  taxes.   In my home State of California, local government sales taxes are  voter-approved by a two-thirds margin for specific purposes. Diverting  this money would be a violation of the State's constitution and the  will of its voters. This 2014 FAA rulemaking, if enforced, is estimated  to divert tens of millions of dollars away from voter-approved purposes  like local transportation, first responders, education, and social  programs every year. It is an assault on State and local control of  general application sales tax measures.   The 2014 FAA rulemaking would also impose an unfunded mandate on  States and local governments that would be required to implement a  burdensome tracking system to segregate taxes on aviation fuel from  other taxable sources.   Furthermore, in recognition of this error, the FAA included in its  recommendations to Congress that the clarification provided in this  legislation be included in an FAA reauthorization bill.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the State and  Local General Sales Tax Protection Act to protect every State and local  government that have or will have general sales taxes that include  aviation fuel.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Warner, and Mr.          Romney):   S. 2355. A bill to clarify the applicability of sanctions and  antimoney laundering compliance obligations to United States persons in  the decentralized finance technology sector and virtual currency kiosk  operators, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs.
