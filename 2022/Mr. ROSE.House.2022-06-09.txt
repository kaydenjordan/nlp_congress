 Madam Speaker, as the Biden inflation worsens and Americans  are forced to choose between buying groceries or filling their gas  tanks, Democrats will hold a prime time, Hollywood-produced sham  hearing of their unconstitutional Select Committee to Investigate the  January 6th Attack.   Most Americans won't watch. In fact, America's most-watched news  source, FOX News, won't even be covering the hearing live. That won't  stop Democrats from trying to pull out all the stops to do whatever  they can to distract the American people from their inability to  effectively govern.   They have even hired a slick ABC News producer to produce the hearing  to ensure their spectacle is ready for prime time.   I hope, come November, when folks head to the polls they remember  Democrats decided to put politics first instead of focusing on the  real-life issues we all face today. It is truly a shame.                            ____________________
