 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, all this amendment is doing is adding seven flights,  because in 1966, we went with an overregulated approach, and the  citizens of the Western United States need to be able to come to the  Nation's Capitol. It is the most expensive place to travel to.   All we are trying to do is lower prices and increase competition.  Traditionally, these are very conservative principles that we all  should be able to support.   We all support the free market. We have to be able to look and say:  Things were different in 1966 than they are now. Planes are more quiet.    This is not a safety issue.    This is simply special interests playing over  here. Let the free market decide.
