This is only possible if Federal broadband maps are accurate. Last  Congress I supported the Broadband DATA Act, which was signed into law  and directed the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, to allow  independent third-party data to challenge these maps.   Many States, including Georgia, have already done their own work to  identify areas with immediate broadband needs.   I recently sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the FCC urging them  to utilize data from the Georgia Broadband Map program in their new  mapping program and insisting that regular updates be provided to  Congress.   House Agriculture Republicans have also marked up the Broadband for  Rural America Act, which will provide targeted assistance to the least- connected residents.   I look forward to working on bipartisan solutions to ensure every  household has broadband access while being good stewards of taxpayer  dollars.
