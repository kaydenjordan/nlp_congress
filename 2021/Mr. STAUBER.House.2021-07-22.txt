 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of  Private Walter Straka.   At 17, Walter lied about his age to serve in the Army National Guard.  In 1941, his unit, the 194th Tank Battalion, arrived in the Philippines  just months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.   After the fall of Bataan in 1942, Walter and his comrades were forced  on a brutal 65-mile trek now known as the Bataan Death March.   During the march, Walter was forced to walk in intense heat and  subjected to appalling abuse at the hands of the Japanese army.   By Walter's own account, he should have been dead a thousand times,  but Walter not only survived this 6-day march, he also survived 3 years  as a prisoner of war before returning home to Brainerd, Minnesota.   Once home, Walter ran a successful business, raised a family, and was  an active member in his community.   Walter Straka died this year at the age of 101. With his passing, the  State of Minnesota said good-bye to its last survivor of the Bataan  Death March.   Private Walter Straka is an American hero whose unforgettable story  has inspired me and so many others.   Our Nation is stronger because of his exceptional service and  courage.                            ____________________
