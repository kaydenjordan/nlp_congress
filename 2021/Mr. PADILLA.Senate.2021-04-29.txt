 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Protecting  Unique and Beautiful Landscapes by Investing in California (PUBLIC)  Lands Act.'' This measure would increase protections for over 1 million  acres of Federal public lands throughout northwest California, the  Central Coast, and Los Angeles, including nearly 600,000 acres of new  wilderness, more than 583 miles of new wild and scenic rivers, and the  expansion of an existing national monument by more than 100,000 acres.   This legislation would preserve our public lands for the benefit of  current and future generations and help protect California's  communities from the impacts of the climate crisis.   The ``PUBLIC Lands Act'' is grounded in the best conservation  principles: it expands access to the outdoors for all, addresses  disparities in access to nature, supports locally led efforts, and is  based on science.   In Northwest California, this bill would designate new wilderness,  wild and scenic rivers, recreation and conservation areas, and forest  and watershed restoration areas. Importantly, it would increase  wildfire resiliency in Northwest California, where the impacts of the  climate crisis have resulted in more frequent and severe wildfires.   Along the Central Coast, the bill would designate nearly 250,000  acres of public land in the Los Padres National Forest and Carrizo  Plain National Monument as wilderness, and establish a 400-mile long  Condor National Recreation trail, stretching from Los Angeles to  Monterey County. The designations in the bill would protect the Central  Valley's abundant biodiversity, including threatened and endangered  species.   In Southern California, the bill would expand the San Gabriel  Mountains National Monument and establish a new National Recreation  Area along the foothills and San Gabriel River corridor. Los Angeles  County is one of the most park-poor, densely populated, and polluted  regions in the Nation--this legislation would begin to rectify that by  providing increased outdoor opportunities for all Angelenos, ensuring  that disadvantaged communities can more easily benefit from our public  lands.   I want to highlight that this legislation protects existing water  rights, property rights, and land-use authorities. The bill does not  create any new public lands--rather, it protects existing public lands  through the high-value designation as wilderness in order to keep these  lands as untouched and wild as possible.   The science is becoming increasingly clear that we must conserve 30  percent of our lands and waters by 2030 in our efforts to solve the  climate crisis, protect nature, and save America's wildlife. This  legislation would provide a down payment on that goal, helping  California and the Biden Administration meet our 30x30 goals and  reverse the worst effects of climate change.   The bill would also provide outdoor recreation opportunities to park- poor communities. It is imperative that as we conserve our public  lands, we do so in a way that also reverses racial and economic  disparities in access to nature and parks.   This bill enjoys the support of hundreds of local municipalities and  elected officials, community groups, and businesses and local  outfitters. It is the product of significant public engagement in the  legislative process over decades.   I would like to thank my colleagues and conservation champions,  Representatives Jared Huffman, Salud Carbajal, and Judy Chu, for  championing these bills in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``PUBLIC  Lands Act'' as quickly as possible.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Casey, Mr. Rounds,          and Ms. Smith):   S. 1458. A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to encourage  the planting of cover crops following prevented planting, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
