 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   Mr. Speaker, on countless occasions, my colleagues on the House  Financial Services Committee have called out the challenges faced by  our family-owned community banks and credit unions created by the one- size-fits-all regulatory approach of this Federal Government. We keep  repeating this message because this is what all of us, Republicans and  Democrats, are hearing from our constituents on Main Street U.S.A.   As a direct result of the overly burdensome and unnecessary Federal  regulation, members of the Ideal Credit Union in Minnesota pay an  additional $225, and it now takes over 44 days to close a home  mortgage. Ideal told me that, if the credit union could return to a  more normal, reasonable processing time, their members would be better  served and the process would be more efficient.   My colleague from Colorado has heard similar examples from his  constituents, too. That is why he introduced the TAILOR Act, to change  the way agencies regulate our small town financial institutions that  are telling us time and time again they need relief.   Representative Tipton's legislation will direct the Federal  regulatory agencies responsible for regulating our local Main Street  financial institutions to consider a few factors when they are  regulating, such as the impact their actions have on the ability of  banks and credit unions to serve their customers, the risk profile and  business models of the institutions they regulate, and the necessity  and appropriateness of the regulations they are imposing.   Tailored regulations are smart regulations and will help to limit the  regulatory burden our community banks and credit unions continue to  face.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of aisle  to listen to the stories of their constituents and support the relief  they are asking for. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1116,  the TAILOR Act.
