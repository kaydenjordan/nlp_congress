 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Sires), the chair of the subcommittee dealing with the very important  issue that we are dealing with now in the Western Hemisphere and  Venezuela, and I associate myself with his remarks in that regard.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rooney), who has been a  strong advocate of energy diversification and renewable energy on the  Foreign Affairs Committee, for his support.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1616, which is a bill I  introduced with the ranking member, Representative Kinzinger, as well  as a bill I sponsored towards the last days of the last Congress with  Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, showing bipartisan and bicameral  support for this effort.   Mr. Speaker, we saw again last weekend with the summary of the  Mueller report coming forward just underscoring, once again, the attack  that was made on our country by Russia. There is no mistaking it now.  There was little mistake, given our intelligence sources at the time.   This is not only a way that Russia is seeking, number one, to attack  the democracies of our country, but also to strategically create a  wedge with the greatest asset we have, something that they certainly do  not have.                                time  1715    That asset is the coalition we have with our European allies. It is  one of our greatest strengths, and it is unique to this historic  coalition.   One of the ways Russia is continuing to break up this Western  coalition and cause great damage, is not just the attacks like they had  in the U.S. over their election and democracy, but also wielding energy  as a weapon to break up this great coalition we have, hurt democracies  in Europe--particularly Eastern Europe and here--undercutting our  interest in sharing the values that we have with our greatest allies.   This is something in terms of the energy resources we can't take for  granted. We know that this is a time when the U.S. is a great exporter  of energy in this world, and it is something that will benefit our  economy going forward but will also benefit the diversification of  energy in Europe as well, something that will advance their economy,  but something also that will give them great protection against this  Russian threat.   We also know that it is not just the exporting of this energy that is  going to be of value, but this bill also targets renewable energy  development as well, and that is something that brings the European  countries together with the U.S., and also, together, sets us at a  greater stage to compete worldwide.   We can work together exchanging technological advances. We can work  together as we share investments in  [[Page H2773]]  each other's countries. This is something that will both help the U.S.  economy as a major exporter, but also help our growth going forward.  So, we need to work more closely. Specifically, this bill authorizes  financing for private-sector investments both in energy security  projects in the United States and likewise in the trade that will ensue  in renewables.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the committee for taking such early  action in this Congress. I think it states the priority nature of this,  knowing that this is going to be something that enhances European  security, our security, enhances our economy and theirs, and seeks to  protect us. Because as they talk about projects like Nord Stream 2 in  Germany, they are using right now that leverage to create a threat and  to isolate countries like Ukraine from their basic energy economic  development.   This is important in so many respects. I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, showing the leadership of this bipartisan bill, to  move it forward quickly.   I also want to recognize, again, Senator Murphy who has been such a  leader of this on the Senate side. It is rare that we have such strong  bipartisan support for a bill, as well as bicameral support. Let's go  ahead and move this forward today.
