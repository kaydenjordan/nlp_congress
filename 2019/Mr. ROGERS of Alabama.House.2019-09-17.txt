 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding time and for his leadership on our committee.   I rise in support of Ranking Member Thornberry's motion to instruct  conferees. It is vital that Congress fund all of the projects that have  been listed today as we vote later. The Senate did the right thing, and  now the House should follow suit.   Securing our border is a vital component to national security. If we  can't control our borders, then we cannot tell the American people they  are secure at home.   Even President Obama's former Attorney General, Eric Holder, said  just this week: ``Democrats have to understand that borders mean  something.''   This motion to instruct conferees supports the President's task of  keeping America safe. It also supports our military by funding  construction projects, including the weapons maintenance shop at  Anniston Army Depot in my district. This project would consolidate  maintenance operations that currently happen in different buildings in  different States under one roof. This facility is in preparation for  future modernizations in support of our force readiness.   This is a simple vote today for securing our borders and building  projects for the military. I urge support of this motion.
