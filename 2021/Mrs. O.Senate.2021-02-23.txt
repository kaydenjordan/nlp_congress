'' She worked as a receptionist for Senator  Mikulski and was the friendly face who welcomed constituents,  colleagues, friends, and even Senators to the office. With her warmth  and kindness, she made you feel right at home. And with her deep  knowledge of Maryland's democratic politics, you knew she meant  business. She cherished working for Congress, and as a lover of  history, she did not take for granted how special it was to walk the  same Capitol halls as many of our former great American leaders.   Even though Barbara was committed to serving the people of Maryland,  she was also equally committed to her family--her husband, her six  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. In their family,  Barbara and her husband, Thomas, a World War II veteran, instilled a  sense of duty and public service, so it came as no surprise that their  son, Martin O'Malley, went on to become the mayor of Baltimore and  Governor of their beloved State of Maryland.   Dedication and commitment to public service defined Barbara's career  in Congress, and we are so lucky she chose the Senate as one of the  places to make her mark in this world.                            ____________________
