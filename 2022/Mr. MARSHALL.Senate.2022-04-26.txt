 Mr. President, I rise today to memorialize and honor  one of my great friends and mentor, our former Kansas State University  President Dr. Jon Wefald who passed away on April 16 after a long and  illustrious life serving higher education and the State of Kansas. His  work at K-State brought the university to great heights, and his  realized dreams will live on forever in K-State lore.   My wife and I first met Dr. Wefald at a student recruitment dinner in  Great Bend we were cohosting, where his energy was contagious and  palpable. He was a young university president with a vision and a  purpose we all wanted to be part of. He made every student in the room  know they were each important, and K-State would help them realize  their dreams. We remained friends up until the time of his passing with  regular communications and advice. I will miss him.   Dr. Wefald served as K-State's 12th president from 1986 to 2009 and  is credited with growing the university into a top 10 land-grant  university. During his 23 years of leadership, the university added 2.2  million square feet of new buildings. He also helped philanthropy  increase from $6 million a year to nearly $100 million annually.   Under his leadership, K-State quickly became one of the Nation's  distinguished research and doctoral universities. Enrollment increased  from 16,000 students to more than 23,000 under his tenure, and with the  growth in students came a monumental growth in research funding from  $18 million annually to nearly $134 million. Both of these increases  have led to astounding innovations from all parts of the university.  Last, but not least of his achievements, Dr. Wefald was also in charge  of hiring the iconic football coach Bill Snyder, which led to the  greatest turnaround in NCAA sports history.   We all mourn the loss of this beloved K-State president who shaped  countless students' and faculty members' lives. His leadership,  passion, and dedication to K-State and the great State of Kansas will  never be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family,  friends, and K-State family. I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the wonderful career and life of Mr. Jon Wefald. A true  inspiration to the State of Kansas, fighting ever fighting for a  wildcat victory.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize  Jerry Farley, the president of Washburn University. Dr. Farley  announced his plans to retire and transition to a president emeritus  role, where he and his signature bow tie will remain a part of  fundraising and international student recruitment.   Farley was born in Oklahoma, but moved to Topeka in 1997 after  spending 25 years in various administrative roles in Oklahoma,  including the role of vice president at Oklahoma University. On July 1,  1997, Farley became Washburn University's 16th president. During his  leadership, Farley's vision to change Washburn from a commuter school  to one that prioritized campus life has become a reality. With his wife  Susan serving by his side through the years, they have helped influence  and nurture student to work hard and leave the university as leaders.   During his tenure, Washburn University added several buildings to its  campus, including the $20 million Living Learning Center residential  hall, as well as the addition of Washburn Tech, the Kansas Bureau of  Investigation Laboratory, and a statue honoring one of the Ichobods'  favorite sons, the late great Senator Bob Dole.   In addition to his hard work and dedication to help build the  reputation of the University, Dr. Farley always did an outstanding job  of representing the State of Kansas and Washburn University as a whole.  His leadership does not go unnoticed. As we celebrate his legacy, I ask  my colleagues to join me in recognizing the wonderful career of Dr.  Jerry Farley and wish him and Susan nothing but joy and happiness in  his next chapter of life.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize  Caleb Smith of Newton, KS. Caleb is the recipient of the 2021-2022  Kansas principal of the year.   Caleb has shown outstanding leadership at Newton High School in order  to earn this award. His passion for the students, working with the  staff, and creative ideas to enhance technology at the school all  contributed to this great success. Caleb found out about this honor  Monday, April 11, following a school scavenger hunt where he walked all  over the campus to find his students presenting the award to him.  Superintendent Fred Van Ranken celebrated Caleb saying, ``Mr. Smith has  done an outstanding job of trying to create an amazing culture at  Newton High School and within the Newton communities, and it shows. I  am so happy for Caleb to be recognized at the state level for what he  and his team are doing at USD 373.''   This is an honor that Caleb should be immensely proud of. After  reading through countless quotes from fellow teachers and Newton  students, it is clear that Caleb has a true passion--and immense  talent--for teaching our future leaders. This award is a testament to  all of his hard work in providing outstanding education for all  students that walk through his classroom. I am ecstatic to hear about  the impact this great Kansan is having on our future generations. I ask  my colleagues to join me in recognizing Caleb Smith of Newton, KS.                            ____________________
