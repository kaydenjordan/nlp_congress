 Mr. Speaker, I was in the gallery right behind us when the  Capitol was breached. Then domestic terrorists breached the Rotunda. I  heard the loud sounds of gunshots through this sacred Chamber. My last  images were brave Capitol Police, guns drawn, to protect us.   This was the first armed insurrection in over 200 years. Who incited  this violent insurrection? Donald J. Trump.   Our resolution states these protests were encouraged by him. He urged  millions of his followers to come and ``stop the steal,'' which is a  lie.   And let's say this now for the Record and for the ages: Joe Biden  won.   And for this high crime nearly ripping our country apart, we should  be removing him by the 25th Amendment or he should be impeached.
