 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the nomination of Michael Barr to be a member of the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Vice Chair for  Supervision.   His confirmation is expected today, but we hold votes on these things  to find out for sure. His confirmation will mean that the Federal  Reserve, for the first time in years, will have a complement of all  seven members.   I credit the Biden administration for being aggressive in doing that.  I credit the committee, which I chair. The Acting President pro tempore  is a prominent member of that committee, Senator Warren, and I thank  her for her work on this. It is a big deal.   Mr. Barr is a qualified nominee who came out of the Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs Committee with strong bipartisan support. Five  Republicans, including Ranking Member Toomey, and all 12 Democrats  supported his nomination. It is clear why. He is a leading expert with  decades of experience in helping to guide and protect our economy,  including having experience with financial institutions and financial  regulation.   He has served this country at the Departments of Treasury and State  as well as at the White House. At the Treasury Department, as Assistant  Secretary for Financial Institutions, Mr. Barr played a critical role  in responding to the 2008 financial crisis when Wall Street greed and  recklessness crashed our economy.   I know especially, as I said on the floor, what it did to my  community, even to my neighborhood. The ZIP Code in which Connie and I  live in Cleveland, 44105, had more foreclosures in the first half of  2007 than had any ZIP Code in America, and we still live with that.   We passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act back then. Among the  many steps the legislation took to prevent another crisis, we created  the Vice Chair for Supervision to identify and to stay ahead of risks  to our country's financial system, like cyber threats, volatile  cryptocurrency, or the climate crisis. We created this job to hold the  biggest banks accountable so  [[Page S3247]]  that Wall Street wouldn't put working families and businesses on Main  Street at risk again.   We know Wall Street puts its own interests first always. We know, too  often, it is at the risk of small businesses, at the risk of working  families, at the risk of the middle class, and at the risk of low- income people. We understand that that is their behavior, and the  purpose of Dodd-Frank was as far as we could go to fix that.   Mr. Barr has worked for a quarter century to make our financial  system safer and fairer. He has focused on developing and evaluating  financial regulatory policies. Most importantly, he has a keen  understanding of the type of risks that pose threats to our financial  stability. Mr. Barr will join the Federal Reserve Board of Governors at  a critical time for our economy, maintaining Federal Reserve  independence along the way.   In response to a question for the record, Mr. Barr told us the  following:         Independence is critical for the Federal Reserve to       effectively carry out its congressional mandate to promote       maximum employment and price stability. Politics should play       no role in setting monetary policy. . . . I am committed, if       confirmed--    He wrote--       to adhere strictly to a non-political, data-driven,       independent approach to policy making.    I support Mr. Barr's nomination in this critical role. Once  confirmed, as I said, we will have a full Federal Reserve Board, with  all seven members. It has been almost a decade since we have been able  to do that. It has taken this new President and this new majority in  the Senate to do that, and I thank all of my colleagues who have played  a role in that.   I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Michael Barr.    Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Jack Graney, Cleveland Indians player and broadcaster, as he  is posthumously awarded the Ford C. Frick Award by the Baseball Hall of  Fame on July 23, 2022.   Jack Graney was born on June 10, 1886, in St. Thomas, Ontario,  Canada, but his professional career on the baseball diamond began with  the Cleveland Naps in 1908. Over his 14-year Major League career, Jack  led the American League in walks during the 1917 and 1919 seasons and  played in three World Series games, helping the Naps to victory in  1920. His daughter fondly remembers growing up on the road and  [[Page S3268]]  watching her father in action on the field.   Jack spent each of his seasons in Major League Baseball with  Cleveland. After 14 seasons, Jack retired with 1,178 hits, 420 runs  batted in, and a career .250 batting average.   Jack made baseball history over the course of his career; he was the  first at bat against Babe Ruth in the big leagues, the first 20th  century big league player to bat with a number on his uniform, and the  first to transition from player to broadcaster.   In 1932, Jack returned to baseball when he joined WHK-AM, which had  just began broadcasting Cleveland games. He would go on to be the voice  of the Cleveland Indians for the next 22 years. Rumor had it, when the  Indians played, you could hear Jack's voice echoing through the streets  of Cleveland. While radio was only local at the time, Jack was  committed to providing a narrative of every single game to Cleveland  fans. During away games, he broadcasted from Cleveland, using the  ticker-tape that came through from the live game.   Jack's detailed descriptions of plays, stadiums, and fans brought the  game to life. Throughout his career, he broadcasted for various  Cleveland stations and with different partners. In 1935, he commentated  on the World Series and the All-Star Game for national audiences.   Jack's final broadcast aired in 1953. For more than 20 years, Jack  brought baseball to Cleveland fans. On April 20, 1978, Jack passed away  at age 91. His legacy lives on today through his family and through all  those he inspired to love America's game and to pass on that love to  their own children and grandchildren.   In 2012, Jack was posthumously inducted into the Cleveland Baseball  Hall of Fame for his tenure as a player. And this month, the Baseball  Hall of Fame will present the Ford C. Frick Award to Jack for his major  contributions to baseball. Recipients are chosen based on their  commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence  within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.   Jack embodied each of these qualities and made our city proud. Today,  we celebrate his contributions to baseball, his commitment to  Cleveland, and his extraordinary life.                            ____________________
