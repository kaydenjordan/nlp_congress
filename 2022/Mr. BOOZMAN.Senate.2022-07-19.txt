 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Kirkley  Thomas who is retiring as vice president of governmental affairs for  Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation.   Kirkley is a devoted Arkansan who has proudly served the State for  more than 30 years. As a graduate of Arkansas State University, he  earned a bachelor of science in journalism and public relations, and he  continued his education at the Economic Development Institute of the  University of Oklahoma.   He began his career working as a professional staff member in the  U.S. Senate for former Arkansas Senator David Pryor in 1991. He  continued his service to Arkansas in positions at the University of  Arkansas System and the Arkansas Economic Development Commission.  Kirkley has been a reliable leader at the Arkansas Electric Cooperative  Corporation since 1998 and assumed the role of vice president of  governmental affairs in 2014.   My team and I have worked closely with Kirkley during his tenure on a  number of initiatives to help support policies to make energy more  affordable and broadband more accessible. He  [[Page S3370]]  is a champion for rural Arkansas, and it has been rewarding to partner  with him to strengthen infrastructure in these communities.   Kirkley's commitment to the State of Arkansas is an example others  should aspire to emulate. Throughout his career, he has earned many  well deserved accolades for his professional and civic involvement. I  applaud Kirkley for his accomplished career and the leadership and  perseverance he has demonstrated. I know that in whatever he does, he  will always continue working to build a better Arkansas.   Our State will be forever appreciative of the contributions made by  Kirkley Thomas. He deserves our thanks for dedicating his career to  bettering so many communities and our entire State. It is an honor to  call him a friend, and I wish him the best in his retirement, where I  know he will be happy to spend more time with his son Jack and  daughter-in-law Hailey.                            ____________________
