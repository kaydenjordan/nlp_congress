 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8. A major  reason our Founding Fathers drafted the Second Amendment is to have a  check and balance for the people against the tyranny of government. It  is the Second Amendment for a reason, not the Ninth or the Tenth. You  must have the Second to protect the First.   The first action by history's dictators--and we know all of them--was  to take guns from law-abiding citizens. We must remember that there is  no law that stops criminals from getting guns and committing crimes. We  would have empty prisons otherwise.   As someone who grew up under a tyrannical government, I value these  rights tremendously, and I encourage my colleagues to be vigilant and  protect these rights for all law-abiding citizens.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
