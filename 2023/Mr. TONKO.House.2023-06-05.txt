 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Patricia Cerro- Reehil on the occasion of her retirement from the New York Water  Environment Association.   Since 1929, NYWEA has played a leading role in promoting water  quality across our State. Patricia's NYWEA career began in 1987, and 14  years later, she rose to become the first woman to serve as executive  director.   Her work over the past 35 years has supported training, education,  and advocacy for countless utilities, local governments, system  operators, and water-sector businesses. This work has been foundational  to protecting and improving water quality throughout New York State.   During her time as executive director, Patricia has also embraced  NYWEA's educational mission, helping to distribute over $700,000 in  scholarships to some 240 students pursuing environmental degrees.   I sincerely thank Patricia for her decades of service, which have  helped provide so many New Yorkers with more reliable, more affordable,  and certainly cleaner water. I congratulate Patricia on her well- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
