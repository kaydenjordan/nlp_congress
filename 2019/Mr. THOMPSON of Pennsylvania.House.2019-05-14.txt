 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  National Police Week. More than 30,000 law enforcement officers from  across the country are in Washington in honor of National Police Week.   Established by a joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National  Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers  who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and  protection of others.   It is a time when we pause to remember officers who have made the  ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives in the line of duty protecting  and serving others.   National Police Week is a collaborative effort of many organizations  dedicated to honoring America's law enforcement community. It honors  the men and women in blue who gave everything to protect their country  and their communities.   Our officers put on their uniforms each day knowing that they can be  in harm's way at any moment. National Police Week is a time to remember  the sacrifices that many officers and their families have made.    Mr. Speaker, I thank all of our officers who answer the call to  serve.                            ____________________
