 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great  American hero, Katherine Johnson.   Katherine was a skilled mathematician, a loyal NASA employee, a  mother, a daughter, but, most importantly, a trailblazer.   In 1953, she began working at the National Advisory Committee for  Aeronautics West Area Computing unit, where she provided equations and  computations that were essential to the success of the early space  program.   At NASA Langley, she played an important role in NASA's Mercury  program of manned space flights from 1961 to 1963. Without her  expertise, the space travel of Alan Shepard and John Glenn would not  have been possible.   At the apex of her career, Johnson was part of the team that  calculated the trajectory of the Apollo 11 mission of 1969, which sent  the first three men to the Moon. And now, her work will ensure that the  first woman and the next man will take steps on the Moon by 2024.   This is the legacy of Katherine Johnson. I am proud to recognize her  today.                            ____________________
