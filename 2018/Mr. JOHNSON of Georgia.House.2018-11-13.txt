 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res.  1055, legislation affirming the United States' strong relationship with  Liberia.   Liberia gives us hope that if we are willing to face truth of our  past there can be hope for unity after devastating divisions. It takes  courage to honestly face your history and find ways to move forward as  a country. We must commit to supporting and encouraging this burgeoning  democracy.   It has been an honor to work with my colleague Rep. Donovan. I am  encouraged by his commitment to this cause. I am pleased to stand  before you today to voice my unwavering support for H. Res. 1055 and  ask for yours as well.
