 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  Democratic motion, and I thank the Gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that your desperation for a political win is  more important than the needs of our nation.   For a few days, you will celebrate this holiday gift for the rich and  wealthy. But in January, Mr. Speaker, the bill will come due.   To cover the costs of these tax cuts, you will destroy the hopes and  dreams of the American people, of working families, of the young and  old, and of generations yet unborn.   Make no mistake, Social Security, Medicare, and CHIP will be on the  chopping block cuts.   Bipartisan solutions for transportation, affordable housing, and  student debt will be out of reach.   And with this tax cut, every single federal program that matters to  the American people will be dealt a crippling blow.   Mr. Speaker, you cannot get blood from a turnip, and you cannot  justify robbing poor Peter to pay billionaire Paul.   I urge each and every one of my colleagues to remember this moment,  to remember this time, and to support this Democratic motion.
