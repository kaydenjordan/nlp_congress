 Mr. President, as a member of U.S. Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize a  unique small business for its tremendous contributions to the local  economy. Small businesses drive our Nation's economic expansion,  generate lasting job growth, and encourage community development. This  week, it is my honor to recognize Boyd Cycling of Greenville, SC, as  the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Boyd Johnson, a former competitive cyclist, originally founded Boyd  Cycling under the name Boyd Bikes in September of 2009. Charged by a  mission of quality and service, Boyd set out to produce and sell  various bike products in the Greenville area. About 3 months into the  operation, Boyd's Bikes began to grow dramatically, and Boyd's wife  Nicole joined as a partner of the business. Boyd and Nicole are a prime  example of how a leap of faith, coupled with hard work, can pay off.   Boyd Bikes initially offered wheels, bike frames, handlebars, and  other accessories, but the Johnsons quickly realized that their  competitive advantage was their handcrafted wheels made out of carbon  fiber and alloy. By 2011, Boyd and Nicole decided to focus directly on  specializing in bike wheels and changed the name of the business to  Boyd Cycling.   In addition to focusing on bike wheels, Boyd and Nicole decided to  shake up their business model. Originally, Boyd Cycling focused  primarily on direct-to-consumer sales. Wanting to expand their  business, Boyd and Nicole reached out to the Spartanburg Area Small  Business Development Center, SBDC, a resource partner of the U.S. Small  Business Administration, and received business counseling and exporting  advice. Eventually, Boyd Cycling began selling their products to bike  shops around the country in addition to their own website. By staying  committed to high quality and low pricing, the Johnsons have been able  to avoid undercutting their retail clients while diversifying their  income stream. In turn, this has enabled them to export their products  globally and now currently distribute to over 15 countries.   A seasoned cyclist, Boyd spends time carefully designing each product  the company offers. Once a product is developed, Boyd Cycling contracts  manufacturing out to different firms domestically and internationally.  Boyd maintains rigorous standards when contracting with every  manufacturing firm that the company uses, making sure to implement  quality controls on materials and construction methods.   Boyd Cycling's dedication to quality has not gone unnoticed. They  have received national media coverage, excellent customer reviews, and  numerous awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Nicole were named the U.S.  Small Business Administration's Exporter of the Year for South  Carolina. This award recognizes small business owners for their success  and commitment to exporting goods or services. Boyd Cycling also  supports various philanthropies in their community including Meals on  Wheels, the Alzheimers Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society,  Miracle Hill, Upstate Forever, and Global Bike. Their community  involvement has been a key to their success as Greenville has become a  bustling hub for the recreational biking community.   Boyd and Nicole truly embody the entrepreneurial and community  spirit. From its humble beginnings, Boyd has grown into a respectable  player in the industry while maintaining a commitment to customer  service and product  [[Page S3283]]  quality. I am honored to recognize the Johnsons and the entire team at  Boyd Cycling as the Senate Small Business of the Week. You make South  Carolina proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth  and success.                            ____________________
