 Mr. Speaker, I ask to bring up H.R. 724, which would  rescind President Trump's refugee ban on individuals like Dr. Suha  Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, who  was denied entry, forced to leave the country, and, therefore, deprived  the country of his medical services.
