 Madam Speaker, last month, 12 people died in a raging  inferno that tore through an apartment building in the Bronx.   I rise today to honor the life of Army Private First Class Emmanuel  Mensah, a 28-year-old man who repeatedly ran into that burning building  to rescue his neighbors. This decorated young American soldier lived by  the Army's values: loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor,  integrity, and personal courage. Private Mensah lived and died by these  values in selfless service to his community.   Madam Speaker, Private Mensah's life exemplifies the best of our  Nation. His tragic death teaches us that every life has value, every  life has meaning, and every life is worth protecting.   Madam Speaker, Private First Class Emmanuel Mensah was not only a  brave and courageous American soldier, he was also an immigrant from  the African nation of Ghana. Let us honor his life by keeping the gates  of liberty open to immigrants like him.                            ____________________
