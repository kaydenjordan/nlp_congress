 Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better Act strengthens our  economy and changes the lives of millions of Americans.   It fights inflation because it is fully paid for by making big  corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share. No one making  under $400,000 will pay a penny more in taxes.   It expands and improves the child tax credit, the biggest tax cut for  working families with children, a transformative policy that the  chairman and I have been fighting for, for nearly 20 years. It is a  lifeline for the middle class and lifts over 50 percent of children out  of poverty.   It guarantees that the cost of childcare will not exceed 7 percent of  a family's income. It includes paid family and medical leave, which  responds to the needs of all people so they can take time off to care  for themselves or a loved one.   It delivers a historic and once-in-a-generation investment in  combating climate change that cannot wait.   It lowers healthcare costs. It provides universal pre-K. I could go  on and on.   We have an opportunity to build the architecture for the future for  working families. Working and middle-class families across this country  are counting on us to build a better and stronger America.  [[Page H6593]]                H.R. 6025.
