 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bost and  Chairman Takano for their leadership. This bill is very important.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protecting Moms Who  Served Act, which I co-lead with my colleague and friend, Lauren  Underwood. I also thank Representative Underwood for her efforts on  this bill to help ensure that all female veterans have access to the  maternal healthcare and support they need and deserve.   Our Nation's heroes deserve the best possible care, and this  legislation gets us one step closer to achieving that goal. Women are  currently the fastest growing group within the veteran population,  creating the greatest demand for maternity care ever faced by the VA.   I have heard from my local VA medical centers about the growing  challenges they face in providing maternity coordination for female  veterans. The demand on this maternity coordination process has  significantly increased over the past few years, from an average of 50  patients per year to now around 140, featuring a generally higher risk  patient population than the private sector.   My local veterans medical centers said that the additional program  support and additional maternity care coordinators would be crucial in  meeting the growing demand, which this bill will provide.   The bill will also provide community maternity care providers with  training and support with respect to the unique needs of pregnant and  postpartum veterans, particularly regarding mental and behavioral  health conditions in relation to the service of the veterans in the  Armed Forces--very important.   Madam Speaker, these veterans honorably served our country. It is  only right that we provide the quality maternity care and support they  deserve.   Madam Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to support this particular  bill.
