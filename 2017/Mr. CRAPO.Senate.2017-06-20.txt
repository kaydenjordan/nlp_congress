 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  5 minutes.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Ms. Sigal Mandelker,  President Trump's nominee to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for  Terrorism and Financial Crimes.   Five weeks ago, at Ms. Mandelker's hearing, members of the Banking  Committee were moved by her heartfelt story of her parents' escape from  the Holocaust. As her father proudly sat behind her, she explained to  the committee how, as Holocaust survivors who narrowly avoided death,  her parents raised her to never take for granted our safety, security,  or freedom.   It was this that motivated Ms. Mandelker to public service, where she  had an impressive career in law enforcement and national security at  the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security before joining the  private sector.   Like many Americans, she was compelled to action following 9/11 and  joined to serve in Justice's counterterrorism and national security  mission. Throughout the nomination process, it was obvious Ms.  Mandelker would be a strong leader to defend our Nation against  terrorism and illicit finance threats. She received bipartisan support  from the Banking Committee in a 16-to-7 vote advancing her nomination.   Also, with bipartisan support, just last week the Senate voted on the  Iran sanctions bill and our Russia sanctions amendment. Part of Ms.  Mandelker's job as Under Secretary would be directly overseeing  sanctions policy on Iran, Russia, North Korea, Syria, and some 25 other  programs.   In fact, when asked what her top priorities would be in assuming  office, she noted that, first and foremost, she will focus on the areas  posing the greatest threats--those being North Korea, Iran, ISIS,  Syria, and Russia. She also affirmed that she would work closely with  the Banking Committee and Congress in carrying out her duties.   I don't need to stress the importance of confirming Ms. Mandelker's  nomination so Treasury can carry out this important mission, especially  given that the Senate vote on our sanctions package last week was so  strong. The two leaders and many Senators of both parties were able to  work together to pass this important, comprehensive sanctions  legislation, as they should, to ensure Senate confirmation of this  nomination.   Given Ms. Mandelker's strong qualifications, dedication to service  and mission, and bipartisan support from this committee of  jurisdiction, I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
