 Mr. Speaker, this weekend will be time  to burn the beetle. I am talking about the mountain pine beetle and the  damage it has done to the majestic Black Hills National Forest. In  recent years, that pine beetle has infected 430,000 acres in the Black  Hills, leaving millions of dead trees.   Now, the pine beetle thrives in an overly crowded forest. It craves  density. So to tackle this problem, Federal, State, and local  governments and private citizens have set to work thinning the forest.   Initially, from the very beginning, it has been the State and local  partners that have been most proactive and aggressive; but, in recent  years, Federal policies have helped as well.   The Forest Service started utilizing the categorical exclusions in  the 2014 and the 2018 farm bills, allowing them to more quickly utilize  sound forest management practices like tree thinning and controlled  burns.   This picture tells the story well. In areas where the forest has been  actively managed, the trees live; in areas where they have not been,  they die. And now, today, after years of battle, it seems as though we  are nearing the end of this particular outbreak.   That is good news, but it is no time to take our foot off the gas.  One key action needed is to continue working with the timber industry  to set and meet good harvest targets so we can get that excess timber  out of the forest.   Mr. Speaker, I started my comments by noting that it was time to burn  the beetle, and in Custer, South Dakota, this weekend, that is exactly  what they will do at their Burning Beetle arts festival.   It is a good opportunity for us to remember the damage that has been  done--430,000 acres--but also to remember the importance of good  management, of good stewardship, and of good  [[Page H243]]  Federal policy when it comes to protecting great resources like the  Black Hills of South Dakota.                            ____________________
