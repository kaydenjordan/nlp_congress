 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize  Jill's Homestead of Chariton, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week for the week of March 6, 2023.   Jill's Homestead is an example of the American entrepreneurial spirit  at its finest. Before starting her own business, Jill Godby had a  longstanding passion for leather crafting, and she had a special knack  for creating trendy leather earrings that she often wore herself. Over  time, her hobby grew as friends and family wanted their own leather  earrings. Prompted by the demand from her family and friends, in 2018  Jill started to list some of her earrings on Facebook; shortly  thereafter, interest in her products took off, and her hobby turned  into a side hustle. Given her products' popularity online, Jill started  to sell her earrings at local farmer's markets and at any trade shows  she could find. Eventually, her hobby-turned-side-hustle led her to  quit her day job and turn her passion into a small business. However,  Jill did not foresee the once-in-a-generation pandemic that was right  around the corner. When disaster struck and businesses were forced to  close, Jill refused to become discouraged. She doubled down on her  products and ideas and worked long nights to grow the business. Today,  that hard work has paid off; Jill has been able to scale up the company  to employ a small, all-female, workshop crew. Furthermore, she now has  her own workshop to make her leather goods on the town square in  Chariton.   In a world that emphasizes the mass production of goods, Jill's  Homestead wants to craft products built to last a lifetime. They work  to achieve this goal through using high-quality leather, experienced  craftswomen, and an online shop to find customers that share their  mutual values of sustainability, self-sufficiency, and natural living.  Each member of her team of seven craftswomen are dedicated to creating  the highest quality product possible. The business primarily sells  their products online on their website created through the ecommerce  platform Shopify. Additionally, they open their workshop once a month  as they pride themselves on providing great customer service and thus  want to form and maintain genuine connections with their customers in  person. In fact, their commitment to customer relations is what  initially grew the company, with Jill hosting weekly auctions on  Wednesday nights of her products through Facebook Live. Jill's  Homestead has grown from only selling earrings to now offering luxury  handbags, accessories, and home goods inspired by the lifestyle of  rural Iowa.   As a small business, Jill's Homestead recognizes the need to give  back to the Chariton community. They are part of the Chariton Area  Chamber/Main Street which is committed to revitalizing the community  through economic and cultural endeavors. Through the chamber, Jill's  Homestead was able to give a significant donation to the Chariton  Downtown Square Sidewalk Project in order to restore the historic town  square. Additionally, the small business is very generous in offering  their products to be used as prizes for fundraisers. Jill's Homestead  donated close to 10 items for the Hops for Hospice raffle fundraiser;  the money raised went to an assistance fund to provide hospice care for  those who cannot cover the cost. Additionally, they recently  contributed a number of their handbags for the Designer Bag Bingo night  fundraiser, the proceeds of which benefit the volunteer services at  Lucas County Health Center which provides free and low-cost services to  the community.   As a small business that will soon turn 6 years old, Jill's Homestead  has been able to achieve massive success, despite extraordinary  challenges. Even after she faced unprecedented challenges at the very  start of her business, Jill refused to give up hope and shifted her  business to online selling. Through perseverance and grit, Jill grew  her business during an uncertain economy, and her hard work has more  than paid off. Not only has Jill achieved impressive growth, her  business has been featured on Iowa news segments, and Jill was invited  to our Nation's Capital to tell her story and discuss the issues facing  women business owners. Since the beginning of their operation, Jill's  Homestead has been motivated to offer the highest quality leather goods  to their customers and consistently serve them with ``Iowa Nice''  customer service. I want to congratulate Jill Godby and the entire team  at Jill's Homestead and commend them for their continued commitment to  excellence in their work both locally in Iowa and throughout the world.  I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Iowa.                            ____________________     Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize PSC  Distribution of Iowa City, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week  for the week of February 27, 2023.   The story behind the origin of PSC Distribution is one of hard work  and knowing an opportunity when you see one. Jim Nesmith was born and  raised in Jasper County in the early 1900s. Wanting to give back to his  community, he became the State senator for Jasper County in the 1940s.  During this time, he also became a salesman for A.Y. McDonald, a  wholesale distributor of plumbing pumps and waterworks based in Des  Moines. Both of these jobs exposed him to greater Iowa, outside of his  native Jasper County. Jim recognized that there was a great opportunity  for growth in Iowa City with the expansion of the University of Iowa,  so he decided to take a chance and open his own wholesale plumbing  distributorship on May 1, 1951.   For the past 70 years, PSC Distribution has been supplying eastern  Iowa residents and businesses with the materials they need to excel in  the plumbing industry. Currently under the fourth generation of family  ownership, cousins Tom Balmer and Jennie Wunderlich, along with her  husband Ben Wunderlich, continue to grow and guide the company with  innovation and excellence. In 2010, the PSC plumbing showroom expanded  and rebranded into a luxury showroom named Studio  [[Page S634]]  H2O which emphasizes quality customer service and building a  relationship of trust with each customer. Today, PSC Distribution  prides itself as a family owned and operated wholesale plumbing  business services offering everything from heating controls and  systems, air conditioning, geothermal systems, to water heaters,  plumbing fittings, pipes, valves, and kitchen sinks.   PSC Distribution has always prioritized giving back to their  community and employees. They actively support the Ronald McDonald  House, the Iowa City Community School District Foundation, Table to  Table, the Optimist Service Club, the Rotary Club, and are recognized  as one of the original investors in Iowa City Area Development.  Additionally, many of its employees have worked there for more than 20  years, with some working there for more than 40 years. Regardless of an  employee's tenure at the company, whether it brief or long, PSC  Distribution celebrates different work anniversaries by posting a  tribute on social media to an employee they appreciate. They also take  the time to honor veteran customers and employees with tribute posts  thanking them for their service. Furthermore, PSC Distribution hosts  community events in their showroom such as pampering nights for women  in the industry and builders' and electricians' events to forge a  strong community and inspire others to join the industry.   Through never compromising their commitment to being trustworthy,  customer-focused, and growth-oriented, PSC Distribution has been able  to thrive for decades. It has won a number of awards throughout the  years, including the Roots Award in 2011, which was awarded by the Iowa  City Chamber of Commerce to highlight their role as an anchor business  of the Iowa City area for over 60 years and for exemplifying the  importance of successful relationships between small businesses and the  communities they serve. They also won the National Single-branch ICP  Distributor of the Year in 2012, awarded by International Comfort  Products, a leading manufacturer of HVAC equipment. In 2022, Studio H2O  was honored to be named the 2022 Showroom of the Year by Wholesaler  Magazine, an industry magazine which reaches 100,000 professional  engineers, distributors, and contractors. It gives me great joy to see  this family business receive their rightful recognition from industry  experts and from their community at large. I want to congratulate the  entire team at PSC Distribution for their continued commitment to  loyally serving the needs of Iowans. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
