 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  NO BAN Act, which I was honored to coauthor. I urge my colleagues to  swiftly pass this landmark legislation today.   More than 3 years ago, President Donald Trump's Muslim ban put into  action the xenophobic and racist agenda that he promised during his  campaign.  [[Page H3623]]    It immediately led to chaos at our airports, where I was honored to  stand in solidarity with our incoming immigrants and those cruelly  ripped apart from their families.   The Muslim ban became the cornerstone of President Trump's dangerous  agenda. It has made America less respected around the world. And our  country is not any safer.   This isn't the only time America has shamefully shut our doors based  on race, ethnicity, or nationality. But we can make it the last time.   That is why we must pass the NO BAN Act and end the Muslim ban and  make sure history does not repeat itself. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, John Lewis was certainly a leader  amongst men. He was a mentor. He was a friend. And my heart goes out to  his family. Our hearts go out to his family.   I can remember, Mr. Speaker, during the healthcare vote, I was coming  out of Cannon and I ran into John, and he asked: ``How many votes do we  have left, or how much time do we have left?'' I said: ``I think we  will make it.''   We crossed the street, along with his chief, Michael, and there were  thousands of people yelling: ``Kill the bill. Kill the bill. Kill the  bill.'' And that wasn't it. They were yelling expletives, racial  expletives, at the three of us.   And John looked at me and said: ``Brother Andre, this reminds me of a  darker time, brother.''   John became a mentor. We would call him up, and he would speak to the  Muslim community. We would call him up, and he would speak to the folks  in Indiana who were there when it was announced that Dr. King had  passed, because he was in Indianapolis at the time.                                time  1900    He was a true servant, Mr. Speaker. Jesus was mentioned. John was  like Jesus. I am reminded of a Scripture when Jesus was having a  conversation with his disciples about this notion of leadership, and  Jesus looked at his disciples and said: He who wishes to be chief among  you shall first be your servant.   John was a servant. He wasn't the kind of leader who looked at the  protesters today and said: Oh, what you are going through is nothing  compared to what we went through.   He stood in solidarity with those young folks and embraced those  young folks like a real leader. John is an example to all of us, what  true public servants should be.   We love you, John. God bless.
