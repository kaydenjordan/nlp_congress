 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2258) to provide anti-retaliation protections for antitrust  whistleblowers.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2258         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the Criminal  Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act, legislation that I introduced with  Chairman Nadler, Chairman Cicilline, and Ranking Member Sensenbrenner  that would extend whistleblower protections to private-sector employees  who report criminal antitrust violations to the Federal Government.   Just by way of background, the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation  Act is based on recommendations from a 2011 Government Accountability  Office report. The legislation will protect private-sector employees  for simply doing the right thing and ensure that those who retaliate  against whistleblowers are held accountable.   Under the legislation, an employee who believes that he or she is a  victim of retaliation can file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor,  and it allows for that employee to be reinstated to their former  position if the Secretary finds in his or her favor.   Mr. Speaker, antitrust violations often result in higher prices, less  innovation, and fundamentally less choice. Private-sector employees are  integral in maintaining the integrity of our antitrust laws, without  whom violations such as price and wage fixing would go unreported.   Since our Nation's founding, our country has had a rich tradition of  working to protect whistleblowers. Today, more than ever, honoring that  history is tremendously important. No employee should fear for their  job or face retaliation for exposing illegal, anticompetitive behavior,  such as price fixing.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Chairman Nadler, Chairman  Cicilline, and the majority leader for bringing this bill to the House  floor.   I also want to thank Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy for  spearheading this effort in the Senate and for working so persistently  to get it passed in that Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the chairman of the  Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the chairman of the Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative  Law Subcommittee, Mr. Cicilline, for his leadership, his  thoughtfulness, and for making consumer protection the central focus of  his work and the Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law  Subcommittee's work over this past Congress.   I also thank Mr. Armstrong, my colleague on the other side of the  aisle.   I would lend my voice, as well, to those who have rightfully praised  the work of Mr. Sensenbrenner who, for many years in the United States  Congress, has served with distinction representing the people of  Wisconsin. And I know that this bill was certainly important to him,  and we appreciate his efforts on that front.   Finally, I would close with this: It can be lost on the American  public as we talk about things like price fixing and the antitrust laws  that are currently on the books how that connects to the everyday life  of Americans. Fundamentally, this bill is about consumer protection. It  is about protecting the public.   Before I came to Congress, I served several years in the cabinet of  then-Governor John Hickenlooper, leading our State's Consumer  Protection Agency, the Department of Regulatory Agencies' 600-person  department with a $100 million budget, civil servants from across our  State working hard each and every day to protect the consuming public  and the people of the State of Colorado, the same work that folks do at  the FTC and the Department of Justice in the Antitrust Division each  and every day.   This is another tool that can be used in the toolbox of regulators  here in Washington as we work to make consumer protection a priority  and ultimately partner with those in the private sector who wish to  report abusive and anticompetitive conduct that might be happening in  the broader marketplace.   Again, I am thankful to the sponsors of this bill in the Senate, to  the leadership in the House for bringing this bill forward to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the legislation before  the House, and I yield back the balance of my time.
