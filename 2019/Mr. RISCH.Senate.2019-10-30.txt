 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in  [[Page S6295]]  the office of the Foreign Relations Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                         Japan--F-15J Modernization         The Government of Japan has requested the upgrade of up to       ninety-eight (98) F-15J aircraft to a Japanese Super       Interceptor (JSI) configuration consisting of up to one       hundred three (103) APG-82(v)l Active Electronically Scanned       Array (AESA) Radar (includes 5 spares); one hundred sixteen       (116) Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II) Mission       System Computer (includes 18 spares); and one hundred one       (101) ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare System (DEWS)       (includes 3 spares). Also included are Joint Mission Planning       System (JMPS) with software, training and support; Selective       Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM); ARC-210 radio,       aircraft and munition integration and test support; ground       training devices (including flight and maintenance       simulators); support and test equipment; software delivery       and support; spare and repair parts; communications       equipment; facilities and construction support; publications       and technical documentation; personnel training and training       equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering;       technical and logistics support services; studies and       surveys; and other related elements of logistical and program       support. The estimated total program cost is $4.5 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a major ally that is a force for       political stability, and economic progress in the Asia-      Pacific region. It is vital to U.S. national interest to       assist Japan in developing and maintaining a strong and       effective self-defense capability.        This proposed sale will provide Japan a critical air       defense capability to assist in defending the Japanese       homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there. Modernized F-15J       assets will better enable Japan to respond to airborne       threats and defend its airspace. Japan will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment and support into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor for the FMS portion will be Boeing       Aircraft Company, Everett, WA. The prime contractor for the       DCS portion will be Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) with       Boeing being a sub-contractor in supporting integration of       the FMS and DCS elements. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this sale will require the assignment of       one U.S. Government representative in Japan.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-65       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The proposed sale will be a hybrid Foreign Military       Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) case involving       the release of sensitive technology to the Government of       Japan related to modernizing its F-15J fleet. The F-15J       aircraft is a twin-engine all-weather air superiority fighter       aircraft in service since 1980 and built under license in       Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Previous upgrades were       carried out under the Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP).       The first phase of this program will consist of upgrade       design, development, modification, training, support, and       testing of the first two (2) F-15J test aircraft resulting in       an upgraded Japanese Super Interceptor (JSI) configuration.       The follow-on production phase will incorporate JSI upgrade       kits to modernize up to ninety-six (96) additional F-15J       aircraft.        2. The AN/APG-82(V)I is an Active Electronically Scanned       Array (AESA) radar upgrade for the F-15. It includes higher       processor power, higher transmission power, more sensitive       receiver electronics, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),       which creates higher-resolution ground maps from a greater       distance than existing mechanically scanned array radars. The       upgrade features an increase in detection range of air       targets, increases in processing speed and memory, as well as       significant improvements in all modes.        3. The AN/ALQ-239 Digital Electronic Warfare Suite (DEWS)       provides passive radar warning, wide spectrum RF jamming, and       control and management of the entire DEWS system. This system       is designed as an internal suite largely comprised of       commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology.        4. Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP II) is the       mission processor for the F-15 managing the overall mission       functions for the aircraft. The ADCP II controls the       aircraft's avionics and provides data for the cockpit       displays. It contains multiple core processors enabling rapid       processing of data and is connected to aircraft systems by       redundant MIL-STD-1553 buses and Ethernet interfaces.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware or software in the       proposed sale, the information could be used to develop       counter-measures, which might reduce weapons system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        6. The sensitive technology being released under this       notification is subject to the security criteria established       in National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1) for the Government of       Japan. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Japan.                            ____________________
