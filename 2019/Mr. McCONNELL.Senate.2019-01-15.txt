 Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Madam President, I move to proceed to S. 1.    Madam President, over the course of this partial  government shutdown, we have seen our Democratic colleagues engage in  increasingly acrobatic contortions in order to dodge a serious  conversation about the urgent humanitarian and security crisis down at  our southern border. Their refusal to come to the negotiating table has  serious implications for the hundreds of thousands of Federal workers  going without pay and for all Americans who deserve a nation that can  secure its own border.   Along the way, we have heard that new funding of any sort--any sort-- of border barrier, even the kinds that Democrats have supported so  recently and so often, would now be an immorality. An immorality?   We have heard serious proposals brushed aside with joking offers of  $1 to address the critical issue. We have even heard frank admissions  that, 30 days from now, there would be no progress toward an agreement  on border security, even if the government were reopened.   Under normal circumstances, we could expect lines like these from the  furthest left organizers and most vocal liberal protesters. But these  are not normal circumstances. These are the words, believe it or not,  of the Speaker of the House, the gentlelady from California, Nancy  Pelosi.   It is unclear exactly when the Speaker made the determination that  the explicit requests of the men and women who secure our borders and  the safety of our communities would take a backseat to the political  whims of the far left, that the border efforts toward which Democrats  have agreed to direct billions of dollars in the past have transformed  overnight into something evil. But here we are, day 25. We know the new  and unreasonable position of the Speaker of the House.   So here, in the Senate, my Democratic colleagues have an important  choice to make. They could stand with common sense, with border  experts, with Federal workers--and with their own past voting records,  by the way--or they could continue to remain passive spectators,  complaining from the sidelines as the Speaker refuses to negotiate with  the White House and ensures that our Nation keeps going round and round  and round this political carousel. It is up to our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle.                               Border Security    Madam President, on another matter, the substance of the border  security issue is not the only subject that is occasioning a  spectacular display of inconsistency from my colleagues across the  aisle.   If you recall, since last week, the apparent position of Senate  Democrats has been that the Senate itself cannot engage in any of the  people's business until government funding is resolved.  [[Page S188]]  Democrats have held this position so dogmatically that three times now  they have voted against advancing a bipartisan and urgently needed  package of legislation that concerns Israel, Jordan, and the civil war  in Syria.   It has been the Democrats' very own ``Senate shutdown'' on top of the  partial government shutdown they are prolonging. What about our ally  Israel? What about the innocent people of Syria? I guess they are just  out of luck--just out of luck. The Democratic leader has made clear  that they will just have to wait. They will just have to wait until he  decides to end his filibuster of these bipartisan bills, which, until  last week, by the way, he supported. It is a bizarre position--a truly  bizarre position.   It has directly contradicted the stated foreign policy views of many  of our Democratic colleagues, but this has been the Democratic leader's  position: Filibuster the expanded assistance for Israel. Filibuster the  new consequences for giving aid and comfort to the Assad regime as it  butchers its own people. That is what the Democratic caucus has  overwhelmingly voted to do on three occasions.   But now, we are informed that it was all just a farce. The Democratic  leader actually doesn't mind doing other business because he now  intends to bring a privileged and political stunt of a motion relating  to the administration's use of sanctions against Russia.   So now at least we know the score. Our Democratic colleagues don't  really object to Senate action as such; they just object to debating a  bipartisan package of bills to reinforce our support for Israel, help  Jordan stand firm amidst regional chaos, and take action to hold  accountable those who have tortured and murdered countless--countless-- Syrian civilians.   There is no reason this bill shouldn't sail through Congress and be  signed by the President. A bipartisan bill to support Israel, defend  Jordan, and provide justice for innocent Syria--that is what the  Democratic leader is filibustering. But a partisan motion on an  unrelated foreign policy issue? Oh, he is perfectly happy to see it  come right here to the floor for a vote. As I said, at least we know  the score.   So here is my commitment to Israel and to Jordan and to the Syrian  people: I will continue to force these cynical tactics into the light  of day. Democrats may vote a fourth time--or a fifth time--to  filibuster these bipartisan bills, even as they turn the Senate toward  other business. But Republicans will not abandon the need for American  leadership in the world.                          Nomination of William Barr    Madam President, on one final matter, today our colleagues on the  Judiciary Committee will begin nomination hearings for Mr. William  Barr, the distinguished public servant President Trump has asked to  serve as the Nation's next Attorney General.   Certainly, no one needs me to explain all of the reasons this is a  vital position. The Department of Justice is charged with duties such  as protecting Americans' civil rights, defending the public order to  which citizens are entitled, and upholding the time-honored tradition  that the United States of America is a nation governed by law. So it is  the Nation's good fortune--our good fortune--that the President has  selected such a completely qualified and thoroughly prepared leader to  fill this vacancy.   First and foremost, of course, is the fact that Bill Barr has served  in this position before. As Attorney General under President Bush 41 in  the early 1990s, he fulfilled his oath and led the Department of  Justice with honor and with skill. He was widely regarded as a capable  administrator and as a strong, independent, and principled advocate for  fairness and for following the law.   His tenure confirmed the great confidence that Republican and  Democratic Senators had all placed in him when they confirmed him to  that position unanimously. Democrats controlled the Senate in 1991-- Democrats controlled the Senate in 1991. That is when he was  confirmed--confirmed on a voice vote. Boy, those were the good old  days.   Amid the proceedings, our distinguished colleague Senator Leahy  expressed confidence that Mr. Barr would be ``an independent voice for  all Americans.''   Then-Senator Joe Biden, who was then the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, put it this way at the time: He is ``a heck of an honorable  guy.''   So 28 years ago, leading Democrats were practically heading up the  Bill Barr fan club, and his subsequent service proved they had made the  right call. In fact, this nominee has been unanimously confirmed by the  Senate three times--three times.   Before serving as Attorney General, he worked as an Assistant  Attorney General and a Deputy Attorney General. In no case did even a  single Senator identify a good reason to oppose his confirmation--three  times unanimously.   So it is beyond safe to say that Mr. Barr is eminently qualified and  widely respected. I look forward to his testimony today and to the  testimony of those who know him and his work. I hope every Senator will  afford Mr. Barr the fair consideration he so obviously deserves.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I object.    Let me repeat again what I have said now for some 3  weeks. The solution to this is a negotiation between the one person in  the country who can sign something into law, the President of the  United States, and our Democratic colleagues. For the Senate  Republicans to participate in something that doesn't lead to an outcome  strikes me as not what the Senate ought to be involved in.   We have an important package of bills that have been held up during  the Senate shutdown--never mind the government shutdown--related to our  colleagues, our friends in the Middle East, the Israelis, related to  the Syrian civil war and all the atrocities that have occurred. There  is business to be done in the Senate.   The way to solve the government shutdown is for the administration  and our good friends in the House in the majority and Senate Democrats  to reach a legislative solution. When that happens, I will be more than  happy to call it up because we know it will actually solve the problem.    I object.    Madam President, I believe the Senate's voice should,  indeed, be heard on national security policy. This is why I have moved  to have the Senate's first legislative business this Congress be a  bipartisan package of foreign policy bills. I made it our first  priority to move legislation that would have helped defend Israel and  Jordan and provide justice for the Syrians who have been tortured and  murdered by the Assad regime, but the Democrats have repeatedly blocked  that important legislation.   The Democratic leader said the Senate shouldn't do any business  during this partial government shutdown, but, apparently, he didn't  actually mean it because now the Democratic leader would like to  dictate the terms of a debate on Russia.   We Republicans are hardly strangers to the need for strong policies  concerning Russia. We have long seen Vladimir Putin for the KGB thug  that he is. We have long advocated for tough measures against him and  the kleptocrats who surround him. Just ask the junior Senator from Utah  who, only 6 years ago, was mocked by the other side for advocating  tough policies against the Kremlin.   This Republican administration has taken far tougher measures against  Russia than the previous administration did. It has designated 272  Russia-related individuals and entities for sanctions, expelled scores  of Russian intelligence officers, shuttered Russian diplomatic  outposts, and equipped Ukraine and Georgia to defend themselves against  Russian aggression. Clearly, there is more work to be done, and I look  forward to this Congress's taking additional steps to defend our  interests against the Russian threats and to additionally impose costs  on Putin.   Specifically, I look forward to seeing whether the Democrats will  join us in providing additional funding to rebuild our military in key  areas to deter and defend against Russian investments and key weapons  systems.   I look forward to seeing whether the Democrats will support efforts  to modernize our aging nuclear triad as the Russians have done.   I look forward to the Congress's reviewing its existing sanctions  policies to see how we can impose additional costs on Putin and his  cronies who enable his malign activities.   I look forward to the Congress's ensuring that our sanctions efforts  remain multilateral and maximize support from our European allies,  whose participation is essential to imposing meaningful costs on the  Kremlin.   But, in this narrow case, career civil servants at the Treasury  Department simply applied and implemented the law Congress itself wrote  and which the Democratic leader supported. Treasury's agreement  maintains sanctions on corrupt Russian oligarch Deripaska. It would  continue limiting his influence over companies subject to the  agreement.   In addition to subjecting the companies and their officers to the  unprecedented transparency and monitoring requirements, the agreement  preserves Treasury's ability to snapback sanctions on the companies and  their officers. If there is any evidence of further malfeasance, I  expect Treasury to use that authority to the fullest.   In the meantime, the Democratic leader's political stunt should be  rejected. I move to table this effort to overturn the hard and  painstaking work of the career officials at Treasury, but I look  forward to continuing our efforts to hold Putin and his cronies  accountable in a thoughtful, far less politicized manner.                Vote on Motion to Table the Motion to Proceed    I move to table the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 2, and I ask for  the yeas and nays.    I thank my friend from Rhode Island.                            ____________________     Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk  for S.J. Res. 2.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, January 16; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S.J. Res.  2, with the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided between the two  leaders or their designees; finally, notwithstanding the provisions of  rule XXII, the cloture vote with respect to S.J. Res. 2 occur at 12:30  p.m., tomorrow, and if cloture is not invoked, S.J. Res. 2 be returned  to the calendar.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic colleagues.
