 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of my opening statement at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         Electronic Health Records          Reid Blackwelder is a family physician with       three clinics in the Tri-Cities area of East Tennessee.        A few years ago, he talked to the New York Times about the       electric health records that were supposed to make his life       easier, saying, ``We have electronic records at our clinic,       but the hospital, which I can see from my window, has a       separate system from a different vendor. The two don't       communicate. When I admit patients to the hospital, I have to       print out my notes and send a copy to the hospital so they       can be incorporated into the hospital's electronic records.''        Dr. Blackwelder could pay for his patients' hospital       records to be electronically sent from his system to the       hospital's system--but it would cost him $26,400 every       month--or $316,800 a year. For Dr. Blackwelder, and so many       other doctors, record keeping is now more expensive and       burdensome.        In 1991, the National Academy of Medicine released a report       urging the ``prompt development and implementation'' of what       were then called computer-based patient records. The report       said these systems, ``have a unique potential to improve the       care of both individual patients and . . . to reduce waste       through continuous quality improvement.'' Electronic health       records got a boost in 2009 when the federal government began       the Meaningful Use program, spending over $36 billion in       grants to incentivize doctors and hospitals to use these       systems.        As was the prediction in the 1991 report, the hope was       electronic records would improve patient care and reduce       unnecessary health care spending. This is important because,       at a hearing last summer, Dr. Brent James, from the National       Academies, testified that up to 50 percent of what we spend       on health care is unnecessary.        There is a bipartisan focus both in Congress and in the       Administration on reducing health care costs. One way to       reduce what we spend on administrative tasks and unnecessary       care is by having electronic health records that talk to one       another--we call that interoperability.        But in 2015--six years after the Meaningful Use program       started--as this Committee worked on the 21st Century Cures       Act, we realized that, in many cases, electronic health       records added to administrative burden and increased       unnecessary health care spending.        A major reason for that is that the records are not       interoperable. One barrier to interoperability is information       blocking--which is when some obstacle is in the way of a       patient's information being sent from one doctor to another.        So, in 2015, this committee held six bipartisan hearings       and formed a working group to find ways to fix the       interoperability of electronic health records. These hearings       led to a bipartisan group of HELP Committee members working       together to include a provision in the 21st Century Cures Act       to stop information blocking and encourage interoperability.        Today's hearing is about two new rules the Department of       Health and Human Services has proposed to implement this       provision in the 21st Century Cures Act. These two rules are       complicated, but I'd like to highlight a few ways that they       lay out a path toward interoperability:        First the rules define information blocking--so it is more       precisely clear what we mean when one system, hospital,       doctor, vendor, or insurer is purposefully not sharing       information with another;        Second, the rules require that by January 1, 2020, for the       first time, insurers must share a patient's health care data       with the patient so their health information follows them as       they see different doctors;        Third, all electronic health records must adopt the same       standards for data elements, known as an Application       Programming Interface, or API, two years after these rules       are completed.        Fourth, hospitals are required to send electronic       notifications to a patient's doctors, immediately, when that       patient is admitted to, discharged from, or transferred from       the hospital.        According to the Department of Health and Human Services,       these two new rules should give more than 125 million       patients easier access to their own records in an electronic       format. This will be a huge relief to any of us who have       spent hours tracking down paper copies of our records and       carting them back and forth to different doctors' offices.        The rules will reduce administrative burden on doctors so       they can spend more time with patients. A recent study from       Kaiser found that emergency room doctors, in order to use       electronic health records systems, make up to 4,000 mouse       clicks per shift. If electronic health records data was truly       interoperable, it would greatly reduce how many clicks       doctors have to make. According to HHS, spending less time on       these administrative tasks will improve efficiency and       therefore could save $3.3 billion a year. And because doctors       can see patients' full medical history, they can avoid       ordering unnecessary tests and procedures.        I also want to be aware of unintended consequences from       these rules: Are these rules moving too fast? In 2015, I       urged the Obama Administration to slow down the Meaningful       Use program, which they did not do, and looking back, the       results would have been better if they had.        Are the standards for data elements too rigid? Is the door       still open for bad actors to game the system and continue to       information block? And how can we ensure patient privacy as       patients gain more access and control over their personal       health information. And how do we help them keep it secure?        I want to ensure these rules will make the problem of       information blocking better, not worse. I look forward to any       specific suggestions to improve these rules from those who       use electronic health records systems.        Electronic health records that work can give patients       better outcomes and better experiences at a lower cost.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of my opening statement at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        Strengthening Accountability          When I was president of the University of       Tennessee, I asked David Gardner, who was then president of       the University of California, why his university was       considered one of the best in the world. He told me:        First, autonomy. We basically have four branches of       government, he said, and one of them is the University of       California.        Second, competition and choice--large amounts of state and       federal money following students to the campus of their       choice.        Third, a commitment to excellence by institutional leaders       and faculty.        As a former university president, I am very much aware that       despite that autonomy, our country's 6000 colleges and       universities report to a lot of bosses--they are accountable       to a great many individuals, boards, governments and other       entities.        First, they are accountable to the students who may take       their federal and state grants and loans to any accredited       institution that will admit them;        Next, to 44 federally recognized accrediting agencies whose       certification of quality is necessary before institutions are       allowed to accept students who bring $30 billion in new Pell       grants and $100 billion in federal student loans each year;        To ensure that these billions of dollars are spent wisely,       the federal government measures how many students default on       their loans;        For the 80 percent of students who attend public colleges       and universities, states have governors, state legislators,       laws, and state higher education authorities;        Every institution, public or private, also has its own       board of trustees or directors;        And in addition, there are specific federal rules for the       for-profit institutions, which about five percent of students       attend, in order to stop fraud against students and       taxpayers;        And when making a list of bosses, no former university       president should leave out the faculty--most faculty members       I have known take great pride in maintaining institutional       excellence.        So any president of an American higher education       institution has a lot of bosses and  [[Page S2810]]       a lot of people to whom he or she is accountable. And that       has been a mostly successful approach.        Most surveys show that the United States has most of the       best colleges and universities in the world. The dream of       many of the best students from around the world is to attend       American colleges and universities.        Still, I hear often from students asking if college is       worth their time and money.        I believe there are steps we can take to make our higher       education institutions more accountable--to provide those       students, and the taxpayers backing their loans, with a clear       yes, college is worth it.        In March, at our first bipartisan hearing during this       Congress on updating the Higher Education Act, we looked at       how to simplify how 20 million families apply for federal       student aid. Last week, we held a bipartisan hearing about       how to create a safe environment for students attending       college.        Today's hearing will be looking at ways to ensure that       students are earning degrees worth their time and money and       that taxpayers are paid back the hundreds of billions that       they have loaned students to earn degrees.        To hold colleges accountable for the $130 billion a year in       grants and loans, in 1990, Congress created the Cohort       Default Rate, which applies to all colleges and universities.        This measure makes a college ineligible to receive federal       student aid if, for three consecutive years, more than 30       percent of its borrowers are in default or over 40 percent in       any one year.        However this cohort default rate has proven to be a poor       instrument of accountability, since it does not take into       account the one third of borrowers who are not yet in default       but don't make payments on time.        Over the last decade, only 20 schools have become       ineligible for federal student aid under the Cohort Default       Rate, according to the Congressional Research Service. And       then there are two federal accountability rules that apply       only to for-profit institutions.        One, the 90-10 rule, which requires that at least ten       percent of a for-profit's revenue come from non-federal       sources; and        Two, the Gainful Employment Rule, which looks at how much       debt a graduate has compared to his or her salary.        This comparison of debt to salary has proved to be a       confusing and ineffective measure of accountability because       it is too complex and does not account for students who take       out loans but do not complete their degrees.        So we need a more effective measure of accountability.        But I do not want the federal government acting as a sort       of National School Board for Colleges--telling states and       accreditors and boards of directors at institutions how to       manage the 6,000 colleges and universities.        Four years ago, this Committee passed the Every Student       Succeeds Act, which reversed the trend towards a national       school board for elementary and secondary education.        For the same reasons, Washington should resist the urge to       send thousands of federal bureaucrats to evaluate our       colleges and universities, which would, in effect, create a       national school board for colleges. Instead, Congress should       create a new measure of accountability that looks at whether       students are actually repaying their loans.        This would be a more effective and simpler way to ensure       that taxpayers aren't financing degrees that are priced so       high and worth so little that students are never able to pay       back their loans.        This proposal is much like the Gainful Employment Rule--but       it would apply to every program at every college--public,       private, and for-profit and would include students who took       out loans but dropped out before graduating.        For some programs, this new measure should provide colleges       with an incentive to lower tuition and help their students       stay in school to finish their degrees and find a job so they       can repay their loans.        A second step to improve accountability would be for the       federal government to make the data it collects from colleges       more useful to students and families. The Department has       struggled for years under all administrations to make such       information easily accessible to students and families.        As we work on updating the Higher Education Act, we first       need to identify what information schools actually need to       report, and second to provide direction to the Department on       how to make that information accessible and useful to       students.        And third, we should strengthen the 44 federally recognized       accrediting agencies upon which we rely for certifying that       students are receiving a quality education.        For example, instead of requiring that accreditors have a       standard of ``student achievement,'' Congress could more       clearly require that accreditors measure whether students are       both learning and succeeding, but leave the specific ways of       measuring those to accreditors and institutions.        Our goal needs to be to help students know that their       degrees are going to be worth their time and money and to       help taxpayers know that the federal government isn't       financing programs that do not provide students with a       valuable education.                            ____________________
