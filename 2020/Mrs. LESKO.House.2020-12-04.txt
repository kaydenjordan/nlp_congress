 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current  form.    Mr. Speaker, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,  House Democrats are rushing to pass a sweeping marijuana legalization  bill without considering the unintended consequences the legislation  will have on workplace and public safety.   According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, studies have  suggested specific links between marijuana use and adverse consequences  in the workplace, such as increased risk for injuries or accidents.   According to the Federal Government's own workplace safety experts at  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH,  other studies of cannabis use have demonstrated effects that include  sedation, disorientation, impaired judgment, lack of concentration, and  slowed fine motor skills. As my Democratic colleagues often say, we  need to follow the science.   Currently, it is common practice for employers in industries such as  construction and warehouse logistics to enact zero-tolerance drug  policies that include a prohibition on marijuana usage to protect  workers by ensuring a safe workplace and to comply with Federal law.  Unlike on-demand evaluations of alcohol usage, there currently is no  adequate real-time intoxication testing technology for marijuana  impairment.   By removing marijuana from the list of scheduled substances in the  Controlled Substance Act, the underlying bill will place unnecessary  burdens on private employers and will needlessly jeopardize workplace  and public safety and health.   For instance, the removal of marijuana from the CSA creates legal  jeopardy for employers who are authorized under the Americans with  Disabilities Act to test for illegal drug use while such authorization  does not extend to legal drugs.                                time  1030    My motion to recommit adds specific language to the bill to affirm an  employer's right to test job applicants and employees to ensure  workplace and public safety.   Legalization of marijuana at the State level has already created  complex challenges for employers wishing to maintain a drug-free  workplace while abiding by relevant employment laws.   The bill before us today, which declassifies marijuana as an illegal  drug, would only further complicate employers' compliance obligations  and liability risks and reduce workplace safety around the country.   A last-minute Democrat amendment added to H.R. 3884 recognizes the  right of the Federal Government to test its employees and workers in  safety-sensitive positions covered by the Department of Transportation  regulations, such as pilots and railroad operators. However, the bill  omits the same protections for private-sector employers in other high- hazard industries not covered by DOT regulations.   If we adopt this motion, we will address legal ambiguities that may  arise from removing marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and  affirm private employers' right to drug test employees in order to keep  their workplaces and the public safe.   This is not a gotcha moment. It is not playing politics. My motion to  recommit is a genuine attempt to improve the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
