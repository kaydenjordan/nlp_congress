 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wesley So of  Minnetonka, Minnesota, who earlier this month became the United States  chess champion. At 23 years of age, Wesley is already one of the  world's top chess grandmasters.   In St. Louis, for the U.S. Chess Championship, Wesley So and his  opponent went into a playoff after a two-way tie for first place. In  the two-game playoff, So won the first game handily and was able to  force a draw in the second game with a perpetual check with his knight.  He extended his no-loss streak to 67 games, one of the longest runs in  the game's history.   Mr. Speaker, Wesley So has quickly made a name for himself in the  world of chess since coming to America from the Philippines 5 years  ago. He is now the world's number two ranked player and is in prime  position to play the world's top player, Norway's Magnus Carlsen.   Congratulations to Wesley So on an impressive run of dominance. We  will be cheering for him as he continues to work on becoming the first  American chess grandmaster in more than 40 years.                            ____________________
