 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support  for H.R. 1044, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, introduced  by Congresswoman Lofgren. This bipartisan legislation will help ease  green card backlogs for those facing the longest wait times and help  our businesses retain the high-skilled staff they need to be  competitive.   Last month, I sat down with Sunayana Dumala, who shared her story  with me.   It was only 2 years ago that our community was devastated when  Sunayana's husband, Srinivas, was murdered in a hate crime in Olathe,  Kansas. My predecessor helped her obtain a temporary visa, but she  still faces a potentially decades-long wait to gain citizenship. This  is because, with him gone, her status was at risk.   These green card backlogs need to be resolved. Sunayana is not alone.  Many people have applied for permanent residency and are stuck in long  backlogs for green cards.   H.R. 1044 creates a fair and equitable first-come, first-served  system, helping to even out green card lines and helping to prevent  excessive backlogs for folks like Sunayana. It allows U.S. companies to  focus on what they do best: hiring people with the right skills to  create products, services, and jobs.   This is a piece of a larger, more comprehensive reform needed to fix  our broken immigration system.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an  amendment to the Save the Internet Act that helps the American  consumer.   This amendment requires the Government Accountability Office to  produce a report examining the FCC's efforts to assess competition in  the wireline and wireless broadband internet access markets, and to  tell us how the FCC can better assess competition in the future.   Driving competition in the telecommunications industry is good for  innovation, consumer pricing, and availability of service. It only  makes sense then that we should receive an accurate assessment of the  FCC's current efforts to promote that competition and to ask the GAO  how they might do it better.   I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
