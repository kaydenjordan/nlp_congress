 Madam Speaker, for 48 years the right to choose has been  the law of the land, and it is time that Congress protects that right  and access to the full range of reproductive care.   States are passing dangerous bans on abortion that harm patients and  criminalize doctors, and anti-choice legislators are erecting barriers  that are ever more onerous for women. This has even happened in my home  State of New Hampshire where the legislature passed an abortion ban and  forced ultrasounds for women seeking an abortion.   If the Supreme Court won't protect Roe v. Wade, then Congress must  pass the Women's Health Protection Act.
