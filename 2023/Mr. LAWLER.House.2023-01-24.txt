 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to oppose New York State's  disastrous congestion pricing tax, which is nothing more than a tax  grab hurting middle-class and working-class families in my district,  especially those first responders who are forced to commute into New  York City by car. It would cost them an additional $5,000 a year to  commute to work, $23 a day, just to get into Midtown Manhattan.   Rockland County, where I live, faces a $40 million value gap. We pay  $40 million more in taxes to the MTA system than services we receive.  We have no one-seat ride option from Rockland County, and express rail  service has been cut. In Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess Counties,  commuters have received a 10 percent cut in express rail service.   Many folks choose not to take the subway anymore because of the rise  in crime. Violent felonies are up over 40 percent on the subways in New  York City.   That is why I joined Congressman Gottheimer from New Jersey in  cosponsoring the Anti-Congestion Tax Act. We will hold the MTA  accountable and end this program, stopping it dead in its tracks.                            ____________________
