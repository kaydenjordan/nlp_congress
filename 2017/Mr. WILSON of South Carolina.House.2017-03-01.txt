 Madam Speaker, last night President  Donald Trump spoke to a joint session of Congress and to the American  people in a powerful and positive address.   From day one, President Trump committed himself to fulfilling the  promises he made to the American people, and last night he outlined his  bold agenda. I was grateful to hear his plans to repeal regulations,  reduce taxes, create jobs, repeal and replace ObamaCare, and promote  veterans.   As the chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on  Readiness, I appreciated his determination to rebuild our military by  providing them with the resources they need to promote peace through  strength.   The President's speech received an overwhelmingly optimistic  response, with nearly 60 percent of viewers having a positive reaction.  Additionally, 70 percent of the viewers said the President's policies  would move the country in the right direction.   I look forward to working with the President and Speaker Paul Ryan to  achieve the bold, positive vision for American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his wife, Lola,  a great team for America.                            ____________________
