 Mr. Speaker, after a week of chaos, we now have a rules  package for MAGA extremists, attacking our freedoms and every major  responsibility of this body--from paying America's bills to funding our  government.   This package criminalizes abortion by advancing bills that attack  access and healthcare without a single hearing or markup, undermining  women's economic freedom and bodily autonomy.   Mr. Speaker, as one of the one-in-four women across this country who  have had an abortion, I join those in both parties--and the majority of  this country--who are saying: Not on our watch.   This package also reinstates a CutGo policy that gives wealthy  corporations more tax cuts and strips the right for congressional  workers to unionize. It eliminates our wins to strengthen witness  disclosure requirements for conflicts of interest and exempt climate  change and pandemic relief from senseless paygo rules.   Democrats delivered for the people. Republicans now want a package  that works for the wealthiest few. Vote ``no.''
