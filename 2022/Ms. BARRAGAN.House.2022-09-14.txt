 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Bernard E.  Strickland, a constituent, a veteran, and a doctor. This is a long  overdue recognition that he deserves for his contributions to our  country and to our community.   Born on January 21, 1922, Dr. Strickland served courageously in the  U.S. military during World War II from 1943 to 1946. During his  service, he led a squadron of soldiers as a sergeant in the historic  761st Tank Battalion. Known as Patton's Panthers, they were the first  African-American tank squad to see combat in Europe. They were not  permitted to serve alongside White troops, and they were the ones who  went in to liberate concentration camps.   Dr. Strickland and the rest of the battalion were crucial to  advancing freedom internationally and racial equality domestically. The  761st Tank Battalion also assisted in making sure that those that were  trapped--Jews that were liberated in these concentration camps--were  able to get out. The things that he saw were horrific.   His son, Henry, had reached out to my office to let us know about his  service and about the fact that he had not been recognized.   Today, I am proud to announce that Dr. Strickland will receive eight  medals--eight awards--for his exemplary conduct, including the Good  Conduct Medal; the American Campaign Medal; the European-African-Middle  Eastern Campaign Medal; the World War II Victory Medal; the Army of  Occupation Medal with Germany clasp; the Honorable Service Lapel Button  World War II; the Expert Badge with machine gun bar; and the  Sharpshooter Badge with rifle bar.   Following his honorable discharge, he continued to devote his life to  helping others as a medical doctor practicing medicine for more than 25  years in California.   Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Strickland for his tireless dedication to  his country and to our community.                            ____________________
