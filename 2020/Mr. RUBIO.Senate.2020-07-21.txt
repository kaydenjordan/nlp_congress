 Madam President, today I honor the life and legacy  of Cuban-American radio legend and pioneer, Martha Flores from Miami,  FL.   As South Floridians grieve the loss of Martha Flores, an exemplary  woman and radio trailblazer, let us honor her memory. For more than 60  years, Martha dedicated her life to her beloved audience and to her  South Florida community. Martha, more commonly known as Miami radio's  own ``Queen of the Night,'' or la ``Reina de la Noche'' in Spanish, was  the voice of Cuban exiles and is remembered as the first Cuban female  to conduct her own radio show in Florida.   More than just a radio legend, commentator, philanthropist, actress,  and singer, Martha Flores was a Cuban-American patriot who tirelessly  spoke out against the horrors of communism and advocated for liberty  and freedom of speech worldwide. Although we are left without the Queen  of the Night, her legacy and memory will live in the hearts of many  Floridians for generations to come. May she rest in peace.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Brittany Brown, the  Holmes County Teacher of the Year at Ponce de Leon High School in Ponce  de Leon, FL.   Brittany believes her work as an educator is to help her students  grow and succeed not only in her classroom, but also in their lives.  She finds the most rewarding part of her work hearing of her students'  newfound love of science.   Brittany believes students lose excitement and fascination for  science by the time they reach high school, making one of her primary  goals to rekindle the subject with them. She incorporates modern  scientific equipment and technology in her curriculum to make science  fun and interesting for her students.   Brittany teaches biology, agriculture, and aerospace at Ponce de Leon  High School and has been a science educator for 8 years. She enjoys  teaching and hopes to pass on her passion for the subject to her  students.   I congratulate Brittany for receiving this important recognition. I  look forward to hearing of her continued success in the coming  years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today it is my privilege to honor  Belinda Fries, the Suwannee County Teacher of the Year from Suwannee  High School in Live Oak, FL.

I offer my sincere gratitude to Alan for his decades of work teaching  countless students. I look forward to hearing of his continued good  work in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Daphne Hayes,  the Hardee County Teacher of the Year at Hardee Senior High School in  Wauchula, FL.

For Cheyenna, it is important to know how her students are learning  as they progress throughout the year.

Angela believes that children deserve a champion in their life, and  she wholeheartedly embraces this responsibility. Before she works to  educate her students' minds, she connects with their hearts, learning  who they are individually to design lessons that bring them to the core  of her subject matter. She understands that what some students need  most is not necessarily what is found in lesson plans, but what is  found in a teacher's heart.   Angela knows that educators hold the high honor and responsibility of  influencing future generations. Time spent in grade school encompasses  a student's most formative years, sometimes spent more with teachers  than with parents. In consideration of this, at the beginning of each  school year, Angela invites parents to download an app that provides  them with access to communicate with the classroom, following the  lesson plan alongside students each day.   I thank Angela for all the great work she has done for her students  over the years. I extend my best wishes to her and look forward to  hearing of her continued good work in the coming years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I recognize Cari Rodriguez,  the Broward County Teacher of the Year from Harbordale Elementary  School in Fort Lauderdale, FL.

It is my privilege to recognize a family- owned small business known for its community leadership and authentic  Cuban cuisine. This week, it is my pleasure to honor Sergio's Family  Restaurant of Miami, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1975, Blanca Cabrera opened what would become Sergio's Family  Restaurant as a small sandwich shop off of Bird Road in Miami. Equipped  with generations of family recipes, Blanca sought to honor her Cuban  heritage. Her shop provided employment for several refugees, providing  dignified work as they built new lives. She offered a fresh take on  Cuban and American cuisine, and her sandwich shop became a local hit.   Today, Sergio's Family Restaurant has expanded to 13 locations in  South Florida. Carlos Gazitua, the chief executive officer, is the  third generation family member to lead Sergio's. Under his leadership,  the business has expanded its community involvement and emphasized  healthy living while retaining its signature flavor. Sergio's has been  recognized by the Florida Department of Health as the first certified  restaurant to take part in the Healthy Happens Here restaurant  initiative, incorporating low-calorie versions of traditional Cuban  eats on their menu.   At the local and State level and among its industry peers, Sergio's  has been recognized for its outstanding cuisine. They were named Best  Drive-Thru of 2015 by the Miami New Times, recognized as the 2017  Restaurant of the Year by the South Florida Tourism Professional  Awards, and their traditional empanadas were featured in ``Florida's  Best Cheap Eats'' by Travel & Leisure Magazine. Additionally, the city  of Miami and Miami-Dade County mayors honored Sergio's with Croqueta  Day on October 2, 2018. On this day, Sergio's served its 20 millionth  croqueta--croquette.   As a community leader, Sergio's has advocated for several nonprofit  organizations and local small businesses. In 2015, Sergio's donated  food to a Live Like Bella Childhood Cancer Foundation event. Then- Governor Rick Scott recognized Sergio's service in 2017, when they  collected and shipped food and supplies to Puerto Rico after Hurricane  Maria devastated the island. When Super Bowl LIV was held in Miami in  2020, Sergio's partnered with The Women's Fund of Miami-Dade to raise  funds for its mission to create awareness and preventing sex  trafficking. Additionally, Carlos has advocated for small business in  local and industry events, including the ``Bring Small Business Back''  initiative.   Like many Floridian small businesses, Sergio's Family Restaurant  stepped up to help its community during the coronavirus pandemic. They  participated in several social media, radio, and video initiatives  encouraging support for local, family-owned small businesses.  Partnering with the Miami Heat and the Miami Dade County Public School  Superintendent, Sergio's Restaurant provided meals for more than 500  people in the Liberty City area. Sergio's collaborated with Meals for  Heroes Miami to feed local healthcare workers and first responders,  including donating approximately 1,400 meals to the Miami-Dade Fire  Rescue teams. Additionally, Carlos worked with U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services and the Florida Restaurant Lodging  Association to provide more than 350,000 reusable masks for hospitality  workers in South Florida.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program, it provided a much needed lifeline to small  businesses, including Sergio's Restaurant. The PPP provides forgivable  loans to impacted small businesses and nonprofits who maintain their  payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to a PPP loan, Sergio's  was able to keep their employees paid until Miami reopened. Their  community leadership and advocacy was recognized by Governor Ron  DeSantis who visited Sergio's in early June.   Through their service and leadership, Sergio's Family Restaurant is  an outstanding example of how small businesses uplift their  communities. I commend their support for local small businesses.  Congratulations to Carlos and the entire team at Sergio's restaurant. I  look forward to watching your continued growth and success throughout  South Florida.                            ____________________
