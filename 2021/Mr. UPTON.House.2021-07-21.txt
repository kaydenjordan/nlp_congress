 Madam Speaker, most folks have never heard of PFAS. In  Michigan we found out the hard way. Again.   Sadly, we know a little bit about water contamination. Think Flint,  think lead. PFAS is bad, too. Really bad.   The EPA has been slow at the switch. Three years ago, I stepped off  the plane coming back from D.C. for the August break, and I got a call.  It was bad. It was from one of my State senators. One of my towns had  been identified just a few hours earlier with having alarming PFAS  parts per trillion numbers.   We had to act right away. I drove straight to the sheriff command  center, prompted the immediate notification of thousands of residents.  It was nearly midnight. Before they could make infant formula or coffee  in the morning or even water their vegetable garden, they had to stop.  They had to unplug their icemakers in their refrigerators. For months  they had to line up at churches and schools to get cases of water for  human consumption.   We had a bipartisan bill to require the EPA to set a minimum standard  for PFOA and PFAS, which House Republicans agreed to, but we were later  denied. It would have started the EPA's clock, which is why we need to  act now.   We know this stuff is bad. We know this causes cancer. This bill is  not perfect. It needs to see a number of constructive changes before it  reaches the President's desk, but I want to thank  Dan Kildee and Brian  Fitzpatrick, the two co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS  Task Force.   I want to thank Chairman Pallone. I also want to thank my colleague  Debbie Dingell for authoring this bill.
