 Mr. Speaker, I thank both the majority leader and the  minority whip for yielding me time.   Today is a great day, but it is also a sad day for me. I am losing my  chief of staff, the only one that I have had since I have been here,  Virgil Miller, who, the funny story is, John Dingell made the reference  for me to hire him.   The one thing I appreciate now is that when I called John Dingell for  a recommendation, he was on the House floor, but told his staff, ``No  matter where I am, pull me off so I can talk about how great Virgil  Miller is.''   Some of you may have seen the news, but Virgil proposed. More  importantly, Kirby said yes. So he is getting married and starting  another chapter of his life.   It was great to have him here in this body, and I hope for him the  best. He is not only my chief, but he has come to be part of our family  and like a younger brother to me. I just want to wish him the best as  he goes off to start a more exciting part of his life and wish him the  best.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for allowing me to say a few  words.
