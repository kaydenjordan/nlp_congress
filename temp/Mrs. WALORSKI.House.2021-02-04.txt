 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: I absolutely reject racism, anti- Semitism, and bigotry. I condemn conspiracy theories and calls for  violence. I do not, in any way, condone these reprehensible views. I am  not here today to defend any comments made by Representative Greene,  whether as a private citizen, candidate, or Member of Congress.   I am here today to defend the precedent set by years of the majority  and minority parties coexisting in this body; and I am here today to  defend the House Ethics Committee, on which I serve as the ranking  member.                                time  1630    H. Res. 72 is nothing more than a partisan power grab at a critical  time when the majority party itself repeatedly calls for unity as our  path forward. Bringing a majority resolution to the floor to remove a  minority Member from her committee assignments is wrong and  unprecedented.   Referring such a resolution to the House Ethics Committee is  unprecedented. Referring such a resolution to the House Ethics  Committee and then completely bypassing the committee's role is  unprecedented. On this floor today we are witnessing one more effort to  consolidate power with a majority party and diminish the rights of the  minority.   This is not the first power grab effort by this majority in Congress.  Earlier this year, the Democrats destroyed over 100 years of  representation in Congress and effectively eliminated the only tool  that safeguarded the minority's voice: the motion to recommit. And they  are doing it again today with H. Res. 72.   In the last 20 years, several Members have been removed from their  committee duties. Members on both sides of the aisle have been removed  and for various reasons. But those reasons and that decision was always  made by the Member's party leadership, or party's membership. Even if  the decision to remove a Member was followed with a voice vote on the  House floor, the decision itself was made by that Member's caucus  following weeks of public and private infighting.   Last night, the Republican Conference met to discuss statements made  by Representative Greene prior to her serving the Congress. We listened  to Representative Greene. She made similar statements as she did on the  floor today. She assured the Conference that her prior statements did  not reflect her views today as a member of this body.   The Democratic majority claims the Republican Conference hasn't  acted, but that simply isn't true. The Conference just hasn't done what  the Democrats want it to do.   Regardless, the majority has brought this unprecedented resolution  before the House today. The majority party could have brought this  matter directly to the floor as a privileged question and the question  of removal would have been a swift vote on the floor.   Instead, the majority referred the resolution to the Ethics Committee  to then immediately and completely bypass the Ethics Committee and its  functions by bringing this resolution directly to the floor.   Involving the committee, then to only bypass the committee, violates  the collegial and bipartisan manner by which the Ethics Committee  should operate.   This is my second term serving on the Ethics Committee and I was  looking forward to working with Chairman Deutch in a collegial and  bipartisan manner. You see, the Committee on Ethics is unique. It is  the only standing House committee with equal numbers of Democrat and  Republican Members: five Democrats and five Republicans.   There is a reason that neither party holds a majority on this  committee and that reason is to avoid one party or the other  weaponizing the committee's purpose for use in a political and partisan  fashion.   The committee has publicly warned of this risk before. In 2012,  following a particularly contentious investigation, the committee  publicly expressed the necessity of bipartisan cooperation within the  committee leadership.   The committee stated: ``Unlike any other committee, this committee  avoids partisan legislative concerns and policies, and must have  bipartisan cooperation for the committee to fulfill its constitutional  mandate to police the Members, officers and employees of the House.  That mission calls upon Members to step out of their partisan framework  and approach the work of the committee without regard to their party.  It is our recommendation, for any Member that serves on this committee,  that he or she constantly evaluate their actions on the committee to  ensure that they are living up to the highest standards of this  committee.''   Today, we do not see the Ethics Committee's leadership upholding the  highest standards of bipartisan cooperation. We don't see today the  chair and ranking member presenting a resolution on the House floor  together.   At the end of each Congress, the committee issues a report detailing  the activities of the committee during the Congress. For each Congress  Chairman Deutch has served on Ethics, the committee has worked in a  collegial and bipartisan manner, to be able to state that--for the  113th, 114th, 115th, and 116th Congress--all votes taken in the  investigative subcommittees were unanimous.   This stack of public reports represents all the hard work the  committee has completed in the last four Congresses. All of this work  of the committee--completed by its sitting  [[Page H349]]  Members, the Members who were asked to serve in the investigative  subcommittees and the committee's professional and nonpartisan staff-- was accomplished in bipartisan cooperation.   In fact, Chairman Deutch himself recognized in the committee report  for the 116th Congress that: ``All of the committee's work . . . is  made possible by the committee's talented, professional, nonpartisan  staff. The members of the committee wish to acknowledge their hard work  and dedication to the committee and the House. In addition, the  committee wishes to thank its departing Members . . . for their service  and for the thoughtfulness and collegiality they showed during their  time on the committee.''   As you can see, the work on the Ethics Committee is extensive. In the  116th Congress alone, the committee commenced or continued  investigative fact-finding gatherings for 50 separate investigative  matters, impaneled six investigative committees, and filed five reports  with the House, totaling over 3,300 pages regarding various  investigative matters.   These tasks were agreed to by the chair and the ranking member of the  committee. In fact, the phrase itself, ``chair and ranking minority  member'' appears 38 times, 38 times in the committee rules. The  Ethics Committee operates effectively because it is consensus driven  with decisions made jointly by the chair and the ranking member.    But that is not what is happening today on this floor. The current  chair and ranking member have not received a complaint and determined  whether the information meets the requirements of the committee rules.   The current chair and ranking member have not jointly gathered  information concerning this alleged conduct. Until yesterday's Rules  hearing, the chair and the ranking member had not had a single  conversation regarding Representative Greene.   As I stated earlier, involving the committee then to only bypass its  function, violates the spirit of how this unique committee operates.  Once a majority determined that the Ethics Committee was the place for  the resolution, it should have allowed the committee to consider the  issues properly.   I know our colleagues want to see the Ethics Committee function  effectively and not to be used as a partisan political weapon on a  manipulated platform. If the Ethics Committee is to consider reviewing  statements made by Members of Congress before they were sworn in, then  the matter should come before the Ethics Committee in a way that  complies with committee rules, preserves the bipartisanship intended,  and allows the committee to make legal conclusions and factual  determinations in a collegial environment.   All I ask is that we let the committee work, as it is supposed to, to  effectively serve this body. To do so, the majority should withdraw  this resolution if it chooses, and pursue the matter properly through  the Ethics Committee. I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), ranking member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Spartz), my new colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I absolutely reject racism, anti-Semitism, and bigotry,  as I said earlier. I condemn conspiracy theories and calls for  violence. I do not in any way condone these reprehensible views.   Sadly, though, here we are today to effectuate another partisan power  grab. The Democratic majority has taken unprecedented steps to  marginalize Republicans just because we have not done what they want us  to do, and that is wrong.   There is a reason that neither party holds a majority on the Ethics  Committee, and the reason is to avoid one party or the other  weaponizing the committee's purpose for use in political and partisan  fashion.   The majority should withdraw this resolution and, if it chooses,  pursue this matter properly through the Ethics Committee.   If the resolution is not withdrawn, then I will vote ``no'' and hope  at some point the Ethics Committee will again be used to serve this  body as intended.   Our colleagues deserve better, and the House, as an institution,  deserves better. I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
