 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in  support of the SECURE Act, a bill that gets to the heart of our  retirement income crisis.   Unfortunately, too many of my constituents are in danger of not  having enough money to put away for retirement. In fact, 86 percent of  Nevadans do not feel financially prepared for retirement, and most  older Nevadans wished they had saved more money.   Fortunately, the SECURE Act will make it easier for Nevadans to save  for their retirement. It makes it easier for small businesses to offer  retirement plans to their employees, allows part-time workers to  participate in 401(k) plans, and provides relief to pension plans,  ranging from rural co-ops to organizations like the Jewish Federation  of America.   I am also proud to share that this legislation includes my bill, H.R.  2806, which fixes a provision in the flawed Republican tax plan that  raised the tax rate for scholarship and fellowship students up to 37  percent.   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I would like to thank  Chairman Neal for his leadership in getting this bipartisan bill passed  unanimously through our committee.   The SECURE Act will help families achieve lifetime financial  security, a core of the American Dream. I urge every Member of this  body to support its passage.                            ____________________
