 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Navy Seaman  Second Class Charles Louis ``Sonny Boy'' Saunders of Winnie, Texas, in  my district.   Seaman Saunders was serving aboard the USS Oklahoma on the morning of  December 7, 1941. Tragically, the Oklahoma sustained 429 casualties  during the attack on Pearl Harbor, claiming Mr. Saunders' life that  morning. After eight decades, 80 years, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting  Agency, or DPAA, has identified Seaman Saunders' remains.   This year, he will be reinterred in his hometown on the 80th  anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Mr. Saunders was born to Mortimer Alvin  and Melina Falke Saunders on October 16, 1923. He was the sixth child  and one of four boys. His oldest brother, Adam, passed away at just 13  months old. He grew up with his sisters Lillie Mae, Mary Alice, Sadie  Lee, and Anna Belle, along with brothers Sidney ``Buddy'' Edward and  Mortimer Virgil.   The Great Depression led to difficult times as their father worked in  construction and labored in the rice fields to provide for his family  while his mother cared for the home and raised their children. Mr.  Saunders' youngest sister, Anna Belle, always spoke of her brother's  compassion and how he sacrificed so that she could have shoes for her  daily walk to school.   His kind, caring, and playful nature fueled his ambition to serve our  Nation. On November 23, 1940, 1 month after his 17th birthday, he  joined the United States Navy. Not only did he possess a deep desire to  serve our country, but he also had a great determination to make a  better life for his parents and his siblings.   On December 7, 1941, Japanese aircraft launched a surprise attack on  the American fleet of battleships that were moored at Pearl Harbor,  thrusting the United States into the Second World War.   After Seaman Saunders' warship capsized because of the damage from  the multiple Japanese torpedoes, his whereabouts were unknown.  According to a casualty roster of the Oklahoma compiled 2 weeks after  the attack, Seaman Saunders' status was labeled as ``missing'' but then  later was amended to be ``killed in action.''   Those who perished aboard the USS Oklahoma were buried at two  different cemeteries: the Halawa and Nu'uanu Naval Cemeteries in  Hawaii. Most of the remains were recovered during salvage operations  but were unable to be  [[Page H6720]]  identified before their interment, and therefore, they were buried as  ``unknowns.''   In recognition of his service, Seaman Saunders was awarded a Purple  Heart for military merit and three ribbons for American Defense,  American Campaign, and the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign.   As the last living sibling, Anna Belle was committed to bringing her  brother home and laying him to rest at the gravesite that their parents  prepared for him those years and years ago at Fairview Cemetery in  Winnie, Texas.                                time  1045    In 2015, the DPAA was given authority to exhume the unknown remains  of these servicemen associated with the USS Oklahoma and to reexamine  them. It was at this point that the military contacted Anna Belle, his  younger sister. She worked tirelessly to gather and provide DNA of  family members to help identify her brother's remains.   Unfortunately, Anna Belle passed away on July 19, 2019, but she never  lost hope that her brother would one day return home. She prayed her  unwavering mission would be continued by those who survived her, and it  was. On February 11, 2021, the Saunders family received word that their  long-lost relative had finally been found and identified.   Mr. Speaker, Seaman Second Class Charles ``Sonny Boy'' Saunders'  arrival in Winnie, Texas, will be welcomed by many relatives, friends,  and fellow patriots; finally coming home. On the 80th anniversary of  his passing, Mr. Saunders will be buried alongside his parents with  full military honors.   May God continue to bless this family for their long record of  service and sacrifice to our great Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much, my good  friend and colleague from Florida, Representative Cammack, for this  Special Order hour.   Madam Speaker, this is a baby at 15 weeks old. He or she can sense  light, make facial expressions, and feel pain. The beating of their  fully functioning heart can be heard on an ultrasound, and all of their  major organs are being developed.   Today, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Dobbs v. Jackson  case. In the coming months, it will rule on whether Mississippi and  other States like them can prohibit the murder of an unborn baby after  15 weeks of age.   Currently, the United States is one of seven nations, including North  Korea and China, that allow abortion on demand after a baby can feel  pain. I don't know about you, Madam Speaker, but I am appalled that our  standard of human rights for the unborn is so low that we actually  align with nations like North Korea and China.   When will the so-called party of science actually accept the science  proving that life begins at conception? I am earnestly praying that the  Supreme Court makes the right and the just decision to allow States to  continue defending the very most innocent among us.   But no matter the outcome, I will never surrender the fight for our  unborn.
