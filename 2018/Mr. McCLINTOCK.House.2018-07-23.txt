Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2630, the La Paz County Land Conveyance Act, is  authored by Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona. It directs the Secretary  of the Interior to convey 8,000 acres of Federal land to La Paz County,  Arizona, at fair market value for the construction of a solar field.   La Paz County is among the few counties in the United States with  nearly 95 percent of its land owned by the Federal, State, or Tribal  governments. Because of the immense Federal footprint in the county, a  land transfer is necessary so that it can secure enough space for this  type of development. The county will not only pay for the land, but all  the administrative costs of the transfer as well.   The county has already worked with the BLM to identify a site  adjacent to preexisting and proposed electric, fiber optic, and natural  gas transmission lines. A review of the proposed site by the BLM has  not revealed any endangered species or historic resources in the area,  and much of the proposed site already has a significant amount of  surface disturbance.   La Paz County suffers high unemployment, and this land conveyance  will not only provide additional energy to the growing southern  California and Phoenix markets, but it will also bring good-paying jobs  to many families in the county.   I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the author of this measure, the  chairman of the Western Caucus of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask all of the Members to  consider what plight their districts would be in, their counties would  be in if 95 percent of the land in that county was off the public tax  rolls, with severe restrictions on its use. The effect is economically  devastating.   This is a small step in the direction of giving La Paz County a  little more control over its economic future. It is an excellent bill,  and I urge its adoption.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1220) to establish the Adams Memorial Commission to carry  out the provisions of Public Law 107-62, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1220         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ADAMS MEMORIAL COMMISSION.         (a) Commission.--There is established a commission to be       known as the ``Adams Memorial Commission'' (referred to in       this section as the ``Commission'') for the purpose of       establishing a permanent memorial to honor John Adams and his       legacy as authorized by Public Law 107-62, located in the       city of Washington, District of Columbia, including sites       authorized by Public Law 107-315.

(c) Chair and Vice Chair.--The members of the Commission       shall select a Chair and Vice Chair of the Commission. The       Chair and Vice Chair shall not be members of the same       political party.        (d) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall not       affect its powers if a quorum is present, but shall be filled       in the same manner as the original appointment.        (e) Meetings.--        (1) Initial meeting.--Not later than 45 days after the date       on which a majority of the members of the Commission have       been appointed, the Commission shall hold its first meeting.        (2) Subsequent meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the       call of the Chair.        (f) Quorum.--A majority of the members of the Commission       shall constitute a quorum but a lesser number of members may       hold hearings.        (g) No Compensation.--A member of the Commission shall       serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for       expenses incurred in carrying out the duties of the       Commission.        (h) Duties.--The Commission shall consider and formulate       plans for a permanent memorial to honor John Adams and his       legacy, including the nature, location, design, and       construction of the memorial.        (i) Powers.--The Commission may--        (1) make such expenditures for services and materials for       the purpose of carrying out this section as the Commission       considers advisable from funds appropriated or received as       gifts for that purpose;        (2) accept gifts, including funds from the Adams Memorial       Foundation, to be used in carrying out this section or to be       used in connection with the construction or other expenses of       the memorial; and        (3) hold hearings, enter into contracts for personal       services and otherwise, and do such other things as are       necessary to carry out this section.        (j) Reports.--The Commission shall--        (1) report the plans required by subsection (h), together       with recommendations, to the President and the Congress at       the earliest practicable date; and        (2) in the interim, make annual reports on its progress to       the President and the Congress.        (k) Applicability of Other Laws.--The Federal Advisory       Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to the       Commission.        (l) Termination.--The Commission shall terminate 7 years       after the date of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC LAW 107-62.         Public Law 107-62 is amended by striking ``Adams Memorial       Foundation'' each place it occurs and inserting ``Adams       Memorial Commission''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, several of the central figures in the winning of  American independence and the founding of our constitutional republic  are given short shrift among the memorials in this capital city, and  none among them is more deserving than John Adams.   By all accounts, he was the animating figure in pushing the  Continental Congress to declare independence; he was indefatigable in  the prosecution of the war, both from stations at home and from Europe;  and is our first vice president under Washington; and as our second  President, he established many of the traditions and policies that set  our course.   Public Law 107-62 authorized the nonprofit Adams Memorial Foundation  to establish a memorial to John Adams in the District of Columbia under  the Commemorative Works Act and to collect private donations for that  purpose. No Federal funds can be used for the memorial.   The foundation has developed initial design concept, it has conducted  location reviews, and coordinated with Congress, the National Park  Service, and other stakeholders, but it has not yet been able to select  a site, design the memorial, receive the approvals, or raise sufficient  funds for construction.   Under the Commemorative Works Act, the foundation's authority to  erect a memorial expires in December of 2020.   H.R. 1220, by Congressman Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, would  transfer that authority to the Adams Memorial Commission.   The commission would have all the powers and responsibilities of the  foundation and would consist of 12 members. Its authority to erect a  memorial will expire in 7 years, consistent was the CWA timeline.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am  ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to compliment Congressman  Lynch and thank him on behalf of the Nation for keeping this memorial  alive and keeping its momentum going.   This is highly deserved, it is long overdue, and this measure takes  us another step toward the recognition of one of America's greatest  Founding Fathers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3045) to amend the National Trails System Act to extend the  Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3045         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Eastern Legacy Extension       Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF LEWIS AND CLARK NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL.         (a) Extension.--Section 5(a)(6) of the National Trails       System Act (16 U.S.C. 1244(a)(6)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``three thousand seven hundred'' and       inserting ``4,900'';        (2) by striking ``Wood River, Illinois,'' and inserting       ``the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,''; and        (3) by striking ``maps identified as, `Vicinity Map, Lewis       and Clark Trail' study report dated April 1977.'' and       inserting ``the map entitled Lewis and Clark National       Historic Trail Authorized Trail Including Proposed Eastern       Legacy Extension, dated April 2018, and numbered 648/      143721.''        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the date that is 60 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3045, which comes to us by  Congressman Luke Messer of Indiana, would extend the Lewis and Clark  National Historic Trail.   Its purpose is to preserve and interpret for future generations the  Corps of Discovery's important preparations for its trailblazing  journey into the Western United States.   In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson charged Captains Meriwether Lewis  and William Clark with finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean  across the United States' newly purchased Louisiana Territory and with  seeking out and identifying wildlife, vegetation, and native  populations along the way.  [[Page H6625]]    The journey contributed greatly to the scientific knowledge and  helped to foster profound political, social, economic, cultural, and  environmental changes to the lands and the peoples of the North  American continent.   The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail was established in 1978  and spans 3,700 miles following the route of the Lewis and Clark  expedition west of the Mississippi River from Wood River, Illinois, to  Astoria, Oregon.   H.R. 3045 would extend the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail by  1,200 miles, with a new eastern boundary at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,  following the path of the Ohio River.   The Eastern Legacy Extension of the trail encompasses important  history and key moments for the expedition.   In February of 2018, at the direction of Congress, the National Park  Service completed a study on the proposed extension of this trail. The  study found the route proposed for inclusion in H.R. 3045 to be  nationally significant, suitable and feasible for inclusion in the  existing Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.   The Eastern Legacy Extension provided by this legislation recognizes  the significance of the planning, preparation, and beginning  preparations for the expedition, and will provide new opportunities for  Americans to learn about the Corps of Discovery and the lands along the  Ohio River where Lewis and Clark refined the techniques that prepared  them for the hardships of the long trip west.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, the Lewis and Clark Expedition was  literally one of the seminal events that produced this great Nation,  spanning from coast to coast, and the completion of this full trail is  an important step in recognizing the heroism and the vision of those  who came before us to build this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask for adoption of the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5875) to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration  Act and the Dingell-Johnson Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act,  to provide parity for United States territories and the District of  Columbia, to make technical corrections to such Acts and related laws,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5875         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. APPORTIONMENT UNDER PITTMAN-ROBERTSON WILDLIFE                     RESTORATION ACT.

(b) Apportionment of Wildlife Conservation and Restoration       Account Among Territories and the District of Columbia.--The       second subsection (c) of section 4 of the Pittman-Robertson       Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669c), as added by       section 902(e) of H.R. 5548, as introduced in the 106th       Congress and enacted into law by section 1(a)(2) of Public       Law 106-55, and relating to apportionment of the Wildlife       Conservation and Restoration Account, is amended by striking       paragraph (1) and inserting the following:        ``(1) The Secretary of the Interior shall apportion from       the Wildlife Conservation and  [[Page H6626]]       Restoration Account to each of the District of Columbia,       American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto       Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands a sum equal to not       more than one-half of 1 percent of such Account.''.        (c) Repeal of Percentage Restrictions on Apportionments to       Territories.--Section 8A of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife       Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669g-1) is amended by striking       ``as he shall determine, not exceeding'' and all that follows       through ``, in any one year,'' and inserting ``as the       Secretary shall determine for each year,''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5875, introduced by my colleague from Guam (Ms.  Bordallo), addresses the existing disparity between the 50 States and  the U.S. territories with regard to the formulas within the Pittman- Robertson and Dingell-Johnson conservation programs. While the  territories are included in the statutory definition as States, they  are not afforded an opportunity to receive an equal share of Pittman- Robertson and Dingell-Johnson funding.   The legislation provides the Secretary of the Interior with greater  flexibility in apportioning conservation funds and requires parity  between the States and the territories with respect to funding for  basic hunter education programs.   Under current law, each State is guaranteed at least a 1 percent  share of yearly Pittman-Robertson apportionment. However, the current  statute caps Puerto Rico's share at one-fourth of 1 percent and the  four other U.S. territory shares at just one-sixth of 1 percent. In  other words, they pay the fees and the taxes, but they don't get equal  access to the funds.   H.R. 5875 specifically removes the existing caps on funds for basic  hunter education programs and would mandate that each territory and  State receive not less than 1 percent in any given year. The bill also  removes additional restrictions on apportionments for wildlife and  sport fishing restoration projects.   The absence of caps will allow the Secretary of the Interior to  exercise discretion in apportioning Pittman-Robertson and Dingell- Johnson funds to the five U.S. territories in proportion to their  populations, as it is done currently for each of the 50 States.   The user-pays approach facilitated by Pittman-Robertson and Dingell- Johnson has consistently delivered significant benefits to hunters,  recreational shooters, and all citizens through the delivery of on-the- ground wildlife and habitat conservation activities.   It is time we make the apportionment of these important funds fair to  all 50 States and the territories. I urge adoption of the measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for  bringing this bill to the House. This really is an injustice to think  that the people of the territories pay the full amount of the fees and  yet only get a fraction of the benefits that are afforded to the States  that are paying the same fees. This corrects that injustice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill's adoption, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5979) to establish the Mill Springs Battlefield National  Monument in the State of Kentucky as a unit of the National Park  System, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5979         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5979, introduced by Representative Hal Rogers of  Kentucky, establishes the Mill Springs Battlefield National Monument in  Kentucky as a unit of the National Park System.   The Battle of Mill Springs was one of Kentucky's largest Civil War  battles and played a crucial role in the Union's success by securing  the Cumberland Gap and providing the gateway into Tennessee.   The Battle of Mill Springs bolstered the Union's morale, as it was  the first major victory of the war following the disastrous defeat at  First Manassas. Winning the battle enabled the Union to push all  Confederate powers out of Kentucky and allowed them to advance into  Confederate strongholds in Middle Tennessee.   Mill Springs Battlefield was designated as a National Historic  Landmark in 1994. The boundary was expanded in 2008 and now encompasses  over 1,500 acres. The nonprofit Mill Springs Battlefield Association  currently owns 900 acres of battlefield land and operates a visitors  center at the site.   H.R. 5979 establishes the Mill Springs Battlefield National Monument  as a unit of the National Park System. The proposed monument would be  approximately 1,500 acres, of which 900 will be donated to the Park  Service.   I am grateful to Mr. Rogers for sponsoring this legislation. It is  the right way to create a national monument. Monuments ought to be  created through the open legislative process of Congress and not via  executive fiat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield such time as  he may consume to gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the  distinguished author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, these historic sites provide a tangible  link between our generation and those who came before us and allow us  to draw inspiration from the deeds and sacrifices of those who built  this country and secured freedom for all Americans. This is an  important part of that story, and I would ask for adoption of the  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6077) recognizing the National Comedy Center in Jamestown,  New York, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6077         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Comedy Center       Recognition Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL COMEDY CENTER IN JAMESTOWN,                     NEW YORK.         (a) Congressional Recognition.--Congress--        (1) recognizes that the National Comedy Center, located in       Jamestown, New York, is the only museum of its kind that       exists for the exclusive purpose of celebrating comedy in all       its forms; and        (2) officially designates the National Comedy Center as the       National Comedy Center.        (b) Effect of Recognition.--The National Comedy Center       recognized in this section is not a unit of the National Park       System, and the designation shall not be construed to require       or permit Federal funds to be expended for any purpose       related to the Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the National Comedy Center in downtown Jamestown, New  York, is a nonprofit institution that tells the story of comedy in  America.   Opening next month, the center is a live performance space as well as  an interactive museum. It is the first national scale, nonprofit,  cultural institution with a visitor experience dedicated to comedy  outside of the U.S. Senate.   The museum is acquiring the personal archives of prominent American  comedians and will showcase more than 50 exhibits on the history of  comedy from early vaudeville to today. In addition, the center operates  the Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum, as Jamestown is the birthplace of  Ms. Ball.   H.R. 6077 will officially designate the National Comedy Center in  Jamestown, New York, as the National Comedy Center. The center will not  be a part of or affiliated with the National Park System. Just to be  crystal clear, this designation will not require Federal funds to be  expended for any purpose related to the center--no joke.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), who is the author of this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask for adoption of the measure,  and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2850) to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights  Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the WMAT  Settlement Fund.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2850         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. USE OF FUNDS IN WMAT SETTLEMENT FUND FOR WMAT                     RURAL WATER SYSTEM.         (a) Authorization of WMAT Rural Water System.--Section       307(a) of the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights       Quantification Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-291; 124 Stat.       3080) is amended in the matter preceding paragraph (1) by       inserting ``, (b)(2),'' after ``subsections (a)''.        (b) Funding.--Section 312(b)(2)(C)(i)(III) of the White       Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010       (Public Law 111-291; 124 Stat. 3093) is amended by striking       the period at the end and inserting the following: ``,       including the planning, design, and construction of the WMAT       rural water system, in accordance with section 307(a).''.       SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF PUEBLO OF SANTA CLARA LAND ELIGIBLE FOR                     99-YEAR LEASE.         Subsection (a) of the first section of the Act of August 9,       1955 (commonly known as the ``Long-Term Leasing Act'') (25       U.S.C. 415(a)), is amended--        (1) by striking ``Indians,,'' and inserting ``Indians,'';        (2) by inserting ``Ohkay Owingeh pueblo,'' after       ``Cochiti,'';        (3) by inserting ``the pueblo of Santa Clara,'' after       ``Pojoaque,'';        (4) by striking ``the the lands'' and inserting ``the       land'';        (5) by striking ``lands held in trust for the Pueblo of       Santa Clara,''; and        (6) by striking ``lands held in trust for Ohkay Owingeh       Pueblo''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 included four Indian water rights  settlements. Title III of the act resolved the White Mountain Apache  Tribes' water-related claims against the United States, the State of  Arizona, and a number of other State and non-Federal parties.   In consideration for the Tribe's waiving its water-related claims  against the United States and other parties, the act authorized funding  for the construction of the White Mountain Apache rural water system to  bring safe and reliable drinking water to the Tribe and to its members.  Specifically, the rural water system will consist of a dam and  reservoir, a treatment plant, and 55 miles of pipeline to serve the  community.   The act also established the creation of the White Mountain Apache  Tribal settlement fund that can be used to cover any cost overruns for  the system and water-related economic development projects. The rural  water system will serve a number of water-related activities that fit  squarely with the settlement fund's authorized purposes.   To ensure the completion of the Tribe's rural water system, S. 2850  makes a technical amendment to the Claims Resolution Act to clarify  that the Tribe may utilize funding from the settlement fund for  planning, design, and conduction activities related to construction of  the rural water system.   The bill also clarifies the 99-year lease authority for the Pueblo of  Santa Clara and the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo in New Mexico. The Indian  Long-Term Leasing Act allows Indians to lease their lands subject to  the approval of the Secretary of the Interior for public, religious,  educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes of up to  25 years. Congress has amended the ILTLA more than 40 times to adjust  the terms and conditions of Indian land leases, including the  authorization of 99-year leases for lands held in trust for the Pueblo  Santa Clara and the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo of New  Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, this bill irons out a  lot of problems with the settlement and clears the way for hopefully a  very productive project.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5613) to designate the Quindaro Townsite in Kansas City,  Kansas, as a National Historic Landmark, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5613         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. QUINDARO TOWNSITE NATIONAL COMMEMORATIVE SITE ACT.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Quindaro       Townsite National Commemorative Site Act''.        (b) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means       the Secretary of the Interior.        (c) Designation.--The Quindaro Townsite in Kansas City,       Kansas, as listed on the National Register of Historic       Places, is hereby designated as the Quindaro Townsite       National Commemorative Site. The Site shall not be considered       a unit of the National Park System.        (d) Administration.--Nothing in this section shall affect       the administration of the Quindaro Townsite by Kansas City or       the State of Kansas.        (e) Cooperative Agreements.--The Secretary, in consultation       with the State of Kansas, Kansas City, Kansas, and affected       subdivisions, may enter into cooperative agreements with       appropriate public or private entities, for the purposes of       protecting historic resources at Quindaro Townsite and       providing educational and interpretive programs for the       public.        (f) Technical Assistance.--The Secretary may provide       technical assistance to any entity with which the Secretary       has entered into a cooperative agreement under subsection       (e).        (g) Effect on Private Property, Local Land Use, and Land       Acquisition Authority.--Nothing in this Act authorizes the       Secretary to--        (1) interfere with private property rights, or any local       zoning ordinance or land use plan of the State or any       political subdivision of the State; or        (2) acquire land or interests in land through condemnation       or otherwise.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Quindaro Townsite in Kansas City preserves an  important piece of our past whose history should be known by all. The  site preserves the ruins of a frontier town on the Missouri River,  founded in 1857 as a free-state port of entry during the Kansas  Territory's fight over the question of slavery. The town's diverse  inhabitants were antislavery and included Americans of European and  African American descent, as well as members of the Wyandot Tribe.   The Quindaro area was the location of an African American refugee  settlement that began during the Civil War and grew into a prominent  African American community. It was also the site of the Freedman's  University and its successor institution, Western University, the first  Black university in Kansas.   The Quindaro Townsite is on the National Register of Historic Places  and, importantly, has been designated as part of the National  Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. Quindaro's early residents  assisted fugitive slaves escaping across the Missouri River to freedom.   Supporters of Quindaro have long sought elevated status and  recognition for the site. H.R. 5613 designates Quindaro Townsite as a  national commemorative site. This establishes the townsite as an  affiliated area of the National Park System and authorizes the  Secretary of the Interior to offer technical assistance and support to  Quindaro.   I want to compliment my colleague, Mr. Yoder, for bringing this  matter to the attention of the Congress and for the work he has done to  ensure that this site receives national recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her kind  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I would again like to say what a great  pleasure it has been for me to work with Ms. Bordallo and the members  of the Natural Resources Committee. It truly does work in a bipartisan  manner, most of the time. And it is no coincidence that, most of the  time, it is productive work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
