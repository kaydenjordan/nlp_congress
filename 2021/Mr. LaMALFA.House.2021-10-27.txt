 Madam Speaker, it is an honor today to highlight the  work of Senator K. Maurice Johannessen in northern California who is  still working hard at helping our veterans.   He was born in Norway many years ago, emigrated to the United States,  and joined the Army in 1953 during the Korean war, serving our Nation  for over 12 years. In 1960 Senator Johannessen moved to Redding,  California, where he met his wife, Marianne, and raised a family.   After several years in local government, he was elected to the  California State Senate where he remained for 9 years. In the State  senate, he chaired the Senate Veterans Committee and authored over 47  veterans' bill and notably created the Northern California Veterans  Cemetery in Igo, California, and five new veterans homes around the  United States. Noticing his commitment to improving support for  veterans, in 2002 Governor Grey Davis appointed him Secretary of the  California Department of Veterans Affairs.   Upon retiring from the senate, Senator Johannessen didn't stop  serving our region. He is still using his own resources and community  support to get a veterans memorial chapel and a state-of-the-art  veterans medical clinic in Shasta County.   On behalf of northern California, I appreciate Senator Johannessen's  service, and I want to thank him for all his devotion to our region.                            ____________________
