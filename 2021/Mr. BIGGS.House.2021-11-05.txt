 Madam Speaker, while the border is porous and 200,000  people are being apprehended every month, another 100,000 are illegally  entering who we don't know where they are coming from. They are not  caught; they are gotaways this administration is going to offer  $450,000.   What is interesting about that is the President himself said he  didn't know about it. He has had to walk that back, hasn't he?   So there will be $450,000 offered to a certain segment of illegal  migrants. Not only that, we will continue to see opioids, fentanyl. We  will see additional drugs and human trafficking continue across our  border until we secure our border. I am hoping this administration will  make that a priority rather than ignoring it and encouraging people to  come across our border.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
