 Actually, Jake wanted to come, so did my husband, and he  wasn't able to make it.   I want to thank him; my sons, Anthony and Tim; and my grandchildren,  Caine and Autrey, for their constant, loving support. I hope to make  them all proud. As an aside, my grandson, Caine, tomorrow will be 16.   He told me: Nonnie, I can't go watch because I have had an  appointment at the DMV for 6 months. I am getting my license, and I am  not giving it up.   So all I have to say to that is: Watch out Tillamook, he is off the  tractor and onto the roads.   I stand before you today and vow to give everything I have to be the  capable and zealous Representative that my constituents deserve. I  often look to the words of Luke and paraphrase: To whom much is given,  much is expected. I take these words to heart in the role that has been  entrusted to me: to honestly, loyally, and passionately represent my  constituents in the United States House of Representatives.   I accept this charge with deep humility. My constituents, the great  people of California's 22nd District, are facing water shortages,  rising inflation, and many other trials not of their own making. Their  pain is my pain. Their concerns are my concerns. I stand shoulder to  shoulder with them.   As a daughter of the Central Valley and a lifelong fighter for our  values, it  [[Page H5533]]  is my duty to ensure that our voices are heard in Congress. As your  Representative, you have my commitment that my door will always be open  to those seeking to make the Central Valley a better place. I look  forward to serving with you.   Madam Speaker, I close my remarks with a local colloquial saying: Go  Dogs, Win the Mountain West.                            ____________________
