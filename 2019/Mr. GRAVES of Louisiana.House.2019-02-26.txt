 Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss concerns  with S. 47, legislation we will soon be voting on in the House of  Representatives.   Madam Speaker, S. 47 has some positive things in it. The legislation  provides for expanded recreational opportunities, expanded  opportunities to hunt and fish on our public lands, and a lot of things  that I very much support.   Madam Speaker, the bill has some pretty profound flaws, one of which  being process. This is a 700-page bill--a 700-page bill--that has been  held at the desk. It has not gone through the regular committee  process.   This isn't some small bill that folks have been exposed to. This is  700 pages of text, and it has not gone through the regular legislative  process and, in fact, is being put up under suspension of the rules,  where we are not even being provided the opportunity to offer  amendments or to represent our constituents, other than just voting  ``yes'' or ``no.''   Madam Speaker, I want to throw out some statistics on what this bill  does and the implications. It provides 1.3 million acres of land being  designated as wilderness areas--1.3 million acres; 694 acres of  recreation and conservation areas; 370,000 acres of mineral  withdrawals; national monument designations of 2,500 acres; 621 miles  of wild and scenic rivers; 2,600 miles added to the national trail  system; and 42,000 acres added to our national parks.   Now, Madam Speaker, I used to teach outdoor wilderness courses. I  have spent hundreds, maybe even thousands of nights of my life in the  outdoors, sleeping out in the wilderness areas, national parks, and  national forests and others. I love these areas. I enjoy them.   I am not saying that these things shouldn't happen. I am saying that  we need to have the ability to go through regular order, just like the  Senate did this week when they had the ability to offer amendments to  this bill. We are not being afforded that same opportunity.   Madam Speaker, my biggest problem or concern with this legislation is  this: The bill permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, which, I will say it again: I support the acquisition of lands,  the protection of lands, so we can enjoy the ecological productivity  and enjoy time in the great outdoors. However, the bill does not  address the fact that we have a $17 billion backlog in national park  maintenance--$17 billion. So we are acquiring more land without a plan  for addressing the existing backlog maintenance issues that actually  prohibit or prevent people from enjoying some of these same lands that  are being acquired.    We are talking about the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and $9  billion in funds over the next 10 years being deposited into a Treasury  receipt account to acquire more land. Guess where this money is coming  from, Madam Speaker. A hundred percent of these funds is coming from  the State that I represent and the other five States that produce  offshore energy. Every penny of it is coming from the State of  Louisiana, which produces perhaps over 80 percent of all the offshore  energy of this Nation in Federal waters. It is paying for this fund.   At the same time, we have lost 2,000 square miles--2,000 square  miles--of our coast. Guess how much of this bill addresses the problem  there? With 2,000 square miles of our coast disappearing, the  ecological productivity being lost, the increased vulnerability to the  people that I represent, zero, nothing. This bill diverts money for  conservation and for protection in other States in other areas and does  nothing for my home State of Louisiana, yet it is coming from our  revenues that we are producing in our offshore.   This is a flawed process. This is a flawed bill. We need to go  through regular order.   I really can't even believe that this is happening. Here we have  dozens of hearings on climate change and other things, and the very  State that is the canary in the coal mine, the State that is  experiencing the worst ecological challenges or losses as a result of  sea rise and other challenges, is being completely ignored.   Where are the climate change advocates right now? Where are you?   I strongly urge opposition to this bill. We need to go back through  regular order, consider the largest conservation and the largest  natural resources bill that we have had since I have been in the  Congress, and send it through regular order again.   I urge opposition to this bill.                            ____________________
