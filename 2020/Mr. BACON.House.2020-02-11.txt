 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I rise to  recognize Littleton Alston for his lifetime contributions in the fine  art of sculpting, both as a renowned artist and as a professor.   Littleton was born in Petersburg, Virginia, and grew up in northeast  Washington, D.C., where he had his first encounter with great art and  public sculpture. He still vividly remembers looking from his home down  East Capitol Street and seeing the Capitol dome.   His mother, who was divorced and raising five children on her own,  acknowledged and recognized a unique gift that Littleton seemed to  possess: drawing. Her devotion and his talent helped him land an  opportunity to attend the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in  Washington, D.C., where he graduated from high school.  [[Page H1022]]    Awarded a scholarship to Virginia Commonwealth University in  Richmond, he received his bachelor of fine arts degree in sculpture and  went on to earn his master of fine arts from the Maryland Institute  College of Art's Rinehart Graduate School of Sculpture in Baltimore.   There, he was the recipient of the school's top honor, the Rinehart  Award. In 1989, he was accepted to the artist residency program at the  Bemis Center of Contemporary Arts in Omaha. A year later, he joined the  faculty of Omaha's Creighton University, where he has attained the rank  of full professor of sculpture.   For the past 30 years, he has consistently given back to the  community. Littleton served on the Omaha Public Art Commission for 9  years, and he has volunteered often for local charities and community  service groups. He is especially proud of his educational outreach,  having often led classes and workshops at schools in low-income  neighborhoods.   In 2013, he was recognized by the city of Omaha for his artistic and  civic contributions with a Community Excellence Award and by Governor  Dave Heineman with the Community Development Excellence Award.   Littleton says he chose the art of sculpting because he believes  sculpture is the best vehicle through which he can best express the  joys and sorrows of the human condition. He says that he has explored  many mediums and conceptual approaches. As an artist, he tries to  convey the beauty and power of the sculpted form.   Littleton Alston has been commissioned to create a variety of  sculptural projects, including monumental bronze figures such as: The  Archangel Michael, Christ Among Children, Dr. Martin Luther King,  Baseball Legend Bob Gibson, St. Ignatius of Loyola, and many others.   His work has included international artist residencies. In 2019,  Littleton was selected from applicants from across the country to  create a larger-than-life-size bronze statue portraying Willa Cather, a  sculpture that will be one of the two statues representing the great  State of Nebraska in the U.S. Capitol.   This achievement is a hallmark for our country and a homecoming for  Littleton, who will become the first African American artist to create  a work to be displayed in the Statuary Hall collection, a compelling  achievement, 50 years in the making, for a young man who grew up in  eyeshot of the Statue of Freedom.   This wonderful addition to these hallowed Halls will be dedicated to  his late mother, Gilbertha Otelia Alston, a fitting tribute to the  person who helped cultivate his great talent at an early age.   We are proud that Littleton; his wife, Anne; and his children, Sarah,  Taylor, and Daniel, call Omaha, Nebraska, home.   I salute and thank Littleton for his impression upon the community,  which will be felt for years to come.                            ____________________
