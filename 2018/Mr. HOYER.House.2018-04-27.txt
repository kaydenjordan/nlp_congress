 Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, does, in fact, the Speaker of the House have  the right to remove the Chaplain?    Mr. Speaker, is it correct that the Chaplain is elected by  the whole House to be the Chaplain of the House of Representatives?    Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.   Are we in the position where the House will be unable to speak to the  issue of removing the official, i.e. the Chaplain, elected by the whole  House?
