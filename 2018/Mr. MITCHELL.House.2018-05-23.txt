 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am pleased to have the opportunity to join the House Armed Services  Committee in time to participate in the review and markup of the fiscal  year 2019 national defense authorization bill. I am pleased to  participate in the investments this bill makes in our national defense.   I would agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: They  are not a cheap date. In fact, some of the amendments that my colleague  mentioned were debated in committee and were defeated in committee.  Apparently, we want to go through them multiple times; and unless they  get everything they want, somehow they are going to protest. At some  point in time, the process is what it is. The amendment is lost.   I am pleased to participate in investments in defense, and in  particular, the Stryker combat vehicle, a program that has a tremendous  impact on combat readiness and capability of our Army.   The Stryker brigade combat teams are some of the most frequently  deployed units in the Army, and it exponentially increases the  protection and lethality of our Nation's soldiers.   The most modern version of the vehicle, the Stryker A1, includes a  double-v hull that has already proven to protect soldiers from the most  violent IED and mine blasts, as well as other upgrades to improve their  mobility and communication capabilities.   I am pleased with the House Armed Services Committee for seeing the  wisdom of authorizing a total $360 million for the Stryker upgrades  this fiscal year. That effort supports Army Chief of Staff General  Milley's plan to provide Stryker A1s to all brigade combat teams by  2025.   I look forward to working with the chairman and over 250 Members of  my House colleagues--across the aisle, by the way--who join me in a  letter supporting the Stryker program and its continued efforts of  development.   Our soldiers who so often are deployed in harm's way deserve every  protection they can get, and we should provide that for them.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the Secretary of the  Army, Mark Esper.                                  Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, April 12, 2018.        Dear Secretary Esper: Thank you for your service to our       nation and your robust efforts to increase the readiness and       modernization budget of the U.S. Army. While you may have       just begun, you are making remarkable progress on behalf of       the American soldier and our national security.        However, we would like to bring to your attention the       continued budgetary challenges of the Stryker combat vehicle       program. The Stryker vehicle is the Army's most deployed and       versatile combat vehicle and represents what may be the most       successful Army acquisition program in recent memory from       initial acquisition to the most recent upgrades. Yet there       appears to be a disconnect between these facts and the Army's       FY19 budget request which once again neglects much needed       Stryker procurement and modernization.        In recent years, Congress has stepped in and ensured that       the Army's lack of budgetary commitment to Stryker did not       prevent our soldiers in the field from receiving the safety       and lethality upgrades necessary against the threats of       today's global environment. Congress has strongly supported       both the conversion of flat bottomed Strykers to the more       survivable Double-V Hull (DVH) Stryker A1 version and the       Stryker lethality (ICV) upgrade which adds a powerful 30mm       cannon to the Stryker infantry variant.        While we are pleased that the Army's FY 19 modernization       budget was increased by more than 14% from FY 18, we are       perplexed why the Stryker program did not seem to benefit       from this growth in investment funding, especially since it       is our understanding that the Army has an operational       requirement for additional brigades of improved Stryker (DVH)       A1s. How can the Stryker fleet represent 30% of Army combat       vehicles yet receive just 6% of the Army's combat vehicle       budget in FY 19?        Congress has continually demonstrated our long-standing       support for Stryker production and we request that you do the       same by working with us in the FY19 defense budget process to       develop a plan to sustain the Stryker program.
