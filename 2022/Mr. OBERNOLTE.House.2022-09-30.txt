 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 75th  anniversary of the city of Barstow, California.   Barstow got its genesis in 1947 as a key stop on Route 66 and has  since grown to form an iconic part of California's diverse landscape.  It is the home of the BNSF rail yard, one of the most important  logistics hubs in our rail system.   It is also the home of the Marine Corps Logistics Base at Barstow, as  well as the transit point for every piece of equipment and soldier who  trains at the Army's National Training Center in Fort Irwin, where  almost all of our soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan have gotten  their training.   As Route 66 approaches its 100th birthday, I have no doubt that  Barstow will continue to be a key component of the Mojave Desert's  diverse infrastructure and economy.   I join Barstow Mayor Paul Courtney in wishing the city a very happy  birthday and many years of prosperity in the future.                            ____________________
