 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Tuesday, President Biden delivered his  State of the Union Address to Congress, and in this time of divided  government, I was glad to see the President making more than one nod to  bipartisanship. I do think this moment, with power split between  Democrats and Republicans, provides a real opportunity to work  together, to move away from the extreme partisanship of the past couple  of years and make some real progress on some of the issues facing us.   But the President's speech also left me concerned because the  President demonstrated almost no awareness of what actually happened as  a result of his policies. Indeed, at times, it seemed as if the  President had lived through a different reality from the one most  Americans have been experiencing over the past 2 years.   The President rattled off a list of his supposed economic  achievements, and I say ``supposed'' because he left out some vitally  important context. He claimed credit for the historic job creation  while leaving out the essential detail that a lot of that job creation  was simply a result of the economy naturally adding back jobs  temporarily lost during the pandemic. He talked about wage growth while  leaving out the fact that real wages have declined--have declined-- because of inflation over his Presidency. And he appeared to take  credit for the fact that inflation has declined somewhat in recent  months while neglecting to mention that it was his administration and  congressional Democrats who helped create our inflation crisis with  their American Rescue Plan spending spree.   Nor did the President spend any time discussing just how bad  inflation still is and how much Americans are still suffering.  Inflation in December was 6.5 percent. The last time inflation was that  bad was in 1982--1982--40 years ago. I am glad inflation has declined  somewhat, but I don't think the President has a lot to be  congratulating himself about. Even if prices stopped increasing  tomorrow, Americans would still be paying thousands of dollars more  over the next year to achieve the same standard of living that they had  when the President took office.    Again, the President and congressional Democrats and their American  Rescue Plan spending spree bear a huge part of the responsibility for  this situation. Or to quote former Obama economic adviser, Jason  Furman:         The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan.    Another of the supposed economic achievements the President talked  about Tuesday night was cutting the deficit. Yes, cutting the deficit.  Well, let me just quote CNN on that claim. This is a quote:         Independent analysts say Biden's own actions, including his       laws and executive orders, have had the overall effect of       adding to current and projected future deficits, not reducing       those deficits.    Let me just repeat that:         Independent analysts say Biden's own actions, including his       laws and executive orders, have had the overall effect of       adding to current and projected future deficits, not reducing       those deficits.    The President failed to meaningfully address the economic crisis that  his policies have helped to create. Instead,  [[Page S275]]  he spent considerable time calling for spending proposals that would  cost taxpayers trillions of more dollars.   He also failed to meaningfully address another crisis that has been  raging over the past 2 years, and that is the security and humanitarian  crisis at our southern border. It is a crisis that the President has  spent 2 years ignoring. On Tuesday night, he essentially ignored it  again. In a speech that was notable for being the most wordy State of  the Union speech in the past 6 decades--clocking in at 9,191 words--the  President devoted just 120 words, approximately 1 minute, to  immigration. He spent a good chunk of that minute attempting to suggest  that it is Congress and not he himself that needs to act. In fact, the  President's brief 120 words on immigration managed to convey the  impression the President had been trying to secure the border all  along, instead of reflecting the reality that the President ignored  this crisis--a crisis, I might add, that he, himself, triggered--for 2  years and only began to somewhat acknowledge it a mere month ago.   The President's speech was also strikingly light on a vision for our  national security in spite of a war of aggression from Russia, which  has made its imperial ambitions very clear, and continued troubling  activity from China. There wasn't even a mention of Iran, which  continues to be the leading state sponsor of terrorism, or North Korea,  which just unveiled an alarming quantity of ICBMs.   The President devoted just nine words to the importance of  modernizing our military, even though the past year and, indeed, the  past week, has underscored the necessity of making sure our military is  the top fighting force in the world so that we can deter and, if  necessary, confront any threat.   While the President's speech was light on immigration and national  security solutions and on any recognition of the economic crisis the  President's policies helped create, the one thing his speech was not  light on was the Democratic playbook on taxes and spending. The  President kept bringing up and encouraging Congress to ``finish the  job.'' It quickly became clear that was code for ``spend more taxpayer  dollars'' or maybe ``expand government,'' even though it was excessive  government spending that helped get us into this inflation crisis in  the first place.   But if there was one thing that became clear Tuesday night, it was  that the President wants to have it both ways. He wants to cut the  deficit but simultaneously expand and grow government. He celebrates  ``Made in America,'' but in nearly the same breath, demonizes  businesses. He wants to boost American innovation, but he also wants to  raise taxes and impose price controls.   Perhaps no example of this wanting to have it both ways was more  telling than the President's clear belief that oil companies should  increase domestic oil production, despite the fact that the President  campaigned on eliminating fossil fuels. The President recounted an  exchange with oil industry representatives who told him that they were  reluctant to invest because they were concerned the President would  shut down oil wells and refineries. The President clearly intended the  anecdote to illustrate the selfishness of Big Oil or Big Business, but  the anecdote did a much better job of illustrating just how outrageous  it is that the President assumes he should be able to get as much oil  production as he wants while simultaneously working to sunset--to get  rid of--oil companies.   The President might like to have it both ways, but he can't because  policies have consequences; spending has consequences; taxation has  consequences.   And the result of the Big Government tax-and-spend policies the  President laid out Tuesday night would not be the prosperous future he  imagines, but more economic pain for American families and businesses.  And any bipartisan work that we do over the next 2 years needs to move  away from the failed policies of the past 2 years and toward a more  fiscally responsible future.   The upcoming debt limit debate represents an outstanding opportunity  to take a good, hard look at government spending and see how we can  handle taxpayer dollars more responsibly.   I was disappointed that despite his calls for bipartisanship, the  President decided to call for a ``clean'' debt limit increase Tuesday  night. In other words, an increase in the Nation's credit card limit  unaccompanied by any effort to stop adding to our bill. The President's  attitude was all too reminiscent of Democrats' partisan ``my way or the  highway'' approach over the past 2 years. I sincerely hope he will  rethink that position.   I was also disturbed by the President's attempt to suggest falsely  that Republicans are interested in paying for the debt limit increase  by cutting Medicare and Social Security. I suspect the President is  well aware that is not the position of the Republican Party. And his  scaremongering was not reflective of the kind of bipartisanship I hope  we can achieve over the next 2 years.   What Democrats and Republicans should be doing is working together to  put Medicare and Social Security on a more secure financial footing  going forward, and that would be greatly helped by addressing excessive  government spending and working to rein in our national debt.   I appreciated, as I said earlier, the fact that despite trotting out  far too many of the tax-and-spend policies Tuesday night, the President  did make a real nod toward bipartisanship. I truly believe that we can  do a lot together over the next 2 years from passing a farm bill to  reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and improving our  Nation's air traffic control system to creating new market access for  American producers and securing more transparency and accountability  from Big Tech. I hope that the President's words in support of  bipartisanship will be borne out by his actions in the coming months  and that working together, we can build a record of achievement that  will help make life better for the American people.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 389         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of       Illicit Fentanyl Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) International drug trafficking is a serious and deadly       problem that threatens the vital interests of the United       States and the safety and health of every community in the       United States.        (2) Transnational criminal organizations, cartels, and       violent gangs are leading perpetrators of drug trafficking,       often combining the manufacture and distribution of synthetic       opioids with violence, human smuggling and trafficking,       firearms trafficking, and public corruption, and pose a       sustained threat to the homeland security of the United       States.        (3) Illicit fentanyl is primarily produced in clandestine       laboratories and trafficked into the United States in powder       and pill form, including fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills.        (4) The People's Republic of China (hereinafter in this       section referred to as ``China'') is the primary source       country of fentanyl precursor chemicals used to manufacture       the illicit fentanyl that is trafficked into the United       States.        (5) The Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid       Trafficking, established under section 7221 of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law       116-92), reported in 2022 that China, which supplied 70 to 80       percent of fentanyl seized by Federal authorities between       2014 and 2019, has been surpassed by Mexico as the ``dominant       source'' of illicit fentanyl in the United States.        (6) Illicit fentanyl is primarily trafficked by land into       the United States through legal ports of entry, as well as       between such ports of entry, with some trafficking       facilitated by domestic and foreign-based social media and       encrypted communication applications.        (7) In fiscal years 2021 and 2022, U.S. Customs and Border       Protection seized over 24,000 pounds of fentanyl at ports of       entry, a 200 percent increase from the amounts seized in       fiscal years 2019 and 2020.        (8) Deaths caused by the trafficking of illicit fentanyl       have reached epidemic proportions, as--        (A) fentanyl was involved in nearly 200,000 deaths in the       United States during the period between 2014 and 2020;        (B) the number of drug overdose deaths in the United States       surpassed 100,000 during the period between May 2020 and       April 2021, of which over 64,000 deaths were related to       fentanyl; and        (C) fentanyl and other synthetic opioids caused       approximately \2/3\ of more than 107,000 fatal overdoses in       the United States during 2021.        (9) Overdose deaths remain a leading cause of injury-      related death in the United States, and fentanyl-related       deaths are the leading cause of deaths among adults aged 18       to 45.        (10) Failure to meaningfully combat illicit fentanyl       trafficking will continue to stress the health care and law       enforcement resources of the United States.        (11) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of       action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under       the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).        (12) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for       the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472       (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the       leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and       conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the       United States, provides the proper legal framework for how       such liability should function in the context of the       Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).        (13) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or       recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly       or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a       significant risk of committing acts of trafficking of illicit       fentanyl that threaten the safety and health of nationals of       the United States or the national security, foreign policy,       or economy of the United States, necessarily direct such       conduct at the United States, and should reasonably       anticipate being brought to court in the United States to       answer for that conduct.        (14) The United States has a compelling interest in       providing persons and entities injured as a result of the       trafficking of illicit fentanyl into the United States with       full access to the court system in order to pursue civil       claims against persons, entities, or countries that have       knowingly or recklessly provided material support or       resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons or       organizations responsible for their injuries.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil       litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with       the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against       persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and       wherever they may be found, that have provided material       support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or       persons that engage in the trafficking of illicit fentanyl       into the United States.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 389         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of       Illicit Fentanyl Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) International drug trafficking is a serious and deadly       problem that threatens the vital interests of the United       States and the safety and health of every community in the       United States.        (2) Transnational criminal organizations, cartels, and       violent gangs are leading perpetrators of drug trafficking,       often combining the manufacture and distribution of synthetic       opioids with violence, human smuggling and trafficking,       firearms trafficking, and public corruption, and pose a       sustained threat to the homeland security of the United       States.        (3) Illicit fentanyl is primarily produced in clandestine       laboratories and trafficked into the United States in powder       and pill form, including fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills.        (4) The People's Republic of China (hereinafter in this       section referred to as ``China'') is the primary source       country of fentanyl precursor chemicals used to manufacture       the illicit fentanyl that is trafficked into the United       States.        (5) The Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid       Trafficking, established under section 7221 of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law       116-92), reported in 2022 that China, which supplied 70 to 80       percent of fentanyl seized by Federal authorities between       2014 and 2019, has been surpassed by Mexico as the ``dominant       source'' of illicit fentanyl in the United States.        (6) Illicit fentanyl is primarily trafficked by land into       the United States through legal ports of entry, as well as       between such ports of entry, with some trafficking       facilitated by domestic and foreign-based social media and       encrypted communication applications.        (7) In fiscal years 2021 and 2022, U.S. Customs and Border       Protection seized over 24,000 pounds of fentanyl at ports of       entry, a 200 percent increase from the amounts seized in       fiscal years 2019 and 2020.        (8) Deaths caused by the trafficking of illicit fentanyl       have reached epidemic proportions, as--        (A) fentanyl was involved in nearly 200,000 deaths in the       United States during the period between 2014 and 2020;        (B) the number of drug overdose deaths in the United States       surpassed 100,000 during the period between May 2020 and       April 2021, of which over 64,000 deaths were related to       fentanyl; and        (C) fentanyl and other synthetic opioids caused       approximately \2/3\ of more than 107,000 fatal overdoses in       the United States during 2021.        (9) Overdose deaths remain a leading cause of injury-      related death in the United States, and fentanyl-related       deaths are the leading cause of deaths among adults aged 18       to 45.        (10) Failure to meaningfully combat illicit fentanyl       trafficking will continue to stress the health care and law       enforcement resources of the United States.        (11) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of       action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under       the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).        (12) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for       the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472       (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the       leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and       conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the       United States, provides the proper legal framework for how       such liability should function in the context of the       Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).        (13) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or       recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly       or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a       significant risk of committing acts of trafficking of illicit       fentanyl that threaten the safety and health of nationals of       the United States or the national security, foreign policy,       or economy of the United States, necessarily direct such       conduct at the United States, and should reasonably       anticipate being brought to court in the United States to       answer for that conduct.        (14) The United States has a compelling interest in       providing persons and entities injured as a result of the       trafficking of illicit fentanyl into the United States with       full access to the court system in order to pursue civil       claims against persons, entities, or countries that have       knowingly or recklessly provided material support or       resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons or       organizations responsible for their injuries.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil       litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with       the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against       persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and       wherever they may be found, that have provided material       support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or       persons that engage in the trafficking of illicit fentanyl       into the United States.
