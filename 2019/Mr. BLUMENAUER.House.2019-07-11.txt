 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   I would first begin by extending my congratulations to the chair and  the committee for taking a hard look at this legislation to better meet  the needs of the military and the taxpayer in long-term, stable,  careful military policy. I think they have made tremendous strides. I  would like to try to make it just a tiny bit better.   Mr. Chair, we are looking at a Minuteman III extension on a land- based intercontinental ballistic missile system, and I am proposing  that we have a study as to whether or not we could be better served by  simply extending the life of the existing system as opposed to new  development.   Frankly, there needs to be more attention by this Congress, and I  appreciate the attention that the committee has given.   The ICBM is the leg of the triad that raises the most questions.  There has been a RAND study on the future of the ICBM force that found  that a new alternative is very likely to cost two or three times more  than incremental modernization.   We are careening toward a $1.3 trillion or more investment in nuclear  weapons that, frankly, do not help us for most of our national security  challenges that we face now, weapons that we simply can't afford and  can't afford to use.   I think by trying to right-size the work that we are doing and by  taking a hard look at this element with a study on extending the life,  it is a reasonable, responsible, cost-effective effort. I strongly urge  my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chair of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the amount of time  remaining.    Mr. Chair, my colleague has the right to close?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 15 seconds to reassure my  good friend from Utah that the Minuteman missile doesn't have to  remember what it was doing in the past. It simply has to launch.   To the notion that it is a Nixon-era weapon, we are flying B-52s,  which are not just Lyndon Johnson but those are of the Kennedy era.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, did my friend from California not  completely exhaust the time allotted?    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment here that would deal  with a study on the cost-effectiveness of the W80-4 Life Extension  Program.   We have been having these debates over the years before the committee  on this issue of nuclear weapons. I am deeply troubled that we really  haven't done a deep dive on the floor of the House in terms of the path  we have been on.                                time  1530    I have settled, in the past, for trying to have some studies to  determine whether or not what we are doing going forward is actually  cost-effective.   In this case, the father of this device, former Secretary of Defense  Bill Perry, has argued that there is scant justification for spending  tens of billions of dollars on new weapons. General Mattis has stated  numerous times that he is not sold on the LRSO.   I simply want to make sure that we know what we are getting into,  what the costs are, in terms of some of the increases that are going  forward.   We need to do a better job of our oversight, our debate. These  weapons have not been used, as the gentleman said, since the end of  World War II. It is not at all clear that we needed to have the volume  of weapons we had, the number of delivery systems. In fact, there is  strong argument that we could have done a better job, or just as good a  job, of deterrence with less. And there have been a whole host of  problems in the past in terms of mismanagement, accident that we have  narrowly avoided disaster.   I think this is a small step forward, and I would respectfully  request that the study be approved.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chairman of the  committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, let me just make three points.   First and foremost, anybody who thinks that we are standing still and  defenseless is not in the real world. We are spending billions of  dollars on nuclear weapons and delivery systems. And, in fact, we are  relying on a delivery system from the Kennedy-era with the B-52. So I  say to the gentleman, don't tell me that we cannot move these items  forward.   Second, the gentleman does not have a good fix in terms of what is  happening with the cost increases. This study is required to be able to  have the additional money. If we can do the appropriate study and it  makes sense, the money is there. But this is a step towards  accountability and it is long, long overdue, and I hope we can start  now approving this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
