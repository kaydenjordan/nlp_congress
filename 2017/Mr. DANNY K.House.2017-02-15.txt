 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Workers collecting unemployment benefits earned their benefits by  working hard. Workers only receive benefits if they are out of work  through no fault of their own and are actively searching for new jobs.   There are considerable challenges facing our unemployment system.  More than half of the State trust funds, including that in my home  State, are insolvent and could only pay earned benefits for a short  period of time if a recession hits. Only about one in four unemployed  workers currently receives unemployment insurance benefits. Some States  have cut benefits, increasing the chance that workers will exhaust  benefits before finding jobs. H.J. Res. 42 does not address these  challenges.   There are also real problems with drug use in this country and a  severe shortage of treatment options for those who need them. H.J. Res.  42 does not address these problems either.   Instead, we are considering a policy that slanders unemployed workers  by assuming that they are drug users; that ignores all research showing  that drug use is not higher among unemployed workers than in the  general population; and that violates the constitutional protection  against illegal search and seizure, a protection that courts have  clearly said exists regardless of whether one receives public benefits.   The statutory provision that has required this regulation was  appropriately limited to a very narrow group of workers, those for whom  finding suitable work required a drug test.   Counter to some GOP arguments, this resolution is not about helping  those with drug problems get treatment. It is about cutting benefits.  States with drug-testing provisions do not pay for expensive treatment  services for those who test positive. Moreover, workers cannot receive  benefits while in treatment because they are not actively seeking work.  Thus, they lose their earned unemployment benefits.   Congress should be helping communities suffering from high  unemployment, addressing persistent long-term unemployment, aiding  workers in upgrading their skills to get good jobs. Congress should be  strengthening our unemployment insurance system to make sure it is  ready to respond in the next recession.                                time  1345    We should not encourage States to waste resources on an  unconstitutionally-based drug testing requirements for struggling  unemployed workers who claim benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), former chairman of this committee  and, certainly, a former ranking member on this side.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a tireless protector of the  rights of individuals.    DAVIS of Illinois. I yield the gentleman an additional 2  minutes.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) who had an office next to mine  for many years. I know she has tremendous commitment, energy, and  fortitude.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  an additional 30 seconds.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to close,  let me just, first of all, thank the more than 40 organizations who  have sent letters in opposition to this legislation, especially the  African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African American Ministers in  Action, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and  many others. They have sent letters because they have a will to help,  not a will to hurt. They have a will to assist. They know that the  individuals we are talking about have lost their jobs, their  opportunity to work, and their connection, in many instances, with  humanity.   I would urge that we do everything in our power to help them find  their way back and not hurt them. Therefore, I would urge all of my  colleagues to oppose this legislation and vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
