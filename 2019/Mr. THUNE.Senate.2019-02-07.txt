 Madam President, I want to congratulate the Senator from  Alaska on doing a wonderful job pulling together pieces of legislation  that have been lingering around here for a long time. They have gone  through the committee process and have been vetted--sometimes multiple  times--but have never ultimately made it across the finish line. We  have an opportunity here, when we get a chance to vote, to complete  that work and to do something that will be very meaningful for Senators  on both sides of the aisle who represent a wide swath of our country.   As the Senator from Alaska pointed out, she and her staff were very  helpful to us. We have a little issue in Custer, SD. The city of Custer  wants to have an airport--to expand their airport operations, and the  Forest Service wants to transfer some of the land in order for them to  do that, and it takes action by Congress to make that happen. So we are  grateful to Senator Murkowski and her team for all they have done to  advance this legislation and to give us an opportunity, once and for  all, to get a number of things across the finish line that have been  waiting for a long time.                                 The Economy    Madam President, Democrats like to present themselves as the party of  working Americans, but if that were ever true, it is certainly not true  anymore. You don't have to look any further than recent Democratic  policy to see how disconnected the Democratic Party is and has become  from ordinary Americans.   Let's take the so-called Green New Deal. This proposal, which would  require that all U.S. energy production be renewable, could raise  electricity bills for families by more than $3,000 per year--$3,000 per  year.   It is difficult to see how anyone who understands the challenges  faced by working families would propose adding $3,000 per year to their  electricity bills. When I am home in South Dakota, I regularly hear  from South Dakotan families who are working hard to make ends meet. I  can think of few families in my State--or anywhere else, for that  matter--who could easily absorb an additional $3,000 a year in energy  costs. With last week's polar vortex or even the average cold winters  we get on the Great Plains, it is frightening to think about how many  people would be at risk if it weren't for reliable and affordable  energy.   Then, of course, there is the Democrats' Medicare for All proposal.  This sounds like a simple solution--who doesn't want to increase access  to healthcare?--until you hear the price tag. The so-called Medicare  for All would cost an estimated $32 trillion over 10 years. That is  equivalent to the entire Federal discretionary budget more than two  times over.   Democrats like to present the fiction of free healthcare. Well, that  is precisely what it is--fiction. There is just no such thing as a free  lunch, and there is certainly no such thing as free healthcare. Nurses  have to be paid. Lab technicians have to be paid. MRI and x ray  technicians have to be paid. The people who cook for patients and keep  our hospitals clean have to be paid. Pharmacists have to be paid.  Medical supplies have to be purchased. Someone has to pay all those  costs.   Under the government-run healthcare plan of the Senator from Vermont,  the government would be paying all the healthcare bills. So the  government would pay all those costs, but the government is going to  have to get all that money from somewhere. Where is that money going to  come from? Well, it is going to come from the American people, and the  government would need a lot more money from ordinary Americans to cover  the cost of Medicare for All. Doubling the amount of individual and  corporate income tax collected would still not be enough to pay for the  mammoth costs of this plan.   Make no mistake--this is not a plan that would be paid for solely  from the coffers of the rich; the so-called Medicare for All would be  paid for on the backs of middle-class Americans.  [[Page S1104]]  Americans would see stratospheric tax hikes, to say nothing of the loss  of their employer-sponsored health insurance. Under Medicare for All,  if you like your health insurance, you will not be able to keep it  because Medicare for All would do away with all employer-sponsored  insurance. One hundred and seventy-five million Americans would lose  their healthcare coverage and be forced into a government-run  replacement--a replacement where the government sets the prices and  makes the decisions about what gets covered. So you will still be  paying for your healthcare via new and higher taxes, but the government  will have the final say.   I could go on. I could talk about other Democratic proposals, such as  the proposal to raise the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent--a rate  we haven't seen since 1965--which would be a tax hike not only on  individuals but on small and medium-sized businesses as well. Then  there is the House Democrats' proposal to substantially increase the  corporate tax rate even though lowering it to make American businesses  more competitive globally has helped grow our economy. It has helped  keep businesses and jobs in the United States, and it has produced new  benefits and opportunities for American workers.   Suffice it to say that the Democratic agenda is not an agenda for the  middle class. It is an agenda crafted by and for elites and far-left  special interest groups. It is an agenda for people who don't have to  worry about the size of their energy bill or a hike in their taxes. It  is not an agenda for working families.   Republicans know that working families had a tough time in recent  years. Years of economic stagnation during the Obama administration  left wages essentially flat, and jobs and opportunities were few and  far between. For too many families, getting ahead has been replaced  with getting by.   Since Republicans took office 2 years ago, we have made huge progress  at turning the economy around. Tax reform has made life better for  ordinary Americans. It has put more money in their pockets and in their  paychecks. It has reduced utility bills. It has expanded the jobs and  opportunities available to workers.   Today, the economy is growing, unemployment is low, and wages are  rising at the best pace in a decade. But there is still more work to be  done, and Republicans are committed to accomplishing that work. We want  to expand the benefits of tax reform even further. We want to lower the  cost of living. We want to make healthcare more affordable. We want to  help Americans save for their children's education and for their  retirement. We intend to do it all while leaving Americans in charge of  their own decisions. We know that Americans are the best judge of what  they and their families need and where their money should go, and  Republicans are committed to keeping Americans in charge of their own  destinies.   We have made a lot of progress so far for American families, and we  are committed to making a lot more. We will oppose every attempt by  Democrats to advance an agenda that will result in fewer jobs, lower  paychecks, and increased burdens for American families.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy).
