 Mr. Speaker, throughout the debate yesterday on the  so-called War Powers Resolution, fundamental misunderstandings surfaced  that I think need to be addressed.   The first misunderstanding is that the justification for the attack  that killed Soleimani was that he was an evil terrorist responsible for  the deaths of hundreds of Americans. Well, there are a lot of evil  terrorists out there, and that does not give the President authority to  launch attacks on foreign countries to kill them.   But what did give the President authority in this case, was the fact  that Soleimani was acting as an armed combatant against U.S. forces in  a war zone in which the Congress had authorized the President to take  military action through the Authorization for the Use of Military Force  in Iraq in 2002.   Now, I hate to shock my woke colleagues, but killing active enemy  combatants is what war is all about, and it is a war that Congress  started with that act.   That act of Congress provides: ``The President is authorized to use  the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary  and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United  States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.''   The very nature of this authority includes combating hostile militia  and armed proxies acting within Iraq against American forces. That is  exactly what the President did.   The authorization to use military force did not end with the defeat  of Saddam Hussein any more than the President's military authority in  Japan and Germany ended with the defeat of Hirohito and Hitler.   In those cases, the President's authority didn't terminate until 1952  and 1955, respectively, and the President's military authority in Iraq  remains in effect until the President and Congress terminate it.   Now, the second misunderstanding is that the President's action was  an attack on Iran. It most certainly was not. It was carried out in the  theater of war defined by Congress against a combatant who was  commanding hostile forces against American troops.   Not only did the President act entirely within his legal authority as  Commander in Chief, but within his moral responsibility to protect  American military and diplomatic personnel and American citizens in  Iraq.   The third misunderstanding is that the War Powers Act is applicable  in this circumstance. The War Powers Act governs only those  circumstances when the President responds without congressional  authority to an attack upon the United States, its territory or  possessions, or its Armed Forces. In this case, the President already  had congressional authority.   The fourth misunderstanding is that the attack on Soleimani was  equivalent to President Obama's attack on Libya. The two are entirely  different matters. The attack on Libya had no congressional  authorization and the War Powers Act did not apply because Mr. Obama's  military attack was not in response to an attack on the United States,  its territory or possessions, or its Armed Forces.   It was an entirely unprovoked attack, entirely unauthorized and,  accordingly, it was entirely illegal.   I think as we go forward, we need to get back to some basic,  fundamental understandings about the constitutional parameters of war  powers.   The American Founders made a sharp distinction between starting a war  and waging a war for some very good reasons. They understood that this  most solemn and lethal decision should not be entrusted to one  individual whose authority would be greatly augmented by it.    The decision to start a war was given exclusively to Congress to  assure that every voice in the country was heard, and that Congress,  once having taken that stand, would be obligated to put the resources  of the country behind that war and those fighting it.   But once the war has begun, the Founders wanted a single Commander in  Chief directing it with clear and unambiguous authority. There is no  surer path to military disaster than having 535 squabbling prima donnas  second-guessing every decision being made.   Thus, the President can wage war but cannot declare it, and the  Congress can declare war but cannot wage it.   The Founders debated these principles thoroughly during the  Constitutional Convention. They recognized that the President did need  certain residual military power to repel an attack when Congress  couldn't act. And I believe the War Powers Act faithfully defines these  circumstances and establishes a framework to contain them.   But the War Powers Act does not give the President the authority to  [[Page H174]]  launch military attacks except in response to a direct attack on our  country, nor can it limit the President's authority as Commander in  Chief once Congress does authorize war.   I believe the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force in  Iraq was a colossal mistake. It created a dangerous power vacuum. It  was never supported with the full resources of the United States, and  it was without provocation.   But there should be no rewriting of history here. It might have been  George W. Bush who advocated for the war and Bush, Obama, and now  President Trump who have waged it, but it was Congress' adoption of the  AUMF that formally started it.   And once started, only the President can wage it. President Trump  inherited this mess and history will judge how well he handles it.  Certainly, in this instance, the President not only had clear and  unambiguous authority to order the attack, he had a moral imperative to  do so.   What is crystal clear from the debate yesterday is that if the  Democrats had had their way, Soleimani would be alive today, and the  attack on American troops that he was in the final stages of planning  would have unfolded. We would likely, today, be mourning very many  American casualties.   If the President, knowing that this attack was coming and in full  possession of the opportunity and the authority to stop it, had taken  the Democrats' advice and done nothing, he would have been deeply  culpable for the loss of these Americans. It is shocking to me, and  perhaps to the country as well, that even in hindsight this is the  course the Democrats have made clear that they prefer.   That brings me to the nature of the resolution that the House passed  yesterday. The separation of war powers between the legislative and  executive branches has been badly blurred in recent decades, and I do  believe that we need to reestablish not only the constitutional  principles that separate the declaring of war from the waging of war,  but also the American tradition that we only go to war when we have  been attacked.   When we must go to war, we have the utmost obligation to put the  entire might and resources and attention of the Nation behind it, and  to get it over with just as quickly as possible.   Now, that is a legitimate debate to have, but that is not what the  House did yesterday. Yesterday, it deliberately and recklessly  undermined the position of the United States Government and the United  States Armed Forces that we sent to Iraq, shredding the tradition that  politics stop at the water's edge.   In a perilous moment, the House refused to stand behind the war that  it had authorized in 2002, refused to protect the men and women that it  placed in harm's way, and it gave a hostile foreign power a major  propaganda victory.   That is yet another stain upon the honor of this House, and one which  should be deplored and condemned through the ages to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
