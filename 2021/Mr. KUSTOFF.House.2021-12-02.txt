 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true education  leader, Dyersburg State Community College President Dr. Karen A.  Bowyer.   Dr. Karen Bowyer has served as president of Dyersburg State Community  College, located in my congressional district, for 37 years, and was  the first female president to lead the institution. In fact, at that  time there were no female college presidents in the entire State of  Tennessee.   Indeed, Dr. Bowyer broke barriers, and she opened doors for students  and their families across west Tennessee to achieve a higher education.  Under Karen Bowyer, enrollment at Dyersburg State grew by more than 100  percent during her tenure.   The impact that Karen Bowyer has had on our community in west  Tennessee is absolutely immeasurable. We thank Karen Bowyer for her  service, and Roberta and I wish her the best in her well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
