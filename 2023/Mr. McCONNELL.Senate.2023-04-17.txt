 Mr. President, it is good to be back.   I want to thank all of my colleagues for their warm wishes shared  over the past few weeks. Suffice it to say, this wasn't the first time  that being hardheaded has served me very well.   We are truly lucky and blessed to get to serve in this remarkable  institution, represent our home States, and serve our country. Needless  to say, I am very happy to be back.   There is important business for Congress to tackle. We should be  working to undo this administration's mistakes. We need to secure the  border, reduce crime, fight inflation, and invest in America's strength  and our security.   On an even more basic level, President Biden and his administration  are literally ``on the clock'' to negotiate a debt ceiling solution  with Speaker McCarthy and the Republican majority over in the House.  The President's economic advisers say the deadline for a solution is  not far off, but his political advisers apparently think the White  House's position should be--listen to this--no talks and no reforms.   This extreme position is not even holding up in their own party. Even  Washington Democrats are breaking  [[Page S1123]]  ranks from the administration's position of no talks and no reforms.   One of our Senate Democratic colleagues wrote an entire Washington  Post op-ed calling on the President to sit down with Congress and  reform spending. Reports indicate that a whole group of House Democrats  are already talking about negotiations and about compromise.   Just a few years ago, the Democratic leader, Leader Schumer, said  this about the debt ceiling:         [It] gives another ample opportunity for bipartisanship,       not for one party jamming its choices down the throats of the       other.    So President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and  refuse to listen, talk, or negotiate, and the American people know  that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating  with the Speaker of the House.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Barrasso), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr.  Cotton), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from  Idaho (Mr. Risch), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan), and the  Senator from Indiana (Mr. Young).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch)  would  [[Page S1129]]  have voted ``nay'' and the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Young) would have  voted ``yea.''   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 61, nays 26, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 83 Ex.]                                  YEAS--61       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Boozman      Brown      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cramer      Duckworth      Durbin      Ernst      Fetterman      Fischer      Grassley      Hassan      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Ricketts      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Sanders      Schumer      Shaheen      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden                                  NAYS--26       Blackburn      Braun      Britt      Budd      Cassidy      Cornyn      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      Mullin      Paul      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Tuberville      Vance                               NOT VOTING--13       Barrasso      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Heinrich      Markey      Risch      Schatz      Sinema      Sullivan      Young
