 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Grandmont  Rosedale Development Corporation as they celebrate 30 years of service  to the residents of northwest Detroit.   Grandmont Rosedale Development Corporation was formed in 1989,  initially as a business association for the five neighborhoods it  represents. However, its focus from business to neighborhood  preservation. From then on, Grandmont Rosedale Development Corporation  has been active in reducing neighborhood blight, promoting sustainable  economic development, and increasing homeownership.   Beyond that, they run a number of community-based programs, including  a neighborhood coworking space, farmers market, and vacant property  task force to help improve the quality of life for all the residents in  the city of Detroit.   Grandmont Rosedale Development Corporation's holistic approach to  maintaining its neighborhoods is the true definition of community  development. Its diverse staff and the countless volunteers put their  heart and soul into the community, and that shines through in every  project.   I am honored to serve this community, and I commend Grandmont  Rosedale Development Corporation on the occasion of its 30th  anniversary.                            ____________________
