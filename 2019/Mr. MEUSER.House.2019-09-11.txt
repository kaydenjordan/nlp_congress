 Mr. Speaker, we all remember where we were on September  11, 2001. I, myself, drove my daughter, Caroline, to school on my way  to work. She was in the third grade. Driving over the Susquehanna River  in Pennsylvania on my way to work, I recall thinking what a beautiful  day it was.   I watched with coworkers soon after that the horror of the planes  hitting the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A few days later, I  was asked to come to Ground Zero to help.   I will never forget the hospitals were all prepared for injured in  Manhattan, but there were no injured, or very few. I will never forget  the families and the communities that showed resilience and hope. I  will never forget the crowds of people cheering the first responders as  they traveled toward Ground Zero.  [[Page H7605]]    I now have a flag hanging in my office with 2,977 names of those who  perished that day. Two of those names were my friends.   September 11, now known as Patriot Day, brought us together and  unified our Nation in defiance of terrorism and evil. Let us continue  to come together and never forget that we are all Americans and that  we, here, represent the greatest country on Earth.                            ____________________
