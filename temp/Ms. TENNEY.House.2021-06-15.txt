 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Richard  J. Furlong, a wonderful member of our community who passed away late  last year.   Mr. Furlong was born in 1926 in Utica, New York, my hometown. He grew  up on the Seminole Farm in Holland Patent.   He was called to serve his country at the age of 19 when he enlisted  in the United States Army during the World War II era. After he left  service, he returned home to Holland Patent. He would later go on to  marry Neva Millias, who was his beloved wife of 37 years.   Mr. Furlong was a very proud son of Irish immigrants. He enjoyed  sharing his heritage with those around him and made several visits to  Ireland over the course of his life.   Friends and family remember him as a jovial and hardworking man. Mr.  Furlong was the oldest living member of The American Legion Leon R.  Roberts Post 161 and a past member and president of the Holland Patent  Hose Company.   He was beloved by his siblings, 12 nieces and nephews, and many  great-nieces and -nephews. I extend my condolences to his family and  also his great friends.   Richard was larger than life, with a vibrant and fun personality.  While we all miss him dearly, we will always remember his great legacy  with a big smile.
