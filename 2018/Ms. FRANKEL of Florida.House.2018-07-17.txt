 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, keeping peace in the world, reducing terrorism, creating  safe environments where countries can be self-reliant and people can be  prosperous is not just about more guns and bombs.   Addressing the root causes of global upheaval is an important task.  It is an important task of USAID that calls itself the world's premier  development agency, which leads me to thank Mr. Royce and Ranking  Member Engel for their bipartisan leadership and for the other  cosponsors of this legislation for this very important bill that we  call the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, which  recognizes that when girls and women of the world are free from  violence, educated, and have access to tools for economic success,  their communities are more safe, more economically vibrant, and more  peaceful.   This is, of course, when women exert greater influence over household  finances, economic outcomes for their families improve. The childhood  survival rates go up, food security, and educational attainment  increases for their children. Women actually place a greater emphasis  on household savings, which improves a family's financial resiliency.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to comprehend the hardships and obstacles  that women face globally. I think of a girl like Fatim, born in Mali.  At just 8 months old, she was subjected to genital mutilation. By age  12, her father sold her for marriage to a man she had never met. She is  among the one in three girls worldwide who will suffer gender-based  violence.   I think of Nasha, a young Nigerian, desperate for an education, who  walks miles, fearful of sexual violence or kidnapping just to get to  class. She doesn't want to become one of the 130 million girls  worldwide who are out of school; or Kamila, a woman in Pakistan who  dreams of starting her own business and being able to care for her  family, but discriminatory laws prevent her from owning property or  accessing credit.   She is among the 1 billion women in the world excluded from the  formal financial system. Given all of the roadblocks, it is not  surprising that women and girls are the majority of the world's poor.   Here is the thing: Many of these cruel and unfair practices make the  world poorer, too, as we have heard from my colleagues. According to  the McKinsey Global Institute, a leading international private sector  think tank, if we change this equation and we advance women's equality,  we could add trillions to the global GDP in just years.   We are recognizing today that there is an undeniable link between  women's economic success and global prosperity and peacefulness and  security.   Now, this bill has several components. It makes it USAID policy to do  the following: to reduce gender gaps in economic opportunity; to strive  to eliminate gender-based violence; to support women's property rights;  and to increase the capability of women and girls to determine their  own future.                                time  1745    Next, the bill requires that 50 percent of USAID's resources for  small- and medium-sized enterprises be targeted to reach enterprises  owned, managed, and controlled by women. It codifies USAID's practice  of shaping policy and activities through a gender analysis.   As important, to ensure that our development assistance is reaching  women, this legislation mandates that USAID track and measure  improvements in women's economic empowerment, including employment,  access to financial services, enterprise development, earnings and  control over income, and property and land rights.   Finally, this legislation also expands the scope of development  assistance from microenterprises to small-and medium-sized enterprises  to reflect changes in the field.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for  joining me in support of this critical bill. Again, it is not about  bombs, military, and guns. Remember this: when women succeed, when  girls succeed, their nations succeed.
