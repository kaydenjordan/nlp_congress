 Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Cumulative Impacts Act to  protect frontline communities by requiring the EPA to consider  cumulative impacts of pollution and deny permits unless they can  demonstrate that no harm will be done to the community, especially  public health.   It is ridiculous that our current permitting processes do not account  for all nearby sources of pollution.   From southwest Detroit to Dearborn's South End, which is home to an  extreme concentration of corporate polluters, and sits directly across  the road from schools, homes, and playgrounds. Our kids are being  taught that this is normal. It is not normal, Mr. Speaker.   From 48217 to Poletown and Beniteau and the east side of Detroit, our  neighbors across Detroit are forced to breathe emissions from dozens of  corporate polluters like Marathon Oil, U.S. Ecology, Stellantis,  Cleveland Cliffs, and so much more, all of whom routinely violate their  permits because it is cheaper than following the law.   Where pollution occurs is a policy choice, Mr. Speaker. It is  environmental racism.   Forcing regulators to analyze the cumulative impacts of pollution and  deny permits for facilities that endanger public health would be a  revolutionary, transformative change for our neighbors who just want to  breathe clean air.                            ____________________
