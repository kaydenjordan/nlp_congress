 Madam President, I rise today in honor of one of the most  beloved women in Indiana. An attorney, a First Lady, a wife, and a  mother, Susan Bayh will always be remembered throughout Indiana for her  grace and strength.   Susan Breshears was born in Los Angeles, CA, in 1959. She received a  bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley and a  juris doctorate from the University of Southern California. In 1978,  she was named Miss Southern California. While working on Capitol Hill  in the early 1980s, she met Evan Bayh. The two married in 1985. She  became Indiana's First Lady in 1989, when Evan was elected Governor. In  1995, she gave birth to twins Birch Evans Bayh IV and Nicholas Bayh,  becoming the first First Lady to have children while in office.   Susan was a talented attorney. She made a name for herself at some of  the country's top law firms before joining Eli Lilly and Company to  manage regulatory affairs. Later, she taught at Butler University and  Indiana University. She passed away in February 2021 after a battle  with brain cancer.   In Indiana, the Bayh name is famous, but as President Biden said,  ``Susan stood out as a single treasure.'' As Susan's loved ones and  friends gather to remember her life at Washington National Cathedral  this week, Hoosiers are grateful for the life she lived, the family she  raised, and the legacy she has left behind.                            ____________________
