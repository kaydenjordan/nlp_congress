 Madam Speaker, I take seriously my oath to uphold and  defend the Constitution, and I do not take today's proceedings lightly.   The Founding Fathers included the impeachment process in the  Constitution to uphold our values and to maintain the checks and  balances that are essential to separation of powers and to democracy.  They knew way back in 1787 that a President could abuse the power of  the office. In fact, they adopted the phrase ``high crimes and  misdemeanors'' from a phrase that had been used in the English  Parliament  [[Page H12155]]  since 1386 intended to cover situations where an official abused his  power and included disobeying an order from the Parliament.   Donald Trump has abused the power of his office by inviting a foreign  government to interfere in the U.S. election. He did this not to help  the United States but to benefit himself. That is wrong, and it is an  impeachable offense.   Then, when Congress exercised our constitutional duty to investigate  these wrongdoings, he obstructed the investigation every step of the  way. That is also wrong, and it is also an impeachable offense.    In our country, no one is above the law. That includes the President  of the United States.
