 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senator from Florida be given 3 minutes to speak on the resolution of  his colleague from Florida, and then I speak on leader time, to be  followed immediately by Senators Whitehouse, Schatz, and Merkley.    Madam President, later today we will vote on the  agreement by the conference committee to keep the government open, as  well as provide additional border security. Once again, I applaud the  members of the conference committee and their staffs. They were the nub  here, and they did outstanding work, nights and weekends, to reach an  agreement. We knew that if the conference committee were allowed to  work, they could bring this together. The agreement is a validation of  the idea that when you put Members of both parties in a room to  negotiate in good faith, when everyone is willing to give and take,  progress is never out of reach. So, again, I thank the members of the  committee.   The agreement is a reasonable compromise. It provides additional  funding for smart, effective border security. It does not fund the  President's wall, but it does fund smart border security initiatives  that both parties have always supported, including increased security  at our ports of entry and humanitarian assistance at our border. Most  importantly, it will keep our government open.   Everyone, I believe, including the President, wants to avoid a repeat  of what happened before Christmas. Everyone wants to avoid another  senseless government shutdown. I expect Congress will pass this bill  sometime this afternoon, and President Trump should sign it  immediately.  [[Page S1342]]         Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the  agreement by the conference committee to keep the government open. The  agreement was a product of a lot of hard work and long nights and  weekends by members of the conference committee and their staffs. I  want to salute Senator Leahy and Senator Shelby. I want to salute all  of the conferees.   When Leader McConnell and I met--as we moved to open up the  government for a short period of time--I suggested that we do a  conference committee because I had a great deal of faith in the members  of the conference committees on both sides of the aisle, and that faith  has proved to be vindicated. I thank Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby,  their staffs, and all the members of the conference committee for the  great job they have done.   The agreement will provide smart border security, increasing support  for technologies at our ports of entry. It will not fund the  President's expensive, ineffective wall. It will provide desperately  needed humanitarian assistance--medical support, transportation, food,  and clothing--for children and families in detention. It will provide  funding to our neighbors in Central America to fight the actual root  causes of migration--the violent gangs and drug cartels.   In short, it represents a fair compromise that includes priorities  from both sides of the aisle. I expect the legislation will pass this  Chamber with a significant bipartisan majority, pass the House, and be  sent to the President with plenty of time to avoid a government  shutdown tomorrow at midnight.   There is word that the President will declare a national emergency. I  hope he won't. That would be a very wrong thing to do. Leader Pelosi  and I will be responding to that in short order, but before that, I  just want to say that in order to reach this point, in order to attain  this bipartisan compromise, 800,000 public servants were forced to  suffer without pay for over a month as President Trump put the country  through a completely unnecessary shutdown that snarled airports,  delayed loans for farmers and small businesses, trashed our national  parks, and took billions of dollars out of our economy.   We still need to address the plight of government contractors who  still have not been made whole. Regrettably, we were unable to include  that in the agreement, but we are going to keep working and fighting  for Senator Smith's proposal to ensure our contractors are made whole  again.   The Senate was in the very same position just before Christmas, with  a deal in hand, when the President reversed himself and engineered the  longest shutdown in American history. After all of the pain of the  shutdown caused by President Trump, we are basically right back where  we started, with nearly the same parameters of a bipartisan agreement  we were ready to pass around Christmas. Leader Pelosi and I, for  instance, offered the President $1.37 billion for border security with  the same language that would have prohibited the wall then as is in the  agreement now.   Let this be a lesson. Government shutdowns don't work. I hope  President Trump has learned that lesson once and for all. I hope we  never go down the road to shutdowns again. The American people suffer  and very little is accomplished.   President Trump should sign this bill ASAP.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, let me congratulate the Chamber on  the overwhelming vote for the appropriations bill. It is good news that  we passed it by a lot of votes, and I hope the House does it by a lot,  too.   I need to comment on the news that President Trump may declare a  national emergency in an attempt to build his border wall. If President  Trump decides to go forward with a disaster declaration, he will be  making a tremendous mistake.   Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse  of the power of the Presidency, and a desperate attempt to distract  from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have  Mexico pay for the wall. It will be another demonstration of President  Trump's naked contempt for the rule of law and congressional authority.   Congress just debated this very issue. There was not support for the  President's position. Congressional intent on this issue is very clear.  The President's wall has been before Congress several times and has  never garnered enough votes to even merit consideration. For the  President to declare an emergency now would be an unprecedented  subversion of Congress's constitutional prerogative.   The fact is, this is not an emergency, and the President's  fearmongering doesn't make it one. A policy dispute about our southern  border does not constitute a national emergency.  [[Page S1366]]    Democrats support and have always supported strong border security,  but the fact is, according to the CBP, apprehensions at our southern  border are at historic lows.   President Trump couldn't convince Mexico, he couldn't convince the  American people, and he couldn't convince their elected representatives  to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall. Now he is trying an end  run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook  for it. Make no mistake--Congress will defend our constitutional  authorities in every way that we can.   I yield the floor.
