 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3742 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, my amendment provides for ensuring that  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is charged by Congress  with enforcing immigration laws in the United States, has sufficient  resources to deport illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes in  the United States.   According to ICE's website, 92 percent of the illegal aliens that ICE  deports have been convicted or charged with crimes. Yet despite the  border crisis and record border crossings, the Biden administration has  drastically reduced deportations to roughly one-quarter of what they  were last fiscal year, reaching the lowest levels on record this  spring, from over 28,000 in October of 2019 to less than 3,000 in April  of 2021.   That means the administration is allowing thousands of criminal  illegal aliens per month to remain in American communities and  potentially commit more crimes.   I ask for your support for enforcing our immigration laws and  deterring illegal immigration and criminal activity by providing the  resources necessary to remove criminal illegal aliens from our streets.   Thank you, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
