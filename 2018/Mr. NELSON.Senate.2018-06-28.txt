 Mr. President, I have some remarks with which to explain  the two unanimous consent requests  [[Page S4705]]  that I am making. I understand, to accommodate the schedule of the  Senator from Wisconsin, I will make the unanimous consent requests  prior to my remarks.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized upon the  disposition of the unanimous consent requests.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S. 2880, a bill to establish a pilot program  for long-term rental assistance for families affected by major  disasters, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I have another unanimous consent request.   Let me just say, as to the unanimous consent request that the Senator  from Wisconsin has just objected to, indeed, FEMA does oppose this.  That is the whole purpose of the UC request, for people are about to  get shut out of the temporary housing that they have in their having  been evacuated from Puerto Rico to Florida.   According to FEMA, this program runs out on June 30. In fact, a law  on the books says that FEMA could activate that program just as it did  after Hurricane Katrina for the poor people in New Orleans who had to  evacuate from their homes. In that case, most of them evacuated to a  different State. A lot of them went to Houston, TX.   If the Presiding Officer hears emotion in this Senator's voice,  indeed, it is there. I will address the remarks later.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2066    Mr. President, my second unanimous consent request involves a matter  of Medicaid assistance and housing assistance to families who have been  affected by a major disaster.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee, of  which this Senator is a part, be discharged from further consideration  of S. 2066, a bill to provide housing and Medicaid assistance to  families affected by a major disaster; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, both of these UC requests are because  there are a lot of people who are hurting in the aftermath of two  hurricanes having hit Puerto Rico and because the island is still in  great distress. Our fellow U.S. citizens on the island of Puerto Rico  are, indeed, in great distress. It is not only because of the slow  assistance by FEMA but because of the lack of electricity, as parts of  Puerto Rico today are without electricity, with its going on 10 months  after the hurricane. It is because of the number of people who are  fleeing the island and, therefore, the jobs are not available because  the economy has been so crippled. Naturally, a number of those people  have fled to where they can find safety and shelter and put their  children in school. By the way, there are a number of schools in Puerto  Rico that are closed.   Not just tens of thousands but hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans  have fled the island to the States where there will be decent  opportunities to get jobs, and a good number of them are in my State of  Florida.   In Florida, there are 600 families who have been in temporary  housing. It is called TSA. It is called temporary shelter assistance.  About 100 of those families have moved on to other States, and another  100 of those families have returned to the island. Yet 400 of those  families are still in our State, and a good number of those 400  families are still in temporary shelter assistance.   At least FEMA did not stop this assistance in March. We got them to  extend it until the end of May and then pointed out that a lot of these  families in that temporary assistance had children in school and that  they needed to complete the academic year. The assistance was extended  until 2 days from now, June 30.   They have nowhere to go. By both husband and wife working two jobs,  some of them have collected enough savings to be able to afford  apartments. The problem is that the apartment rentals want security  deposits that are three or four times the monthly rents. Many of these  families do not have that much money saved as a result of their being  unable to find work.   It seems to me that the humane thing to do is to activate again the  part of the law that is still on the books that was activated after  Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, of which this Senator asked for  unanimous consent and to which it has been objected by the Republican  side, for the purpose of there being transitional housing assistance.  That bill was filed by a number of us. It was the only way to get  action since we just heard the chairman of the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee say that FEMA was not going to extend it  and does not support it.   If it were good enough for the people who fled New Orleans during  Hurricane Katrina, why isn't it good enough for the people in Florida,  our fellow U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico, who have been equally  devastated after their having fled the deplorable conditions on their  native island?   In the wake of those hurricanes, there are thousands of displaced  families who are still unable to return to their homes. This includes  the hundreds of families--and we estimate its being about 400  families--who are in the State of Florida. Despite that fact, FEMA is  still saying that it is ending this transitional shelter assistance.   This decision to stop providing assistance to these families has many  of them very scared. They are scrambling to figure out what they are  going to do and to find affordable places. We have reached out to  churches, and we have reached out to other charitable organizations to  try to help them afford the deposits even when they have the income now  from one or both spouses having worked two jobs to be able to afford  the apartments.   So what we have been trying to do with this legislation, now rejected  by our Republican friends, is we have been trying to urge the Agency to  do the right thing--use the existing law and activate it. It was done  for New Orleans; why not now for Puerto Rico?   The situation that many of these families find themselves in is a  situation no family should have to go through. I suspect that what we  are going to see come Sunday in Florida by the news organizations will  be a chronicle of some who will be living in a car or going down to a  homeless shelter. Some of them have lost everything because of these  storms. Too many are  [[Page S4706]]  still unable to find work or to find affordable housing and especially  the security deposit. For many of them, the only thing they have is the  help FEMA is providing, but that is only good for 2 more days.   We have tried, but the Senator from Wisconsin, at the direction of  the Republican leader, has said they are not going to let this  legislation come up.   These folks are not looking for a handout; they just need a little  help getting back on their feet after the storms took everything from  them. The fact that FEMA has put an arbitrary deadline on this aid  rather than trying to work with the people defies logic. FEMA's TSA  Program is critical and it has been critical to providing for them.  While I recognize that the TSA Program was a temporary fix, you just  can't end a temporary fix when people are being thrown out on the  streets. So that was an attempt to force FEMA to act, this request to  pass the legislation forcing them to act. That is why this Senator made  the unanimous consent request.   The second unanimous consent request this Senator asked for was to  activate a housing program of additional section 8 housing. Florida has  used up its meager allocation. This would have given additional section  8 housing for those among the least fortunate of us. I thank my  cosponsors--Senators Blumenthal, Warren, Markey, Gillibrand, Harris,  and Baldwin--for their understanding of this situation and for signing  on as cosponsors with me.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments  to recognize my friend and esteemed president of the University of  Central Florida, John Hitt. On June 30, John will step down as  president after 26 years.  [[Page S4728]]    John was the first in his family to graduate from college, and ever  since then, he has continued to work in academia through his leadership  at the University of Maine, Bradley University, Texas Christian  University, Tulane University, and most recently, the University of  Central Florida.   Since he assumed his role in 1992, UCF has seen its enrollment more  than triple to over 66,000 students. It has also tripled the number of  minority students at UCF, who currently make up 46 percent of the UCF  student body.   As the current longest serving president in Florida's State  University System, John has been involved in UCF receiving $2.23  billion in research funding, creating 71 new degree programs, and  launching more than $1 billion in new construction, including more than  100 new buildings. Among them is the UCF College of Medicine that  anchors the Medical City at Lake Nona.   His many awards and honors include being recognized as one of  America's 10 most innovative college presidents by Washington Monthly  magazine and twice being ranked No. 1 on Orlando Magazine's list of  Orlando's 50 Most Powerful People.   Most impressively, John, a first-generation college student, has  awarded more than 270,000 degrees, which translates to about 83 percent  of all degrees conferred in UCF history. John awarded more degrees  within the State University System of Florida than any other university  president in Sunshine State history.   In his inaugural presidential address in 1992, John said, ``UCF is an  institution founded on partnership in a city that dares to dream. We  are a university founded on the principles of access to high quality  education at affordable cost, of research directed to public need, and  of service to the people of our state, region and nation. I fervently  believe that UCF will become America's leading metropolitan  university.''   His dedication to his students, university, and community will be  remembered by the large UCF Knight family and the people of central  Florida.   I am proud to call John a friend, and we will all miss his leadership  at UCF. I wish him well on his retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize and  celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Tampa alumni chapter of Kappa  Alpha Psi fraternity. For 90 years, the members of the Tampa alumni  chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi have provided leadership, dedication, and  service to Tampa. Through their community initiatives and fundraisers,  they have helped thousands in their community. The Tampa alumni chapter  of Kappa Alpha Psi was founded in 1928 on the belief of service to one  another and the community, during a time when African Americans faced  legal and institutional discrimination both on and off college  campuses. The current members of the alumni chapter have dedicated  their time to providing leadership and service in their community, most  recently organizing a Martin Luther King, Jr., day of service focused  on disaster preparedness.   The past and present members of the Tampa Alumni Chapter of Kappa  Alpha Psi fraternity should inspire everyone to make their own  communities better. One quality members of Kappa Alpha Psi strive for  is excellence in everything they do, and over the past 90 years, the  members of the Tampa alumni chapter have provided excellent leadership  and service to their community in Tampa. The celebration and reflection  of 90 years of service shows how far we have come in the United States  and how much work is still left to do.                            ____________________
