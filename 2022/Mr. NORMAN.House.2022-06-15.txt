 Madam Speaker, as a Member of the 117th Congress, I rise  today to celebrate the life of John Walter Revell. John is the son of  Jeanie Tanner Revell and Dr. Walter J. Revell, Jr., and the brother of  Letty and Marie Revell.   John was born on March 8th, 1980, and tragically died on June 19th,  1993, as a result of being hit by a car as he was riding his bicycle on  his way to his family farm. The driver of the car was a person under  the influence of drugs, which are ravaging our Nation today.   John was 13 years old at the time of his death. However, his life  epitomizes the words, ``While he was alive, he lived.''   The fond memories our family has of John include his Rollerblading  around the neighborhood, the family ski trips, the sleepovers he had  with our children and friends at our house, the words others would have  this 13-year-old boy tell me during the children work week, ``Ralph, we  want to take today off to swim at Shiland Pool and play,'' the sight of  him standing in our back door when dinner was being served with that  smile, indicating I am hungry.   He was an athlete. He was a Boy Scout. He was an honor student. He  was a musician. He was a child who loved to laugh and brought a ray of  sunshine to everyone he encountered.   June 19, 2022, will mark the 29th year of John's passing. On March 8  of this year, he would have been 42 years of age.   The biblical passage that gives comfort to all those left behind who  knew and loved John Revell can be found in Romans 8:38-39, ``For I am  persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor  principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor  height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us  from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.''                            ____________________
