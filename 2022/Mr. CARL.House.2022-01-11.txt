 Madam Speaker, I am a firm believer that when the President  of the United States does well, be it Republican or Democrat, we as  America benefit the most. Unfortunately, President Biden's performance  during his first year in office has been absolutely terrible, and  virtually all Americans are suffering because of his failures.   There is so much about this President that actually frustrates me. He  left behind Americans in Afghanistan, and he has completely refused to  secure our southern border. Meanwhile, he is punishing hardworking  Americans by imposing illegal vaccine mandates on them.   All across America, businesses are struggling to keep their doors  open and their shelves stocked, but President Biden has done nothing to  fix these issues.   I am urging President Biden to show up and work on leadership for a  change. The American people deserve much, much more and much better  than what they are receiving today.                            ____________________
