 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following my  remarks, I yield the floor to Senators Johnson and Markey.    Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues Senator  Warner and Senator Blumenthal for their words on the Senate floor-- Senator Warner's words yesterday especially, defending Special Counsel  Robert Mueller, in his leadership on the Senate Intelligence  Committee's Russia investigation. Senator Warner is absolutely right  that we must protect the integrity of the Justice Department's  independent investigation.   Congress needs to make clear that there are redlines. Any attempt to  fire Robert Mueller, to shut down the investigation, or to  presumptively pardon key witnesses essential to the investigation would  be an abuse of power and a direct threat to the rule of law and to our  constitutional system.   Ohio's Ukrainian community knows the impact of unchecked Russian  aggression in Russia's effort to undermine democracy around the world.  Getting to the bottom of Russian interference and protecting our future  elections from that interference are critical.   My priority is getting to the bottom of what happened so that our  democratic process is upheld and so we can move forward with the  business we were sent here to do--creating jobs, combatting the opioid  crisis, as Senators Johnson, Markey, and I will speak about in a  moment, and helping middle-class families. Any efforts to delay that  conclusion or interfere in the investigation, I believe, will not be  tolerated by Senators in either party.   Thanks to Senator Warner for making that clear. Thanks to my  colleagues in both parties who take this seriously. All of us have had  serious conversations with Members of both parties to discuss what all  this means, and thank you for all of us working together to complete  the independent Senate investigation. It is important that we make  clear to the American people that this is not a partisan issue. It is  about the integrity of our elections, about protecting our country from  foreign powers.   Any attempt to discredit Robert Mueller and his investigation and to  turn it into a partisan issue makes us less safe as a nation. Let's  allow the Justice Department and the special counsel to do their jobs.  Let's get back to doing ours.                            ____________________     Madam President, as we await Senator Markey's and Senator  Johnson's remarks, I wish to set the stage. The CDC released a new  report last night showing a massive increase in the number of Americans  dying from drug overdoses.   My State is second to the Presiding Officer's State. It has the  second highest rate of deaths per capita in the country. In my State of  Ohio, unfortunately, far too many people die from opioid overdoses than  any other State in country. Families are torn apart. Children lose  parents. Parents lose sons and daughters.   The CDC pins much of the blame of this epidemic on this relatively  new deadly synthetic fentanyl. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than  heroin. Senator Capito knows that, as do Senators Johnson and Markey.  All of us in the Senate are aware of that.   This drug is being illegally trafficked into this country from Mexico  and China. We have a bill to stop this today. The INTERDICT Act. I want  to thank Senator Markey for his leadership on this bill and also my  colleague Senator Portman for his support. Senator Portman and I have  been working on a number of issues across party lines for months and  months. It would provide more funds for Customs and Border Protection  to screen packages effectively and safely, to stop fentanyl whenever  possible before it reaches Akron, Toledo, Dayton, or the smaller cities  of Chillicothe, Mansfield, and Zanesville.   This passed the House with only two or three negative votes. It has  the support of major law enforcement organizations, including sheriffs  and police officers. Our law enforcement officials, better than  anybody, see the devastation that fentanyl causes our communities. They  know the risk our officers face dealing with this deadly substance.  That is why this bill needs to pass into law.   Just this week, the National FOP, the Federal Law Enforcement  Officers Association, the Police Assisted Addiction Recovery  Initiative--a recent phenomenon, unfortunately--all publicly asked us  to pass the bill.   Americans are dying in record numbers. Life expectancy in our  country--I believe, for the first time in the lifetimes of any of us-- actually dropped last year. Think about that.   We have made progress, as I mentioned, in this body. I wear a pin on  my lapel of a canary in a bird cage. The mine workers in West Virginia,  Ohio, and elsewhere would take this canary down to the mines. If the  canary died, the mine worker was on his own. He didn't have a union  strong enough or a government that cared enough to help him. In those  days, people lived 45 years on average--for a person born in the United  States in 1900.   Today we live 30 years longer for a whole host of public health  reasons--from Medicare to Medicaid, to safe drinking laws, to clean  air, to minimum wage--all the things that we do. For the first time, I  believe, in our lifetime, life expectancy actually has dropped because  of drug overdoses for the second year in a row, and it is in large part  because of these overdose deaths.   Why shouldn't we take steps today to stop this? We can do this by  putting the INTERDICT Act on the President's desk, immediately giving  law enforcement the tools they need to keep fentanyl out of the country  and off our streets.    Of course.    Madam President, will the Senator yield?    Madam President, I thank Senator Markey for his leadership  on this issue. This has gotten this far because of his efforts in so  many ways.   I want to enter into the Record three letters that are dated  yesterday and today. Actually, one is from the National Fraternal Order  of Police, signed by Chuck Canterbury, their national president, in  support of this bill, with a very persuasive, passionate laying out of  reasons it matters. The second is a letter from the Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association, signed by Dominick Stokes. Mr. Stokes  is a longtime friend of mine. The third letter is from the Police  Assisted Addiction Recovery Initiative group, signed by Frederick Ryan,  all making endorsements for this bill.   I ask unanimous consent those three letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             National Fraternal Order of Police,                                  Washington, DC, December 20, 2017.      Hon. A. Mitchell McConnell, Jr.,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: I am writing on behalf       of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to urge the       Senate to consider H.R. 2142, the ``International Narcotics       Trafficking Emergency Response by Detecting Incoming       Contraband with Technology (INTERDICT) Act,'' which passed       the House 412-3 in October.        Heroin and prescription opiates have created a devastating       epidemic across our country, and now these overdoses       outnumber gunshot deaths and motor vehicle deaths. This       epidemic has worsened with the influx of synthetic opiates       like fentanyl from foreign countries, especially China and       Mexico. For example, synthetic fentanyl is cheaper than       normal opiates bought on the street and it is 50 times more       deadly than heroin.        Our law enforcement officers at the United States Customs       and Border Protection (CBP) are on the forefront of stopping       the deadly influx of synthetic fentanyl into our communities       from these foreign countries. The CBP needs all the resources       they can get to stop this devastating flow of drugs into our       country.        This legislation will ensure that CBP will have additional       portable chemical screening devices at ports of entry, mail       and express consignment facilities, and more fixed chemical       screening devices at CBP laboratories. The bill will also       provide CBP with sufficient resources, personnel, and       facilities, including scientists to interpret the screening       test results from the field.        With all the additional resources CBP will be better       equipped on all fronts to thwart the deadly flow of synthetic       opiates across our borders.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to thank you for helping fight       against the heroin and opioid epidemic and fighting every day       to rid our communities of these drugs. If I can be of any       additional help to you. please feel free to contact me or my       Senior Advisor, Jim Pasco, in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                             Federal Law Enforcement                                            Officers Association,                                  Cabin John, MD, December 21, 2017.      Hon. A. Mitchell McConnell, Jr.,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: I am writing on behalf       of the members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers       Association (FLEOA) which is a professional organization       representing more than 26,000 federal officers and agents in       65 law enforcement agencies including the United States       Customs and Border Protection (CBP). FLEOA has endorsed H.R.       2142, the ``International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency       Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband and Technology       (INTERDICT) Act'' which passed the House with a 412-3 vote. I       urge the Senate to consider this bill for passage.        Probably the most serious crisis facing law enforcement is       the proliferation of heroin and opiate drugs, which are       causing more deaths from overdoses than ever experienced       before. In fact, synthetic opiates like fentanyl are now the       leading cause of overdoses because they are cheaper and       dramatically stronger than heroin.        The INTERDICT Act will provide CBP with portable screening       devices at ports of entry and mail facilities. In addition,       it will increase detection devices at CBP testing facilities       and laboratories. The Act will also provide CBP with       additional staffing and resources. This will allow CBP to       successfully diminish the importation of synthetic opiates       into the United States.        FLEOA applauds your assistance in helping CBP and the other       federal agencies in their efforts to reduce the plague these       illegal substances have induced on our country.            Sincerely,                                                   Dominick Stokes,      FLEOA V.P. for Legislation.                                   ____                                                     Police Assisted                                   Addiction Recovery Initiative,                                  Gloucester, MA, December 21, 2017.      Hon. A. Mitchell McConnell, Jr.,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: The Police Assisted       Addiction Recovery Initiative (PAARI) is a nonprofit       organization that trains and supports more than 360 law       enforcement agencies that have launched programs that serve       as a pre-arrest bridge to treatment. PAARI was pleased to       offer its strong support for S. 708, the bipartisan INTERDICT       Act, which was introduced by Senators Markey, Rubio, Brown,       and Capito. This bill will expand U.S. Customs and Border       Protection's ability to use technology to detect fentanyl and       other narcotics coming into the United States from abroad and       which are causing a public health epidemic in our       communities.        While the Senate has yet to act on S. 708, the House of       Representatives took action and on 25 October 2017, passed       companion legislation HR 2142, by a vote of 412-3. As this       year draws to a close, we urge the Senate to take up and pass       the House version of INTERDICT this year.        Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in       the United States, with more than 54,000 overdose deaths       reported in 2015. Almost 33,000 of those overdose deaths--      roughly 60 percent--involved opioids, including prescription       opioid pain relievers, heroin, or the synthetic opioid       fentanyl. In particular, as the CDC's recent report has just       shown, fentanyl and its analogs are becoming increasingly       responsible for these overdose deaths.        Fentanyl is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin and       100 times more powerful than morphine. It is dangerous and       potentially life-threatening to simply touch or accidentally       inhale the white powdery substance. Sometimes, unbeknownst to       the user, fentanyl is often mixed with heroin or other       substances, or formed to resemble prescription opioid pills.       Most illicit fentanyl comes to the United States from China       and Mexico, delivered through the mail or express consignment       carriers, or smuggled across the southwest border of the       United States. The INTERDICT Act will help the United States       better identify and stop these dangerous substances from       landing in communities across America.        Now is the time to act. This holiday season too many seats       at too many tables are empty due to the unrelenting flow of       fentanyl into the United States. We must give our law       enforcement personnel the tools necessary to stop this flow.       We can do that, in part, by getting the INTERDICT Act to the       President's desk this year. That is why PAARI strongly       supports this important legislation which will give U.S.       Customs and Border Protection the additional resources it       needs to fight the flow of fentanyl and other deadly drugs       into the United States.            Sincerely,      Frederick Ryan,  [[Page S8211]]         Chief of Police, Arlington Massachusetts,                              PAARI Board of Directors Co-Chairman,                            PAARI National Police Council Chairman.     I think it is pretty clear how important this is. This  bill got, I believe, 2 or maybe 3 negative votes out of 400-some in the  House of Representatives. There is no organization I know of that  opposes it. I hear from people in my State consistently about how  important this is, from police organizations to parents, to individual  police officers and county sheriffs and all, and deputy sheriffs.   There is just no reason we shouldn't be able to do this before we go  home for Christmas. There are a lot of things we should do before we go  home for Christmas, including the Children's Health Insurance Program,  but this is one we know we can do. There seems to be no substantive  disagreement from any large number of groups or individuals that I can  see, so I am hopeful we can move forward with this in the next few  minutes.    Yes.    Madam President, I thank Senator Markey and hope we can  work things out with Senator Johnson on this issue.                            ____________________     Yesterday, Madam President, a bunch of Members of  Congress, with healthcare paid for by taxpayers, went to the White  House and celebrated a handout for corporations that sends jobs  overseas--companies that shut down in Mansfield, in Zanesville, in  Lima, and Toledo moved to Wuhan and Sheshan and Shanghai and Guangzhou.   Families here in America, at the same time--I am still incredulous  about this. Families in this country, at the same time--in this State  of Virginia, just a few miles from here--are getting letters in the  mail saying their kids are about to be kicked off their health  insurance through something that was bipartisan and never interrupted  for 20 years since Chairman Hatch and Senator Rockefeller and Senator  Kennedy wrote this bill to create CHIP--and a number of us worked on it  in the House of Representatives--because Congress hasn't done its job.   Think about that. Because Congress hasn't done its job, we are about  to go home for Christmas--most of us--and those who don't celebrate  Christmas are about to go home for the holidays and celebrate the new  year. My grandchildren are coming from Columbus, and another one is  coming from the Virgin Islands with his father--our son and his  daughter-in-law. We are going to go home, and our families have health  insurance, but Members of Congress who get good health insurance paid  for by taxpayers are willing to leave here and not reauthorize, not  continue the Children's Health Insurance Program. To make it worse,  several States, including Virginia--Ohio is in a little better position  because there is a little more money left over to take care of this-- but letters are going out in State after State after State to parents  saying: Sorry, the health insurance for your children is going to  expire. The health insurance for your children will no longer be there.   Imagine you are a parent, and you get this letter. You are just  vaguely aware that Congress is fighting about something. You are  vaguely aware of the hard-heartedness of a whole lot of people in this  Congress. You are vaguely aware that a bunch of politicians-- privileged, elected officials who make good salaries and make good  benefits--are going to turn their backs on you. You don't really think  much about that. All you know is, you take this piece of paper, tear  open this envelope, and you start reading this letter, and you see, oh,  my gosh, the insurance for my children.   Now, overwhelmingly, these parents are people who are working. They  are earning $8, $10, $12, $15 an hour. They are not making enough that  they can afford insurance for their families. They are not working at a  job where insurance is provided as part of the compensation your  employer is paying you. So that is why the Children's Health Insurance  Program is so important.   A new report from the Georgetown University Center for Children and  Families reports that 1.9 million children could lose coverage in  January--1.9 million children. Almost all of them have a mother or a  father who will open a letter and see that, oh, my gosh, the insurance  for my daughter, for my son is about to expire. That is 1.9 million in  January and another 1 million will lose insurance by the end of  February.   Parents will panic, parents will be confused, and parents, to be  sure, will have their Christmas ruined by this. Think about those  families getting that letter. It should be a joyful time of year for  families, spending time with family, enjoying the holidays. Imagine  checking that mailbox and kind of thinking maybe this is a Christmas  card and opening it and finding out it is that letter. Imagine telling  your daughter: I am sorry, honey. Santa is not going to bring much this  year. We don't make a lot of money--you know that--but we will not have  any presents under the tree. Then you have to  [[Page S8212]]  look into your children's eyes--you have to look into your son's eyes,  you have to look into your daughter's eyes, and you hope they don't see  the worry in your eyes because you just got this letter. Now you are  wondering how you will afford to take him or her to the doctor if he or  she gets sick. These are often families with two working parents who,  as I said, aren't lucky enough to work for an employer who provides  insurance.   These are often families with children who have special needs. Like  Crystal Lett and her son Noble, a first-grader in Dublin, OH, which is  a suburb just west and northwest of Columbus. Crystal and her son  Noble--I met them. This is obviously Noble. I met Noble and his mother  Crystal in Washington this spring when they came all the way from Ohio  to talk about what CHIP means to their family.   Noble was born with a rare genetic disorder. He needs three therapy  sessions a week. He needs daily hormone injections to treat his  condition. His medications run about $1,500 a month.   I talked to Crystal again at the end of last month. She and her  family are scared to death about what will happen to them if Congress  doesn't save CHIP. She said CHIP is ``the difference between living a  middle class lifestyle, or being part of the poverty line.'' It is the  difference between a middle-class lifestyle or being part of the  poverty line.   Over the last several weeks, Congress was busy. Congress had the time  to hand out massive tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest  corporations but didn't have time to help these families. Some of you  may have been in this Chamber a few nights ago when I pointed down the  hall to Senator McConnell's office, the Senate Republican leader, and  described the lobbyists who went in and out of his office to get these  tax breaks. It was the lobbyists from the oil companies and from the  oil industry. There were lobbyists walking in and out of Senator  McConnell's office, the leader's office, from the tobacco companies.  The lobbyists from the big drug companies and the lobbyists from Wall  Street were going in and out of his office.   When you look down the hall to Senator McConnell's office, do you  know who didn't come out of his office? There were no lobbyists for the  Children's Health Insurance Program because, you know what, children  like Noble don't have lobbyists. They can't hire lobbyists. Parents are  just hoping to keep their head above water because they have a child  who needs medical attention, and any child obviously can need medical  attention. That is the importance of CHIP.   So CHIP doesn't have a lobbyist. CHIP has people like Crystal Lett,  who stands up for her family, who stands up for her children, but she  can't come to Washington full time. She came here with a delegation  from Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.   Congress had time to hand out these massive tax cuts, but they don't  have time for Noble Lett. It is a disgrace. It is a program that was  bipartisan, and it has always been bipartisan. It was voted out of  committee bipartisanly, but I guess the right crowd of lobbyists hasn't  visited Senator McConnell down the hall in his office. It is  despicable.   We passed a bipartisan CHIP extension out of the Finance Committee.  It is ready to go. If Republican leaders would put it on the floor  today, it would pass. I assume it would pass with at least 90 votes.  There is no excuse for this delay.   There is talk the House is going to pass a 3-month CHIP extension. We  have never done that. We have extended CHIP 1 year, 2 years, 3 years.  This is going to get a 5-year extension. That is what we ought to do.  They are going to do a 3-month extension.   Three months provides no certainty to the States that are running  CHIP. It provides no certainty to Crystal Lett to take care of Noble  and manage his healthcare. It provides no certainty to anybody. The  Presiding Officer's State of Alabama is already taking steps to close  down their programs and freeze enrollment. I know Senator Strange  doesn't want that to happen, but I also know Senate Republicans need to  talk to their leader to make this happen.   States have to give families a heads-up so these parents have time to  do what they can. Maybe some of these parents can find an alternative  source of coverage, maybe they are going to fit in one more doctor's  appointment before their coverage lapses. Think of that. You get this  letter in the mail saying the insurance for your children is about to  expire, so what do you do? You start dialing the hospital and dialing  the doctor's office because you have CHIP coverage for another month or  another 5 weeks or whatever, and you start scheduling any possible  appointment you can, the Christmas season notwithstanding.   Providing a 3-month extension doesn't solve this problem; it just  makes the situation more complicated. This body can pass massive  permanent tax cuts, but they can't give families certainty? I know the  tax cuts are permanent for corporations, and I know they are temporary  for individual people in this country. Of course, this Congress--as  special-interest controlled as it is--first takes care of corporations,  but it would be nice if they gave some certainty to these children's  families.   I want my colleagues to explain to the Crystal Letts in your State-- because every State has thousands of concerned parents who don't know  what to do with the expiration of this. My State has 209,000 children  who rely on this program.   Senator Hatch said last month: We are going to get it done. Now we  are hearing that Senator McConnell is only going to let us vote on a 3- month extension.   This is about whose side you are on. Do we work for corporations that  send our jobs overseas, or do we work for families, such as Crystal  Lett and her son Noble? Do we work for families who might wake up on  Christmas morning without health insurance? I guess the answer is  pretty clear: Most people in this body are working for large  corporations that are getting huge tax cuts and that send their jobs  overseas, and they are turning their backs on those families who need  us to simply do our jobs and pass this extension of the Children's  Health Insurance Program.   I yield the floor.
