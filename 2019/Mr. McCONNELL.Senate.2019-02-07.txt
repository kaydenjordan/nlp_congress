 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee are meeting to advance a number of judicial nominees and the  President's choice for Attorney General here to the Senate floor.   In Bill Barr, President Trump has nominated a tried-and-true public  servant and a proven professional to lead the men and women of the  Department of Justice.   Testifying before the committee last month, Mr. Barr expressed his  unwavering commitment to the rule of law, the Constitution, and the  American people.   My colleagues don't have to take his word for it. Having served as  Attorney General once before, Mr. Barr's qualifications and job  performance speak for themselves.   In 1991, this body saw fit to confirm him to head DOJ by a voice  vote. That was the third time he had earned Senate confirmation without  opposition. On both sides of the aisle, Senators were vocal in their  praise for the ``independent voice'' of an ``honorable guy,'' William  Barr.   Today, the job description remains exactly the same as it was years  ago, and before us is a nominee who remains eminently well qualified to  discharge these duties. The Senate needs to act quickly to put Bill  Barr back to work at the Justice Department. I hope and expect he will  be confirmed next week.                       Natural Resources Management Act    Today, the Senate officially turned to the Natural Resources  Management Act, a broad bipartisan package of 100-plus distinct land  bills with importance to nearly every Member of this body. I am  certainly one of them.   This comprehensive legislation includes two initiatives I introduced  with my House colleagues Andy Barr and Hal Rogers. They will  incorporate two Civil War sites in Kentucky as part of the National  Park System, Camp Nelson and Mill Springs Battlefield. By designating  these two sites as national monuments, we will ensure that their rich  history will be preserved for the education and service of future  generations.   Camp Nelson was established in 1863 in Jessamine County. It would  become arguably Kentucky's top recruiting station and training facility  for the Union's African-American soldiers. In later years, those  seeking freedom from slavery fled to the camp. This historic site  helped expedite the destruction of slavery in Kentucky.   My other proposal would protect Mills Springs Battlefield, the site  of an 1862 battle that historians remember as the Union's first  significant victory in the West, and one of its earliest major  victories in the whole Civil War.   Preserving these sites isn't the only way Kentucky will benefit from  this sweeping lands package. The bill will help historically Black  colleges and universities like Kentucky State University preserve their  distinguished contributions to our communities; it extends the Lewis  and Clark National Historic Trail into Kentucky; and it bolsters our  critical efforts to combat invasive species like the dangerous Asian  carp that clog up Western Kentucky waterways. These are just examples  in my home State.   Across the whole country, communities will benefit from more  flexibility for economic development, more commonsense approaches to  conservation, and more access to our country's Federal lands. It is no  wonder that nearly 300 expert groups and advocacy organizations  publicly support the contents of this bill, from economic development  organizations to natural resources nonprofits to cultural organizations  and prominent historians.   Chairman Murkowski and all of our colleagues on the Energy and  Natural Resources Committee deserve credit for getting us to this  point. Senators Gardner and Daines have been particularly effective  advocates for this legislation. I look forward to passing it soon.                                  Elections    Madam President, on one final matter, in the days since House  Democrats began arguing for a massive takeover of America's elections,  we have heard a lot of dramatic claims about the state of American  democracy.   Speaker Pelosi has denounced ``devious vote-suppression schemes.''  The Democrats' response to the State of the Union on Tuesday night  warned of ``threats to democracy'' and ``efforts to undermine our right  to vote.''   If you listened only to Democrats, you might actually think there is  a widespread voting crisis in this country. If you took Democrats'  rhetoric at face value, you certainly wouldn't guess that 2018 saw the  highest midterm turnout rate in half a century or that 2016 hit an all- time record for Presidential ballots cast and the third highest  Presidential turnout rate in 50 years. If you believed the Democrats'  rhetoric, you would be shocked--shocked--to see the freedom, openness,  [[Page S1105]]  and availability of the electoral franchise across the country in the  year 2019.   Let's start with voter registration. Current Federal law provides all  Americans the option to register to vote when they apply for an  identification card at their local DMV. In many cases, registering is  as simple as checking a box on a completed form. If that is not enough,  voter registration is available at Agencies that provide social  services or disability services. It is available in places like  military recruitment centers, post offices, hunting and fishing license  offices, and courthouses. Voter registration is even available online  in many places, and in places where it isn't, detailed instructions are  available to anyone who goes looking.   You will find voter registration drives on college campuses, in high  schools, or outside the subways or train stations. You will find them  at church and other civic organizations. You will find voter  registration drives while you are walking down the street, visiting a  grocery store, or many other public places. Heck, many campaigns and  advocacy groups will come door to door to register voters.   So what about once voters are registered? To hear these Democrats  tell it, all of the polling places across America are staffed-- staffed--by malevolent people who set out to deny the franchise to as  many of their neighbors as possible.   But beneath the rhetoric, the procedures they are trying to attack  actually could not be more reasonable.   We are talking about things like making sure voters are in the right  precinct or even the right county so that they have the opportunity to  vote for their local leaders--things like requiring any form of  identification to verify that voters are who they claim to be, things  like making sure there is enough time between voter registration and  election day for officials to verify what district and precinct voters  live in or that they are eligible to vote in that State in the first  place.   These are simple, commonsense practices. They have worked just fine  in communities across the country, in areas overseen by Democratic  elected officials and Republican elected officials alike. But now-- now--Democrats have decided these standard processes are so unfair or  so immoral that the Federal Government must snatch the reins away from  the people and their local representatives. Now Washington Democrats  have decided we need them--them--to determine how we elect our leaders.   Once again, the plain facts disprove all of the hyperventilating.  After last year's election, the Pew Research Center surveyed Americans  about their voting experience, asking: How do you feel about voting?   Ninety-two percent said their voting experience was easy--92  percent--easy. Only 1 percent of voters found their experience ``very  difficult.'' One percent? That could be the result of practically any  inconvenience: full parking lots maybe, long lines, bad traffic, a  forgotten ID. You name it. But more than 9 of 10 voters indicated they  had no trouble whatsoever, so it is more than a little suspicious--more  than a little suspicious--that Washington Democrats are trying to  invent crises to justify a huge power grab for themselves.   This fact-free rhetoric is being used to push legislation that would  override the decisions of Americans' democratically chosen local  leaders and replace them with one-size-fits-all prescriptions authored  by a small handful of politicians, like Speaker Pelosi, Congressman  Sarbanes, and a few others whom the vast majority of Americans do not  elect and have no way to hold accountable. These prescriptions largely  seem designed to help Democrats and their DC attorneys contest rules  after election day. I call this 500-plus-page doorstop the Democratic  Politician Protection Act for a reason.   Let me be abundantly clear. Every eligible American voter should be  completely free to exercise their right to vote at every opportunity  and cast a ballot, period. There is no question about that. Every  single valid vote should be counted. Opposing the Democratic Politician  Protection Act is not opposing those basic tenets.   But the way to honor these basic propositions is to let States and  localities take simple, necessary steps to protect our elections and  ensure that valid votes are not diluted; to have procedures in place to  make sure that voters are casting ballots in the right places; to make  sure that the American people are the ones who determine how we elect  our leaders.   The real threat to American democracy is staring us in the face-- right in the face: an invented crisis, inaccurate rhetoric, all to  justify an unprecedented intrusion by Washington, DC, Democrats into  the way States run their elections.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to move to proceed to Executive Calendar No. 14 during today's  session of the Senate.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  February 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 47; finally, that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motion filed  during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m., Monday, and the filing  deadline for first-degree amendments be at 4 p.m. on Monday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senator Cornyn.
