 Mr.  Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.      The online version has been corrected to read: AMENDMENT NO. 199  OFFERED BY MR. ELLISON The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to  consider amendment No. 199 printed in House Report 115-297. Mr.  ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 590, strike line 1 and all that follows through page       591, line 14.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply preserves the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau's independent funding and ensures that it  is adequately funded. That is essentially what this is all about. This  is very clear. The sides on this couldn't be more clear. My amendment  is one of many this week, but I hope that people pay special attention  to how folks vote on this particular amendment.   This amendment is a clear litmus test. If a legislator wants to  support  [[Page H7346]]  the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, if they want to  support the work of $11.5 billion being returned to consumers, they  should vote ``yes.''   A ``yes'' vote on my amendment means you want to protect Americans  from fraud, deceptive practices, and rip-off schemes.   A ``yes'' vote means you want banks, debt collectors, credit  reporting agencies, payday lenders, and other finance companies to be  held accountable if they rip off consumers.   A ``yes'' vote means that you want honest and fair-dealing firms in  the financial services space to be rewarded for their good work and for  people who take advantage of consumers to be punished.   We want to keep good companies good. How can you do that if good and  bad get treated just alike?   We need the CFPB. My amendment asks that you stand with Ari Booras,  for example. As you may have seen on ``CBS Sunday Morning'' a few weeks  ago, Harry Booras contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's  consumer complaint center for help. His teenage son, Ari, joined the  Army, just like mine did, and bought a used truck at a car dealer near  his base.   My boy was 18 when he went to the Army. Ari was the same age, I  imagine. Yet that desire was taken advantage of.   Teenage Ari joined the Army and bought a used truck at a car dealer  near the base. The loan was way more than this private could possibly  afford, with an extensive extended warranty and 18.5 percent interest.  Private Booras would have paid three times more than Blue Book value  for this $11,000 truck. He would have paid three times more. Yet he  can't afford three times more. He is just a private trying to serve his  country.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau got Private Booras and  50,000 other servicemembers out of these predatory loans that ruin  their finances and cause enormous stress in their lives. We need  servicemembers thinking about protecting the country, not how to fight  off some predatory lender.   My amendment asks that you stand with Samir Hanef from Durham, North  Carolina. Samir was one of more than half a million people who was  wrongly charged for auto insurance when he took out a loan to buy a  Honda Civic.   Samir, a social worker, already had insurance, but Wells Fargo  charged him and 20,000 others, customers, added insurance that made  them miss payments. This led to their cars being repossessed in some  cases.   The numerous scandals at Wells Fargo--the forced insurance, fake  accounts, overcharges at mortgage closing, signing customers up for  life insurance without their consent, and other fraudulent practices-- are coming to light because of the work of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau and its consumer complaint office. They need  independence.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1 minute  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 200 Offered by Mr. Ellison    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 200  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 563, strike line 16 and all that follows through page       566, line 3.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment preserves the CFPB's  authority to protect people who live in manufactured housing,  manufactured housing buyers.   I am lucky to have the National Manufactured Home Owners Association  based in my district. For the Record, they have written an excellent  letter on behalf of this amendment, which I will include in the Record.                                        Manufactured Housing Action.      Representative Keith Ellison,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Ellison: We are writing to thank you for       introducing the Ellison Amendment #200 to the Department of       the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Act of 2018       (H.R. 3354). On behalf of the manufactured homeowners we       represent, we our offering our organizational support for       this amendment.        MHAction empowers homeowners and residents in manufactured       home communities to build and win local, state and national       issue campaigns that strengthen the long-term viability and       affordability of their communities. The work of MHAction is       based on a set of core values, central to which are       compassion for our neighbors and love of our communities. We       believe that manufactured home communities play a key role in       providing affordable, safe and accessible housing for all       families, regardless of race, language, immigration status,       class, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. MHAction       currently represents over 19,000 manufactured homeowners in       28 states.        It is vital that this amendment passes to protect       manufactured home buyers, especially people of color that       face higher levels of lending discrimination and seniors. We       need to ensure that the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau       retains the power to ensure that potential home buyers aren't       steered into high fee and high interest loans. When people       buy a home, it should help increase their stability and       wealth, not damage their finances.        Again, we would like to express our sincere thanks to your       office for fighting to ensure that the Consumer Finance       Protection Bureau can continue to protect manufactured home       buyers from loans that strip away their economic and       retirement security.        Should you have any question, please feel free to contact       MHAction's Executive Director, Kevin Borden. Our organization       can easily put your office in touch with purpose-driven       community leaders in numerous states that have been fighting       to strengthen the economic and retirement security of       manufactured homeowners.            Sincerely,      The MHAction Core Team.                                   ____                                               National Manufactured                                         Home Owners Association,                                    St. Paul, MN, September 7, 2017.      Representative Keith Ellison,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Ellison: On behalf of the 17 million       people nationwide who live in manufactured homes, we offer       our support for the Ellison Amendment No. 200 to the       Department of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies       Act of 2018 (H.R. 3354).        This amendment prevents the roll back of vital Dodd-Frank       consumer protections that would be especially harmful to low-       and moderate-income families. Contrary to claims made by       those making these changes, the current manufactured housing       provisions in H.R. 3354 would not expand access to credit and       would not serve the interests of homeowners and communities.       Instead, this bill would undermine already vulnerable       homeowners by stripping away protections created by Congress       and implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.        These protections were put in place for a reason: to give       manufactured-home owners the same protections as traditional       home owners. The last housing crisis showed that exorbitant       loan pricing was a particular area of abuse. Congress and the       CFPB decided to protect homeowners from these practices, but       the current language in H.R. 3354 would repeal these       protections for the buyers of manufactured homes.        The severity of this problem has been well-documented by       investigations such as the one conducted by The Seattle Times       and the Center for Public Integrity. In a series of articles       published in 2015, it was reported that ``former dealers said       the company encouraged them to steer buyers to finance with       Clayton's own high-interest lenders.'' The investigation       concluded that industry leader, ``Clayton relies on predatory       sales practices, exorbitant fees, and interest rates that can       exceed 15 percent, trapping many buyers in loans they can't       afford and in homes that are almost impossible to sell or       refinance.''        We support the Ellison Amendment No. 200 to H.R. 3354 in       order to retain the CFPB's efforts to protect manufactured       home buyers from high cost loans. Please feel free to contact       us with any questions.            Sincerely,                                                     Dave Anderson,                                                Executive Director.     I am also very proud of the residents of the Park Plaza,  a  [[Page H7348]]  manufactured home resident-owned community in my district.   They tell me that being steered to high-cost loans makes  homeownership more costly for families. Before Dodd-Frank and the  creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the manufactured  home loan market was notoriously predatory.   For example, a story in The Seattle Times, which I recommend Members  read, tells the story of Kirk and Patricia Ackley, a construction  worker and a Walmart employee in Washington State.   More than a decade ago, they bought a new manufactured home big  enough for their children and room to care for Patricia's dad, who had  dementia. But their dream became a nightmare when the promised 7  percent interest rate was raised to 12.5 percent.   This family faced crisis when this raised their monthly payment from  $700 to $1,100. They had already invested $11,000 to build the concrete  foundation for their new home. They took the loan, but it destroyed  their finances and nearly cost them their marriage. The home was  repossessed.   A 2015 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and The  Seattle Times interviewed more than 280 customers of Clayton Homes. One  person they interviewed was a member of the Navajo Nation. She said she  learned about Clayton on Navajo radio.   The ad recommended that she talk to a specific Navajo-speaking  salesperson at a lot outside of the reservation. He told her that  Vanderbilt Mortgage was the only source of finance for homes on the  reservation. He didn't tell her the truth and overcharged her.   Now it is illegal for a salesperson to steer buyers to high-cost  loans because of new rules from the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. But section 915 of the bill weakens those protections. Loans  with high interest rates can be especially devastating to buyers of  mobile homes since houses often depreciate quickly.   A buyer with a high rate will still owe a large sum for many years on  a home that can be almost impossible to sell or finance. That is  because the value of the home can fall below the loan balance.   Opponents of my amendment say that they want to help manufactured  home buyers. That is a good thing. Yet none of them have cosponsored  H.R. 515, which would provide low-cost loans to owners of outdated  mobile homes so they can buy ENERGY STAR homes, which would reduce  their bills and save energy. None of them have joined me to cosponsor  the Frank Adelmann Manufactured Housing Community Sustainability Act,  which helps residents of mobile home communities form a cooperative and  buy the land that they live on. Or what about H.R. 3583 that gives  manufactured homeowners located in communities the same tax benefits as  those who own their own land?   I have introduced these bills to try to help people who live in  manufactured homes. We do and must stand with them because this is an  affordable, and sometimes quality, housing option for people, and yet  manufactured homeowners support my bills.   Right here we have the National Manufactured Home Owners Association,  which has said very clearly that my amendment is a good one.   There is a way to help manufactured homeowners that does not involve  overcharging them. There is a way forward to help owners of  manufactured housing without helping Clayton Homes and its affiliates  make more money off of them.   And let's be clear, nearly no other lender benefits to this change to  section 915. Ninety-one percent of the high-cost loans come from  lenders owned by Clayton. The industry's second largest mobile home  lender, Wells Fargo, didn't have a single loan in the high-rate pool in  The Seattle Times study.   Protect manufactured home buyers. Support my amendment No. 200.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 201 Offered by Mr. Ellison    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 201  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 598, strike line 12 and all that follows through page       599, line 2.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is to preserve the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau's authority to regulate small-dollar loans.   Sometimes people need access to more money quickly. We know that.  Your car breaks down, your refrigerator dies, or your kid breaks a leg  at a soccer game and you get hit with an unexpected health bill. Life  happens sometimes, not on a plan. We get that.   Unfortunately, too many people--about half of families--do not have  the adequate savings for the cushion. Right now, Mr. Chairman, about 63  percent of all Americans report that they do not know what they would  do if hit with an unexpected $500 bill.   If they take out a payday loan or a title loan, they can fall into a  cycle of debt, and many people do. Instead of getting one $500 loan,  most people get a repeat loan of 6 to 10, on average, paying additional  fees each time, at 400 percent interest. So a $500 loan could cost  thousands of dollars.   More than 80 percent of the payday industry's revenues are generated  by repeat borrowers, not one-and-done, Mr. Chairman.   That is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau prioritized  improving the small-dollar loan market. Unfortunately, language in this  bill would stop the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from moving  forward to rein in abuses in the payday loans, auto title loans, and  other similar debt traps.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has documented through  extensive study how payday lending traps borrowers in a cycle of debt:  one in three auto title loans in default, one in five borrowers using  auto title loans have their cars repossessed. That is 20 percent.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is close to releasing  guidance to improve this market. Its efforts are supported by a broad  network of civil rights and consumer advocates, as well as faith-based  leaders opposing predatory lending.   I am really proud of Exodus Lending in my district. The Minneapolis  Lutheran congregation recognized that too many of their congregants  were stuck in debt traps. Their parishioners had jobs. They had bank  accounts. But when they took out small-dollar loans, it gave lenders  access to their bank accounts, which stripped out a third of their  paycheck every 2 weeks. Instead of one loan, they ended up getting ten  because they could not repay the first loan.   So the Lutherans, working with Sunrise Banks, established an  alternative. They made more than 100 loans to people stuck in debt  traps. Other communities are creating small-dollar lending alternatives  through employer assistance programs with for-profit partners.   My amendment would simply allow the CFPB to finalize its rulemaking  so cool ideas like these, to help people out of debt, could go forward.  We need strong Federal standards so people can have access to small  loans on a quick basis without falling prey to debt traps.   Research from the Center for Responsible Lending shows that payday  lending drains $3.4 billion a year nationally from consumers' pockets-- money that is no longer available to help pay for medicine, new tires,  or any kind of emergency.   The CFPB is very close to putting forth a better way to get private  sector lenders involved. We could have a $300 loan with $60 fees that  someone can repay.   Let's allow the CFPB to move forward to better small-dollar loans.  Please support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let's be clear, to get a payday loan, you  have to have a bank account and a job. We are not talking about the  unbanked. We are talking about people who run into a short-term  financial crisis, they go to a payday lender, but the amount of the  fees are so high that they have to borrow money to pay the money back,  and they end up getting in a cycle of 6 to 10 loans that they have to  continue to take out, which drains money from their finances. They lose  bank accounts because of payday loans.   We are saying: Let the CFPB allow the regulatory process, the  rulemaking process, to go forward. Let's not chop it off, let's not  stop it, and let's see what we can find out. People in my district have  come up with some pretty innovative ways to go around the high-cost,  high-APR payday lending scam.   But if we just say, No, we are just going to take authority away from  the CFPB, what we are really doing is subjecting Americans to the  payday loan industry. Now, I don't want to take support from those  guys, so I am happy to stand up here and say: Vote for my amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Minnesota has  expired.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota  will be postponed.
