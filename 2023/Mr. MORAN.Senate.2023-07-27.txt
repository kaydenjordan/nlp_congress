 Mr. President, this weekend, in the town of  Nicodemus in western Kansas, folks from all over will gather to  celebrate and commemorate the history of this town. This year they will  celebrate the 145th Homecoming Emancipation Celebration.   Nicodemus holds a unique place in American history. In 1877, newly  freed slaves migrated West determined to create a community where  freedom and equality could flourish. Out of the resolve of those early  settlers emerged Nicodemus. Nicodemus was the first Black community  west of the Mississippi River and is the only predominantly Black  community west of the Mississippi that remains a living community  today. Far from other towns or the railroad, life in Nicodemus wasn't  easy, but the early settlers were determined to build a life for  themselves--farms, homes, and a community that was their own.   The Homecoming Emancipation Celebration serves as a poignant reminder  of the significance of the Emancipation Proclamation, a proclamation  that shattered the shackles of slavery and ignited the spark of hope  and liberty across the Nation. Throughout the years, the Homecoming  Emancipation Celebration has been a time of reflection, remembrance,  and unity. Families gather to pay homage to their ancestors and cherish  the sacrifices made by those who sought a new life and new  opportunities.   The celebration this weekend is a time for grandparents to pass down  stories and memories to the younger generations, ensuring that the  legacy of Nicodemus lives on in the hearts and minds of all. I hope  that this celebration is a chance to remember the history of Nicodemus  and celebrate the men and women who bravely made the journey west to  find a place of their own.   I hope anyone passing through western Kansas will take time to visit  Nicodemus to learn the history of this brave little town on the plains  of Kansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to  pay tribute to the Stockton Lions Club and recognize their  contributions to the community. This organization has been a part of  the community since the 1950s, and its presence will be missed.   Lions Club International is the world's largest service organization,  with more than 1.42 million members and 47,000 clubs in over 200  countries. In Kansas, 216 clubs serve various community needs. The  international focus of the Lions Club is helping the visually impaired  or blind. This cause came from Helen Keller at the International  Convention at Cedar Point, OH, in June of 1925. She challenged the  Lions to be the ``Knights of the Blind.'' From holding eyeglass drop- offs in the community, to paying for eye appointments and glasses, the  Stockton Lions Club answered this challenge.  [[Page S3749]]    As a member of the Kansas Lions Club for almost 40 years, I have  witnessed the hard work and dedication these members put forward to  serve others. At its core, the Lions Club's mission is to empower  communities through acts of service, and it has touched countless  lives. Their willingness to devote their time, talents, and treasure to  helping others is inspiring. Over the years, I have enjoyed attending  Lions Clubs meetings in Stockton to visit with folks about the issues  important to them. I will miss attending the Stockton Lions Club but  want to take time to remember this community organization. The  dedicated members of the club demonstrated that, together, they could  make a difference in their community.   Whether by sponsoring the annual Free Watermelon Feed during the  Rooks County Fair or taking students to the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson,  the Stockton Lions Club made an incredible impact. Thank you to the  Stockton Lions Club members for bettering Kansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 40th  anniversary of the creation of Watco Companies. Watco is a Pittsburg,  KS, based transportation and logistics company that demonstrates the  very best of Kansas work ethic.   Following the deregulation of the railroad industry in October 1980,  founder Dick Webb saw a niche available to serve customers in the rail  industry. With no line of credit, Dick moved his family to Louisiana,  purchased a locomotive, and began an industrial railcar switching  operation. The first customer in Louisiana was Boise Cascade, a paper  manufacturer, which is still a Watco customer today.   A company that started with only one locomotive in 1983 has now grown  to nearly 5,000 employees across North America and Australia and is  known for its world-class management of short-line railroads, ports,  and dependable transportation and supply-chain services. Dick Webb laid  the foundation for the growth Watco has experienced today. He set the  core values of the company--humility, integrity, and respect for the  customer--which has translated in Newsweek magazine naming Watco as one  of the top 100 most loved places to work in the U.S. in 2022 and  worldwide in 2023.   Dedication to serving the customers' needs drives Watco's business  model and, over the years, has contributed to Watco's expansion. In  Kansas, there are more than 2,000 miles of short-line rail alone, and  for the last 40 years, Watco has been an integral mover of Kansas  agricultural commodities such as grain and feed products, industrial  products such as chemicals and liquid petroleum gasses, cement, coal,  steel, and plastics.   Kansas providers rely on rail transportation to move their products  to markets across the region. Without efficient and varied  transportation options, a versatility innate to Watco, producers are at  a significant disadvantage. Last June, a $375 million soybean crushing  facility opened in Cherryvale, KS, and the South Kansas & Oklahoma  Railroad, owned and operated by Watco, provides services to the  facility, connecting it to the class 1 rail network.   I have been proud to support Watco in their applications to the  Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement--CRISI--Grant  Program, not only because of their contributions to Kansas businesses,  but also the larger impact to the Pittsburg community. Watco and the  Webb family have made it a point to give back to local schools and  universities, utilizing their platform to contribute graciously to the  community in numerous philanthropic ways.   Companies like Watco exhibit the excellence of the Kansas workforce  and a commitment to delivering quality service to their customers. I  want to congratulate Watco on 40 years of excellence and reliability  and look forward to 40 more years of delivering on their  promises.                            ____________________
