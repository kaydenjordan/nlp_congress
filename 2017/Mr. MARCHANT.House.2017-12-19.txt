 Mr. Speaker, today, we are keeping our promise to the  American people and sending comprehensive tax reform to the President's  desk for the first time in 31 years.   Lowering the tax rates for middle-income families and providing a tax  cut for every income level in 2018 is a very historic Christmas present  delivered to my constituents in north Texas.   This year, our country has--after many long years of low growth-- begun to experience the level of growth and economy that it needs. This  tax cut bill will assure Americans years of sustained high growth and  new jobs.   Mr. Speaker, job creators and investors know that the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act will create lasting economic growth and a booming economy for  everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill and  deliver tax relief to the American people.
