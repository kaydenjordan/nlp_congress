 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3298, which allows  United States Capitol Police officers who have sustained serious  injuries in the line of duty to receive payments from the United States  Capitol Police Memorial Fund.   The bill is just one of the ways that we, as an institution, can  recognize the swift and heroic actions taken by the Capitol Police  officers who put their lives on the line each and every day to protect  the United States Capitol not just for the Members of Congress, but for  all of the staff and all of the many visitors from across our country  and around the world.   Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured during the  June 14 shooting, including Officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner,  and we wish them a speedy recovery.                                General Leave
