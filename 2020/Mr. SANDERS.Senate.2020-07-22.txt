 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1788, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his support of  our amendment, for his beautiful words on John Lewis, and for his  insistence that this Senate makes sure that every American has the  right to vote. That is not asking too much, and that is a bill we  should deal with.   Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment I have  filed for the National Defense Authorization Act to cut the bloated  $740 billion Pentagon budget by 10 percent and use that $74 billion in  savings to invest in human needs here at home.   This amendment is being cosponsored by Senators Markey, Warren,  Merkley, Wyden, and Senator Leahy and will receive a rollcall at 12:10  p.m.   This amendment has been endorsed by more than 60 organizations  representing millions of working people, environmentalists, and  religious leaders, including Public Citizen, the Union of Concerned  Scientists, and Physicians for Social Responsibility.   In America today, we are experiencing an extraordinary set of crises  unprecedented in the history of the United States of America. We are in  the midst of a public health crisis that is worse than at any time  since the Spanish flu of 1918. Over the past 4 months, the coronavirus  has infected more than 3.7 million Americans and caused nearly 140,000  deaths.   We are in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great  Depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 119 million Americans have  seen a decline in their income--unbelievable. One hundred and nineteen  million Americans have seen a decline in their income, 50 million have  filed for unemployment, and American households have lost over $6  trillion in wealth.   All over this country--in the State of Vermont and in every other  State in America--people are going hungry in America. People are going  hungry. And many, many people are frightened to death that they will  soon be evicted from their apartments or will lose their homes to  foreclosure.   That is where the American people are today: loss of jobs, loss of  income, hunger, eviction.   On the other hand, there is another reality going on in America  today. We don't talk about it much, but we should, and that is that 600  billionaires in our country have seen their wealth go up by $700  billion during the pandemic. So we entered this pandemic with massive  income and wealth inequality since the pandemic, and the very rich have  become even richer, while working people have seen a significant  decline in their income and wealth.   The current crisis, or series of crises, have revealed the  extraordinary inequities in our economy. If people didn't know it  before, they surely know it now.   In the United States today, over half of our workers live paycheck to  paycheck. Not surprisingly, when you live paycheck to paycheck, and the  paycheck stops coming in, you are in financial distress. That means  that your economic situation goes from poverty, which is low wages, to  desperation, which is no income coming in at all. That means that you  go hungry. It means that you may become homeless. It means that when  you get sick, you no longer have health insurance or the income to see  a doctor.   What the pandemic has taught us is that a relatively low unemployment  rate, which is what we had before the pandemic, does not adequately  guarantee for the security and well-being of working families.   When tens of millions of our people earn starvation wages, that is  not a good economy. When 40 percent of our people do not have the  savings to pay for a $400 emergency, that is not what I would call a  good economy. When over half a million Americans are homeless and 18  million families spend at least half of their incomes on housing, that  is not a good economy. When 87 million people are uninsured or  underinsured, that is not a good economy. In other words, to create a  good economy, we are going to have to do a whole lot better than that.   Further, over the last few months, hundreds of thousands of Americans  have taken to the streets to demand justice for the murders of George  Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, and Ahmaud Arbery, among many  others, and to end the rampant police brutality that we see in America  today. These tragic killings of unarmed African Americans have  highlighted the urgent need to rethink the nature of policing and to  fix a broken and racist criminal justice system.   On top of all of that--on top of a pandemic, on top of an economic  collapse, on top of systemic racism--we have to address the existential  threat facing this planet of climate change.   A few weeks ago, temperatures in Siberia--the coldest region on  Earth--topped 100 degrees, shattering records. If we do not get our act  together and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into  renewable energy, we will be leaving this planet increasingly unhealthy  and uninhabitable for our kids and future generations   That is where we are today: hunger, homelessness, racism, a warming  and dangerously warming climate. These are the issues that we have to  focus on. Our attention must be on improving the lives of ordinary  Americans--working people, lower income people--and doing what we can  to work with countries around the world to help the billions of people  living in economic distress.   With that, I rise today to make it abundantly clear that if we are  going to address those issues, if we are going to protect the working  families of this country who are now under so much stress, it is  absolutely imperative that we change our national priorities.   The status quo and conventional wisdom that we see on TV every day  and that we hear on the floor of the Senate is no longer good enough.  History has overtaken us. Unprecedented crises have overtaken us. The  status quo is not good enough. We must respond.   We must finally have the courage to stand up to powerful special  interests and all of their campaign money and understand that we cannot  allow these people to continue to have so much power over the economic  and political life of this country; that we must start developing  policies that work for working families, not just the rich, not just  the powerful, and not just those who contribute to super PACs.   Fifty-three years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged our  country to fight against three major evils: ``The evil of racism, the  evil of poverty, and the evil of war.'' That was what Dr. King said 53  years ago. And if there were ever a moment in American history when we  need to respond to Dr. King's clarion call for justice and demand, as  he stated, ``a radical revolution of values,'' now is that time. This  is the moment for us to bring about what Dr. King called ``a radical  revolution of values,'' whether it is fighting against systemic racism  and police brutality, whether it is transforming our energy system away  from fossil fuel, whether it is ending a cruel and dysfunctional  healthcare system, or addressing the grotesque level of income and  wealth inequality in our country, now is the time for change, real  change.   In my view, given all of the unprecedented crises our country faces,  now is not the time to increase the Pentagon's bloated $740 billion  budget, which is 53 percent of all discretionary spending in America.  Let me repeat that. The military budget alone is 53 percent of all  discretionary spending in this country.   At a time when 28 million Americans are in danger of being evicted  from their homes, now is not the time to be spending more on the  military than the next 11 nations combined.   At a time when 30 million Americans have lost their jobs, now is not  the time to be spending more on national defense than we did at the  height--the height--of the Cold War or the wars in  [[Page S4373]]  Korea or Vietnam. Let me repeat: spending more in real, inflation- accounted-for dollars today on the military than we did during the Cold  War or the wars in Korea or Vietnam.   At this unprecedented moment in our history, now is the time to  provide jobs, education, healthcare, and housing in American  communities that have been ravaged by the global pandemic, by extreme  poverty, by deindustrialization, and mass incarceration.   If this horrific pandemic we are now experiencing has taught us  anything, it is that national security means a lot more than building  bombs, missiles, jet fighters, submarines, nuclear warheads, and other  weapons of mass destruction. National security also means doing  everything we can to improve the lives of our people, many of whom have  been abandoned by our government decade after decade.   The amendment that I am offering today would cut the $740 billion  budget--Pentagon budget--by 10 percent and use that $74 billion in  savings to invest in distressed communities in every State in this  country, communities that have been ravaged by poverty, mass  incarceration, and other enormous problems.   Under this amendment, distressed cities and towns would be able to  use this $74 billion to create jobs by building affordable housing, new  schools, childcare facilities, community health centers, public  hospitals, libraries, sustainable energy projects, and clean drinking  water facilities. These communities would also receive Federal funding  to hire more public school teachers, provide nutritious meals to  children, and offer free tuition at public colleges, universities, and  trade schools.   Over and over again, our Republican friends--my colleagues here--have  told us we cannot possibly afford to address the enormous problems  facing working families: We just can't afford it. We don't have the  money to deal with homelessness and hunger and inadequate education.   That is what they say every day. We have been told that we cannot  afford to make public colleges and universities tuition-free or to  provide a decent income for every man, woman, and child. But when it  comes to spending $740 billion on the military, well, suddenly, hey,  money is no problem; we can spend as much as we want. Hey, let's listen  to all of the lobbyists from the military-industrial complex who flood  Capitol Hill and tell us all their needs. We have to listen to them,  but we don't listen to the children in this country who may not have  enough food to eat or the workers in this country who are sleeping out  in their cars. We don't listen to them, but when it comes to the  military, hey, no end to the money that we can provide.   To my mind, that is unacceptable. We don't need more nuclear weapons.  We don't need more cruise missiles. We don't need more fighter jets.  What we do need in this country, desperately, is more healthcare, more  housing, more childcare, and better schools.   Now is the time to fundamentally change our national priorities, and  that is what this amendment is all about. This amendment in itself is  not going to do anywhere near what we need to do as a country, but it  is an important step forward in changing the way we think about our  needs.   Let me be clear. If we were to institute a 10-percent cut in military  spending, that $74 billion could provide high-quality childcare to  every family in America. Imagine that. We could solve the childcare  crisis in America just by cutting the military budget by 10 percent.   We could, by cutting the military budget by 10 percent, provide  section 8 housing vouchers to all of the 7.7 million families in  America who are paying more than half of their limited incomes on rent.   A 10-percent cut to the Pentagon could provide a free college  education for 2 million low-income students.   A 10-percent cut to the Pentagon is enough to hire 900,000 teachers  in the poorest schools in America.   So I am a little bit tired about hearing that we don't have enough  money for nuclear weapons, that we need more money for missiles and  tanks and guns--that we need more for all of that, yet we are turning  our backs on Americans who are hurting the most.   I believe this is a moment in history when it would be a very good  idea for all of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, to remember  what former Republican--Republican--President Dwight D. Eisenhower said  in 1953. I think we all recall that Eisenhower knew something about  military budgets and the war because he was the four-star general who  led the Allied forces to victory in Europe during World War II. He was  not a passivist. He was not an anti-war activist. He was a four-star  general.   Dwight D. Eisenhower said:         Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every       rocket signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who       hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not       clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It       is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its       scientists, the hopes of its children.    Right now, when the world is searching for treatment of the  coronavirus, when we are searching desperately and spending billions  looking for a vaccine, maybe it might be a good idea to be educating  our young people to figure out how we deal with disease--with cancer  and schizophrenia and Alzheimer's and diabetes--rather than putting  more and more scientists into figuring out how we can blow the world up  a dozen times over.    What Eisenhower said was true--profoundly true--67 years ago, and it  is true today, maybe even truer today.   When we analyze the Defense Department budget, it is interesting to  note that the Congress has appropriated so much money for the Defense  Department that the Pentagon literally does not know what to do with  it. Between 2013 and 2018, they actually returned more than $80 billion  in funding back to the Treasury. They had more money than they could  spend.   In my view, the time is long overdue for us to take a hard look not  only at the size of the Pentagon budget but at the enormous amount of  waste, cost overruns, fraud, and at the financial mismanagement that  has plagued the Department of Defense for decades.   Let's be clear. We don't talk about it, but let's be clear. About  half of the Pentagon's budget goes directly into the hands of private  contractors, not our troops. Over the past two decades, virtually every  major defense contractor in the United States has paid billions of  dollars in fines and settlements for misconduct and fraud, all while  making huge profits on those government contracts. Virtually every  major defense contractor has been found guilty of misconduct or fraud.   Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United Technologies have  paid over $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or  misconduct. Further, I find it interesting that the very same defense  contractors that have been found guilty or reached settlements for  fraud are also paying their CEOs excessive--excessive--compensation  packages. Last year, the CEOs of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman  both made over $20 million in total compensation, while around 90  percent of these companies' revenue came from defense contracts. In  other words, for all intents and purposes, these companies are  basically government agencies. Ninety percent of the revenue coming in  comes from the taxpayers of this country. Meanwhile, the CEOs of those  companies make over 100 times more than the Secretary of Defense makes.  It is not too surprising, therefore, that we have a revolving door  where our military people end up on the boards of directors of these  major defense companies.   Moreover, as the GAO has told us, there are massive cost overruns in  the Defense Department's acquisition budget that we continue to ignore  year after year. According to the GAO, the Pentagon's $1.8 trillion  acquisition portfolio currently suffers from more than $628 billion in  cost overruns, with much of the cost growth taking place after  production.   A major reason why there is so much waste, fraud, and abuse at the  Pentagon is the fact that the Defense Department remains the only  Federal agency in America that has not been able to pass an independent  audit. Many of us will recall what then-Secretary of Defense Donald  Rumsfeld--George W. Bush's Secretary of Defense--told the American  people on the day before 9/11. It never got a lot of attention--the day  before 9/11. Rumsfeld said:   [[Page S4374]]              Our financial systems are decades old. According to some       estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.    I don't know that the situation has changed very much since 2001 and  Rumsfeld's remarks. Yet, nearly 20 years after Rumsfeld's statements,  the Defense Department has still not passed a clean audit, despite the  fact that the Pentagon controls assets in excess of $2.2 trillion or  roughly 70 percent of what the entire Federal Government owns.   I believe in a strong military, but we cannot keep giving more money  to the Pentagon than it needs when millions of children in this country  face hunger every day and 140 million Americans cannot afford the basic  necessities of life without going into debt.   In 1967 Dr. King warned us that ``a nation that continues year after  year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social  uplift is approaching spiritual death.'' I believe the time is long  overdue for us to listen to Dr. King.   At a time when, in the richest country in the history of the world,  so many of our people are struggling, now is the time to change our  priorities because, as Dr. King stated, we are approaching spiritual  death.   At a time when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of  almost any major country on Earth, at a time when 60,000 Americans die  each year because they can't get to a doctor on time and 1 out of 5  Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe,  we need to start focusing on those people, not on the military- industrial complex.   At this moment of unprecedented national crisis--a pandemic, an  economic meltdown, the demand to end systemic racism, and an unstable  President--it is time for us to truly focus on what we value as a  society and to fundamentally transform our national priorities. Cutting  the military budget by 10 percent and investing that money in human  needs is a modest way to begin that process.   Let me conclude by once again quoting Dwight D. Eisenhower. I don't  know that I have ever quoted a Republican quite as much as I have  during these remarks, but he is somebody whom I respected very much.   This is what Eisenhower said when he left office. This was back in  1961. He was out, and John F. Kennedy was coming in. This is what he  said. I hope we can all remember this. He said:         In the councils of government, we must guard against the       acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or       unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential       for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will       persist.    Eisenhower was right then, and, if anything, the situation is worse  today. Now is the time for us to stand up to the greed and  irresponsibility of the military industrial complex. Now is the time to  address the needs of working families, the elderly, the children, the  sick, and the poor.   Let us vote for the Sanders-Markey-Warren-Merkley-Wyden-Leahy  amendment to cut the Pentagon budget by 10 percent and invest in human  needs here at home.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
