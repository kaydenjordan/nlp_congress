 Mr. President, the State of Idaho has had a long history  with Chinese immigration to both our cities and the wilderness areas of  Idaho. Today, I am pleased to honor Polly Bemis, the United States'  most famous Chinese pioneer woman.   There have been many articles, books and even a full-length feature  movie about Polly and her pioneering life in the mountains of Idaho.  Born in China in 1853, she was sold by her parents and smuggled into  the United States. In 1872, Polly was brought to recently settled  Warren, ID, as a slave. There, she met Charlie Bemis, a saloon owner  and deputy sheriff, whom she wed in 1894 despite a State law  prohibiting marriage between a White and non-White person.   Soon after Polly and Charlie wed, they moved to their homestead, the  Bemis Ranch on the Salmon River, where they resided for many years.  Polly was famed for her vast knowledge of medical treatments and her  hospitality to friends and travelers alike venturing down the Salmon  ``River of No Return.'' Charlie died in 1922; however, Polly continued  to live on her 27-acre ranch until shortly before her death in 1933 at  the age of 80. Fifty-five years after her passing, Polly's cabin on  Bemis Ranch was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.   As an early settler of the Idaho Territory and an enterprising  Chinese immigrant, Polly Bemis left an exceptional legacy and an  indelible mark on Idaho's history. While she did not receive U.S.  citizenship during her lifetime, we honor her strength,  industriousness, and pioneering spirit in our Congressional Record.                            ____________________
