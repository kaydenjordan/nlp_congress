 Mr. Speaker, I wish we were here talking about clean  water. We can all agree, as we did back in 1974 when we passed the  Clean Water Act and we gave the government all it needed to deliver  clean water to America, the rivers no longer burn. Trains do fall in  rivers, but that is a jurisdictional river. That is not what we are  talking about today.   What we are talking about today is how much dry land, how much  farmland, and how much rolling hills and grassy fields with no frogs,  no fish, and no water most of the year are going to be regulated by  this administration.   Back when we passed the Clean Water Act, it was bipartisan.  Republicans and Democrats got together, and we gave the government  jurisdiction to protect our clean drinking water. Our harbors, our  rivers, and our streams are protected. Our lakes are protected. Our  drinking water is protected. Nothing here today will have any impact on  whether we have safe drinking water or not.   As a farmer, I was prosecuted under the Clean Water Act for planting  wheat in a wheat field that had been planted  [[Page H1786]]  to wheat with the same practices many times before. What we are talking  about here today is expanding the authorities of the Clean Water Act to  regulate almost every activity--construction, farm production, energy  exploration--that can happen on open fields that might from one time or  another pocket a little bit of water.   When I went through delineation on my property, it took 2 years just  to get enough rain to be able to tell where the wetlands were under the  previous clean water rule.   So let's not pretend this is about clean water. This is about  government control of land, it is about affordable food, and it is  about affordable housing. It is about use of our lands by private  landowners for economic purposes.   What we are doing today here is telling the President that he didn't  have authority to do this back in 1974, and he doesn't have authority  to do it today.
