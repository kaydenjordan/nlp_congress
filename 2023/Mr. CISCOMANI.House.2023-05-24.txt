 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Skin Cancer Awareness  Month to raise awareness of the most common and often avoidable form of  cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer. Nationwide, 3.3 million cases are  reported annually, including over 13,000 in Pima County alone.   Sun exposure on unprotected skin is the primary cause of skin cancer,  and it is a year-round threat. Other risk factors include the use of  tanning equipment, family history, and increasing age.   Typically, this type of cancer is treated with Mohs surgery, but  today I am pleased to note a nonsurgical alternative is available in  Arizona, which means those afraid of surgery can now seek treatment.   I congratulated Tucson dermatologist Marc Epstein for being the first  in southern Arizona to provide this new standard of care. This method  avoids all potential complications of surgery, using a low-level x-ray  precisely targeted through the use of ultrasound imaging, with a rate  of cure of over 99 percent.   Given that most States now offer this nonsurgical treatment, and more  than 50,000 patients have been treated successfully with it, no one  should avoid timely treatment for this common skin cancer.   This month and always, I hope all Arizonans will take the simple skin  care precautions necessary to prevent skin cancer.                       Protecting Unaccompanied Minors     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shine light on yet  another tragedy unfolding at our southern border.   We have all seen the surge of border crossings, fentanyl trafficking,  and migrant deaths brought about by President Biden's mishandling of  the border.   Recently, The New York Times investigated the treatment of migrant  children by the Department of Health and Human Services. They found  that the Department had lost contact with over 85,000 migrant children  after placement with sponsors.   What is even worse, hundreds of these children have been found in  work environments that defy child labor laws, some working 12-hour days  in hazardous conditions.  [[Page H2554]]    In an effort to rush migrants out of government custody, HHS' lack of  vetting has put vulnerable children directly in harm's way.   As an immigrant myself, and especially as a father, it is  heartbreaking to imagine the neglect that these innocent children have  endured, first as a casualty of the border crisis and now by the  agencies tasked with rescuing them. It is a national tragedy and an  embarrassment to allow this exploitation to continue.   I am proud to be a first-generation American who has benefited from  the freedoms and opportunities of this country. This is not the best  that America has to offer. What is happening at the border is not part  of the American Dream my family pursued and thousands of other families  continue to pursue.   We have seen babies abandoned in rivers, migrants dying in deserts,  and high-speed car chases through our neighborhoods.   Last month, I led 75 of my colleagues in a letter to Biden  administration officials demanding accountability for this terrible  neglect. We carried out our constitutional duty of oversight and set a  deadline for Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Becerra to provide  transparency. The deadline was 12 days ago. With the Biden  administration refusing to take action to prevent another surge at the  border, it is hard to see what exactly these officials are preoccupied  with.   This must be a top priority. Focusing on border security isn't just  about keeping Americans safe, it is about stopping an ongoing  humanitarian crisis.   As we speak, lives are being put at risk, migrants are being  exploited, and the only people winning are the cartels leveraging this  administration's weak border policy.   I urge President Biden and his Cabinet to accept accountability for  this disaster and implement the border security measures our country  desperately needs. There is no time to waste.                            ____________________
