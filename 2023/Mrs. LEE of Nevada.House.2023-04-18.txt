 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  2023 graduating class of the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Touro  University Nevada.   This week is National Osteopathic Medicine Week, and I cannot think  of a better way to celebrate than by highlighting the incredible  success of our future doctors of osteopathic medicine.   Not only did these graduates achieve a 100 percent residency match  rate, but I am also proud to say that 50 of them will be staying in  Nevada where they will help fill critical healthcare needs in our State  by helping combat our dire shortage of physicians.   Nevada ranks 48th in the Nation in doctors per capita. These future  healthcare providers will fill in the gaps across our healthcare system  from family medicine and pediatrics to emergency medicine, neurology,  and psychiatry.   Too many Nevadans in rural and underserved communities do not have  access to specialists in their area, which significantly restricts  their ability to access healthcare services.   I am so proud that these doctors will be filling those critical  needs, and I congratulate Touro University.      Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Nevada Air National Guard     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  Nevada Air National Guard for their 75 years of service to Nevada and  the entire country.   In that time, our servicemembers have supported national security,  combat operations, and humanitarian efforts across the globe.   The Nevada Air National Guard began as a small fighter squadron  comprised of World War II-era P-51 Mustangs. Its units have since  evolved: flying in the Korean war, aerial reconnaissance throughout the  Cold War, and numerous deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq.   Here at home, the Nevada Air National Guard has also carried out  significant humanitarian operations such as Operation Haylift, a daring  supply drop to farmers and miners trapped by winter storms in 1948.   Today, the Nevada Air National Guard is perhaps best known for its  continued use of our military's workhorse, the C-130, which, among  other impressive capabilities, has been routinely deployed for  firefighting operations with the U.S. Forest Service.   In 2021 alone, the Nevada Air National Guard made 331 flights,  dropping more than 8 million pounds of fire retardant to help contain  wildfires, preserve our public lands, and save lives.   Looking ahead, I look forward to working with the Nevada Air National  Guard on their priorities, including a well-deserved upgrade to their  fleet of C-130s, as they take on an even better 75 years ahead.   From Carson City to Reno and the 232nd Combat Training Squadron at  Nellis Air Force Base, I again thank everyone who has made Nevada Air  National Guard strong for the past 75 years. Our State and country are  safer because of it.                             Restricting Abortion     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  frightening recent developments concerning the personal freedoms of  millions of Americans.   A single judge in Texas has dramatically restricted decades-long  access to safe and effective abortion medication in all 50 States.   Anti-choice extremists have made it clear that this is not the end.  They did not stop at overturning Roe v. Wade. They will not stop at  preventing women from accessing FDA-approved medications like  mifepristone.   They have made it clear about their intention to restrict control and  ban a woman's right to choose with Federal legislation. From the courts  to Congress, a woman's right to choose is under attack. We will not be  intimidated, and I am doing everything in my power to stop this.   My home State of Nevada, where voters decided by a 2-to-1 margin in  1990 to protect a woman's right to choose and just last fall voted to  reject the extremist politicians leading this crusade to ban abortion  nationwide, has made it clear where it stands.   I have made it clear that I am here to represent my district and my  State.   Last week, I joined hundreds of my pro-choice colleagues in signing  on to an amicus brief that has been filed with the Supreme Court,  asking the Court to reverse the Texas judge's radical decision.   I am not giving up and neither should you. I support choice. The  majority of Nevadans support choice. The majority of Americans support  choice.   It is time for Congress and the courts to do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, during rollcall Vote number 187 on  H.J. Res. 27, my vote was recorded as a ``yea'' when I intended for it  to be a ``nay.'' Let the record reflect that I oppose H.J. Res. 27.                             personal explanation
