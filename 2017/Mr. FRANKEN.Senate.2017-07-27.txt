 Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Franken moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate within 3 days with changes that are within       the jurisdiction of such Committee to strike provisions that       would repeal the medical loss ratio and allow insurers to       spend less of their revenue from premiums on providing high       quality medical care and more on corporate profits and       administrative overhead.
