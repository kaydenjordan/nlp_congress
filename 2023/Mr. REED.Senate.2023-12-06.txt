 Thank you, Senator Murray.   Mr. President?    I would like to be recognized and reserve the right to  object.    Mr. President, just a few minutes ago, my Republican  colleagues voted down the National Security and Border Act. In doing  so, they essentially said no to supporting Israel, no to supporting  Ukraine, no to supporting Taiwan, no to humanitarian assistance, which  is absolutely critical, no to rebuilding our defense industrial base,  no to border security funding, and no to combating fentanyl.   These items are not the partisan demands of any one party; they are  bipartisan priorities and necessities. They are the fulfillment of our  commitments to our allies and to our national security.   I believe the majority of our Republican colleagues do believe this,  but some may see this as leverage--as one of my colleagues put it in a  discussion, leverage for extreme immigration legislation that they  don't at the moment have the votes to pass.   In delaying the much needed assistance that I indicated, my  Republican colleagues are indirectly, directly, or however you want to  put it, giving too many opportunities or at least ideas to people like  Putin and Chinese communists and others who are engaged in trying to  undermine democracy throughout the world.   Speaking for myself, I hope that what we can do is begin a serious  debate now--not on the one issue that I listed but on all those  issues--and come to a serious, principled compromise so that we can  move forward together.   It seems that my colleagues on the other side simply want us to  accept their version of immigration reform, and then everything else  will be OK. It is not that at all. In fact, one of the aspects of the  legislation that was just voted down was a significant infusion of  resources into the border area--1,300 additional Border Patrol agents,  1,000 law enforcement personnel and investigative capabilities to  prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into the country, 1,600 additional  asylum officers, funding to conduct robust child labor investigations  and enforcement to protect vulnerable migrant children entering the  United States through the southern border, and the bipartisan FEND Off  Fentanyl Act, led by our colleague, Senator Tim Scott of South  Carolina.   My colleagues just voted against a series of important ways to fix  our problems at the border. We need them desperately, and we could have  gotten them if we had moved forward procedurally.   I have been here for a couple of years, and I have seen several  occasions where we have been together on a bipartisan basis. I know in  2013, led by Senator McCain and others, we passed comprehensive  immigration reform, only to see it set aside by the Republican House of  Representatives at the time.   So we, I think, have to do much more, and we can, but it will be on a  bipartisan, cooperative basis. We have to do much more to help not just  Israel--  [[Page S5798]]  it is critical--but also Ukraine. It has been a long time since we have  had their funding request--August of this year. They made a serious  request for additional resources, anticipating the attrition they would  suffer over the intervening months, long before the October 7 tragedy.   It has been more than 2 months since President Zelenskyy was here in  person asking us all personally for the help he needed to lead his  country forward. It was at that time that Senator McConnell correctly  and sincerely indicated, in his words, ``American support for Ukraine  is not charity. It is in our own direct interests, not least because  degrading Russia helps to deter China.'' But the foot-dragging has  continued since then.   Ukraine cannot wait. The OMB Director wrote earlier this week:         [W]ithout congressional action, by the end of the year we       will run out of resources to produce more weapons and       equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from U.S.       military stocks.        There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this       moment. We are out of money--and nearly out of time.    So without our help, the Ukrainian people will be in a very desperate  situation. We need to help them. We need to help our allies in Israel.  We need to help those in Taiwan, and we need to help the innocent  victims of conflict throughout the world.   So this one-shot deal doesn't cut it. We have to come together, work  together, and deliver assistance to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan,  humanitarian aid, and aid for our borders.   With that, I will yield to Senator Klobuchar.
