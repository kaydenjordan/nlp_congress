 Madam Chair, I also rise to support these en bloc  amendments, particularly my amendment to increase and emphasize the  support for research in the Office of Nuclear Energy Light Water  Sustainability Program.   In my district in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, we gave birth to the  civilian nuclear fleet. President Eisenhower launched that plant in  1958, and many other plants have come up around the Nation providing  carbon-free, safe, reliable energy, and many of them have served long  past their useful life.   Tens of thousands of American workers keep these plants running  today. They keep us safe. We have to protect these plants, protect  these jobs, and, most importantly, protect our energy grid. We can do  that with better research into how to make these plants run more  efficiently, more cheaply, and more competitively.
