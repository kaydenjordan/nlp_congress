 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Chu for this  important statement that is necessary for the American people: In God,  We Trust. And the God we trust is a merciful God.   144,000 people dead from COVID-19. It is important when an  administration, no matter who it is, fails the American people, the  United States Congress must be the one that deals with that failure,  and that is what the NO BAN Act stands for. It stands for expanding the  INA's nondiscrimination provision to prohibit discrimination based on  religion and extends the prohibition on discrimination beyond the  issuance of immigrant visas to include the issuance of nonimmigrant  visas, entry, admission to the United States, and the approval or  revocation thereof.   I had an amendment that is added to this that makes it a surety that  the administration report to Congress on the impacts of positive,  negative, and unintended actions by the President. We must have  oversight.   I stand in the name of Ali, a 17-year-old. When I landed from  Washington, I went straight to the terminal immediately on that Friday.  My tears were coming to my eyes as I saw little Ali denied entry into  the United States.   That is why I am here. I support the NO BAN Act.   Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor and senior member of the  Committee on the Judiciary, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support  of H.R. 2214, the ``National Origin-Based AntiDiscrimination For Non- Immigrants Act, or No BAN Act, which stops executive overreach by  preventing the president from abusing his authority to restrict the  entry of non-citizens into the United States under section 212(f) of  the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).   This legislation also repeals several of the President's section  212(f)-based executive actions, including his original Muslim ban as  well as the most recent expansion of the ban announced in January 2020.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because the NO BAN Act  amends section 212(f) of the INA to place checks and balances on the  President's authority to temporarily suspend or restrict the entry of  aliens or classes of aliens into the United States, when it is  determined that such individuals ``would undermine the security or  public safety of the United States or the preservation of human rights,  democratic processes or institutions, or international stability.''   Specifically, the bill requires the President to find and document  that any suspension or restriction: (1) is based on specific and  credible facts; (2) is narrowly tailored; (3) specifies a duration; and  (4) includes waivers.   The NO BAN Act expands the INA's nondiscrimination provision to  prohibit discrimination based on religion and extends the prohibition  on discrimination beyond the issuance of immigrant visas to include the  issuance of nonimmigrant visas, entry and admission into the United  States, and the approval or revocation of any immigration benefit.   The NO BAN Act terminates several of President Trump's proclamations  and executive orders invoking section 212(f) authority, including  Presidential Proclamation 9645, also known as the ``Muslim Ban,'' and  Presidential Proclamation 9983, barring the entry of immigrants from  Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, and Nigeria, and suspending  participation in the Diversity Visa program for nationals of Sudan and  Tanzania.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the NO BAN Act includes an important  amendment I offered during the committee markup of the legislation,  which requires the Administration to report to Congress on the  impacts--positive, negative, and unintended--of any action taken by the  President pursuant to executive orders he has or will issue pursuant to  section 212(f) of the INA.   I strongly support the provision in the legislation that nullifies  the President's latest executive order which adds the countries of  Belarus, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania to  the President's new and offensive Muslim Ban.   As a co-chair of the Congressional Nigerian Caucus, the United States  cannot afford to hamper diplomatic relations with Nigeria due to its  importance in the region.   Nigeria is the largest economy and most populous country in Africa  with an estimated population of more than 190 million, which is  expected to grow to 400 million by 2050 and become the third most  populous country in the world after China and India.   The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, with  U.S. foreign direct investment concentrated largely in the petroleum  and mining and wholesale trade sectors.   At $2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second largest U.S. export  destination in Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States and Nigeria  have a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement.   In 2017, the two-way trade in goods between the United States and  Nigeria totaled over $9 billion.   Due to many of the residents of these countries practicing Islam, the  President's executive order has been appropriately nicknamed the  ``Muslim Ban'', and only exemplifies the xenophobic and prejudiced  mindset that is unacceptable in this country.   With countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, and Eritrea, being  considered as additions to the travel ban list, I strongly oppose this  discriminatory act.   Tanzania is also an important partner of the United States, and  through numerous presidential initiatives, the United States  has provided development and other assistance to Tanzania for capacity  building to address health and education issues, encourage democratic  governance promote broad-based economic growth, and advance regional  and domestic security to sustain progress.    Although Sudan has had some internal issues during the last decade,  the U.S. was a major donor in the March 1989 ``Operation Lifeline  Sudan,'' which delivered 100,000 metric tons of food into both  government and rebel held areas of the Sudan, thus, averting widespread  starvation.   The United States established diplomatic relations with Eritrea in  1993, following its independence and separation from Ethiopia.   The United States supported Eritrea's independence and through a  concerted, mutual effort that began in late 2017 and continues today,  there are vast improvements to the bilateral relationship.   U.S. interests in Eritrea include supporting efforts for greater  integration of Eritrea with  [[Page H3634]]  the rest of the Horn of Africa, encouraging Eritrea to contribute to  regional stability and partner on shared peace and security goals,  urging progress toward a democratic political culture, addressing human  rights issues and promoting economic reform and prosperity.   Although the law contains a waiver program that allows residents of  these countries to enter the country if they meet certain standards,  this program is arbitrary and unfairly creates a separation of  families, provides less work opportunities and greatly reduces the  opportunity to apply for visas in the future, unless it is repealed.   A comprehensive and coordinated strategy needs to be developed in  coordination with the United States Congress to ensure that each  country affected by this law may peacefully have its residents enter  the United States and complete visa and asylum applications.   We live in a nation of laws but we also live in a nation that seeks  to establish and maintain diplomatic ties to these important African  nations and imposing a discriminatory and arbitrary ban would adversely  affect foreign relations with a critical continent for decades to come.   Madam Speaker, in light of the crisis presented by current COVID-19  pandemic, the NO BAN Act contains a provision to ensure that the  President can use section 212(f) to protect the United States from the  spread of communicable diseases, including the 2019 coronavirus, by  suspending the entry of a class of individuals if the President  determines their entry would undermine the public safety of the United  States.   However, to remove any perceived ambiguity and avoid the propensity  of this president to abuse delegated authority, the legislation  includes language to clarify that the term ``public safety'' ``includes  efforts necessary to contain a communicable disease of public health  significance.''   Madam Speaker, the NO BAN Act is supported by a bipartisan coalition  of the nation's leading immigrants' rights organizations, faith-based  organizations, and civil rights organizations, including the following:   American Civil Liberties Union; Church World Service; U.S. Conference  of Catholic Bishops; Muslim Advocates Immigration Hub; Asian Americans  Advancing Justice Association; Americans United for Separation of  Church and State; Bend the Arc; Center for American Progress; The  Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans; Interfaith Immigration  Coalition; Human Rights Campaign; Franciscan Action Network; HIAS;  Jewish and Muslims and Allies Acting Together; Religious Action Center  of Reform Judaism; National Council of Jewish Women; National Iranian  American Organization Action; National Immigration Law Center;  International Refugee Assistance Project; Friends Committee on National  Legislation; Engage Action; and Airbnb.   I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 2214 and send a powerful message  to the President and the American people that this House will not stand  idly by as this Administration tries to abandon America's well-earned  and long-established reputation of being the most welcoming nation on  earth.    Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor and senior  member of the Committee on the Judiciary, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of H.R. 5581, the ``Access to Counsel Act of  2020,'' which ensures that certain individuals who are subjected to  prolonged inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at  ports of entry have a meaningful opportunity to communicate with  counsel and other interested parties.   This important legislation amends section 235 of the Immigration and  Nationality Act (INA) to require the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to ensure that certain individuals can communicate with counsel  and other interested parties if they are subjected to prolonged  inspection by CBP.   The protections afforded by the Access to Counsel Act of 2020 would  apply to individuals who possess valid travel documents, but who are  pulled out of the ``primary'' inspection line and referred to  ``secondary'' inspection for extended processing.   If such individuals are held in secondary inspection for at least one  hour, they must be permitted to communicate with counsel and other  interested parties.   Counsel and interested parties would be able to provide information  and documentation to the inspecting officer to facilitate the  inspection process and offer support and assistance to the individual  subject to inspection.  [[Page H3642]]    Madam Speaker, the stakes can be high for a person wrongfully refused  admission and the consequences of being denied admission to the United  States can be significant.   For example, a U.S. research institution may lose the opportunity to  employ a next generation cancer researcher if that researcher is denied  admission despite possessing a valid nonimmigrant visa.   Individuals who are refused admission may be unable to reunite with  their families, receive critical medical care unavailable in their home  country, or pursue higher education at a U.S. college or university.   Although some individuals may be permitted to withdraw their  application for admission and return home without long term  consequences, others may be ordered removed without a hearing or  further review under ``expedited removal.''   An individual who receives an expedited removal order is barred from  returning to the United States for five years.   Communication protocols are inconsistent across ports of entry and  CBP provides no public guidance on an individual's ability to  communicate with counsel and other individuals during the inspection  process.   According to an American Immigration Council report, CBP policies and  practices on access to counsel vary from one office to another.''   While some ports of entry completely bar counsel in primary or  secondary inspection,'' others provide specific procedures for  interacting with counsel or provide the inspecting officer with broad  discretion to decide whether and with whom to communicate.   Madam Speaker, the Access to Counsel Act of 2020 ensures that no one  is cut off from the world due to the Administration's hasty and  mismanaged rollout of the Muslim ban and the widespread chaos that it  engendered at airports across the nation.   Affected individuals were detained at airports for hours, and many  were sent back to their home countries without the ability to contact  their families or receive the assistance of counsel.   Reports of similar treatment surfaced in January 2020, as tensions  between Iran and the United States escalated and up to 200 individuals  of Iranian descent were detained and questioned in secondary inspection  at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine, Washington.   These individuals--many of whom were U.S. citizens or permanent  residents, including seniors and children--were held for several hours,  with some reportedly held for up to 12 hours.   Madam Speaker, although complications in the inspection process can  arise in response to sweeping changes in immigration policy or shifting  world events, the greatest impact on individuals comes from the  consistent lack of access to counsel and other assistance at ports of  entry on a day-to-day basis.   All individuals--including U.S. citizens--who seek to lawfully enter  the United States are subject to inspection by CBP officers at ports of  entry.   Without access to counsel and other parties, many individuals are  refused admission or issued an expedited removal order instead of being  provided the chance to vindicate their rights and lawfully enter the  country.   The Access to Counsel Act will ensure individuals who are seeking to  lawfully enter the United States are treated fairly and with dignity.   The bill permits counsel and interested parties to appear in person  at the port of entry, but also gives DHS and CBP enough discretion to  determine--based on operational and other practical limitations--how  the consultation takes place.   The bill provides extra protection for lawful permanent residents  (LPRs) by prohibiting DHS from accepting a Record of Abandonment of  Lawful Permanent Resident Status from an LPR without first providing  the LPR a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel.   Madam Speaker, the Access to Counsel Act of 2020 is supported by an  impressive coalition of highly respected organizations, including:  Amnesty International; American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); America's  Voice; American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA); Coalition for  Humane Immigrant Rights; Immigration Hub; and National Iranian American  Council (NIAC).   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 5581, the Access  to Counsel Act of 2020.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager of this legislation  for his leadership.   Let me also acknowledge and thank Mr. Hoyer for his, as well, and to  Mr. Clyburn, Ms. Bass, Mr. Thompson, and, as I indicated, Mr.  Butterfield.   Mr. Speaker, let me start as I did just a few minutes ago, ``In God  we trust,'' and recognize that God has created, in many of our faiths,  all of us equal as humans. We stand together dealing with the  Confederacy that diminished and denied those descendants, those African  slaves, their humanity. And yet, in a place of freedom, this place, we  honor them.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome H.R. 7573 and am glad to be joining as a  staunch supporter, for, if Justice Taney viewed me as inhuman, then  that means that those today, those babies yet unborn from descendants  of enslaved African Americans, would be inhuman. This is needed not  because we don't put it in the historical context, but because we need  to unify America.   Mr. Speaker, as we have lost a great warrior, John Lewis, and, as  well, C. T. Vivian, I know they are looking down to say that we are not  to honor those who voluntarily serve to deny us our humanity and to  fight for the Confederacy and were treasonous.                                time  1515    Alexander Hamilton Stephens--it is interesting that he secured the  name of Alexander Hamilton--has a statue in Statuary Hall. It says:         I am not fearful of anything on Earth, I am not fearful of       anything above, except to do something wrong.    That is what Alexander Hamilton Stephens said.   Well, this is wrong. It was wrong to enslave so many human beings and  for that slavery to last over 200 years.   I am delighted with the gentleman from Illinois for his congenial and  historic moment today, and we do it in unity. I offer peace to this  Nation and to this body that we remove these by bringing America  together.   I know the family of George Floyd, who struck a chord in the hearts  of all Americans and Black Lives Matter, would welcome this magnificent  decision today. Let us do it together, under this flag. In God we  trust.    Mr. Speaker, we are all heartbroken. We all are  speechless. We all are committed to John Robert Lewis' beloved  community.   Each of us have been touched without ceasing for the spirit he led us  in acknowledging, even in anger, that there was the beloved community.   He loved his wife and his family and his extended brothers and  sisters, all the way from Alabama to Georgia. I am reminded of his  ability to love Dr. Martin Luther King. It is a testament of a man that  is able to extend love and not to show envy but to learn and to seek  knowledge. John did that, which allowed him to carry that all the way  to the fights of today.   Dr. King said: ``John Robert Lewis, are you the boy from Troy?'' He  loved to tell that story. He loved to tell that he preached to the  chickens, but his voices were heard by kings and queens.   John Robert Lewis, a saint walking on Earth.   I am reminded of our days in front of the South African Embassy,  arrested, against genocide, or fighting against the children in cages.  John never stopped his fight.   And so I come today to honor him in this brief moment that we have,  to be able to say, Isn't it good that a saintly man walked on this  Earth and reminded us of the beloved community?   I am very glad to say that I knew, and the world knows John Robert  Lewis, ``the boy from Troy.''   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this body and the Committee on the  Judiciary, as a colleague of a great and beloved man, and as a member  of a generation that directly benefited from and was inspired by his  work in the Civil Rights Movement, I am proud but heart-broken to  participate in this tribute to an American original, our friend and  colleague, the late John Robert Lewis who died last Friday, July 17,  2020, in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 80 years old.   But what amazing things my friend John bore witness to in those eight  decades.   John Robert Lewis was a lifelong warrior for a more just, equitable,  fairer, and better America, one of the Original Big Six, and a giant of  the Civil Rights Movement.   John Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders who challenged  segregated interstate travel in the South in 1961.   He was a founder and early leader of the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee, which coordinated lunch-counter sit-ins.  [[Page H3673]]    He helped organize and was the last surviving person who addressed  the multitude at the March on Washington, where Dr. King delivered his  immortal ``I Have A Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln  Memorial.   John Robert Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, the third of 10  children, to Eddie and Willie Mae (Carter) Lewis near the town of Troy  on a sharecropping farm owned by a white man.   After his parents bought their own farm--110 acres for $300--John  shared in the farm work, leaving school at harvest time to pick cotton,  peanuts and corn.   Their house had no plumbing or electricity. In the outhouse, they  used the pages of an old Sears catalog as toilet paper, that seems too  much to bear but John was empowered by his history.   His family called him ``Preacher,'' and becoming one seemed to be his  destiny.   John often said he drew inspiration by listening to a young minister  named Martin Luther King on the radio and reading about the 1955  through 56 Montgomery bus boycott.   John Lewis met Dr. King in Montgomery, Alabama in 1958, who was  touched by a letter John had written him and sent him a round-trip bus  ticket to visit.   When John arrived at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church for his  appointment, Dr. King greeted him thusly: ``Are you the boy from Troy?  Are you John Lewis?''   John said, ``I am John Robert Lewis, giving his whole name.   But Dr. King henceforth would affectionately call our beloved John,  ``the boy from Troy''.   But in 2011, at a White House ceremony, President Barack Obama  awarded John Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's  highest civilian honor, and said this about the boy from Troy:  ``Generations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant  by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind; an American who  knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other  time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.''   The first time John Lewis was arrested was in February 1960, when he  and other students demanded service at whites-only lunch counters in  Nashville, the first prolonged battle of the movement that evolved into  the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.   John's advocacy was fierce and joyful, as embodied in his common  refrain to involve oneself in the actions and passions of one's time  ``to get in the way, make necessary trouble.''   Less than two years after that August 1963 day, in the shadow of the  Lincoln Memorial, in March 1965, John led over 600 foot soldiers across  the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma, Alabama, in a march demanding the  right to vote. John's protest against injustice was met with violence  by Alabama State Troopers.   He was beaten and his skull left bloodied, the horror left bare for a  nation to see on television.   That incident, immediately known and forever remembered as Bloody  Sunday, led to the passage and enactment of the Voting Rights Act of  1965.   It was my personal honor to accompany John on countless pilgrimages  to the Edmund Pettus Bridge to remember and acknowledge those common  persons with common dreams and uncommon courage and love for the  promise of the country.   In 1986, John Lewis was elected to the United States House of  Representatives from Georgia's 5th District and served in that role  until earlier the evening when the sun set on his heroic and  extraordinary life.   John was the conscience of the Congress, widely beloved and revered  on both sides of the aisle and the Capitol.   His moral authority was colossal because he had seen the worst of us  but he always appealed to the best of us and never ceased to inspire us  to strive to create the beloved community.   It is no exaggeration to say he was a man, the likes of which we  shall not see again.   As news of John's passing reverberates across the United States and  around the world, John would want us to reflect not on his death, but  his life and the unfinished necessary work ahead of us.   John never took his eyes off the prize and to his last days,  continued to march and stand in solidarity with those protesting  injustice and inequality.   I remember getting arrested with John, Congressman McGovern, former  colleagues Jim Moran of Virginia and John Olver of Massachusetts, and  our late colleague Tom Lantos, for protesting the genocide in Darfur at  the Embassy of Sudan on April 28, 2006.   John Lewis led us in the sit-down demonstration on the House floor to  protest the Republican Congress' refusal to take up gun violence  prevention legislation in the face of the tragic mass shootings that  plague our country.   And in his final act of civic engagement and civil disobedience, John  Lewis stood in the middle of Black Lives Matter Plaza showing  solidarity and the continuity with the now global movement fighting  galvanized by the horrific murder of George Floyd to peacefully protest  for justice and equal treatment in the criminal justice system.   Mr. Speaker, John Lewis was among the finest Americans this country  ever produced.   He lived a consequential life and his legacy is all around us, in the  realization of talent and opportunity of millions of persons who walked  through the doors of progress that John Lewis helped open.   I hope it is comfort to John's family and loved ones, that people the  world over are mourning his death but celebrating his life.   A fitting and proper means of paying tribute to John Lewis's  extraordinary life is for the Senate to immediately take up and pass  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, landmark legislation to  protect the precious right to vote for all persons and to ensure that  our democracy has the tools needed to remain strong.   I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory and thanks  of John Robert Lewis, the boy from Troy, who became a leader who helped  change the world.
