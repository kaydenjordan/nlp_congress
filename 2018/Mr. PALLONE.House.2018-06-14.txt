 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have taken their  appalling assault on New Jersey to new lows: The Natural Resources  Committee is considering legislation that would penalize States like  New Jersey, where Governor Murphy and our people have had the courage  and foresight to block drilling in State waters.   What House Republicans don't realize is that New Jerseyans will never  be blackmailed into accepting drilling miles away from our $38 billion- a-year tourism industry. We know the damage that the BP oil spill did  to communities on the Gulf Coast, and we will stop at nothing to  prevent it off New Jersey's waters.   The Trump administration offered the largest offshore drilling plan  we have ever seen last year, but even the President understands the  true dangers of drilling. We know this because he excluded drilling off  Florida waters at the request of his political allies there.   Republicans understand the risk of offshore drilling, yet they are  all too happy to subject coastal communities throughout our country to  the risk.   So much, Mr. Speaker, for State rights.   Mr. Speaker, New Jerseyans have a long memory, and we will never  forget this assault on our economy and our way of life.                            ____________________
