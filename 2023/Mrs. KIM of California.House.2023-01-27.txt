 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my  community in celebrating Lunar New Year as we ring in the Year of the  Rabbit and Year of the Cat.   We cannot ignore that this year's celebrations in southern California  were rocked by the worst of evil. I have attended the Monterey Park  Lunar New Year celebrations in years past, and my heart is with the  loved ones of the victims of the shooting and our AAPI community.   However, I know that in the face of this tragedy, as we heal our  wounds, we will persevere, come together, and come back even stronger.  Our best days are yet to come.   Good prevails over evil. Love triumphs hate. Light surpasses darkness  always. That is what Lunar New Year is all about.   I am rallying with my AAPI community, and I wish all who are  celebrating joy, renewal, and many blessings.   I want to greet all the public in my special New Year's greetings.   (English translation of the statement made in Korean, Mandarin,  Cantonese, and Vietnamese is as follows:)        ``Happy new year.''        Korean: ``Saehae bok mani badeuseyo''        Mandarin: ``Xinnian kuaile''        Catonese: ``Gong hei fat choy''        Vietnamese:``Chuc Mung Nam Moi''
