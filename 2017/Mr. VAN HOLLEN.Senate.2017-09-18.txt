 Madam President, I first thank the Democratic leader  for his efforts to work and reach out to the Republican leader, Senator  McConnell, as we move forward to try to take some sensible steps to  improve our healthcare system, not try to blow up the entire healthcare  system.   Just last month, the overwhelming majority of the American people  sighed a great sigh of relief when this Senate voted down the earlier  TrumpCare proposal that would have destroyed the Affordable Care Act  and which would have had a devastating impact on the entire American  healthcare system.   We all recall, at that point in time, Senator McCain gave a powerful  and impassioned speech on this floor about the importance of the Senate  going through the regular order, about working in a transparent way, in  a bipartisan way, to improve and strengthen our healthcare system--not  another cynical, partisan effort to ram through a piece of legislation  that impacts hundreds of millions of our fellow Americans. For a time,  it seemed we were making headway on that front. Senator Lamar Alexander  and Senator Patty Murray and the HELP Committee are working together,  holding hearings, bringing people from all points of view in front of  that committee to testify about how we can improve and strengthen our  current system.   Now, instead of heading down that bipartisan path, we are seeing  another last-ditch effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act and, in  the process, wreak incredible damage to our entire healthcare system.  The latest incarnation of TrumpCare is the Graham-Cassidy legislation.  Make no mistake, in many ways, this is far worse than the earlier  proposals we have seen.   It would end the Medicaid expansion program, which in my State of  Maryland actually has provided more affordable care to more Marylanders  than the exchanges that were established under the Affordable Care Act.  It will dramatically cut the funds under the Medicaid Program through a  block grant proposal that gives very little, given the huge  responsibilities that the State has.   It will give a green light to States throughout the country to  eliminate the really important patient protections, protections against  discrimination based on preexisting conditions like diabetes or asthma  or whatever it may be, and it will give a blank check to those who want  to eliminate the important essential benefit provisions that provide  important coverage guarantees for women's health and so many other  important areas like mental health and substance abuse.   Doctors in this country take a very simple oath, the Hippocratic  oath, which says: First, do no harm.   This piece of legislation--this latest incarnation of TrumpCare--will  do devastating harm to our healthcare system, and you don't have to  take my word for it. As more and more groups learn about this piece of  legislation--and they are just looking at the details--they are  beginning to phone into our offices and to send us emails and texts. I  can assure you that Members will see the same outpouring of opposition  to this bill that they saw to the earlier ones.   Already we have seen strong statements of opposition from the  American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the  American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, and the list  goes on and on, and it just started.   It is important for us to remember that these are not Republican  groups. They are not Democratic groups. They have no partisan  affiliation at all. Their only interest is to protect patients in this  country, and we should have the same interest in protecting the health  of our constituents.   It is not just the patient advocacy groups that are already strongly  opposed to this. Those who provide healthcare in our system to our  loved ones--to our parents, to our children--are coming out strongly  opposed to this already.   Here is what the Children's Hospital Association has to say about the  Graham-Cassidy provision:         Their legislation would slash funding for Medicaid, the       nation's largest health care program for children, by one-      third, reducing access and coverage for more than 30 million       children in the program. Furthermore, the legislation weakens       important consumer safeguards, and as a result, millions of       children in working families would no longer be assured that       their private insurance covers the most basic of services       without annual and lifetime limits. . . .    And they go on. That is the Children's Hospital Association. Those  are the hospitals that every day are caring for kids throughout this  country, and they are not alone in already opposing this legislation.   The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of  Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses  Association--in short, all of those organizations representing all  those people out there who are providing healthcare to our fellow  Americans, to our constituents--are opposed to this bill.   AARP, which, of course, represents millions--in fact, tens of  millions--of older Americans is strongly opposed to this bill because,  once again, it opens the door toward age discrimination in the amount  of the premiums that are charged. Older Americans and elderly Americans  will see their premiums go through the roof under this proposal, and  that is why AARP is also strongly opposed.   So just when we thought we were at a point where we were going to  focus on a bipartisan basis on improving our healthcare system, which  has a whole lot of room for improvement, just when we began to see  bipartisan hearings and legislation possibly emerge from the HELP  Committee, we now see this last-ditch effort on the floor of the Senate  to do what other bills had tried to do but in an even worse fashion.   We are hearing already from Americans--not with political hats on,  not with Republican hats on or Democratic hats on or Independent hats  on, not with political hats on at all, just people who care about the  healthcare of the people of this country--and they are resoundingly  opposed to this. So let's not try and ram something  [[Page S5781]]  through here in the next 2 weeks to try to meet an artificial clock  that has been set by the rules of the Senate. There has been ample time  to debate this, and we have debated the earlier versions. Let's not  allow this final sneak attack on the American healthcare system to get  through this body. It would be a very sad day for the Senate.   I yield the floor.
