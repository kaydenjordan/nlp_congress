 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 172 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 172         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1) to expand Americans' access to the ballot       box, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and       strengthen ethics rules for public servants, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed two hours equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       House Administration. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu       of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Committee on House Administration now printed in the       bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-7, modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill       for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute       rule and shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.        Sec. 2. (a) No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution       and amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this       resolution.

(c) All points of order against the further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules or       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution       are waived.  [[Page H2380]]         Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on House Administration or her designee to       offer amendments en bloc consisting of amendments printed in       part B of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc       offered pursuant to this section shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on House Administration or their designees, shall       not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a       demand for division of the question in the House or in the       Committee of the Whole.        Sec. 4.  After the conclusion of consideration of the bill       for amendment and a final period of general debate, which       shall not exceed 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       House Administration, the Committee shall rise and report the       bill to the House with such further amendments as may have       been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.        Sec. 5.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of March 7, 2019, or March 8, 2019, for the       Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules       as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her       designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or his       designee on the designation of any matter for consideration       pursuant to this section.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the  distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Rules, pending which I  yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 172, providing for consideration of  H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019, under a structured rule.   The rule provides 2 hours of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on House  Administration.   The resolution self-executes Chairwoman Lofgren's manager's amendment  and provides for the consideration of 72 amendments debatable for 10  minutes each.   The rule also provides authority for en bloc amendments, debatable  for 20 minutes each.   The rule also provides 10 minutes of final general debate after  amendment consideration equally divided and controlled by the Chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration or  their designees.   Lastly, the rule provides suspension authority through Friday, March  8, 2019.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, this past weekend, I had the honor of  traveling to Selma, Alabama, with over 40 of our congressional  colleagues on a pilgrimage to observe the 54th anniversary of Bloody  Sunday, the violent confrontation at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.   That confrontation seized the Nation's attention and launched one of  the most important periods in the history of our Republic, culminating  in the passage of the Voting Rights Act.   When our colleague, Representative   John Lewis, along with Martin  Luther King and other civil rights pioneers, organized voters to  register, crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge and marched from Selma to  Montgomery, they did so knowing that their lives and the lives of those  they loved were at risk.   The institutional opposition they faced was fierce and violent, but  their message of nonviolence and justice strengthened them and their  resolve.   They marched and risked their lives in order to secure the right to  vote. They understood that they would never be equal citizens of the  United States until they had a voice in their destiny, and they  understood that the United States could never be the republic it  aspired to become until all of its citizens had the right to  participate in decisions affecting their future.   We undeniably have made progress since then, but not enough, and  frighteningly, we seem to be moving backward.   In recent years, we have seen new forms of voter suppression emerge,  whether in the guise of strict voter ID laws, purges of voting rolls,  partisan gerrymandering, or unfounded allegations of voter fraud.   As an election official, election protection organizer, and voting  rights advocate for over 3 decades, I have seen all of these tactics in  play. In fact, several of us in the Pennsylvania delegation were able  to join this Congress in part because a Federal court ordered that  Pennsylvania's congressional districts had been so gerrymandered that  they must be redrawn, they were unconstitutional.   We have heard, and will undoubtedly hear again today, that Democrats  are pushing voting rights reform because of the expectation that new  voters will likely be Democratic voters. I would hope that those with a  sense of history would resist this, recognizing that the very same  argument was used to oppose the Voting Rights Act in 1965 out of fear  that those who had been oppressed would factor that experience into  their voting decisions.   It is telling that a similar fear motivates some in this Chamber  today who would rather deprive citizens of a fundamental right than  face them at the ballot box.   The cynicism of those who would continue to place barriers in the way  of those who wish to vote goes a long way to explaining why our  citizens lack faith in us to work for them.   Those with power, voting and otherwise, too often try to preserve  that power through means that are neither transparent nor understood by  the people of this country. We have to be bold, and shed some of that  institutional power in order to regain the trust of the people.                                time  1230    I thank my colleague, Representative   John Sarbanes, who has worked  for years in tirelessly crafting this legislation. I also thank Speaker  Pelosi and the Democratic leadership team for making this bill the top  priority in the House for the 116th Congress. I am so proud that the  first order of business of this Congress, our H.R. 1, is dedicated to  good government and restoring trust in our democratic institutions.   Our elections are the bedrock of our democracy. During the recent  midterm elections, the American people charged us, the new Congress, to  make sure that our government works for them. They put their trust in  us to champion our uniquely American creed: a government of the people,  by the people, and for the people.   H.R. 1, the For the People bill, is our commitment to that trust.  This reform package will address many of the barriers to democracy that  prevent too many eligible voters from having their voices heard,  including our seniors, communities of color, servicemembers, college  students, those with disabilities, and low-income families. But it is  up to us to see it through.   I am immensely proud to be part of a Caucus that is prioritizing  legislation that the people are asking for, legislation that will  protect the right to vote for every American and ensure clean and fair  elections, that will end the dominance of big money in our politics,  and that will crack down on corruption to make sure that public  servants put the public interest first.   Recent polls have found that many Americans do not vote because of  difficulty registering or accessing their polling places and that  Americans are really concerned about the ethical standards of their  elected representatives and government officials and are equally  concerned about the influence of special interests and corruption in  Washington.   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority takes what the people are asking  for seriously. This is a bill that addresses their concerns and resets  our democracy so that it works for the people, not special interests.   H.R. 1 will make it easier for eligible Americans to vote. Allowing  and enabling Americans to vote should not be a divisive partisan issue.  Our Nation  [[Page H2381]]  can only stand to benefit when all eligible voters have a voice.   The very fact that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  greater electoral success when fewer people come out to vote is not  just a stain on our democracy but a direct threat to it.   Automatic voter registration will make it easier for young adults and  working families to make sure that they are not left out of the process  due to issues with registration.   This bill will make critical fixes to voter purging policies that  have disenfranchised millions since section 4 of the Voting Rights Act  was struck down by the Supreme Court in Shelby v. Holder. Over 4  million more names were purged from voter rolls after that decision  came down than they were in the years before. These purges affected  poor minority communities at a vastly disproportionate rate, further  marginalizing people who already face significant institutional  barriers to voting.   Election security has been a bipartisan concern across the country  for years, and H.R. 1 will make considerable investments to ensure our  elections are secure, independent, and free from foreign interference.  Empowering the Election Assistance Commission will allow States to get  the funding they need to upgrade or improve their election  infrastructure, and improvements in election administration will help  protect voting systems from cyber threats.   Election infrastructure is critical, and this bill finally recognizes  the role that Congress must play in protecting our elections.   A specific priority of mine that I am excited to see included in the  bill will make it easier for persons with disabilities to participate  in the electoral process. For too long, individuals with disabilities  have faced barriers that prevent them from participating in our  democracy at the ballot box. I have introduced legislation included in  H.R. 1 that will direct and assist States to improve access to voter  registration and the ballot box for persons with disabilities.   These democracy-driven policies represent just a handful of the  voting rights reforms contained in H.R. 1. They will improve access to  voting, promote integrity in the voting process, and ensure the  security of our elections.   Going further, H.R. 1 acts to shine a light and address the dark  money which the Citizens United decision unleashed into our politics.  Each year that we do not act on reversing Citizens United, more and  more untraceable money is spent on campaigns.   This bill will overhaul the Federal Election Commission, the FEC, so  that we have a real cop on the beat to enforce our campaign finance  laws.   It will upgrade political advertising disclosures and require donors  giving more than $10,000 to politically active organizations to be  publicly identified.   Simultaneously, this bill seeks to empower everyday Americans by  creating a small-dollar match system that will bring more people into  the conversation while reducing the impact large donors can have on any  one campaign. While small-dollar campaign funding is relatively new to  the Federal system, it has been trialed in States and larger cities to  great effect.   I am proud that H.R. 1 also includes a bill that I drafted to keep  Presidential inaugural funds from becoming shadowy slush funds or  opportunities for dark forces, whether foreign or domestic, to  influence our government. The bill will prohibit donations to inaugural  funds by foreign nationals or corporations, ban personal use of  inaugural funds by a candidate, and require disclosure of all donations  and disbursements.   H.R. 1 will also help to restore voter confidence in our democracy by  codifying ethics standards for all three branches of government. The  bill requires the development of a code of ethics for Supreme Court  Justices, mandatory recusal of Presidential appointees from matters  that concern the President, and increased enforcement of the  registration of foreign agents.    The bill will prohibit Members of Congress from using taxpayer funds  to settle employment discrimination cases against them, preventing  Members of Congress from hiding this conduct and protecting taxpayer  money from being misused.   Finally, H.R. 1 will address Presidential conflicts of interest by  requiring sitting Presidents and Vice Presidents, as well as  Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, to release their tax  returns. Those occupying the highest office in the land should be  required to show if they have financial interests that would influence  their decisionmaking. Having an executive beholden in any way to a  private company or a nation only serves to undermine our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Rhode Island an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the  Committee of Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the gentleman from  Oklahoma has any more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the reforms in H.R. 1, the For the People Act, will  remove barriers to our democracy that drown out the voices of too many  Americans.   H.R. 1 will put the people back in charge. These reforms will bring  about systemic change which, in turn, will lead to policy outcomes that  improve the lives of all Americans.   From lowering the cost of prescription drugs to rebuilding our  Nation's infrastructure to raising wages and creating better job  opportunities, each of these policies requires the voice of the people  to be fully heard and respected. They all rest on fixing our broken  democracy.   We have heard the call for change from our friends, neighbors, and  constituents. That is how I got here and how so many of my colleagues  did, too.   To those people who voted for such historic change, know that  Democrats hear you, and we are ready to give you the government you  deserve.   Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma last weekend was a  poignant reminder that change does not come quickly, and it certainly  does not come easily. Heroes like Representative   John Lewis remind us  of the sacrifices that were made in order to preserve our uniquely  American creed: ``of the people, by the people, for the people.''   H.R. 1 is the top priority of Democrats because it will strengthen  the very core of our democracy. It is a mandate with which we were  entrusted by voters this past November, and it is the first step in  restoring faith in our institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of this House to support this rule to  show that you want big money out of politics. Support this bill to show  that you believe voting should be made easier--not harder--for eligible  voters, and support this rule to show that you believe those elected to  public positions deserve to be held to the highest possible ethical  standards.   In the words of our esteemed colleague, Representative Lewis: ``The  fight to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful  nonviolent tool or instrument that we have in a democratic society.''   To the American people: We hear you. In the words of the civil rights  anthem, we must keep our eyes on the prize and hold on to the vision of  a more perfect Union, one in which the voices of the people are heard  and respected. Our Caucus is eager to restore the promise of our  democracy and give you the government you deserve. That is why we are  urging passage of H.R. 1--``For the People.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:        At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 7 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Cole of Oklahoma or a       designee. That amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent.        Sec. 7. The amendment referred to in section 6 is as       follows:        Page 421, insert after line 11 the following:        ``(5) The candidate certifies that no lien exists on any       property of the candidate by reason of a failure of the       candidate to pay any Federal, State, or local tax.''.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my first amendment is amendment No. 6.  This straightforward amendment would establish a committee of election  security experts to review grant requests to ensure that funds for  election security infrastructure are best spent.   This committee would be established under the Election Assistance  Commission, the EAC, and act alongside the three existing Federal  advisory committees that were created under the Help America Vote Act.   Currently, the three existing boards have advisory and oversight  responsibilities to assist the EAC in carrying out its mission under  the law and reviewing voluntary voter system guidelines. There is not,  however, enough expertise within these three committees to properly  determine how funds related to election security grants are best spent.   Election security is one of the critical pillars of H.R. 1, and my  amendment would help ensure that the EAC has everything it needs to  properly vet grants to help improve and secure voting systems across  the United States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, the intent of the amendment is to  establish a committee that parallels the three existing committees and,  therefore, would use the same properties as those committees for  appointment, et cetera.   The gentleman who argued against the last amendment was suggesting  that it would be too intrusive to interject too much specificity in the  amendment, so I guess we have a flip situation here. But the idea is to  parallel the three existing commissions and have the 15-person  committee appointed using the same processes.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that we share a  common concern about our election security and an interest in using the  best technology to protect that security.   The intent here is to make sure that we are spending congressional  dollars wisely as there are these grants being awarded. The amendment  was devised, after hearing from interested parties, that there was not  sufficient expertise on the three existing committees. And I would  suggest that if the dangers, which the word the gentleman has  suggested, were to come to pass, that that would be an excellent  opportunity for congressional oversight.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the much more experienced  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have a second amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my next amendment is Amendment No. 7.   The amendment would require the Federal Election Comission to conduct  a study to specifically assess whether the small donor match cap and  the 6-to-1 ratio contained in H.R. 1 is appropriately scaled for both  House and Senate elections.   H.R. 1 will empower everyday Americans through each of these systems  by bringing more and more people into the political fold.   This system of small donor campaign funding is relatively new to the  Federal system but has been tried in States and localities nationwide  to great effect. New York City has had a matching funds program in  place since the 1980s, and over 80 percent of the 2015 Connecticut  State Legislature was elected under the Citizens' Election public  financing program.   It is important and necessary to study these issues at the Federal  level, and my amendment would ensure that the Federal Government has  all of the relevant information it needs when proceeding with any  future changes to these programs.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the thoughtful queries from the  gentleman from Arizona, and that is precisely what this amendment is  directed towards. It is an amendment to H.R. 1 which sets up a small  dollar financing program, and this will allow us to assess how it is  working going forward.  [[Page H2488]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
