 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the importance of our Nation's National Heritage Areas. These sites are  rich with history, culture, and the marvels of our Nation's natural  resources.   In 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed the first National Heritage  Area into law, calling it ``a new kind of national park.'' Today,  nearly 40 years later, our Nation touts 55 National Heritage Areas  across the country.   I am proud of the 12 National Heritage Areas in Pennsylvania, more  than any other State in the Nation. National Heritage Areas in  Pennsylvania span 57 of our 67 counties, and these areas are truly an  economic development powerhouse.   In 2014, tourists spent an estimated $2 billion worth of goods and  services during their travels to Pennsylvania's National Heritage  Areas. That is $2 billion back into our rural communities.   One of those areas, the Oil Region National Heritage Area, is in my  district. The oil region was established as a Pennsylvania Heritage  Area in 1994. Ten years later it became a National Heritage Area.   Pennsylvania's oil region is rich with history. In 1859, Edwin Drake  changed our Nation's energy future forever when he drilled the world's  first commercial oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania, which is in my  congressional district, establishing Pennsylvania's oil region as the  birthplace of the world's petroleum industry.   Recently, I had the pleasure of joining the Alliance of National  Heritage Areas for their annual Heart & Soul Breakfast, where I was  reminded of the positive impact that these areas have on our  communities.   Mr. Speaker, National Heritage Areas represent one of the finest  public public-private partnership models in the country. It is for that  reason and their unwavering commitment to preserving our Nation's  history that I am so proud to stand beside them as they tirelessly  promote our Nation's rich history.   National Heritage Areas are preserving our Nation's history, not only  to celebrate it, but to learn from it and, quite frankly, to create  economic development and opportunity utilizing it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Protein Day. Protein is one of the most important elements of  a healthy diet.   In turn, I would also like to recognize one of the most important  sources of protein in the American diet. I am talking about milk.   We know that the protein in milk helps build and repair muscle tissue  in active bodies. Additionally, dairy products like milk contain nine  essential nutrients that help reduce the risk of high blood pressure,  osteoporosis, and certain cancers. Milk also supports strong bones and  a healthy immune system.   Despite all these positive qualities, milk consumption in the United  States has been on the decline. In an effort to reverse this trend, I  introduced the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act last year, a bipartisan  bill, to once again allow whole milk in our Nation's schools.   Milk is part of a nutritious and healthy diet, packed with protein  and flavor. This National Protein Day, I would like to remind us all of  the nutrients and health benefits that whole milk provides.                            ____________________
