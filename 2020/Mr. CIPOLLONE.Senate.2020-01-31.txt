 Opponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you may proceed.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Before I begin, Mr. Chief Justice, the House  managers will be reserving the balance of our time to respond to the  argument of counsel for the President.   Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, fellow House managers, and counsel for  the President, I know I speak for my fellow managers, as well as  counsel for the President, in thanking you for your careful attention  to the arguments that we have made over the course of many long days.   Today, we were greeted to yet another development in the case when  the New York Times reported with a headline that says:         Trump Told Bolton to Help His Ukraine Pressure Campaign,       Book Says        The President asked his national security adviser last       spring in front of other senior advisers to pave the way for       a meeting between Rudolph Giuliani and Ukraine's new leader.    According to the New York Times:         More than two months before he asked Ukraine's president to       investigate his political opponents, President Trump directed       John R. Bolton, then his national security adviser, to help       with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on       Democrats from Ukrainian officials, according to an       unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton.        Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an       Oval Office conversation in early May that included the       acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the       president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White       House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the       President's impeachment defense.    You will see in a few moments--and you will recall Mr. Cipollone  suggesting that the House managers were concealing facts from this  body. He said all the facts should come out. Well, there is a new fact  which indicates that Mr. Cipollone was one of those who were in the  loop--yet another reason why we ought to hear  [[Page S754]]  from witnesses. Just as we predicted--and it didn't require any great  act of clairvoyance--the facts will come out. They will continue to  come out. And the question before you today is whether they will come  out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgment as to the  guilt or innocence of the President.   Now, that Times article goes on to say:         Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who       had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure       Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, who was planning a       trip to Ukraine to discuss the investigations that the       President sought, in Mr. Bolton's account. Mr. Bolton never       made the call, he wrote.    ``Never made the call.'' Mr. Bolton understood that this was wrong.  He understood that this was not policy. He understood that this was a  domestic political errand and refused to make the call.         The account in Mr. Bolton's manuscript portrays the most       senior White House advisers as early witnesses in the effort       that they have sought to distance the President from.    Including the White House Counsel.         Over several pages--    According to the Times--       Mr. Bolton laid out Mr. Trump's fixation on Ukraine and the       president's belief, based on a mix of scattershot events,       assertions and outright conspiracy theories, that Ukraine       tried to undermine his chances of winning the presidency in       2016.        As he began to realize the extent and aims of the pressure       campaign, Mr. Bolton began to object, he wrote in the book,       affirming the testimony of a former National Security Council       aide, Fiona Hill, who had said that Mr. Bolton warned that       Mr. Giuliani was ``a hand grenade who's going to blow       everybody up.''    Now, as you might imagine, the President denies this. The President  said today: ``I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for  Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America.''   So here you have the President saying John Bolton is not telling the  truth. Let's find out. Let's put John Bolton under oath. Let's find out  who is telling the truth. A trial is supposed to be a quest for the  truth. Let's not fear what we will learn. As Mr. Cipollone said, let's  make sure that all facts come out.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the  President, last Tuesday, at the onset of this trial, we moved for  Leader McConnell's resolution to be amended to subpoena documents and  witnesses from the outset. This body decided to hold the question over.  You have now heard opening arguments from both sides. You have seen the  evidence that the House was able to collect. You have heard about the  documents and witnesses President Trump blocked from the House's  impeachment inquiry. We have vigorously questioned both sides.   The President's counsel has urged you to decide this case and render  your verdict upon the record assembled by the House. The evidence in  the record is sufficient. It is sufficient to convict the President on  both Articles of Impeachment--more than sufficient.   But that is simply not how trials work. As any prosecutor or defense  lawyer would tell you, when a case goes to trial, both sides call  witnesses and subpoena documents to bring before the jury. That happens  every day in courtrooms all across America. There is no reason why this  impeachment trial should be any different. The commonsense practice is  borne out of precedence. There has never been--never before been--a  full Senate impeachment trial without a single witness. In fact, you  can see in the slide that in every one of the 15 prior impeachment  trials the Senate has called multiple witnesses. Today we ask you to  follow this body's uniform precedence and your common sense. We urge  you to vote in favor of subpoenaing witnesses and documents.   Now, I would like to address one question at the outset. There has  been much back and forth about whether if the House believes it has  sufficient evidence to convict, which we do, why do we need more  witnesses and documents? So I would like to be clear. The evidence  presented over the past week and a half strongly supports a vote to  convict the President. The evidence is overwhelming. We have a mountain  of evidence. It is direct, it is corroborated by multiple sources, and  it proves that the President committed grave impeachable offenses to  cheat in the next election.   The evidence confirms that if left in office, President Trump will  continue to harm America's national security. He will continue to seek  to corrupt the upcoming election. And he will undermine--he will  undermine--our democracy all to further his own personal gain.   But this is a fundamental question that must be addressed: Is this a  fair trial? Is this a fair trial? Is this a fair trial? Without the  ability to call witnesses and produce documents, the answer is clearly  and unequivocally no. It was the President's decision to contest the  facts, and that is his right, but because he has chosen to contest the  facts, he shall not be heard to complain that the House wishes to  further prove his guilt to answer the questions he would raise. He  complains that few witnesses spoke directly to the President about his  misconduct beyond his damning conversations with Sondland and Mulvaney.  OK, let's hear from others, then--the witnesses the House wishes to  call directly to the President's own words, his own admissions of  guilt, his own confessions of responsibility. If they did not, all the  President's men would be on their witness list, not ours.   These witnesses and the documents their agencies produced tell the  full story. And I believe that we are interested in hearing the full  story. You should want to hear it. More than that, the American  people--we know they want to hear it.    The House Republicans' own expert witness in the House, Professor  Turley, said, if you could prove the President used our military aid to  pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival and interfere in our  elections, it would be an impeachable abuse of power. Senator Graham,  too, recognized that, if such evidence existed, it could potentially  change his mind on impeachment.   Well, we now have another witness--a fact witness--who would  reportedly say exactly that. Ambassador Bolton's new manuscript, which  we will discuss in more detail in a moment, reportedly confirms that  the President told him in no uncertain terms--we are talking about the  former National Security Advisor saying that the President told him in  no uncertain terms--no aid until investigations, including the Bidens.   For a week and a half, the President has said no such evidence  exists. They are wrong. If you have any doubt about the evidence, the  evidence is at your fingertips. The question is: Will you let all of  us, including the American people, hear--simply hear--the evidence and  make up their own minds? And you can make up your own minds, but will  we let the American people hear all of the evidence?   You will recall that Ambassador Bolton, the President's former  National Security Advisor, is one of the witnesses we asked for last  Tuesday. We did not know, at the time, what he would say. We didn't  know what kind of witness he would be, but Ambassador Bolton made clear  that he was willing to testify and that he had relevant, firsthand  knowledge that had not yet been heard. We urged--we argued--that we all  deserved to hear that evidence, but the President opposed him. Now we  know why--because John Bolton could corroborate the rest of our  evidence and confirm the President's guilt.   So, today, Senators, we come before you, and we urge again--we  argue--that you let this witness and the other key witnesses we have  identified come forward so you will have all of the information  available to you when you make this consequential decision.   If witnesses are not called here, these proceedings will be a trial  in name only, and the American people clearly know a fair trial when  they see one. Large majorities of the American people want to hear from  witnesses in this trial, and they have a right to hear from witnesses  in this trial. Let's hear from them. Let's look them in the eye, gain  their credibility, and hear what they have to say about the President's  actions.   For the same reasons, this body should grant our request to subpoena  documents, the documents that the President also blocked the House from  obtaining--documents from the White House, the State Department, the  DOD, and the OMB--that will complete the story and provide the whole  truth,  [[Page S755]]  whatever that may be. We ask that you subpoena these documents so that  you can decide for yourselves. If you have any doubt as to what  occurred, let's look at this additional evidence.   To be clear, we are not asking you to track down every single  document or to call every possible witness. We have carefully  identified only four key witnesses with direct knowledge, who can speak  to the specific issues that the President has disputed, and we have  targeted key documents which we understand have already been collected.  For example, at the State Department, they have already been collected.   This will not cause a substantial delay. As I made clear last night,  these matters can be addressed in a single week. As we made clear last  night, these matters can be addressed in a single week. We know that  from President Clinton's case. There, the Senate voted to approve a  motion for witnesses on January 27. The next day, it established  procedures for those depositions and adjourned as a Court of  Impeachment until February 4. In that brief period, the parties took  three depositions. The Senate then resumed its proceedings by voting to  accept the deposition testimony into the Record.   In this trial, too, let's do the same. We should take a brief, 1-week  break for witness testimony and document collection, during which time  the Senate can return to its normal business. The trial should not be  allowed to be different from every other impeachment trial or any other  kind of trial simply because the President doesn't want us to know the  truth. The American people--the American people we all represent, the  American people we all love and care about--deserve to know the truth,  and a fair trial requires it.   This is too important of a decision to be made without all of the  relevant evidence. Before turning to the specific need for these  witnesses and documents, I want to make clear that we are not asking  you, again, to break new ground. We are asking quite the opposite. We  are asking you to simply follow the Senate's unbroken precedent and to  do so in a manner that allows you to continue the Senate's ordinary  business.   The Senate, in sitting as a Court of Impeachment, has heard witness  testimony in every other--as we have said earlier--15 impeachment  trials in the history of the Republic. In fact, these trials had an  average of 33 witnesses, and the Senate has repeatedly subpoenaed and  received new documents while adjudicating cases of impeachment. That  makes sense. Under our Constitution, the Senate does not just vote on  impeachments, and it does not just debate them. Instead, the Senate is  commanded by the Constitution to try all cases of impeachment. Well, a  trial requires witnesses. A trial requires documents. This is the  American way, and this is the American story.   If the Senate denies our motions, it would be the only time in  history it has written a judgment on Articles of Impeachment without  hearing from a single witness or receiving a single relevant document  from the President, whose conduct is on trial. And why? How can we  justify this break from precedent? How would we justify it? For what  reason would we break precedent in these proceedings?    There are many compelling reasons beyond precedent that demand  subpoenas for witnesses and cases and documents in this case.   At this time, I yield to Manager Garcia.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, President's counsel,  Senators, last week, I shared with you that I was reflecting on my  first days at a school for baby judges. You all may recall that. I  mentioned to you that one of the first things they told us was that we  had to be good listeners and be patient, and you, as judges in this  trial, have certainly passed the test. Thank you for being good  listeners and for being patient with us. It has been quite a long  journey.   We are here today to talk about the other thing they told us in baby  judge school, and that was that we had to give all of the parties in  front of us a fair hearing--an opportunity to be heard, an opportunity  to cross-examine witnesses, an opportunity to bring evidence. That is  what I want to talk to you about today because, in terms of fundamental  fairness, subpoenas by the Senate in this trial would mitigate the  damage caused by the President's wholesale obstruction of the House's  inquiry.   The President claims that there is no direct evidence of his  wrongdoing despite direct evidence to the contrary and Ambassador  Bolton's offer to testify to even more evidence in a trial. Let's not  forget that the President is arguing that there is no direct evidence  while blocking all of us from getting that direct evidence.   It is a remarkable position that they have taken. Quite frankly,  never, as a lawyer or as a former judge, have I ever seen anything like  this. For the first time in our history, President Trump ordered his  entire administration--his entire administration--to defy every single  impeachment subpoena. The Trump administration has not produced a  single document in response to the congressional subpoenas--not a  single page, nada. That has never happened before. There is no legal  privilege to justify a blanket blocking of all of these documents. We  know that there are more relevant documents. There is no dispute about  that; it is uncontested. Witnesses have testified in exceptional detail  about these documents that exist that the President is simply hiding.   President Trump's blanket order of prohibiting the entire executive  branch from participating in the impeachment investigation also extends  to witnesses. There are 12 in all who followed that order and refused  to testify. Much of the critical evidence we have is the result of  career officials who bravely came forward despite the President's  obstruction, but those closest to the President--some may say, like in  the musical ``Hamilton,'' those ``in the room when it happened''-- followed his instruction.   The President does not dispute that these witnesses have information  that is relevant to this trial, that these individuals have personal  and direct knowledge of the President's actions and motivations and can  provide the very evidence he says now that we don't have.   The President's counsel alleged the House managers hid evidence from  you.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. [B]ecause as house managers, really       their goal should be to give you all of the facts because       they're asking you to do something very, very consequential.        And ask yourself, ask yourself, given the fact you heard       today that they didn't tell you, who doesn't want to talk       about the facts? Who doesn't want to talk about the facts?        Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game. They should give you       the facts.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. This is nice rhetoric, but it is simply  incorrect.   The President's counsel cherry-picked misleading bits of evidence,  cited deposition transcripts of witnesses who subsequently corrected  their testimony in public hearings and said the opposite and, in some  cases, simply left out the second half of witness statements.   The House managers accurately presented the relevant evidence to you.  We spent about 20 hours presenting the facts and the evidence. The  President's counsel spent 4 hours focusing on the facts and the  evidence, and that evidence shows that the President is guilty. But to  the extent certain facts were shown to you, let's be very clear: We are  not the ones hiding the facts. The House managers did not hide that  evidence. President Trump hid the evidence. That is why we are the ones  standing up here, asking you to not let the President silence these  witnesses and hide these documents.   We don't know precisely what the witnesses will say or what the  documents would show, but we all deserve to hear the truth. And, more  importantly, the American people deserve to hear the truth.   Never before has a President been put--put himself above the law and  hid the facts of his offenses from the American people like this one.  We cannot let this President be different. Quite simply, the stakes are  too high.   Second, as this builds on what we have been arguing, the Senate  requires and should want a complete evidentiary record before you vote  on the most sacred task that the Constitution entrusts in every single  one of you.   I can respect that some of you have deep beliefs that the removal of  this President would be divisive. Others,  [[Page S756]]  you may believe that allowing this President to remain in the Oval  Office would be catastrophic to our Republic and our democracy.   But regardless of where you are, regardless of where you land on the  spectrum, you should want a full and complete record before you make a  final decision and to understand the full story. It should not be about  party affiliation; it should be about seeing all the evidence and  voting your conscience based on all the relevant facts. It should be  about doing impartial justice.   Consider the harm done to our institutions, our constitutional order,  and the public faith in our democracy if the Senate chooses to close  its eyes to learning the full truth about the President's misconduct.   How can the American people have confidence in the result of a trial  without witnesses?   Third, the President should want a fair trial. He has repeatedly said  that publicly; that he wants a trial on the merits. He specifically  said it. You saw a clip that he wanted a fair trial in the Senate, and  that would have to be with witnesses that testify, including John  Bolton and Mick Mulvaney. He said that he wants a complete and total  exoneration.   Well, whatever you say about this trial, there cannot be a total--an  exoneration without hearing from those witnesses because an acquittal  on an incomplete record after a trial lacking witnesses and evidence  will be no exoneration. It will be no vindication--not for the  President, not for this Chamber, and not for the American people.   And if the President is telling the truth and he did nothing wrong  and the evidence would prove that, then we all know that he would be an  enthusiastic supporter of subpoenas. He would be here probably himself,  if he could, urging you to do subpoenas if he had information that  would prove he was totally not in the wrong. If he is innocent, he  should have nothing to hide. His counsel should be the ones here asking  today to subpoena Bolton and Mulvaney and others for testimony.   The President would be eager to have the people closest to him to  testify about his innocence. He would be eager to present the documents  that show he was concerned about corruption and burden-sharing. But the  fact that he has so strenuously opposed the testimony of his closest  advisers and all the documents speak volumes.   You should issue subpoenas to the President so that the President can  get the fair trial that he wanted--but more importantly, so the  American people can get the fair trial that they deserve. The American  people deserve a fair trial.   I said at the onset of this trial that one of the most important  decisions you would make at this moment in history will not be whether  you convict or acquit but whether the President and the American people  will get a fair trial.   The process is more than just the ultimate decision because the faith  in our institution depends on the perception of a fair process. A vote  against witnesses and documents undermines that faith.   Senators, the American people want a fair trial. The overwhelming  majority of Americans, three in four voters--three in four--as of this  past Tuesday believe that this trial should have witnesses. Now, there  is not much that the American people agree on these days, but they do  agree on that, and they know what a fair trial is; that it involves  witnesses and it involves evidence.   The American people deserve to know the facts about their President's  conduct and those around him, and they deserve to have confidence in  this process, confidence that you made the right decision. In order to  have that confidence, the Senate must call relevant witnesses and  obtain relevant documents withheld thus far by this President. The  American people deserve a fair trial.   I now yield to my colleague Manager Crow.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, last week the House managers argued for the  testimony of four witnesses: Ambassador John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney,  Robert Blair, and Michael Duffey. And during the presentations from  both parties, it has become abundantly clear why the direct testimony  from those witnesses is so critical, and new evidence continues to  underscore that importance.   So let's start with John Bolton. The President's counsel has  repeatedly stated that the President didn't personally tell any of our  witnesses that he linked the military aid to the investigations.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         PURPURA: There is simply no evidence anywhere that       President Trump ever linked security assistance to any       investigations[.] [M]ost of the democrats['] witnesses have       never spoken to the President at all let alone about Ukraine       security assistance.        . . .        Not a single witness testified that the President himself       said that there was any connection between any investigations       and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything       else.    Mr. Manager CROW. Now, that is simply not true, as the testimony of  Ambassador Sondland and the admission of Mick Mulvaney make very clear.   The evidence before you proves that the President not only linked the  aid to the investigations, he also conditioned both the White House  meeting and the aid on Ukraine's announcement of the investigations.   But if you want more, a witness to acknowledge that the President  told them directly that the aid was linked, a witness in front of you,  then you have the power to ask for it.   I mentioned this portion--there is a slide. I mentioned this portion  of the Ambassador's manuscript in the beginning, and Manager Schiff  referenced it as well, but he said directly that the President told him  this.   Now, the President has publicly lashed out in recent days at  Ambassador Bolton. He says that Ambassador Bolton is--what Ambassador  Bolton is saying is ``nasty'' and ``untrue.'' But denials in 280  characters is not the same as testimony under oath. We know that.   Let's put Ambassador Bolton under oath and ask him point blank: Did  the President use $391 million of taxpayer money--military aid intended  for an ally at war--to pressure Ukraine to investigate his 2020  opponent? The stakes are too high not to.   I would like to briefly walk you through why Ambassador Bolton's  testimony is essential to ensuring a fair trial, also addressing some  of the questions that you have asked in the past 2 days.   First, turning back to Ambassador Bolton's manuscript, the  President's counsel has said: No scheme existed. And the President's  counsel has cited repeated denials, public denials of President Trump's  inner circle about Bolton's allegations--none of them, of course, under  oath. And as we know from the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, how  important being sworn in really is.   But Ambassador Bolton, as the top national security aide, has direct  insight into the President's inner circle, and he is willing to testify  under oath whether ``everyone was in the loop,'' as he testified  before.   Ambassador Bolton reportedly knows ``new details about senior cabinet  officials who have publicly tried to sidestep involvement,'' including  Secretary Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney's knowledge of the scheme.   Second, Ambassador Bolton has direct knowledge of key events outside  of the July 25 call that confirm the President's scheme. Remember, this  is exactly the type of direct evidence the President's counsel say  doesn't exist. That is partly because they would like you to believe  that the July 25 call makes up all of the evidence of our case. The  call, of course, is just a part of the large body of evidence that you  have heard about the past week, but it is a key part. But Ambassador  Bolton has critical insight into the President's misconduct outside of  this call, and you should hear it.   Take, for example, the July 10 meeting with U.S. and Ukrainian  officials at the White House. Dr. Hill testified during the meeting  that Ambassador Sondland said that he had a deal with Mr. Mulvaney to  schedule a White House meeting if Ukrainians did the investigations.  According to Dr. Hill, when Ambassador Bolton learned this, he told her  to go back to the NSC's Legal Advisor, John Eisenberg, and tell him,  ``I am not a part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are  cooking up on this.'' We already have corroboration of Dr. Hill's  testimony from  [[Page S757]]  other witnesses like Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.   And we have new corroboration from Ukraine too. Oleksandr Danylyuk,  President Zelensky's former national security advisor, recently  confirmed in an interview that the ``roadmap [for U.S.-Ukraine  relations] should have been the substance but . . . [the  investigations] were raised.''   Danylyuk also explained why this was so problematic. He raised  concerns that being ``dragged into this internal process . . . would be  really bad for the country. And also, if there's something that  violates U.S. law, that's up to the U.S. to handle.''   Danylyuk elaborated that there were serious things to discuss at the  meeting, but if instead Ukraine was dragged into ``internal politics,  using our president who was fresh on the job, inexperienced, that could  just destroy everything.''   Another key defense raised by the President has been that Ukraine  felt no pressure, that these investigations are entirely proper. Well,  here is Ukraine saying the opposite of that. You know what else  Danylyuk said in the interview? ``It was definitely John who I  trusted,'' talking about Ambassador Bolton.   So if you want to know whether Ukrainians felt pressure, call John  Bolton as a witness. He was trusted by Ukraine, and he was there for  these key meetings, and he was so concerned that he characterized the  scheme as a ``drug deal'' and urged Dr. Hill and others to report their  concerns to NSC legal counsel, who reports to White House Counsel  Cipollone.   So let's ask Ambassador Bolton these questions directly under oath:  The President says Ukraine felt no pressure, that soliciting these  investigations wasn't improper. Is that true? If it is true, why is  Ukraine publicly saying that the talk of investigations could destroy  everything? And if the President's administration thought this was OK,  why did you use the words ``drug deal?'' We should ask him that. Why  did you urge your staff to report concerns to lawyers? These are all  questions that we can get the answers to.   Third, the President has suggested the House managers have not  presented any direct evidence about Mr. Giuliani's role in the scheme.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ms. Counsel RASKIN. In fact, it appears the House committee       wasn't particularly interested in presenting you with any       direct evidence of what Mayor Giuliani did or why he did it.       Instead, they ask you to rely on hearsay, speculation, and       assumption, evidence that would be inadmissible in any court.    Mr. Manager CROW. Well, once again, that is simply not true. But if  you want more evidence, we know that Ambassador Bolton has direct  evidence of Mr. Giuliani's role regarding Ukraine and expressed  concerns about it.   The President has suggested that Mr. Giuliani wasn't doing anything  improper, and he was not involved in conducting policy. By their own  admission, they said he wasn't doing policy. So let's ask John Bolton  what Giuliani was doing and whether the investigations were politically  motivated or part of our foreign policy.   He would know. Dr. Hill testified that Ambassador Bolton said Mr.  Giuliani was ``a hand grenade,'' which he explained referred to ``all  of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was making publicly, that the  investigations that he was promoting, that the story line he was  promoting, the narrative he was promoting was going to backfire.'' The  narrative Mr. Giuliani was promoting, of course, was asking Ukraine to  dig up dirt on Biden.   Dr. Hill also testified that Ambassador Bolton was so concerned, he  told Dr. Hill and other members of the NSC staff that ``nobody should  be meeting with Giuliani,'' and that he was ``closely monitoring what  Mr. Giuliani was doing and the messaging he was sending out.''   So let's ask Ambassador Bolton: If Mr. Giuliani wasn't doing anything  wrong, why were you so concerned about his behavior that you directed  your staff to have no part in this? If Mr. Giuliani wasn't trying to  dig up dirt on Biden, why did you seem to think that he could ``blow  everything up''?   Fourth, the President has said that there was nothing wrong with the  July 25 call. But once again the evidence suggests that Ambassador  Bolton would testify that the opposite is true. According to witness  testimony, Ambassador Bolton expressed concerns even before the call  that it would be ``a disaster'' because he thought there could be  ``talk of investigations or worse.'' Now, if the President would have  you believe that the call was perfect, as he has repeatedly stated, why  don't we find out? Because all of the evidence before you suggests  otherwise.   And Ukraine knows this is not the case. The call was not perfect.  Danylyuk is clear on this point. He said:         One thing I can tell you that was clear from this [July 25]       call is that the issue of the investigations is an issue of       concern for Trump. It was clear.    But if there is still any uncertainty, we must ask Ambassador Bolton:  If there was no scheme, how did you know President Trump would raise  investigations on the call? What made you so concerned the call would  be a ``disaster''?   Fifth, the President's main defense, once again, is that he withheld  the military aid for legitimate reasons. But the evidence doesn't  support that. You have heard a lot. The evidence doesn't support that.  Witness testimony, emails, and other documents confirm that Ambassador  Bolton and his subordinates on many occasions, including through in- person meetings with the President himself, urged the President that  there was no legitimate reason to withhold the aid.   But if you are not sure, if you think this could in any way have been  about a legitimate policy reason, let's ask the National Security  Advisor, who was in charge of that. If this was simply a policy  dispute, as the President argues, let's ask John Bolton whether that is  true.   The President also argues that you cannot evaluate the President's  subjective intent--that the President can use his power any way he  feels is appropriate. That is, of course, not the case. Whether his  intent was corrupt is a central part of this case, as it is in nearly  every criminal case in the country. As a backup argument, however, the  President's counsel claims that we want you to read the President's  mind.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. This entire impeachment process is       about the House managers' insistence that they are able to       read everybody's thoughts. They can read everybody's       intention . . .        Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. They think you can read minds.
