 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1065.   As a working mother who has two beautiful children, I support  reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers. Many of the provisions  in the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act are admirable. However, it is  equally important to protect First Amendment rights of our religious  organizations, hospitals, and schools, including those located in the  Fifth District of Louisiana.   Under this bill, organizations could be forced to make employment- related decisions that conflict with their faith and sacrifice their  religious rights. For example, a faith-based employer could be deemed  in violation of this bill if it does not accommodate an employee's  request for paid time off to undergo an abortion.   Also, if signed into law, this bill allows an independent and  uncontrollable Federal agency to make additional rules and regulations  that could further erode religious liberties. It leaves decisionmaking  in the hands of unelected government bureaucrats.   Therefore, Congress must include a religious freedom exemption in the  base text of this bill. When it comes to religious freedom and pro-life  issues, we should not allow bureaucrats and potentially the judicial  system to make decisions by reading between the lines. We must send a  clear message that religious freedom is nonnegotiable.
