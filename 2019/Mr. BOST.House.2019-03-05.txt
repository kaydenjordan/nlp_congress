 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1381, the Burn Pit  Registry Enhancement Act. As the ranking member said, I am a marine. As  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, caring for those veterans  who have served our Nation, and protecting them, is a top priority for  me. They should have the peace of mind in knowing that they will be  cared for by a grateful Nation after having that time that they served.   I have had veterans come into my office with health problems, health  problems that they shouldn't be having. They are young, and they don't  have a family history. Sometimes, they just can't pinpoint the cause.   All too often, it can be from the use of burn pits in Iraq and  Afghanistan. It is equally frustrating that the VA doesn't have enough  data to fully understand the effects of burn pits.   We have seen this movie before. We saw it with people who were  exposed to Agent Orange, people who were serving offshore, and the  problems we have dealing with blue water Navy Vietnam veterans. They,  too, faced the consequences of unknown exposure risks.   We must do better. This bill seeks to do that. This is a step  forward. It is not a fix all, but at least we are trying to move in the  direction that we need to move and not be trapped in the same situation  we were with Agent Orange. Today's legislation is a bipartisan effort,  and it puts our veterans first.
