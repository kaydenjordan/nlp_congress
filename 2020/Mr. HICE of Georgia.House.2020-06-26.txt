 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C.  Admission Act.   There is a whole lot more to statehood than simply being a large and  vibrant city. Our Nation's Founders made it clear that D.C. is not  meant to be a State. They thought about it, they debated it, and they  rejected it. In fact, in those early days, Alexander Hamilton himself  proposed an amendment that would allow the District residents to have a  voting Member in the House, and that proposal was rejected.   If the majority wishes to go against our Founders, that is their  prerogative, but they should simply admit, in their opinion, the  Founders were wrong. They cannot ignore the intention behind D.C.'s  current status. The Constitution simply does not allow city governments  to become microstates with all the rights and responsibilities of full  States. The debate about the nature of Washington, D.C., is not a new  debate, but it is absolutely a settled one.   My friends on the other side of the aisle may gasp and protest in  outrage at the suggestion that what this is really all about is an  attempt to get two more Democratic Senators. That is what this really  is all about.   On our side, there is no question that we have the Constitution on  our side on this whole debate. The Constitution clearly establishes a  federation of sovereign States, and representation here in Washington,  D.C., comes from those States, the federation of those States. This  District is a unique entity. It was set apart to not be influenced by a  State, but to, in itself, be governed by those representatives of the  various States who are here.   Our Founders did not want this city, the seat of our Federal  Government, to be influenced by any other State, but that is exactly  what this proposal would do.   As James Madison expressed it himself in Federalist 43, if the  Nation's Capital City were situated within a State, the Federal  Government could be subject to undue influence of that State. That is  not the intent of our Federal Government; that is not the intent of  this District that has been set aside; and that is exactly what would  happen under this bill.   My colleagues across the aisle believe that excluding a small Federal  enclave from this new State would nullify the need for a constitutional  amendment, but that is simply not true. The original text of the  Constitution is clear.   Congress has the power to create States from two sources: a territory  or  [[Page H2533]]  an existing State that agrees to secede its territory to become a  State. Washington, D.C., is neither of these. It is the Nation's only  Federal District, and it is set aside for a specific purpose. Congress  does not have the authority to take this District and create a State  out of it. At least one constitutional amendment would be required for  that to happen.   During the markup of this bill, I personally raised these  constitutional concerns and offered an amendment to provide an  expedited procedure to deal with the constitutional amendment, but the  Oversight Committee Democrats opposed that amendment, and they opposed,  in fact, all of our amendments that were put forth.   This is not a surprise that this whole proposal has been rejected by  the American people.                                time  0930    In fact, in a Gallup Poll last year, 64 percent of Americans reject  the idea of D.C. being a State, only 29 percent approve of it.   Granting D.C. statehood goes against not only the American citizens'  desires, but more importantly, against the Constitution itself and  certainly our Framers' original intent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to oppose the  Washington, D.C. Admissions Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the chairwoman that the entire court  system of Washington, D.C., is supported by the Federal Government.   And there is representation. This District has three electoral votes.  No other city in the country has that. There is a representative here.   It is just an amazing thing, too, that this whole bill does not even  allow elections for the new Governor that is proposed here, so the very  thing they are arguing, they reject and deny from the residents.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Murphy), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), my good friend and a great member of the  Oversight Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I will just remind my good friend,  listen, we share the concern if people are upset, if it is not working.  But the reality is, if it is not working, we have a system in this  government, in our system, to deal with it. And in this case, it is  called a constitutional amendment.   Why the Democrats are not presenting a constitutional amendment to  [[Page H2535]]  deal with the problem is beyond me, but it is what it is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I would just say again that our  Constitution has representation here in our Capitol from the Federation  of the States, and this district was set apart, not to be a State, nor  to be influenced by one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Massie), a great member of the Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I feel like the arguments on the  other side of the aisle are so weak that they respond by yelling  louder.   We have just heard a great, passionate speech about something that is  totally irrelevant. In fact, the point was highlighted that the  condition for statehood is not population; otherwise, we would not have  States like Wyoming or Alaska or other States that were ever admitted.  That is not the issue. The issue was that Washington, D.C., was set  apart as a seat of government not to be the same as the federation of  States that our Constitution grants us.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy), who is my good friend and a great leader.    Mr. Speaker, to somehow try to paint a picture  that D.C. is a second-class city is absolute absurdity. Without  question, this is the most influential city in this country--perhaps in  the world.  [[Page H2538]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my good friend and a great leader.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining for each side?    Mr. Speaker, it certainly can happen. It just  requires a constitutional amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Harris), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, the Constitution can change by  amendment only.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Despite the passionate arguments that we have heard today regarding  H.R. 51, the plain truth is that Washington, D.C.'s status as the  Capital of the United States is exactly as our Founders intended.   To be clear, Washington, D.C., is a vibrant and special city holding  a unique position in our Nation's Federal system. Our Nation's Capital  does not exist within one State, and therefore, it is free from the  influence of any State. That is exactly the intention of our  Constitution and our Founders.   But not only is the Constitution proposal going to be a violation of  our Constitution, but practically speaking, D.C. is not prepared  financially and otherwise as a microstate.   Currently, Washington, D.C., only raises about half of its annual  budget through local taxes, despite the fact that they have some of the  highest taxes in the Nation. This shows a lack of financial readiness  for the responsibility of statehood.   Congress has already dealt with this in the past, and D.C.'s  financial situation, we bailed it out in the 1990s after 20 years of  troubled self-rule.   The majority's bill does not take into account how these budgetary  shortfalls would be remedied or how the taxpayers would be relieved.  Statehood first, the details later, that is the majority's proposal.   In seeking to gain an extra two seats in the Senate, Democrats would  strip this great historic city of its special status and make it a  shell state. The Democrat's statehood proposal leaves us with a State  in name only, and a tiny remnant of a Federal district. This is far  from the intent of our Founding Fathers.   We live in a federation, a federation of States. I would say there is  no one who is a greater supporter of States' rights than I am, but  because I believe in States' rights, I cannot support this city  becoming a State.   D.C. is simply not equipped to shoulder the burden of statehood. If  Democrats were serious about granting representation to the citizens of  D.C., they would consider retroceding the land back to Maryland, as has  been proposed, but that has been rejected over and over. If D.C.'s  citizens rejoin Maryland, they would gain the Senate and House  representation that supposedly is what this bill is after.   But this statehood proposal is about politics all dressed up in noble  arguments about disenfranchising and taxation without representation.  It is just a big sham.   The Constitution is clear. A new State can be formed from Federal  territories or from existing States with their permission. But the  current Federal district is not an existing State, nor is it a  territory. It is unique, and our Framers specifically crafted the  Constitution with a maximum size for the District, so as to prevent it  from becoming a State.   We have been over this time and again, but H.R. 51 changes the clear  intentions of our Founders. By making the District a State, we are  going exactly against the intent of our Framers and the intentions of  our Constitution. The Framers crafted our Constitution with the direct  intent that we would have a unique district, the seat of our Federal  Government that is not influenced by a State. That is what we have, and  that is what we need to keep.   H.R. 51 disregards the Constitution, and we cannot take this lightly.  I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
