 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee  for both yielding and for his kind remarks.   Mr. Speaker, this is what our Republican colleagues won't tell the  American people: The debt ceiling does not control spending. It is  raised, as has been said multiple times now, to cover the debt we have  already incurred.   In this case, a lot of that debt is from the 2017 Trump tax scam. Our  Republican colleagues will tell you they voted to cover that debt. But  here is the deal: That massive giveaway to wealthy corporations and  individuals has a price tag of nearly $2 trillion.   This year, it added $271 billion to the debt. Republicans are  refusing to pay that bill. Next year, it will add another $243 billion  to the debt. Are Republicans going to pay that bill? How about in  fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2026?   They refuse to vote to pay those bills. This whole debate about the  debt ceiling has become a dangerous lie, a very dangerous lie.   The truth is, the debt ceiling needs to be repealed or at least it  needs to be reformed so we can put an end to this political  brinkmanship that will continue to threaten our economy and the  livelihoods of American families for years. It is time to end this  charade.
