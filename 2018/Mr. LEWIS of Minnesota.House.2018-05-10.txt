 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his  leadership on this vital issue.   The Federal Government asked Americans to pay roughly $40 billion in  taxes and interest with the promise the government would operate a  national  [[Page H3899]]  repository. Thirty-seven years later, no repository, and my district is  hampered with the burden of maintaining 40 spent fuel casks, with more  on the way.   Now, while on-site storage is done in a very safe and highly secure  manner, it is simply not appropriate. In fact, in 1991, the United  States Department of the Interior agreed, stating: ``The imposition of  risk upon the Prairie Island Indian community is an unreasonable  burden.''   Prairie Island is just one community shouldering this burden. The  city of Red Wing and the citizens of Goodhue County expect better.   In fact, my constituents reminded me that, by law, the repository  should have been open in 1998, stating: But it is not our  responsibility to remind Congress to do its job. They are right.   I urge my colleagues to uphold our promise and vote in favor of this  bill.
