 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today my thoughts, my prayers, and  condolences are with everyone whose lives were ripped apart because of  the awful fire in the apartments that ignited yesterday at the Twin  Parks North West tower in the Bronx. Seventeen people lost their lives  in yesterday's fire, including eight innocent children. Dozens of  others were injured, many critically so. We pray for their recovery.  Many are still in the ICU.   It was the deadliest fire in New York City in the last 30 years, an  unspeakable tragedy made a thousand times worse because it happened  within the confines of people's own homes--places that should be safe,  should be secure, should be shielded from moments of terror like the  ones we saw yesterday.   I grieve for all the families, friends, and neighbors whose lives  were suddenly cut short in the fire. Many were from immigrant families,  people who came to our city to start climbing up the ladders of  prosperity and a decent life for themselves and their children in this  beautiful country, and now they are lost.   I commend the brave firefighters who stepped up to beat back the  fire, save lives, and keep the surrounding communities safe. They did  not think about their own safety. They just answered the call and did  their jobs. That is what firefighters do. We respect them. We love  them. I am profoundly grateful for them and all the workers who are  rebuilding from the damage, as well as the health workers tending to  the injured.   Last night, I joined with the Governor, Mayor Adams, and with other  members of the city and local government. It was a broad group because  New York always pulls together in times of tragedy, and we had people  [[Page S105]]  from all parts of this city and all different backgrounds coming  together to support those families impacted by the fire. At the Federal  level, we will do whatever we can--housing assistance, disaster  assistance, and help for all immigrant families.   Many of those affected by the fire came from Gambia and other West  African countries on a program called Diversity Visa, which I was proud  to author. I say to these immigrant families: Do not hesitate to reach  out to local and Federal authorities. You will find nothing but a  helping hand.   When tragedy strikes our city, New Yorkers come together. We embrace  one another. We help however we can. And we always find ways to come  back stronger than before. That has been true throughout our city's  history, and it shall remain true as we get through this latest, awful  tragedy.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I understand there are 18 bills at the  desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    A few moments ago, I went through the typical rule XIV  process, which the majority leader always does to place legislation  from both minority and majority on the legislative calendar. It is  merely technical.   Now, the Republican leader seems to want to place a bunch of  ``gotcha'' bills on the legislative calendar that he thinks would be  tough votes for Democrats to take as some kind of payback for pursuing  legislation to protect the sacred right to vote.   Well, we Democrats aren't afraid of these votes, so what I propose to  the Republican leader is that the Senate hold up-or-down votes at a  majority threshold on each of the Republican bills he has outlined  tonight, as well as the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act.   Let me say again. In a few moments, I will ask unanimous consent to  have the Senate vote on the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act, and all the so-called tough bills the  Republican leader is proposing tonight at a majority threshold.   We believe the right to vote, to protect our democracy, to get rid of  dark money from elections, to end gerrymandering to ensure the American  people pick their elected leaders, not politicians, is so important, I  would hope the Republican leader would go along with this proposal.   Our caucus strongly disagrees with the Republican bills on this list,  but for the sake of our democracy and getting to a majority vote on  voting rights, we are willing to vote.   So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican  leader, that the Senate vote on passage of the following bills in the  order listed; that there be no motions or amendments in order to the  bills; and that the passage be at a majority threshold, all without  intervening action or debate: S. 2747, the Freedom to Vote Act; H.R. 4,  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act; S. 3452; S. 3453; S.  3454; S. 3455; S. 3456; S. 3457; S. 3458; S. 3459; S. 3460; S. 3461; S.  3462; S. 3463; S. 3464; S. 3465; S. 3466; S. 3467; S. 3468; and S.  3469.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S. 450 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Burr  substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3451, introduced earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 486, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until 11 a.m.,  Tuesday, January 11; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate  proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Davidson  nomination postcloture; that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until  2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; further, that all  postcloture time on the Davidson nomination expire at 2:20 p.m. and  that the Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination; finally,  that if any nominations are confirmed during today's session, the  motion to reconsider be considered made  [[Page S122]]  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:05 p.m., recessed until 11  a.m., on Tuesday, January 11, 2022.                            ____________________
