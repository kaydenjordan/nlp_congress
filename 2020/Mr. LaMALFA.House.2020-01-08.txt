 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend President Trump  for his actions in dealing with Iran.   The White House has shown restraint up to this point, since Iran has  been a bad actor going all the way back to 1979, one of the largest  sponsors of terror the world has ever seen.   The President has been patient, and, finally, with the actions  recently at the embassy, took that step to eliminate General Soleimani,  which was needed in order to not only send a message but stop a lot of  the carnage.   Moving forward, we hope for and wish for true freedom for the people  of Iran so that they would be able to live more like they did pre-1979,  with the freedom, especially for women, to associate as they please.   This is not about regime change, and it is not about wanting to start  a war. It is about, indeed, helping our neighbors and our colleagues in  the Middle East to have stability from the state sponsor of terror.                            ____________________
