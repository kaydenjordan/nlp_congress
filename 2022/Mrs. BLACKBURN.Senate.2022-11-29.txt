 Madam President, on behalf of myself and Mr.  Hagerty, I ask unanimous consent that the following remarks be printed  in the Congressional Record to honor our fellow Tennessean, Amy Grant.   Each year, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts selects  a handful of cultural luminaries to receive the Kennedy Center Honors  for their lifetime artistic achievements. On behalf of the entire  Tennessee congressional delegation and all Tennesseans, we want to  congratulate contemporary Christian and pop singer-  [[Page S6850]]  songwriter Amy Grant on her inclusion in the 45th annual honoree class.   A quick glance at Amy's more than 40 years in the spotlight reveals  an iconic popstar, songwriter, television personality, and  philanthropist who never forgot her gospel roots. The thing that makes  Amy special, though, isn't her long list of accolades, but how she used  her personal faith in Christ to build bridges between the welcoming  contemporary Christian genre and the secular confines of popular music.   All artist-songwriters find success when they strike at the very  center of what makes the human heart ache, whether it be for a love  found, a life lost, or the infinite potential of what could be. These  emotions are humanity's great equalizers. But for gospel artist- songwriters, faith, and not emotion, is the touchstone. For these brave  and gifted individuals, assurance comes not from an endless cycle of  love, hurt, and healing, but from a far more enduring source of hope.   We could not be more pleased to see the Kennedy Center recognize the  importance of Amy's work in helping new generations embrace that hope,  and we join the artistic community in thanking her for sharing her  gifts with the world.                            ____________________     Madam President, every year, Music City  luminaries gather to celebrate entertainers and other giants in the  arts with the Cecil Scaife Visionary Award. While statuettes do have  their charms, this award highlights true champions of creativity whose  life and work have made it possible for future generations to realize  careers in the music industry. This year, I have the privilege of  congratulating the oft imitated, never duplicated, positively  incomparable Brenda Lee as she accepts this special honor.   Even in today's strange world of social media sensations and cross- discipline collaborations, success in the entertainment industry is  hard to come by. And if mainstream popularity is a pipe dream, it is  safe to consider crossover success on a global scale almost impossible  to achieve.   Still, for many of Nashville's rising stars, this pinnacle of  artistic achievement is the only measure of professional success worth  striving for. But who is to mentor these dreamers? Who sets the  standard? If you ask them, they will surely point to Brenda Lee.   Brenda Lee's stunning vocal talent put her on stage at 6, in the  studio at 12, and on the international tour circuit by her early teens.  Her third single climbed both the pop and country charts, and over the  next 20 years, she achieved pop stardom, pop-to-country crossover  success, and international fame. That she did this at all is  remarkable; but how she did it is what makes Brenda Lee a phenomenon.  Her career was not the product of clever gimmicks, but the  manifestation of her own personal tastes, desires, and instincts in  song. In a world of mimics, Brenda Lee dismissed convention and created  something new.   I have always believed that there is no secret sauce that separates  the successful from the legendary, but if there is, its main ingredient  is surely the spark of captivating individualism that Brenda embraced  over the course of her more than 60 years in the spotlight. And while  young artists could never hope to replicate her career, her legacy  serves as a reminder that, yes, you can conquer this industry, if only  you have the courage to do it on your own terms.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to honor a true  Music City legend. For more than 50 years, Ray Stevens has delighted  audiences with his talents as a comedian, an actor, a musician, and a  songwriter. His unique vision for the future of entertainment allowed  him to blaze trails no other artists would dare tread alone.   As a fellow Tennessean, and one of Ray's biggest fans, you can  believe me when I say that you have never seen anything like Ray  Stevens. It would have been easy for him to justify resting on his  laurels while Music City grew around him, but if you know Ray, you know  that was never a possibility. Although he achieved fame for his work in  the creative arts, he is best known for leading with laughter,  kindness, and an unfailing desire to encourage fellow artists.   In 1971, Ray and a group of fellow Music Row luminaries led by Cecil  Scaife came together to create a music business program at Belmont  University, where aspiring entertainers could exercise both their  talents and their business acumen. This tremendous effort changed the  industry for the better and set an example for the city's rising stars.  Today, the Cecil Scaife Visionary Award is given annually to those  whose life and work have made it possible for future generations to  realize careers in the music industry, and I could not have been  happier when I learned that Ray is one of this year's recipients.   Ray, on behalf of all Tennesseans, I thank you for your devotion to  the arts, your zest for life, and for going above and beyond on behalf  all who hope to walk in your footsteps.                            ____________________
