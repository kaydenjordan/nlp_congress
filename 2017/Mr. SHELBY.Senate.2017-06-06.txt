 Madam President, today I wish to mark the retirement of  VADM James D. Syring from the U.S. Navy following more than three  decades of military service to this great Nation.   In his last post, he served as the Director of the United States  Missile Defense Agency, MDA. As Director, Admiral Syring made enormous  contributions to the successful development and fielding of the  Ballistic Missile Defense System, BMDS, in order to protect our Nation,  American troops deployed abroad, our allies, and our international  partners.   Beginning as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, the Navy  recognized his potential early on and designated him an engineering  duty officer, where he served in various assignments.   Upon selection to flag rank in 2010, Admiral Syring served as the  program executive officer for Integrated Warfare Systems, where he  managed integrated weapons systems for ships, submarines, carriers, and  aircraft within the Fleet and Joint Force.   His intellect, work ethic, and ability to deliver complex weapons  systems resulted in his being nominated and confirmed as the ninth  Director of MDA in November 2012, the first naval officer to assume the  directorship of this multibillion-dollar Agency. He oversaw MDA's  worldwide mission to develop and deliver to the warfighter a capability  to defend the United States against ballistic missile attacks. He has  done an outstanding job.   During his time at MDA, the Agency and the Department of Defense made  significant progress in addressing current and emerging ballistic  missile threats of all ranges. The progress made is even more  remarkable considering the budget cuts sustained during that time. In  response to the growing North Korean ICBM threat, Admiral Syring  implemented a program to expand the capacity of homeland missile  defenses. His leadership brought acquisition rigor to the critical  Ground-based Midcourse Defense--GMD--Program and laid the foundation  for the Agency to implement ground system modernization, a robust  ground-based interceptor--GBI--Stockpile Reliability Program, as well  as the Redesigned Kill Vehicle Program.   Under Admiral Syring's steady hand, the Agency successfully fielded a  new data terminal at Fort Drum, NY, providing the warfighter the  capability to improve communication with homeland defense interceptors.   He also oversaw a strategy to improve the overall sensor and  discrimination capability of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. With  the Long Range Discrimination Radar--LRDR--Program, MDA will deploy an  improved persistent midcourse BMDS discrimination capability to enhance  the Pacific architecture. The program today is within cost and is on  schedule to deliver an initial capability to the warfighter in 2020.  Those most familiar with major defense acquisition programs know that  this is no small accomplishment.   Overall, Admiral Syring's advocacy for additional interceptor  capacity, improved GBI reliability, a redesigned kill vehicle, and LRDR  resulted in a fielded system that meets the threat today and is well- positioned to be expanded upon for future challenges.   Admiral Syring was also responsible for major BMDS asset deployments  around the globe. He strengthened regional defenses by continuing  deliveries of terminal high altitude area defense--THAAD--interceptors  and Standard Missile-3--SM-3--Block IBs for use on Aegis Ballistic  Missile Defense ships and at Aegis Ashore sites. He took steps to  ensure that the United States remained committed to the planned  European phased adaptive approach--EPAA--deployments.   He oversaw the delivery of the Aegis Ashore system in Romania in  support of EPAA Phase 2, which was accepted for operations by the  warfighter in May 2016. In addition, under his leadership, construction  of the Aegis Ashore  [[Page S3284]]  site in Poland commenced to improve European NATO defenses against  medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. He kept the Agency  on track to deliver by the end of 2018 the initial SM-3 Block IIA  missiles developed in cooperation with Japan to support EPAA Phase 3.   Additionally, Admiral Syring supported successful negotiations  between the United States and the Republic of Korea, ROK, on the  deployment of a THAAD battery to the ROK, shoring up defenses against  the growing threat from North Korean ballistic missiles.   In order to deal with future missile threats, Admiral Syring pursued  an advanced technology program with the goal of reducing the cost of  engaging increasing and complex ballistic missile threats.   Finally, Admiral Syring successfully initiated the development of an  experimental space sensor layer for the BMDS, a new, low-cost program  called Space-based Kill Assessment, SKA. The program will increase the  performance of the BMDS by collecting data on missile intercepts, a  critical capability of which the significance cannot be overstated.   Our Nation has long hoped and, indeed, expected that we will always  be able to recruit and retain capable individuals with a strong sense  of patriotism, who will spend their careers ensuring that our country  is safe in peacetime and capable in time of war. The contributions that  VADM James D. Syring made to the Missile Defense Agency, the U.S. Navy,  and the national security of the United States of America over his  career have again shown our Nation's hopes are not too great to be met.  As he retires after more than three decades of military service, I wish  him and his family well, and I hope he has a deep appreciation of his  legacy to this Nation and of the gratitude of his fellow citizens.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to the work  and 37-year career of Ms. Nancy E. DiCarlo on the occasion of her  retirement from the Department of Defense.   Since January 2007, Ms. DiCarlo has served as the Director for  International Affairs for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. In this  capacity, Ms. DiCarlo has played an important role in the successful  initial fielding of our integrated, layered, ballistic missile defense  system, which currently protects our Nation, American troops deployed  abroad, and our friends and allies from attack by ballistic missiles.   Ms. DiCarlo's career has been marked by increasing responsibility  across a number of departments and programs important to the national  security of the United States. Beginning her career in the Department  of the U.S. Navy, Ms. DiCarlo contributed to the cost, schedule, and  performance of the Navy's F/A-18 international programs, undersea  surveillance programs, electronic hardware programs, and logistics  programs.   Her performance caught the attention of the Assistant Secretary of  the Navy for Research, Development & Acquisition, who selected Ms.  DiCarlo to join the Navy acquisition team. In this role, she worked on  a strategic implementation plan and performance measures across the  Navy acquisition enterprise.   Ms. DiCarlo went on to join the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation  Agency and lead both military and civilian staff in the management of  Asian, European, NATO, and African security cooperation strategy,  programs, and engagement. She was later selected for the Senior  Executive Service and named as MDA's Director for International Affairs  for MDA, where she diligently promoted U.S. national security goals and  objectives.   Her service has assisted the sale of U.S. missile defense assets  which has strengthened the cooperation of our international partners,  thereby expanding the capabilities and effectiveness of U.S. missile  defenses.   Additionally, Ms. DiCarlo's efforts have enhanced the U.S.  partnership with the Government of Israel on missile defense programs.  As the lead U.S. negotiator, she instituted codevelopment programs for  the David's Sling Weapon System to defend Israel against long-range  rockets and short-range ballistic missile threats and for the Upper  Tier Interceptor Program as part of the Arrow Weapon System designed to  defend Israel against longer-range ballistic missile threats. Ms.  DiCarlo led negotiations with Israel on coproduction agreements for  Iron Dome and David's Sling Weapon Systems.   The American people rely upon civilian and uniformed Federal  employees to protect and advance their interests. Our country has been  fortunate to have had Ms. Nancy DiCarlo's dedication and contribution  to our Nation's defense for nearly four decades.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in recognizing Ms.  Nancy DiCarlo for her work and thanking all of the men and women of the  Missile Defense Agency for their service to our Nation.                            ____________________
