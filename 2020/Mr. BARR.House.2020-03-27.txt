 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of central  Kentucky in support of the most aggressive fiscal stimulus in American  history.   Founding Father John Adams famously said that every problem is an  opportunity in disguise. This insidious virus, and the resulting  shutdown of our economy, is a very serious problem. But because of the  spirit of the American people, it is also an opportunity.   It is an opportunity to support the heroic work of America's  hospitals, healthcare workers, and doctors and give them the resources  they need to stay safe and take care of the sick.   It is an opportunity to go to war against this virus, to unleash the  creative energies of America's private sector, and to help our  scientists and researchers find therapies, a vaccine, and a cure.   It is an opportunity to give American workers, small business owners,  and families the cash flow they need to get back to work.   It is an opportunity to provide liquidity and financial support to  our markets to fuel a powerful economic recovery.   And it is an opportunity to come together as a Nation, not as  Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans, to rise to the occasion, as  we have done so many times before, to confront this challenge and  deliver a stronger, healthier, and more prosperous America.
