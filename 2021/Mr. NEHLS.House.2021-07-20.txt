 Madam Speaker, the Consumer Price Index rose 5.4 percent  in the last year, the highest inflation in 13 years.   Americans are paying more for nearly everything. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of milk is up 5.6 percent; the  price of fruit is up 7.3 percent; and the price of gas is up a whopping  45 percent.   Americans are paying more for goods and services because of the  Democrats' out-of-control spending. Despite the dire economic state  Democrats' reckless spending has put us in, they are now trying to ram  through a partisan $3.5 trillion package that will raise taxes on the  middle class and job creators.   What are Democrats telling American businesses to do when they are  going to raise taxes and impose regulations on them as they try to  rebuild in the aftermath of a pandemic? They are telling them to take  their business overseas.   To bounce back from the Biden administration's dismal job reports in  consecutive months, we need to be stimulating economic opportunity and  growth with less taxes and less regulation. Doing so will help spur the  creation of good-paying jobs that encourage people to get back in the  workforce.   What won't fix it is continuing to throw money at the economy, which  seems to be all the Washington swamp knows how to do. The Democrats'  liberal tax-and-spend model is failing our economy and failing the  American people.   We are not going to spend our way out of this mess with trillion- dollar programs that do nothing but serve liberal special interests. We  do it by letting the free market flourish through lower taxes, lower  regulation, and more economic freedom.   It worked under President Trump when he set records in unemployment,  and it will work again if only the Federal Government would get out of  the way and empower the people and the free market.                            ____________________
