 Mr. Speaker, people every day are struggling to make  sense of the most challenging times our Nation has seen in more than a  century, and that is saying something.   A hundred years ago, we were recovering from the Spanish flu pandemic  that hit America hard and people around the globe. Ten years later, we  had the stock market crash, the Great Depression, and massive  unemployment.   But today, we have all of those circumstances and more. We are in the  middle of a pandemic. We have the resulting economic upheaval. We  reached near depression-era levels of unemployment, and rather than  take 3 years, as happened in the 1930s, it has happened in a matter of  3 weeks.   We have the climate crisis which my colleagues have addressed so  eloquently today both in terms of the challenge and what we can do  about it. Luckily, the world is finally acknowledging that, but it is  still too slow to respond.   We have some lessons that we, I think, have learned from what we  quaintly called the Great Recession of 10 years ago. As somebody who  was legislating in the middle of it and watching the impact in my  community and around the country, it seemed horrific. But it pales by  comparison with what people are facing today and the demands for racial  justice.   My colleagues in introducing their handiwork of the Select Committee  on the Climate Crisis all acknowledged that that is at the forefront of  our thinking. There is a recognition that demands for racial justice,  long overdue and now widely acknowledged, is more than just law  enforcement and criminal justice reform.   Racial justice means addressing the dramatic health disparities that  have been put in the spotlight as a result of the COVID-19 disaster. It  means they must address the housing defunction in this country, the  lack of affordable housing, a crisis of homelessness, people on the  verge of losing their homes to eviction, and foreclosure that is  looming on the horizon.   We need more affordable housing and we need more of it if we are  going to deal with those demands for racial justice. We need safer,  sustainable communities and economic justice and opportunities.   Luckily, the House this week is dealing with ways to advance a vision  that addresses all of those. The climate blueprint that has been  acknowledged, the hard work of the Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis to protect the climate, protect the planet, also has embedded in  it: opportunities to improve the quality of life in every community,  new economic opportunities that will be widely shared, reducing costs  for families, and strengthening the capacity of local government to  meet their climate challenge.   H.R. 2, the handiwork of my friend and colleague, Peter DeFazio, the  chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is a modest  1,067 pages. It is full of opportunities to rebuild and renew America  in a sustainable fashion, to share economic opportunity, to have a low- carbon future, energy efficiency, and electrification of the  transportation system. Part of it rescues the post office, replacing  hundreds of thousands of their vehicles with electric cars which will  help build the platform for further electrification.   These are a variety of elements that, woven together, is a new vision  for Congress and this country. It can start yet before we adjourn this  Congress. I hope that we will have some bipartisan cooperation to  embrace these critical principles and move that forward.   But the extent to which there is delay, we are setting the stage for  the next Congress, for the next administration being able to engage  people around the country with a new way of rebuilding and renewing  America, making our families safer, healthier, and more economically  secure.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2,  which reflects years of hard work with my staff, with hundreds of  advocates, innovators, and local officials to deal with the challenges  of a sustainable transportation future, especially in a time of  upheaval. I appreciate the committee and staff reflecting these  opportunities.   It includes a national clearinghouse to research the secondary  impacts of autonomous vehicles that my friend from Washington just  talked about.   It adds bikeshare as an eligible expense for CMAQ funding.   It provides Federal funds for cities and States to establish and  implement Vision Zero plans to protect quality of life and reduce the  carnage on the highways.   It increases funding for State road user charge pilot projects that  is the vision for the future of how to fund transportation.   It increases small starts reauthorization.   It increases the volume cap on private activity bonds issued for  surface transportation.   It increases the value of the historic tax credit and makes it more  accessible for different types of projects.   Most critically, when we are dealing with renewable energy projects,  it provides for direct payment in lieu of tax credits for renewable  energy projects at a time when there is less appetite for traditional  tax credits.   It clarifies that energy storage projects qualify for investment tax  credits to spur the development.   It increases the value of section 179D energy efficient commercial  buildings that we have worked on with them for years.   It reinstates the bicycle commuter tax, increases the value of the  benefits, and allows them to be used with transit funds.   These are the nuts and bolts of often technical elements that form  the basis for action and progress in the future.   I look forward to working with the vast array of stakeholders that  are counting on us to make this visionary document a reality.    Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the gentleman's  courtesy, and I appreciate the work that he has done. I admire his  restraint in his response to the gentleman from Louisiana, who in the  beginning of his comments acknowledged that Chairman DeFazio spent time  with him going over a variety of things, for a person in the minority  party, a relatively junior Member. That is how Congressman DeFazio  operates.   He studied under Bud Shuster and Jim Oberstar back when we were  putting things together big picture, standing up to Newt Gingrich and  Bill Clinton, dealing with those financing issues.   This piece of legislation, I think, is the most consequential since  we had the ISTEA legislation. And in a sense, I think it is more  consequential, because it ties together all of these pieces in terms of  resilience, climate change, dealing with decades of neglect in terms of  resources and people who are too timid in moving forward. I am in awe  of all of the pieces that have been fit together. And if people will  examine the elements of this bill, they will understand that.   Yes, there are incentives for electric vehicles. There are also  resources here to study a new way of financing, dealing with road user  charges. The pieces fit together and provide a foundation for us going  forward.   This is a blueprint. It is a point of departure. It is not the  finished product, but it is what we are going to be dealing with in the  House, I think, throughout the next year-and-a-half as we are meeting  the challenges that have been given to us.   There may be people like Trump who claim that they want to spend $1  trillion or $2 trillion. This is a plan for the future. This ties the  pieces together. This is climate friendly. This is economically  visionary. This provides the tools to local governments that have been  waiting for the Federal Government to step up and honor that  partnership.   I thank the gentleman for what he is doing and look forward to  working with him to build on it as it moves its way through the  legislative process. And ultimately this is going to be enacted into  law. It is a framework for where America will go.
