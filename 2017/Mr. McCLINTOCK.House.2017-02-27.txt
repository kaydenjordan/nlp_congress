Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 88, introduced by Representative Marsha Blackburn  of Tennessee, expands the boundaries of the Shiloh National Military  Park to include 2,126 acres of battlefields in Corinth and designates  the Parker's Crossroads Battlefield as an affiliated area of the  National Park System.   The Battle of Shiloh was one of the bloodiest battles in the history  of this Nation and a turning point of which it was once said that,  after Shiloh, the South never smiled again. The Battle of Parker's  Crossroads was fought later that year and, though not as decisive a  battle as Shiloh, was worthy of preservation in remembrance of the  fallen.   I would like to add something on a personal note. I would like to  speak of Private James H. Ewing, of the Third Iowa Volunteer Infantry  Regiment, the fifth of 10 children of James and Agnes Ewing of Marshall  County, Iowa. The family had begun in Ohio and journeyed to the  frontier of Iowa, following Horace Greely's advice to go west and grow  with the Nation. In 1861, that Nation was torn apart by secession.  James Ewing met President Lincoln's call to defend her and was 24 years  old when he was killed on April 6, 1862, at Pittsburg Landing on the  first day of the Battle of Shiloh.   The words of his younger brother, John, written 64 years later, in  1926, expressed both the enduring anguish of that loss with equal parts  of enduring pride, saying: ``Brother James gave up his life at the  Battle of Shiloh . . . fighting to save our free government.'' That  free government survived because of the sacrifices and suffering of  these brave young men, and I am honored to speak the name of one of  them in this Chamber today.   Private James H. Ewing is one of 3,584 courageous Americans whose  graves our Nation has cared for and honored through the generations  that have followed at Shiloh. This bill assures that several more of  the battlefields they struggled on will be preserved in a cohesive  unit. Our family remains proud of him to this day and grateful to  Congresswoman Blackburn for bringing forward this bill to assure that  the sacrifices, gallantry, and idealism of those young men who  struggled at Bloody Shiloh shall never be forgotten by their larger  family, the American people.   This bill would preserve approximately 2,126 acres of that  battlefield associated with the Siege of Corinth, including the Fallen  Timbers, Russell House, and Davis Bridge Battlefields. The National  Park Service determined that each of these sites provides extensive  opportunities for visitor use and interpretation or the potential for  archeological research. An identical version of this legislation passed  the House of Representatives last Congress.   I commend Representative Blackburn for her work to preserve these  historically significant sites, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the author of this  measure.  [[Page H1326]]         Mr. Speaker, I would join in asking for adoption of  this measure.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 228) to amend the Indian Employment, Training and Related  Services Demonstration Act of 1992 to facilitate the ability of Indian  tribes to integrate the employment, training, and related services from  diverse Federal sources, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 228, the Indian Employment, Training and Related  Services Consolidation Act, is sponsored by my colleague from Alaska,  Congressman Don Young. This bipartisan legislation would make the  Tribal 477 Program permanent and make improvements to its  administration.   The 477 Program was established by Congress in 1992 as a  demonstration program. It allows tribes to combine employment,  childcare, and job training funding from a variety of Federal sources  and conduct consolidated, comprehensive reporting. The 477 Program  embodies tribal self-determination by allowing tribes to provide  opportunities tailored to the unique needs of their communities.   The bill improves accounting procedures and reporting mechanisms to  uphold the original intent of the program, ensures that agencies treat  tribes fairly, and sets a foundation for participants' continued  success.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Kevin Brady of the Ways and Means  Committee and Chairwoman Virginia Foxx of the Education and the  Workforce Committee for agreeing to help expedite consideration of this  bill.   I urge adoption of H.R. 228.   I reserve the balance of my time.

Dear Chairman Bishop: I write concerning H.R. 228, the       ``Indian Employment, Training and Related Services       Consolidation Act of 2017,'' which was referred to the       Committee on Natural Resources.

The Committee on Ways and       Means takes this action with our mutual understanding that by       foregoing formal consideration of H.R. 228, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward. Our Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation, and asks that you support any such       request.

This       discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support having       the Committee on Ways and Means represented on the conference       committee. Finally, to memorialize our understanding, I would       be pleased to include your letter and this response in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered by the       House.

Thank you for consulting with the Committee on       Education and the Workforce with regard to H.R. 228 on those       matters within my committee's jurisdiction and making       improvements to the legislation to address concerns.        The Committee on Education and the Workforce will not delay       further consideration of this bill. However, I do so only       with the understanding this procedural route will not be       construed to prejudice my committee's jurisdictional interest       and prerogatives on this bill or any other similar       legislation and will not be considered as precedent for       consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to my       committee in the future.        I respectfully request your support for the appointment of       outside conferees from the  [[Page H1330]]       Committee on Education and the Workforce should this bill or       a similar bill be considered in a conference with the Senate.       I also request you include our exchange of letters on this       matter in the Congressional Record during consideration of       this bill on the House Floor. Thank you for your attention to       these matters.            Sincerely,                                                     Virginia Foxx,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chairwoman, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chairman: H.R. 228, Indian Employment, Training       and Related Services Consolidation Act of 2017, was       introduced on January 3, 2017.        I understand our staffs have been able to negotiate out       text that is agreeable to you. Therefore, I ask that you       allow the Committee on Education and the Workforce to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill, so that       this revised text for H.R. 228 may be scheduled by the       majority leader. This discharge in no way affects your       jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will       not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition,       should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support       having the Committee on Education and the Workforce       represented on the conference committee. Finally, to       memorialize our understanding, I would be pleased to include       your letter and this response in the Congressional Record       when the bill is considered by the House.        Thank you for your response and cooperation. I look forward       to further opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the legendary gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 699) to amend the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009  to modify provisions relating to certain land exchanges in the Mt. Hood  Wilderness in the State of Oregon.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 699         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land       Exchange Clarification Act''.       SEC. 2. COOPER SPUR LAND EXCHANGE CLARIFICATION AMENDMENTS.         Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act       of 2009 (Public Law 111-11; 123 Stat. 1018) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``120 acres'' and       inserting ``107 acres''; and        (B) in subparagraph (E)(ii), by inserting ``improvements,''       after ``buildings,''; and        (2) in paragraph (2)--        (A) in subparagraph (D)--        (i) in clause (i), by striking ``As soon as practicable       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary and       Mt. Hood Meadows shall select'' and inserting ``Not later       than 120 days after the date of the enactment of the Mount       Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act, the       Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows shall jointly select'';        (ii) in clause (ii), in the matter preceding subclause (I),       by striking ``An appraisal under clause (i) shall'' and       inserting ``Except as provided under clause (iii), an       appraisal under clause (i) shall assign a separate value to       each tax lot to allow for the equalization of values and'';       and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(iii) Final appraised value.--         ``(I) In general.--Subject to subclause (II), after the       final appraised value of the Federal land and the non-Federal       land are determined and approved by the Secretary, the       Secretary shall not be required to reappraise or update the       final appraised value for a period of up to 3 years,       beginning on the date of the approval by the Secretary of the       final appraised value.        ``(II) Exception.--Subclause (I) shall not apply if the       condition of either the Federal land or the non-Federal land       referred to in subclause (I) is significantly and       substantially altered by fire, windstorm, or other events.         ``(iv) Public review.--Before completing the land exchange       under this Act, the Secretary shall make available for public       review the complete appraisals of the land to be       exchanged.''; and        (B) by striking subparagraph (G) and inserting the       following:        ``(G) Required conveyance conditions.--Prior to the       exchange of the Federal and non-Federal land--        ``(i) the Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows may mutually agree       for the Secretary to reserve a conservation easement to       protect the identified wetland in accordance with applicable       law, subject to the requirements that--         ``(I) the conservation easement shall be consistent with       the terms of the September 30, 2015, mediation between the       Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows; and        ``(II) in order to take effect, the conservation easement       shall be finalized not later than 120 days after the date of       enactment of the Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange       Clarification Act; and         ``(ii) the Secretary shall reserve a 24-foot-wide       nonexclusive trail easement at the existing trail locations       on the Federal land that retains for the United States       existing rights to construct, reconstruct, maintain, and       permit nonmotorized use by the public of existing trails       subject to the right of the owner of the Federal land--         ``(I) to cross the trails with roads, utilities, and       infrastructure facilities; and        ``(II) to improve or relocate the trails to accommodate       development of the Federal land.         ``(H) Equalization of values.--        ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in       addition to or in lieu of monetary compensation, a lesser       area of Federal land or non-Federal land may be conveyed if       necessary to equalize appraised values of the exchange       properties, without limitation, consistent with the       requirements of this Act and subject to the approval of the       Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows.        ``(ii) Treatment of certain compensation or conveyances as       donation.--If, after payment of compensation or adjustment of       land area subject to exchange under this Act, the amount by       which the appraised value of the land and other property       conveyed by Mt. Hood Meadows under subparagraph (A) exceeds       the appraised value of the land conveyed by the Secretary       under subparagraph (A) shall be considered a donation by Mt.       Hood Meadows to the United States.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 699, the Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange  Clarification Act, was introduced by Congressman Greg Walden and  cosponsored by Congressman Earl Blumenauer to address an ongoing land  exchange issue in the State of Oregon.   In 2009, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act authorized a land  exchange in Government Camp, Oregon. This land exchange was supposed to  be completed within 16 months of the enactment of the legislation;  however, this still has not occurred more than 7 years later. The long  delay, primarily due to disagreements surrounding easement terms, has  frustrated local communities such as Mt. Hood Meadows and other local  groups.   This legislation, along with the Senate companion, comes as a result  of a mediation session held by the Forest Service in September 2015 to  resolve longstanding issues between the agency and the local community.  Subsequently, the parties released a joint statement that they arrived  at mutually satisfactory terms during the mediation session.   H.R. 699 updates the details and process for the land exchange to  clarify issues relating to land appraisals and the parameters of a  wetland conservation easement on the Federal portion of the conveyance.  This legislation also includes several technical provisions, including  changes to conveyance conditions regarding wetland boundaries on the  Federal land, reservation of a nonexclusive trail easement, and  equalization of values of the exchange properties.   This bill was amended in committee last Congress to address concerns  raised by the Forest Service, including clarifying language for the  easement allowed in the bill and the length of time allowed for the  Forest Service to implement this legislation.   It is illustrative of the state of Federal Land Management that the  Forest Service has not already carried out the provisions of this bill.  This bill previously passed the House in September 2016, and it is my  hope that the Senate will see fit to act on the legislation during this  Congress.   I appreciate Congressman Walden's continuous efforts to see this  issue addressed once and for all, and I hope my colleagues will join me  in supporting this bill. I urge adoption of the measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the author of  this measure, whose dogged determination has brought us within reach of  resolving this dispute.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers and yet  another show of bipartisan comity.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of this measure.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 863) to facilitate the addition of park administration at  the Coltsville National Historical Park, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 863         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO COLTSVILLE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK                     DONATION SITE.         Section 3032(b)(2)(B) of Public Law 113-291 (16 U.S.C.       410qqq) is amended by striking ``East Armory'' and inserting       ``Colt Armory Complex''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 863 was introduced by Representative John Larson of  Connecticut. Originally, the National Park Service was required to  acquire 10,000 square feet of space in East Armory of Coltsville. This  measure would allow the National Park Service to acquire that space  within any part of the Colt Armory Complex in Hartford, Connecticut.   Coltsville was the home of Samuel Colt's industrial enterprise,  Colt's Manufacturing Company. In Hartford, Samuel Colt developed the  use of the assembly line and highly mechanized techniques. Colt's  Manufacturing Company not only transformed the firearms industry, but  it was a major contributor to the industrial revolution by pioneering  the use of interchangeable parts and precision manufacturing.   Colt's success brought him fame and wealth. He became one of the 10  wealthiest businessmen in the United States, a pillar of the Hartford  community, and was given the honorary title of colonel by the Governor  of Connecticut.   This small modification to current law would provide the Park Service  flexibility in selecting a location for park administrative offices and  visitor services at the Coltsville site. A nearly identical bill passed  the House last Congress by voice vote.   I commend Representative Larson for his work on this legislation. I  urge passage of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, certainly  none that could match the detailed knowledge and eloquence of the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure and look  forward to taking Representative Larson up on his kind invitation for  the great opening.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H1334]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.
