 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor survivors during  National Gun Violence Survivors Week.   Tragically, this week, sisters Deja and Abbaney Matts of Garland were  killed, and Abbaney's toddler was injured at a shooting at Texas A&M- Commerce University. The shooter was believed to be her ex-boyfriend,  who was recently charged with aggravated assault for attacking Abbaney.   I send my deepest condolences to the Matts family.   To honor the Matts and to underscore the need for action, I want to  share a letter 6-year-old Cal Bingham of Rowlett sent me after the mass  shootings in El Paso at Midland. He wrote: ``When kids get shot, that's  less friends to play with. When I grow up, I don't want to hear about  anymore on the news about people being killed with guns. What are you  going to do to help make us safer?''   I want my son, Jordan, and kids like Cal to grow up without fear of  gun violence. I call on the Senate to act and pass the bipartisan bills  that we have passed in this House, including background checks and the  Violence Against Women Act. Our children are watching.                            ____________________
