 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus Health Braintrust to commemorate National Minority Health  Month and to challenge Congress to take bold action to end health  disparities that continue to plague our communities.   Mr. Speaker, it is a sad fact that in America your race, class, and  ZIP Code very much determine how long you will live and how healthy you  will be; whether you will die of a heart attack in your forties or  develop type 2 diabetes and lose a limb.   These three factors speak volumes about your life and health. That is  just wrong, and it is up to us to change that.   From cradle to grave, and at every stage in between, people of color,  low-income people, rural Americans, Native Americans, and first- generation Americans are sicker, receive less care, have less access to  care, and, tragically, die sooner.   In 2010, we took a major leap forward with the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. This law has started to reduce these disparities  by increasing access to care, ensuring mental healthcare, expanding  research, and creating a  [[Page H3152]]  pipeline of doctors and medical professionals from underrepresented  communities.    A major result of the ACA has been to cut the excessive risk of  cancer death in half for African-American men. The same risk factor for  Black women was reduced by seven points, according to the American  Cancer Society's 2017 report.   They clearly state: ``Increasing access to care as a result of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may contribute to a further  narrowing of the racial gap across all population groups.''   However, the ACA is not just fighting cancer. It is improving other  aspects of care and increasing access to care.   While the Affordable Care Act has made major strides, disparities  remain deeply entrenched in our society and our healthcare system  today.   Today, I would like to talk about several of them. The first and most  entrenched is access to care. Far too often, the sickest among our  neighbors are those with the least access to the care they need. They  cannot see a provider because they can't afford it, can't get the time  off work, can't find transportation; or there is simply no care  available in their community.   Let's work together to make sure that everyone can get the care they  need, no matter where they live, whether in a city, the suburbs, or on  a farm.   This Minority Health Month, we must also address the challenge of  mental health being stigmatized in communities of color.   We know that African Americans are 20 percent more likely to report  serious psychological distress than their White counterparts, but just  25 percent will seek care, compared to 40 percent of White Americans.   Thankfully, there are some great organizations, like New York City's  First Lady Chirlane McCray's Cities Thrive Coalition, working to  deconstruct the stigma and improve access to care, but much work  remains.   Just like with mental health, another health subset, maternal health,  shows stark differences between different demographic groups.   Mr. Speaker, it is a shame and a tragedy that America is the only  developed nation where women die from childbirth now more than they did  in the recent past.   Despite technology and innovation, it is becoming more dangerous to  have a child, especially for women of color. Growing your family  shouldn't mean putting your life on the line.   In the coming weeks, I will be introducing comprehensive legislation  to start pushing these numbers down.   Another public health crisis that affects some groups more than  others is the issue of gun violence.   Last month, hundreds of thousands of young people and supporters came  to Washington, D.C., to challenge Congress to act and save lives.  Millions more marched in their own cities with the same message.   Like all public health issues, people of color, women, and rural  Americans are far more impacted by gun violence. In fact, it remains  the leading cause of death for African-American men from birth to 44.   We are also tragically seeing spikes in rural and veteran suicides by  guns, another public health issue that this House has ignored.   Despite these calls for action and the cold, hard facts, this House  has yet to act to save lives.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I just spoke extensively about many problems and  challenges facing the health of Americans, but I want to close by  highlighting some recent successes to end health disparities.   First, this February, this House passed my Action for Dental Health  Act, a bill that will better target existing resources to more  effectively deliver oral and dental healthcare to underserved  communities and populations.   And finally, I want to praise the new leaders in the medical,  research, and advocacy professions who are working to end these deeply  entrenched disparities.   Next week, I will honor the National Minority Quality Forum's 40  Under 40, young leaders in the healthcare field who are working to  support and empower minority communities to live longer, healthier  lives.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to challenge this House to follow the  example of these young people and come together to improve the health  of all Americans, especially those who have been forgotten for far too  long.                            ____________________
