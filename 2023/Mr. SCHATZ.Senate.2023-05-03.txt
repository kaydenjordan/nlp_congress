 Madam President, 8 months ago, we passed the Inflation  Reduction Act. Sometimes when a major bill is passed, its effects are  not immediate, but that is not the case with this legislation.   Since the IRA was signed into law, more than 100 clean energy  projects have been announced. These include solar, wind, hydrogen  power, battery manufacturing, electric vehicle development, and clean  tech investments. If it seems like I am excited, it is because I am.  They are in rural areas, in major cities, and everywhere in between,  and in more than 30 States, from Idaho to Louisiana, to Ohio, to  Arizona. Collectively, these projects have created more than 100,000  new jobs for electricians, for mechanics, for construction workers, for  technicians, and more, but these 100,000 jobs are only the beginning.   A report from the University of Massachusetts projects that the IRA  will create more than 9 million jobs over the next decade. I want to  repeat that: 9 million jobs over the next decade. Those are  manufacturing jobs for wind turbines, solar panels, and electric  vehicles to make our power grid more resilient and our roads less  polluted. They are construction jobs to make our homes and our  buildings more energy efficient and to lower costs for families and  small businesses. They are environmental jobs to support farmers, to  protect fisheries, and to restore our public lands.   Investments supporting these new jobs and projects are already near  $90 billion, and with financial analysts projecting a multiplier effect  of 1.6 dollars in private sector investment for every dollar of public  spending, even the most optimistic predictions about the IRA's impact  seem low now. A Credit Suisse report analyzing the bill estimates that  we will see double the amount of clean energy that the bill was  initially projected to accomplish--double the amount of clean energy. A  new analysis from Goldman Sachs puts the impact even higher: triple the  amount of clean energy that we were contemplating.   This shift is already happening in Colorado, where it is seeing a  rapid expansion in clean energy development.   DR Richardson, who runs a business in electrifying homes with heat  pumps and induction wiring, said about the change that ``we are having  a hard time keeping up with the demand. The Inflation Reduction Act has  been a massive tailwind for us.''   In Michigan, the State's manufacturing background and embrace of  electric vehicles could lead to as many as 34,000 new clean energy  jobs. According to researcher Aaron Brickman, ``There's a strategy,  there's a plan, and the benefits are already being seen. . . . Michigan  is poised for an economic boom.''  [[Page S1484]]    In Texas, a massive $4 billion investment to create the country's  largest green hydrogen facility was recently announced. It will also  generate 1.4 gigawatts of wind and solar, enough to power nearly  750,000 homes. In the words of Seifi Ghasemi, the CEO of a company  behind the investment, ``It will be competitive on a world scale while  bringing significant tax, job, and energy security benefits to Texas.''   That is really what the IRA entails: new jobs, energy security, and a  cleaner planet.   But there is an opponent to this progress. The opponent is the fossil  fuel industry. They have gotten rich digging up oil and burning coal  for generations, but now we are seeing the energy of the future that is  not fossil fuels. They know that they have lost, so the industry and  its supporters are attempting to stall this progress by throwing  whatever they can find at it. They are pursuing litigation. They are  pushing NIMBYism--``not in my backyard.'' They are trying to stop clean  energy projects through the State public utility and public service  commissions. They are attempting to hijack the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission. Through this CRA, they are trying to grind solar  manufacturing to a halt.   So, if you hear this debate around this particular Congressional  Review Act resolution, which we are contemplating today, it is not  actually about this. There is a bigger story here, and the story is  this: We finally took climate action that wasn't small. We finally took  an action that was equal to the moment. We finally took action that was  equal to the obligation that we have to future generations, that was  equal to the opportunity for the United States and the entire planet to  move forward on clean energy that benefits everybody, that lowers costs  and saves our planet for the future.   So when they come after this particular action of the Biden  administration, don't get lost in the weeds; they have lost. They are  dead-enders. They know that. And so they will pick up a Congressional  Review Act here or a Public Service Commission over there or they will  gin up a bunch of NIMBYism over here or they will introduce another  bill over there. But this is part of a story where, for the first  time--and I mean this because it has been decades of us getting our  butts kicked--for the first time, we are taking the kind of climate  action that can actually make a difference, and they are terrified.  That is what this CRA is all about.   We can choose more manufacturing jobs, or we can choose less; energy  security or a continued dependence on foreign dictators; a forward- thinking outlook or a mindset from the past. That is what this CRA is  ultimately about.   Despite the arguments the dark money apparatus of the fossil industry  is making, it doesn't change what they are. They are arguments that  belong in the past. It is the equivalent of a pay phone tycoon failing  to adapt after the iPhone came out.   But we don't have to be beholden to an industry whose strongest days  are in the past. No matter what happens with this vote, the demand for  solar panels made in America is not going away. The demand for energy- efficient homes and electric vehicles is not going away. The demand for  renewable energy is not going away.   The IRA was not a one-off but the first, most meaningful step in the  transition to the clean energy revolution. And the forces opposing this  progress will be forced to recognize that sooner or later.   I yield the floor.
