 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on  this bill.   I am very proud to support this rule for this very outstanding bill  package that makes For the People investments to give every person a  better chance for a better life.   Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on a few issues.   First, with this legislation, we recognize that when women succeed,  America and the world succeed. We do this with many, many outstanding  investments.   When women in our country and the world are educated and healthy and  have economic opportunity, their communities will be more prosperous  and peaceful for everyone.   We have increased investments in Head Start and childcare programs,  medical research, family planning, girls' education, fighting gender- based  [[Page H4448]]  violence, and supporting women-owned enterprises.   Mr. Speaker, we are repealing the administration's cruel domestic and  global gag and religious refusal rules that are cutting off lifesaving  healthcare to so many people in our own country and around the world.   We are also making smart investments in our country's infrastructure.  So important to my home State of Florida is the restoration of  Florida's Everglades, to keep the drinking water clean and safe for  over 8 million people.   I want to add, as a mother of a retired United States marine war  veteran of many years and representative to so many honorable  servicemen and -women, I recognize their selfless and brave service to  our country. So I am especially pleased with the funding for the  Veterans Student Success Program on college campuses that will help  veterans transition to student and civilian life.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, this is an outstanding bill for the people of  this country, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the bill  package.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this very cruel amendment which  supports the Trump administration's rule that allows virtually any  individual or entity involved in a patient's care, from a hospital's  board of directors to a receptionist that schedules procedures, to put  personal beliefs ahead of a patient's health.    This antiabortion obsession has gone to the ridiculousness.   Under this Trump rule, a pharmacist could refuse to fill a  prescription for birth control, a receptionist could refuse to schedule  an abortion for a child rape victim, an ambulance driver could refuse  to take a patient suffering from miscarriage to the hospital, all based  upon their personal beliefs, not the patient's welfare.   Mr. Chair, this rule is dangerous. The amendment is dangerous. It  should be killed before it kills us.    Mr. Chair, my, my, my, here we go again, the anti- abortion obsession turned into more cruel ridiculousness.   How interesting that my Republican colleagues, whose motto is ``less  government,'' try at every opportunity to interfere with a woman's most  personal decision whether or not to bring a child into the world.   But this amendment does more than that. It is aimed at eviscerating  Planned Parenthood and like clinics, cutting off access to  contraception and lifesaving healthcare to millions of Americans.   Women and the people they trust--not politicians--must be in charge  of women's reproductive destinies, which means that women must have  access to full healthcare, because we will not go back to the days of  coat hanger medicine.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to defeat this very, very bad, bad,  bad, bad, very bad amendment.                                time  1645
