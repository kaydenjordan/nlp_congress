 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of my  constituent Levester Thompson, who was taken from us far too soon after  battling COVID-19.   Growing up in a small Virginia town of 300, LT aspired to move to the  big city, inspired to work as a banker in Manhattan. He commuted 2\1/2\  hours every day from Staten Island to pursue that dream.   As he got older, he realized there is so much more to life, so he  returned to his true passion, his true passion for sports, working as  an equipment manager for NYU's athletics department and spending more  time helping his children, Jade and Chase, realize their own passions.   LT was a larger-than-life character, a coach, a mentor, someone with  a great sense of humor, and a smile that will be so dearly missed.   LT, you will forever live in our memory.                            ____________________
