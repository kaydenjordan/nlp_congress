 Mr. Speaker, yesterday Americans  observed National Ice Cream Day, which is celebrated annually on the  third Sunday in July.   In 1984, President Ronald Reagan made the designation and also named  July National Ice Cream Month.   Our very own Penn State University is a world leader in dairy  production and food science. Over the last 150 years, its Berkey  Creamery has been an important Penn State landmark.   Penn State has a herd of more than 200 Holsteins that are milked  twice daily, which is the start of the university's delicious ice  cream. The methods developed by Penn State's food and dairy scientists  have made the creamery a world authority on ice cream and dairy  manufacturing.   Penn State's legendary short course, which takes participants from  ``Cow to Cone,'' has attracted some of the biggest names in ice cream,  from Baskin-Robbins to Ben & Jerry's, from Hershey's to Haagen-Dazs.   For 6 days a year, industry professionals head to Happy Valley for  the best-known program dealing with science and the technology of ice  cream.   Congratulations to Penn State for being the industry leader, and  happy National Ice Cream Month.                            ____________________
