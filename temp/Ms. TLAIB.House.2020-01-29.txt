 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Waters and her intelligent,  hardworking staff for their leadership on this bill.   I also thank my sister-in-service, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, for  spearheading this package of bills, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act of  2020. A new decade, a new way, as our chairwoman would say.   I am also proud that our package of bills before us today includes  H.R. 3622, the Restoring Unfairly Impaired Credit and Protecting  Consumers Act. We are all aware of how expensive medical bills are and  how easily one sickness or accident can bring families to financial  ruin. According to the Urban Institute, regardless of age, income,  insurance status, or ethnicity, one in four individuals are at risk of  losing their health, homes, credit standing, and financial security  annually because of the harms of medical debt.   The bill prohibits the reporting of medically necessary debt often  incurred for seeking lifesaving treatment and protects the credit  profile of those struggling with medical debt by stopping the credit  reporting agency from reporting this debt for 1 year, twice the current  practice.   This bill also protects the survivors of financial abuse. A study by  the Federal Trade Commission shows that 21 percent of consumers had  verified errors in their credit report; 13 percent had errors that  affected their credit scores; and 5 percent had errors serious enough  to cause them to be denied or pay more for credit.   Our bill would make sure that fellow Americans suffering from  circumstances beyond their control are not punished or left out of  future opportunities to responsibly build and rebuild credit because of  risk factors beyond their control.    By passing this bill, we will make it easier for our neighbors  struggling to recover from predatory loans and fraudulent activity by  requiring that credit reporting agencies remove negative information  from credit reports relating to loans that are unfair, deceptive,  abusive, and otherwise illegal.   Lastly, and probably the most transformative provision, this bill  shortens the length of time that bad marks stay on your credit report  from 7 years to 4 years.   This package will open up doors for economic opportunities for  millions of people across our country. No one should be stopped from  becoming a homeowner or bettering their life because of bad debt.   Mr. Chair, that is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, during Roll Call Vote number 32 on S. 3201,  I mistakenly recorded my vote as ``yes'' when I should have voted  ``no''.                             Personal Explanation     Madam Speaker, as part of the incredible, large class of  members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I am really proud to  be here helping my colleagues translate a number of policy positions  and issues and in being able to translate that into action to various  policies and to be able to express that.   So this Special Order is very, very much an integral part of  organizing within our caucus, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, on  what we call frontline community issues. So I want to thank my  colleagues for helping us organize today a Special Order hour to  declare loudly and very clearly to every Muslim American and to Muslims  around the world that the House of Representatives will not stand idly  by as this administration continues to enforce its racist Muslim ban.   So with that I really rise today to send a message to marginalized  communities everywhere that through our work to repeal the Muslim ban  we are preventing racist bans from ever happening again.   I am so incredibly grateful for Congresswoman Chu's leadership of the  National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, or what  we call the NO BAN Act. I thank Congresswoman Chu for her leadership  and courage to stand up to those who try to target folks based on their  faith.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy  Chu).    Madam Speaker, as one of its first acts, this White House  decided to ban Muslims from entering the United States by issuing an  executive order prohibiting the entry of nationals of certain Muslim- majority countries.   The people this administration banned are not all the same. They  represent a diverse array of countries and cultures, including Arab  communities, Black communities, Southeast Asian communities, amongst so  many others.   All around our Nation, especially in Michigan's 13th District strong,  we understand just how dangerous this administration's racist Muslim  ban is for our families. The Muslim ban fuels anti-Muslim violence and  discrimination. It promotes the dangerous myth that Muslims are  inherently foreign, violent, and pose a threat to the United States.   The Muslim ban also harms children. In the 2 years since it went into  effect, countless families have been needlessly separated. People have  been denied access to lifesaving medical treatments. Children have been  denied their parents, access to their grandparents, and family members  have missed births, deaths, weddings, and funerals for loved ones.   I rise today to say that Muslims and Muslim Americans are our  friends, our neighbors, and our family members--and, yes, they are also  Members of Congress.   This White House might not like that fact very much, because the  racist Muslim ban represents the Federal Government's endorsement of an  anti-Muslim discrimination culture. The policy endorses a fear- mongering campaign that only serves to dehumanize and divide, and it  leads us to question if this White House has any plans for our country  that are not centered on hate or greed.   I am extremely troubled that this federally sanctioned discrimination  has contributed to a significant spike in hate crimes against American  Muslims and attacks on mosques in Muslim communities all across the  country.   That is why, as Members of Congress, we must put an end to  discrimination by passing the NO BAN Act. We have over 200 Members of  Congress who support and cosponsor this NO BAN Act.   As introduced, the NO BAN Act would immediately rescind the Muslim  ban and stop discriminatory orders and abuses of authority by this  administration, thanks to the leadership of Congresswoman Judy Chu.   By ending the Muslim ban, the NO BAN Act will also get us close to  ending the extreme number of increasing religious discrimination within  our immigration system now.   The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, INA, to  prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion and ensure that no  President ever again will be able to ban an entire community without  accountability.   I urge my colleagues in the House leadership to bring the NO BAN Act  to the floor as soon as possible, because our communities cannot wait.  Minority communities across our country and, indeed, the international  community are eager for action that repeals the Muslim ban.   As someone who is raising two Muslim boys in our country, I can tell  you they struggle now even sharing about their faith and even worried  about the rhetoric that they hear from various folks in school, but  also just in passing, not only through social media, but through  different kinds of conversations that they are hearing where they talk  about not only folks who are of the Muslim faith, but folks of various  immigrant communities. And being two sons of a father who is also an  immigrant, they now really struggle very much in feeling that they can  be open.    At 9 years old, my son, who is now 14, remembers me--I remember  speaking to his father about a terrible ad, a cartoon that was put in  USA Today, where it depicted Muslims in a certain way that would evoke  violence towards Muslim Americans. I remember talking to his father at  that moment and just kind of whispering to him: This is terrible. I  can't believe they are doing this. This is just going to invoke people  to really hate and even want to kill Muslims.   And my son, who came into the bedroom, said: Don't worry, Mama. If  anybody asks if I am Muslim, I will tell them that I am not.   That is the kind of culture that we create by allowing these kinds of  discriminatory policies to be placed and for us to allow it to be  codified through executive orders and allow it to go without any  action.   I ran a campaign to take on hate, which really started in Michigan,  but was implemented throughout the country in about 12 communities.   And one of the things that young people understand is you have got to  take on hate with action. You can't sit idly back--because people just  thought: Well, this doesn't impact me--but really trying to understand  that it does connect all of us; because this form of othering in the  culture that you see within the administration is real and it is  dangerous, and sitting idly by and not doing anything about it, to me,  will increase that form of hate towards people of different faiths.   And trust me, it is not just about Muslims. It is about other kinds  of faiths, people of different ethnic backgrounds.   This, in essence, is creating this kind of hate culture that we can't  see, not only in our American society, but it is also festering within  our school culture and with our young people again questioning  constantly with identity and allowing this kind of othering to be  normalized through acts like this executive order.   When you hear Muslim leaders and those talk about the separation that  happens, I remember at Bridging Communities in southwest Detroit, we  had a press conference with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell fighting back  against the separation of families, and it all stemmed around: Well, I  didn't understand there was supposed to have been a waiver.   Well, everyone should know, many of the people we represent who are  coming to our offices were not granted waivers.   And we are talking about people who are married, who have legal  access through the immigration, but for the Muslim ban, and are not  able to reunify with their family members.   I have two young children who can't see their father because of the  Muslim ban.   I have folks who had a green card, had access to the United States,  but when this got implemented, because it was implemented in a way  where there was no notice, no policy, no procedures, no structure in  place for folks on the ground to understand what was going on, that is  why we saw what we saw, the overwhelming call for action and people  showing up to airports all across the country saying: No, not now, not  ever.   It is really important that we do it through action within the  Congress, and I hope my colleagues understand this should be bipartisan  support.   This is religious discrimination. This is one of our core values as  Americans. We are founded on religious freedom. And for us to allow,  again, targeting of folks solely based on their faith, to me, repeats  history. We have done it in the past; and it wasn't right then, and it  isn't right now.   And I think I can speak on behalf of Muslim Americans. They do not  want to wait for an apology. Apology is not enough. They want action  today. They know this is discriminatory. They know this is bias. They  know this is targeting Muslims.   And, yes, it is leading to, again, increased hate crimes towards  Muslims in huge amounts across the country; and so it is critical that  we act, that we don't sit silently by, because doing nothing is not an  option anymore. So I urge the House leadership to bring this NO BAN Act  forward to the floor as soon as possible.   I really commend the incredible leadership of many of our colleagues,  especially my good colleague from Indiana, Congressman Andre Carson,  whom I lovingly call the dean of the Muslim Caucus.   Yes, we are your neighbors; we are your advocates; we are your  doctors, your teachers, and all of those things, and also your Members  of Congress.  [[Page H710]]    And so, again, it is really critically important that we push back  against this ban.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana.   I really appreciate the incredible public service that not only stems  here but, as you all know, many of our servicemen and women who are of  Muslim faith are serving our country every single day.   Again, people need not try to separate us as not being part of this  amazing country. The Muslim ban completely tears that down and comes  from, again, a place of hate that we need to push back against.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal), who I really honor and respect, the co-chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus, my good colleague, one of the  fighters within this Chamber every single day for communities of color  and marginalized communities.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. Her incredible  leadership and mentorship are so inspiring but also completely fuels my  commitment to be centered around social justice and equality.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to make sure that we talk about the fact that  because of the Muslim ban and some of the kind of hate agenda policies  that we see coming out of the administration, it all has resulted in an  increase of hate crimes that still is underreported and has not, I  think, truly, under this administration, been documented by the FBI.   Even when the current President just called for a total and complete  shutdown on Muslims entering the United States, just days after that  report, hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs nationwide spiked up 23  percent.   As we hear about the various kinds of hate crimes, we get some of  these complaints and incidents being reported to even our offices. I  wanted to make sure that we talk about the fact that the FBI, when it  released its report this past year, that Muslim advocates in their  statement--which is very accurate, based on what we hear of our  community members at home--said that, yet again, the FBI annual  statistics on hate crimes show us that the worrying numbers of Muslims,  Jews, Sikhs, and Latinos being victimized by hate crimes are not being  reported, or the data does not reflect that. It is not a complete,  accurate picture of the epidemic of hate that continues to threaten the  safety of so many Americans across the country.   Last year, an armed man drove a truck into a convenience store in  Louisiana because he suspected the owners were Muslims. Also in March  last year, a man deliberately tried to drive his car into a Muslim  family in a parking lot in California and managed to strike the father  twice.   Both are clear examples of hate crimes. Neither of those were  included in the FBI's data on hate crimes.   Madam Speaker, it is completely unacceptable. As we push for the NO  BAN Act, I also want to try to encourage my colleagues to try to have  hearings and discuss the importance of accurate data around hate crimes  increasing across the country. That is why we have to pass the Khalid  Jabara and Heather Heyer NO HATE Act to improve the hate crime  reporting data collection.                                time  2100    Many of the organizations that support the NO BAN Act also want to  see a much better reflection of the data being reported by the FBI  around hate crime.   The only way we are able to promote or push back against these forms  of hate that lead to violence, and even death, for so many folks that  are impacted by these forms of racist policies and hateful agenda  policies, is to be able to document and to push back against it.   So I really appreciate a number of my colleagues, over 200 Members  that support the NO BAN Act, and I look forward to finally being able  to vote for it on the floor.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 p.m.), under its previous  order, the House adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, January 30, 2020,  at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
