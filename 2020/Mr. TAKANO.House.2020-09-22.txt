 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3010) to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a  mission statement of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3010         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Honoring All Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. MISSION STATEMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Required Mission Statement.--Section 301 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(d) The mission statement of the Department shall be as       follows: `To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for       those ``who shall have borne the battle'' and for their       families, caregivers, and survivors.'.''.        (b) Notification.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall--        (1) publish in the Federal Register and on the internet       website of the Department of Veterans Affairs a notification       explaining the mission statement of the Department as       specified in subsection (d) of section 301 of title 38,       United States Code, as added by subsection (a) of this       section; and        (2) update each internet website of the Department of       Veterans Affairs and other electronic references that use a       previous mission statement.        (c) Guidance.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the       enactment of the this Act, the Secretary shall develop and       issue guidance to all elements of the Department regarding       the mission statement of the Department as specified in       subsection (d) of section 301 of title 38, United States       Code, as added by subsection (a) of this section. The       guidance shall include the following:        (1) A notification explaining the mission statement.        (2) Instructions and a timeline for updating all previous       mission statement references at each such element.        (3) A method to monitor and evaluate the compliance by       facilities of the Department with the guidance, including a       reporting mechanism for such facilities to report back to the       Secretary on the progress made in updating all non-electronic       mission statement references.        (4) Any other information that the Secretary determines       necessary to ensure timely compliance with the guidance.        (d) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress       a report containing a review and assessment of the progress       of each element of the Department in complying with the       guidance under subsection (c), including--        (1) any reasons explaining why an element of the Department       has failed to implement the guidance; and        (2) a plan to address any such failure to implement the       guidance and ensure that each element of the Department fully       implements and complies with the guidance.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3010.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3010 establishes an inclusive VA mission  statement or motto as follows: ``To fulfill President Lincoln's promise  to care for those `who shall have borne the battle' and for their  families, caregivers, and survivors.'' Congresswoman Rice introduced  this bill to establish a model at VA that includes all who VA is  mandated to serve.   Since its creation in 1861, only one woman, Dr. Mary Walker, has  received the Medal of Honor. Her citation recognized her for devoting  ``herself with much patriotic zeal to the sick and wounded soldiers,  both in the field and in hospitals, to the detriment of her own  health,'' and enduring ``hardships as a prisoner of war.''   She received the Medal of Honor in 1866 for her service to the U.S.  Army throughout the American Civil War.   The current VA mission statement, a line from President Lincoln's  second inaugural address delivered in 1865, uses only male pronouns and  excludes women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer  veterans, as well as the diversity of their families, caregivers and  survivors.   For years, this committee has heard from veterans and their  supporters that both the gender-exclusive motto and the VA's refusal to  changes it are reflective of a culture that does not prioritize or  value them.                                time  1345    The current model was unilaterally selected by the Administrator of  what was then the Veterans Administration in 1959.   By passing this bill to create a new mission statement, we are  demonstrating the will of the American people for VA's motto to be  inclusive. In the original context, President Lincoln expressed an  intent of inclusion and an obligation to care for all who had endured  conflict.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3010 both honors the original spirit of President  Lincoln's words while reflecting the full scope of VA's mission and  whom they must serve. As Dr. Mary Walker said: ``Let the generations  know that women in uniform also guaranteed their freedom.''   I, again, thank Miss Rice from the State of New York for sponsoring  this bill and for her tireless work on behalf of America's veterans,  their families, caregivers, and survivors.   I thank Dr. Roe and the minority Members who made bringing this bill  to the floor a fully bipartisan effort, and I hope the Senate will take  this on swiftly so that it will pass into law before the end of the  116th Congress.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice), who is my good friend and who is the sponsor of  H.R. 3010.   Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  bipartisan bill, the Honoring All Veterans Act.   This bill would finally require the Department of Veterans Affairs to  replace its outdated motto with a more inclusive statement. The words  of the original motto would be updated to read: ``To fulfill President  Lincoln's promise to care for those `who shall have borne the battle'  and for their families, caregivers, and survivors.''   For far too long, the VA's gender-exclusive motto hasn't properly  acknowledged the service of women and LGBT veterans. This is simply  wrong, and it is long overdue that we change it. Women and LGBT  servicemembers have sacrificed so much for our country. They have  always answered the call of duty, and they should know that we are just  as grateful for their service and sacrifice as we are for anyone who  serves this country.   That is why we must make this change. We need a VA motto that  properly recognizes and honors the service of all veterans, regardless  of their gender or sexual orientation.   Changing the motto won't solve every issue facing women and LGBT  veterans, of course, but it is a start, and it is the right thing to  do. It would say in no uncertain terms that all veterans are seen  equally in the eyes of the agency that exists solely to serve them.   I want to thank Chairman Takano for his support for me getting this  bill to where it is today. And it is simply that, as Chairman Takano  said, we would not be here if it were not for the ranking member, Dr.  Roe. I want to thank him personally so much for supporting this bill  and for helping to bring it to the floor today.   I also want to thank my Republican colead, Representative Brian Mast,  the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and all the veterans whom  I have heard from in support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Honoring All  Veterans Act today. It is time every veteran who served our country  receives the respect and recognition they deserve.     Madam Speaker, I thank H.R. 3010's sponsor,  Representative Kathleen Rice from New York. It is long past due for us  to recognize the contributions of all veterans, regardless of gender,  sexual orientation, or gender identity.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3010,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4908) to amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit the  collection of a health care copayment by the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs from a veteran who is a member of an Indian tribe, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4908         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Veteran       Parity in Access to Care Today Act'' or ``Native American       PACT Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON COLLECTION OF A HEALTH CARE COPAYMENT                     BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FROM A                     VETERAN WHO IS A MEMBER OF AN INDIAN TRIBE.         (a) In General.--Section 1730A of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in the heading, by striking ``catastrophically       disabled'' and inserting ``certain'';        (2) by inserting ``(a) Prohibition.--'' before       ``Notwithstanding'';        (3) by striking ``a veteran who is catastrophically       disabled, as defined by the Secretary,'' and inserting ``a       covered veteran''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(b) Covered Veteran Defined.--In this section, the term       `covered veteran' means a veteran who--        ``(1) is catastrophically disabled, as defined by the       Secretary; or        ``(2) is an Indian or urban Indian, as those terms are       defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement       Act (Public Law 94-437; 25 U.S.C. 1603).''.        (b) Technical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 17 of such title is amended by striking       the item relating to section 1730A and inserting the       following:  ``1730A. Prohibition on collection of copayments from certain                veterans.''.         (c) Delayed Effective Date.--The amendments made by this       section shall take effect on the day that is one year after       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3908, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4908, as amended, the Native  American PACT Act.   The Federal Government has a legal and moral obligation to uphold its  treaty obligations to Tribal nations, which include the provision of  healthcare. Our responsibility to ensure care is compounded when  American Indians and Alaska Natives serve this country in uniform.   While largely provided by the Indian Health Service and Tribal Health  Programs, the healthcare obligations of the United States do not start  and stop  [[Page H4679]]  with one agency. For decades, VA has not recognized the unique status  of Native veterans and has charged them copays for care provided at VA.   For far too many Native Americans, particularly those in rural areas,  the copay burden is a barrier to care. These veterans, who may be  unable to access specialty care from their Tribal health systems, are  then unable to access VA due to cost.   Eliminating the copay burden is a step toward upholding the treaties  between the United States and Tribal nations while also bringing  immediate relief to veterans unable to access care during these  distressing times.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Gallego for his steadfast  leadership on this issue. I encourage all of my colleagues to support  H.R. 4908, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I too ask all of my colleagues to join me  in passing H.R. 4908, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6589) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop  and submit to Congress a plan to address the material weakness of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.    I am checking. I do not have ``as amended.'' Madam  Speaker, I stand by the motion that I made that we suspend the rules  and pass H.R. 6589.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 6589.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6589, the CFO Authority and  Collaboration Act of 2020, which addresses the sometimes arcane but  also very important need for strong financial management and  accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Madam Speaker, each year, VA spends billions of dollars in support of  our Nation's veterans. Taxpayers deserve to know that each dollar is  spent wisely and that each dollar is properly accounted for in order to  avoid waste, fraud, and abuse.   Madam Speaker, the VA inspector general has determined what is called  a ``material weakness'' in how the Office of the Chief Financial  Officer is structured. This was a topic examined during hearings and  through oversight by our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.   Mrs. Lee's legislation requires a small but important fix to ensure  strong financial accountability. I thank Mrs. Lee for sponsoring this  bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6589.   Madam Speaker, I wish to, at this point, withdraw the motion.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6589) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop  and submit to Congress a plan to address the material weakness of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6589         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

LICENSURE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING                     TREATMENT VIA TELEMEDICINE.         Section 1730C(b) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended to read as follows:        ``(b) Covered Health Care Professionals.--For purposes of       this section, a covered health care professional is any of       the following individuals:        ``(1) A health care professional who--        ``(A) is an employee of the Department appointed under       section 7306, 7401, 7405, 7406, or 7408 of this title, or       under title 5;        ``(B) is authorized by the Secretary to provide health care       under this chapter;        ``(C) is required to adhere to all standards for quality       relating to the provision of health care in accordance with       applicable policies of the Department; and        ``(D) has--        ``(i) an active, current, full, and unrestricted license,       registration, or certification in a State to practice the       health care profession of the health care professional;        ``(ii) qualifications prescribed by the Secretary under       section 7402(b) of this title for an appointment to a       position in the Veterans Health Administration; or        ``(iii) other authorization from the Secretary to provide       health care.        ``(2) A health professions trainee who--        ``(A) is appointed under section 7405 or 7406 of this       title; and        ``(B) is under the clinical supervision of a health care       professional described in paragraph (1).

Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members may have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3228, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3228, as amended, the VA  Mission Telehealth Clarification Act.   The John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA  Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside  Networks Act of 2018, or the VA MISSION Act, as it is more commonly  known, expanded VA's ability to provide telehealth to veterans across  State lines.   The legislation before us builds on those enhancements by allowing  healthcare professionals in training to provide tele-healthcare to  veterans with clinical supervision.   As we have seen over the course of this pandemic, tele-healthcare is  becoming more and more a staple of Americans' healthcare experience. As  this virus will be with us for some time to come, the value and  reliance on telehealth will continue. It is critical that during this  time, VA has the authorities necessary to keep veterans healthy and  safe in their homes.   This is particularly important for our rural and aging veterans whose  access to in-person care was already a challenge. We need to do  everything possible to ensure veterans' access to safe distant care  whenever it is appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Carter for his dogged work to see  veterans have what they need during this time. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support H.R. 3228, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for his comments  about the VA really being a pioneer in this moment, that the expansion  of tele-mental health, especially, has seen a logarithmic increase, and  it has implications for Medicare and Medicaid. I am hearing from the  civilian medical sector about the need to follow the VA's example.   I am very proud of the work the VA has done to respond to this  pandemic moment by making sure that our veterans, no matter where they  live, have access to medical care through telehealth and tele-mental  health, especially.   I want to thank, again, the sponsor of this legislation, and I want  to urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this important  legislation, H.R. 3228, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6092) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a national clinical pathway for prostate cancer, access to  life-saving extending precision clinical trials and research, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6092         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran's Prostate Cancer       Treatment and Research Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Prostate cancer is the number one cancer diagnosed in       the Veterans Health Administration.        (2) A 1996 report published by the National Academy of       Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine established a link       between prostate cancer and exposure to herbicides, such as       Agent Orange.        (3) It is essential to acknowledge that due to these       circumstances, certain veterans are made aware that they are       high-risk individuals when it comes to the potential to       develop prostate cancer.        (4) In being designated as ``high risk'', it is essential       that veterans are proactive in seeking earlier preventative       clinical services for the early detection and successful       treatment of prostate cancer, whether that be through the       Veterans Health Administration or through a community       provider.        (5) Clinical preventative services and initial detection       are some of the most important components in the early       detection of prostate cancer for veterans at high risk of       prostate cancer.        (6) For veterans with prostate cancer, including prostate       cancer that has metastasized, precision oncology, including       biomarker-driven clinical trials and innovations underway       through the Prostate Cancer Foundation and Department of       Veterans Affairs partnership, represents one of the most       promising areas of interventions, treatments, and cures for       such veterans and their families.

Such registry shall be designed--        (A) to establish a systematic and standardized database       that enables intra-agency collaboration by which to track       veteran patient progress, enable population management       programs, facilitate best outcomes, and encourage future       research and further development of clinical pathways,       including patient access to precision resources and       treatments and access to life-extending precision clinical       trials;        (B) to employ novel methods of structuring data, including       natural language processing, artificial intelligence,       structured data clinical notes, patient reported outcome       instruments, and other tools, to ensure that all clinically       meaningful data is included; and        (C) to be accessible to--        (i) clinicians treating veterans diagnosed with prostate       cancer and being treated for prostate cancer in conjunction       with Department medical facilities; and        (ii) researchers.        (c) Clinical Pathway Defined.--In this section, the term       ``clinical pathway'' means a health care management tool       designed around research and evidence-backed practices that       provides direction for the clinical care and treatment of a       specific episode of a condition or ailment.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 6092.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6092, the Veteran's Prostate  Cancer Treatment and Research Act.   The number one cancer diagnosed by the Veterans Health Administration  is prostate cancer. Nearly half a million veterans are currently  undergoing treatment, with disproportionate diagnoses of this disease  impacting Black veterans and those exposed to Agent Orange.   This legislation would create a national clinical pathway and  standardized system of care for treatment of prostate cancer at all  stages. This will ensure more widespread early detection efforts,  increase access to clinical trials, and create a registry and research  program.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans battle prostate cancer at twice the rate of  their civilian counterparts. A unified systems-wide approach that  builds on the incredible work of the Department's research efforts is  essential.   I want to thank Dr. Dunn for his steadfast leadership and his passion  on this matter.   Mr. Speaker, I also encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R.  6092, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also want to acknowledge the leadership of  the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), who worked with the  subcommittee ranking member, Dr. Neal Dunn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Cunningham), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to withdraw my motion to  suspend the rules and pass H.R. 6092.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6092) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a national clinical pathway for prostate cancer, access to  life-saving extending precision clinical trials and research, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6092         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran's Prostate Cancer       Treatment and Research Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Prostate cancer is the number one cancer diagnosed in       the Veterans Health Administration.        (2) A 1996 report published by the National Academy of       Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine established a link       between prostate cancer and exposure to herbicides, such as       Agent Orange.        (3) It is essential to acknowledge that due to these       circumstances, certain veterans are made aware that they are       high-risk individuals when it comes to the potential to       develop prostate cancer.        (4) In being designated as ``high risk'', it is essential       that veterans are proactive in seeking earlier preventative       clinical services for the early detection and successful       treatment of prostate cancer, whether that be through the       Veterans Health Administration or through a community       provider.        (5) Clinical preventative services and initial detection       are some of the most important components in the early       detection of prostate cancer for veterans at high risk of       prostate cancer.        (6) For veterans with prostate cancer, including prostate       cancer that has metastasized, precision oncology, including       biomarker-driven clinical trials and innovations underway       through the Prostate Cancer Foundation and Department of       Veterans Affairs partnership, represents one of the most       promising areas of interventions, treatments, and cures for       such veterans and their families.

PUBLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF DISABILITY BENEFIT                     QUESTIONNAIRE FORMS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Section 5101 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new       subsection (d):        ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall publish in a central location       on the internet website of the Department disability benefit       questionnaire forms, or such successor forms relating to non-      Department medical providers submitting evidence regarding a       disability of a claimant.        ``(2) Subject to section 6103 of this title, if the       Secretary updates a form described in paragraph (1), the       Secretary shall--        ``(A) accept the previous version of the form filed by a       claimant if--        ``(i) the claimant provided to the non-Department medical       provider the previous version of the form before the date on       which the updated version of the form was made available; and        ``(ii) the claimant files the previous version of the form       during the one-year period following the date the form was       completed by the non-Department medical provider;        ``(B) request from the claimant any other information that       the updated version of the form requires; and        ``(C) apply the laws and regulations required to adjudicate       the claim as if the claimant filed the updated version of the       form.        ``(3) The Secretary may waive any interagency approval       process required to approve a modification to a disability       benefit questionnaire form if such requirement only applies       by reason of the forms being made public under paragraph (1).        ``(4) Not less frequently than once each year through 2026,       the Inspector General of the Department shall submit to       Congress a report on the findings of the Inspector General       with respect to the use of the forms described in paragraph       (1).''.        (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in section 5101 of title       38, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), may be       construed to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to       develop any new information technology system or otherwise       require the Secretary to make any significant changes to the       internet website of the Department of Veterans Affairs.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, and to include extraneous material on H.R. 7795.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Benefits Fairness and Transparency Act of  2020 is legislation that was brought to the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee as a result of a strong partnership between staff and the  advocates that are out in the field, even through the COVID-19  pandemic, assisting our veterans in the disability benefits process.   When a VA doctor evaluates a veteran's disability, they use a form  known as a disability benefit questionnaire, or DBQ.   These DBQs are what VA employees use to decide benefit claims and can  be the deciding factor between a grant or a denial.   During the height of the pandemic, VA made the decision to pull these  DBQs off its public website, making them inaccessible to veterans and  their representatives. The advocates told us this change was harmful  for veterans because they could no longer get relevant medical  information from their own treatment providers to support their claims.   Now, even though VA oftentimes provides medical exams to veterans  during the claims process, it is not always the same as getting that  information from your own doctor.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7795 fixes this issue by requiring VA to publish  DBQs on its website and to accept DBQs completed by a non-VA medical  provider.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment to thank Representatives Barr  and Luria for introducing this legislation, and also thank our VSO  partners for bringing this issue to our attention.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), the chairwoman of the Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, and also a cosponsor of H.R. 7795.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the passage of this important legislation is necessary  to continue to make it easier for veterans to submit medical evidence  in support of their disability claims.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation, H.R. 7795,  brought forward by Congressman Barr of Kentucky, and the cosponsor, the  chairwoman of our Subcommittee on DAMA, Elaine Luria of Virginia.   Mr. Speaker I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
