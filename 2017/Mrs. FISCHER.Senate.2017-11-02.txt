 Mr. President, although nearly half of those graduating  from law school are women, only about a third of the Federal judges are  female. This week, we had the honor of adding three more.   I rise to congratulate these three successful women because their  additions to the Federal court system are historic. They serve as more  evidence that well-qualified women are becoming more confident in  stepping forward and serving our great Nation.   Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Louise Larsen, and Allison Eid are three more  cracks in that glass ceiling. Their confirmations are proof that  successful women can balance responsibility and seize opportunity when  it knocks on their doors. These accomplished nominees are not joining  the Federal bench because of a frivolous attempt at trying to balance  out the gender disparity in our courts. They will be donning the black  robes because they will have earned it.   Amy Coney Barrett, our new judge for the Seventh Circuit, climbed to  the ranks by clerking for Judge Laurence Silberman on the DC Circuit  and Justice Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. In working with her  husband, who is a successful lawyer in his own right, she has balanced  family responsibilities while having achieved personal success. At the  age of 30, she was hired as a professor at one of the Nation's best law  programs, Notre Dame. Over the past 6 years, she has sat on the  Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure on the  recommendation of Chief Justice Roberts.   Joan Louise Larsen, the next U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth  Circuit, is proof that hard work pays off. After graduating at the top  of her class from Northwestern, Judge Larsen clerked for Justice Scalia  on the U.S. Supreme Court before serving as a Deputy Assistant Attorney  General in the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel. She  most recently sat on the highest court in her State, the Supreme Court  of Michigan. She has done this while raising two children with her law  professor husband.   Allison Eid, the newest judge for the Tenth Circuit, has demonstrated  brilliance throughout her career. After graduating from Stanford, she  worked as an assistant speechwriter for William Bennett, President  Reagan's Secretary of Education. After graduating from law school with  honors, she clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme  Court. She has served with distinction on the Colorado Supreme Court  since 2006. With her husband, Troy, the first Egyptian American to  serve as a U.S. district attorney, she has helped to raise two  children.   These three successful women should serve as role models to girls and  boys across this Nation. They are proof that women do not need to stand  back while others find success, and their confirmations are evidence  that, when women support each other, they will achieve at the highest  level. They also demonstrate the power of families when they work  together to accomplish goals.   We should be proud to have confirmed these three great women to the  Federal bench. All of us receive letters from children who ask  questions about: What do you do in the U.S. Senate? Weeks like this one  should be part of our response. We empower those who have empowered  themselves regardless of their gender. We shape our legal system by  filling it with qualified women who are dedicated to preserving and  protecting our Constitution--the framework of our free Nation. We  proclaim that hard work is to be rewarded. These three important  confirmations are further proof that young women do not have to choose  between raising families and rising to the top of their chosen  professions.   I stand here today and send a message to every little girl who  wonders about politics and every young woman who faces the challenges  of starting out in her career: You can do this too. We love you, and we  support you. Be confident when you want to step forward and serve your  community and serve your country.   The judicial nominees who were voted on this week exemplify the best  of our Nation's legal community. Their confirmations to the Federal  bench have added significant talent to our Nation's system of justice.  The work being done by the President and by this Senate in shaping the  Federal courts with those who will follow the rule of law is historic.  President Trump should be applauded for nominating such well-qualified  people to be on the Federal bench.   All of the nominees voted on this week will make exceptional  additions to the Federal bench, and I hope that the President will send  many more like them for us to consider. All four are deserving of their  new positions, and I am sure that they will honor and protect the  Constitution and serve the American people well as good judges.   I yield the floor.
