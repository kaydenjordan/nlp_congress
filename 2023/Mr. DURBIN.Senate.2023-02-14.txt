Mr. President, today is Valentine's Day and a day we set  aside to celebrate love, but far too many American families this day  have haunting memories and unfathomable pain. They are the families of  Americans killed by gun violence.   Last night, the families of three Michigan State University students  joined the heartbroken ranks. Five additional victims were wounded. It  was the 67th mass shooting in the United States of America in this  calendar year. February 14, the 67th mass shooting--more than 1 mass  shooting every day this year. What is a mass shooting? When four people  or more are injured or killed.   No other nation on Earth accepts this wholesale slaughter that we  have now become so inured to in the United States. We shouldn't be.  Americans have seen too much carnage from guns. I am sick of it. This  Nation is sick of it.   Five years ago today, a 19-year-old gunman murdered 17 people and  wounded 17 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,  FL--the fifth anniversary of it, and we are observing the madness and  slaughter that took place in Michigan. The gunman fired  indiscriminately at Parkland, at students and teachers, and used a  Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault rifle. The dead included 14 students and 3  staff members who died trying to protect them.   The Parkland shooting horrified our Nation. It cut especially deep at  Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL, 65 miles outside of  Chicago. You see, exactly 10 years ago on Valentine's Day 2008, a  gunman armed with a shotgun and three semiautomatic pistols kicked open  the door of an auditorium-style classroom at Northern Illinois and  walked up and down the aisle, shooting people indiscriminately. The  shooting lasted just under 6 minutes. When it ended, 5 students had  died at Northern and more than 20 were injured.   Six weeks into the year 2023, and already this year, at least 5,127  Americans have died from gun violence according to the Gun Violence  Archive. They died in homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings.   Last year, Congress passed and President Biden signed the most  sweeping gun safety law in 30 years--the Bipartisan Safer Communities  Act. Among other things, it toughened background checks for gun  purchasers under the age of 21 and cracked down on the trafficking and  straw purchasing of firearms. It also included funding to help States  implement red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who  pose a danger to themselves or others. Just today, my home State of  Illinois was awarded $9\1/2\ million in funding under the new law to  help carry out Illinois' red flag law. That is progress. But the  majority of Americans support even stronger gun safety laws, including  closing the gaps in the background check system for gun purchases.   I believe that Congress should also restore the ban on assault  weapons, including AR-15-style rifles--increasingly the weapon of  choice for mass shooters. These military-style weapons have no place in  schools, neighborhoods, or college campuses.   One month after the Parkland school massacre, student survivors of  that slaughter organized a rally called March for Our Lives. Hundreds  of thousands of people attended the march in Washington. One of those  powerful speakers that day was a young woman named Emma Gonzalez, a  survivor of Parkland. She warned Americans that day, ``Fight for your  lives before it's someone else's job.''   In America today, gun violence can strike any family, anywhere,  anytime. Today on this grim anniversary, we must recommit ourselves to  a better America, to do more to protect our kids, our schools, our  communities, and our country from the scourge of gun violence.

I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I rise to speak on the confirmation of  Matthew Garcia to the U.S. District Court for the District of New  Mexico.   Mr. Garcia is an experienced litigator with deep ties to the New  Mexico legal community. He received degrees from the University of New  Mexico, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and the University of  New Mexico School of Law before establishing a career in civil rights  litigation. Mr. Garcia represented plaintiffs in religious liberty,  unlawful discrimination, and wage theft cases. He also gained  experience in multistate antitrust actions and personal injury matters.  In 2019, Mr. Garcia left private practice and joined the New Mexico  State government as general counsel to New Mexico Governor Michelle  Lujan Grisham. He now serves as her chief of staff and advises on  issues related to State constitutional questions and statutory  interpretation.   Throughout his career, Mr. Garcia has appeared frequently in State  and Federal court. His breadth of experience in government and the  private sector will make him ready to serve on the District of New  Mexico from day one. The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr.  Garcia ``well qualified,'' and he has the strong support of his home- State Senators, Mr. Heinrich and Mr. Lujan.   I supported his nomination and was glad to see him confirmed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak on the confirmation of  Lindsay Jenkins to U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Illinois.   Born in Cleveland, OH, Ms. Jenkins received her bachelor's degree  from Miami University of Ohio and her J.D., summa cum laude, from  Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. After clerking for Judge Solomon  Oliver, Jr., on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Ohio and working in private practice for 2 years, Ms. Jenkins spent the  majority of her legal career--15 years--as an Assistant U.S. Attorney  for the Northern District of Illinois.   As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, Ms. Jenkins prosecuted a range of  cases, including violations of drug and firearm laws, fraud, gang- related activity, civil rights violations, and corruption. In addition  to her caseload at the U.S. Attorney's Office, she took on supervisory  responsibilities, rising to become chief of the Criminal Division. In  that role, she oversaw all criminal prosecutions in the Northern  District of Illinois, supervising nearly 150 prosecutors across 9  prosecution sections.   In 2021, Ms. Jenkins returned to private practice, primarily working  on internal investigations and white collar cases. The American Bar  Association rated Ms. Jenkins as unanimously ``well qualified.'' Given  her qualifications and her deep knowledge of the Northern District,  Senator Duckworth and I strongly support Ms. Jenkins.   I thank my colleagues for confirming her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak on the confirmation of  Judge Gina Mendez-Miro to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Puerto Rico.   Judge Mendez-Miro is an experienced jurist and dedicated public  servant. A graduate of the University of Puerto Rico and Princeton  University, she spent several years in private practice before devoting  the rest of her legal career to public service. Judge Mendez-Miro has  served in all three branches of the Puerto Rico government. She served  as Assistant Attorney General for Human Resources for the Puerto Rico  Department of Justice, as director of judicial programs and general  counsel and director of legal affairs in the Puerto Rico judicial  branch's office of courts administration, and as chief of staff for the  Puerto Rico Senate. In 2016, Judge Mendez-Miro was appointed by the  Governor of Puerto Rico and unanimously confirmed by the Puerto Rican  Senate to serve on the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals. The American Bar  Association unanimously rated Judge Mendez-Miro as ``qualified.''   I supported her nomination and was glad to see her confirmed.                            ____________________
