 Madam President, let me first thank my colleague from  Texas. We disagree from time to time, but when we agree, I feel good  about it. And today, we do agree, certainly, on the Ukrainian war and  the role and responsibility of the United States.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), the Senator  from Oregon (Mr. Merkley), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders)  are necessarily absent.
