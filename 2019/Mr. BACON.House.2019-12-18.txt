 Madam Speaker, I am strongly opposed to this impeachment.  No law was broken, no high crimes or misdemeanors, no impeachable  offenses.   The Ukrainians received aid 1 week prior to the law's requirement,  aid that was previously rejected by the administration before it. There  was no investigation, and President Zelensky said he received no  pressure from the Trump administration ever.   Simply put, there was no quid pro quo and no crime. There was only  the majority's disdain for the President, and that is not an  impeachable offense.   The elections are in 10 months, but the majority doesn't trust the  American people. Too many have said that the impeachment is necessary  so that the President is not reelected in 2020, and that is shameful.   Today's vote sets a new precedent for America. In the future, the  majority will use impeachment as a tactic to remove a President simply  based on partisanship. Our Founders feared this, and I strongly oppose  it.   I want my statement to be in the Record until the end of time to show  that I was on the side of the Constitution, that I oppose the majority  taking down a duly elected President who committed no crime, and that I  defended the truth.
