 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Jeffries for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the wife of the sheriff of Rock Island  County, Illinois. I also rise today in support of the Justice in  Policing Act.   I have listened to so many people throughout the district that I  serve who are hurting, so many stories of people who are in pain: a  woman whose cousin died when the police used a neck restraint like the  one that took George Floyd's life. That was in 2010, a decade ago. Her  family has been fighting for justice ever since.    I recognize that I as a White woman cannot fully understand the pain  that Black Americans feel, but I also know that if we are going to make  real and lasting change to end systemic racism, I must care just as  much and I must be just as motivated as those in the communities who  are hurting most.   Today, I lift their voices. America will hear you.   For this family's decade-long quest for justice, we can, we will, and  we must act.
