 Madam Speaker, on behalf of Nevada's Third  District, I rise today to recognize Mr. Kenny Belknap, an honors and AP  government teacher at Del Sol Academy.   For decades, Clark County schoolteachers have been forced to work  with a tight budget. Like Mr. Belknap told me: ``We're just trying to  keep our head above water.''   He is used to parsing materials and assigning two students to one  textbook as they fight for space in an overcrowded classroom. And,  unfortunately, that was before the COVID-19 pandemic.   The economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis is devastating State  and local governments. In my home State of Nevada, the Clark County  School District is expecting budget cuts of $38 million this year  alone. It is classes like Mr. Belknap's that will hurt the most from  this loss.   Congress can help by prioritizing Federal funding to States, towns,  and communities to relieve budget shortfalls so our education,  healthcare, and public services don't suffer.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to help our States and local  communities and give teachers like Mr. Belknap a chance to give his  students the opportunities they deserve.                            ____________________
