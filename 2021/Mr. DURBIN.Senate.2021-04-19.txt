 Madam President, I was sure that I wouldn't like him. I  was convinced that we weren't going to get along. I had so many  grievances against President George W. Bush--the war in Iraq, the  interrogation of prisoners--I really was prepared not to like him at  all, and then I met him. Darn it. I met him and I liked him and I still  do.   We still have some profound differences on issues. I think back on  his Presidency, and there are some things that I want to give him  credit for. First and foremost, I want to thank him for being our  President during 9/11 because, if you remember what he said after 9/ 11--and how profound it is in light of our history since--he said our  war against terrorism is not against people of the Islamic faith; it is  a faith of peace. What a remarkable statement to make by a President  because we have seen just the opposite since by another President from  his party.   He did great work when it came to global health, extraordinary work.  He changed the world for the better. I was glad to be his ally in that  effort.   That wasn't the sum total of all the work on the good side of the  ledger that he had done, and I won't recount the areas of disagreement  because there were many, but I do want to tell you that I was touched,  personally touched by an article that President  [[Page S2004]]  George W. Bush wrote in the Washington Post this weekend. It was about  his new book, a collection of paintings entitled ``Out of Many, One.''   He said, in putting this book together, he was really setting ``out  to accomplish two things: to share some portraits of immigrants''--and  he has become an accomplished painter--``each with a remarkable  story,'' he says, ``I try to tell, and to humanize the debate on  immigration and reform.''   George W. Bush, a proud Republican, speaks not only to the people of  America but especially to his own political party in this article. ``I  hope that these faces, and the stories that accompany them, serve as a  reminder,'' he writes, ``that immigration isn't just part of our  heritage. New Americans are just as much a force for good now, with  their energy, idealism and love of country, as they have always been.''   He goes on to talk about some of the amazing stories, the story of a  young man from France who followed his dream to become an American  soldier and went on to earn the Medal of Honor, the story of a champion  runner who barely survived ethnic violence in East Africa and who told  President Bush: ``America has given me everything I dreamed of as a  boy.''   He says the backgrounds of these immigrants are varied, ``but readers  won't have to search hard for a common theme.'' President Bush writes:  ``It's gratitude. So many immigrants are filled with appreciation, a  spirit nicely summed up,'' he writes, ``by a Cuban American friend who  said: `If I live for a hundred years, I could never repay what this  country has done for me.'''   President Bush writes: ``The help and respect historically accorded  to new arrivals is one reason so many people still aspire and wait to  become Americans.'' And then he asks the important question: ``How is  it that in a country more generous to new arrivals than any other,  immigration policy is a source of so much rancor and ill will?'' The  short answer, he says, is that the issue has been exploited in ways  that do little credit to either party. And no proposal on immigration  will have credibility without confidence that our laws are carried out  consistently and in good faith.   ``One place to start,'' bless him, he writes, ``is DACA (Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals.) Americans,'' he writes, ``who favor a  path to citizenship for those brought here as children, known as  `dreamers,' are not advocating open borders. They just recognize that  young men and women who grew up in the United States, and who never  knew any other place as home, are fundamentally American. And they  ought not be punished for choices made by their parents.''   Let me just add, thank you, President Bush. He speaks of our border,  and he should. Another opportunity for agreement, he calls it. ``I have  long said that we can be both a lawful and a welcoming nation at the  same time.'' He writes we need a secure and efficient border, and we  should apply all the necessary resources to ensure it.   He goes on to say we need a modernized asylum system that provides  humanitarian support and appropriate legal channels for refugees. The  rules for asylum should be reformed by Congress to guard against  unmerited entry and reserve that vital status for its intended  recipients.   I don't disagree with a word he has written. ``Increased legal  immigration, focused on employment and skills,'' and here we may have  some area of disagreement, ``is also a choice that both parties should  be able to get behind.'' He also writes about improving our temporary  entry program for some workers.   And listen to what President George W. Bush writes about the  undocumented in America, estimated to be in the numbers of millions, 11  million. Here is what he says: ``As for the millions of undocumented  men and women currently living in the United States, a grant of amnesty  would be fundamentally unfair to those who came legally or are still  waiting their turn to become citizens. But undocumented immigrants  should be brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which  legal residency and citizenship must be earned, as for anyone else  applying for that privilege. Requirements should include . . . work  history, payment of a fine and back taxes, English proficiency,'' and  other things.   He closes by saying: ``If we trust those instincts in the current  debate, then bipartisan reform is possible. And we will again see  immigration for what it is: not a problem and source of discord, but a  great and defining asset of the United States.''   I was touched by those words and still am that he would be so caring  and so pointed in his message. That is the basis for bipartisan  immigration reform which America desperately needs.   Now I am looking for George W. Bush and the Republicans to join the  Democrats in a bipartisan effort to get it done. I have called together  a group for that purpose, and we are going to meet again soon to talk  about the progress that we might be able to make.   I do want to thank the President. We have a job to do, and we need  the values that George W. Bush still brings to the American people in  this debate.                                 Gun Violence    Madam President, over the weekend in Chicago, a 13-year-old boy, Adam  Toledo, on March 29, in the wee hours of the morning, was stopped by  police and shot and killed in an alley in the city of Chicago.   Thousands have been gathering since in his memory. The videotape of  the arrest was released last week, and there is that stark moment with  his hands up, and he is being shot and killed--13 years old.   There is a lengthy debate going on in our city and our Nation about  the role of the police, the fairness of law enforcement, and what is  happening with children in areas of poverty and guns. This past  weekend, our Nation's epidemic of gun violence continued to devastate  families and communities. The Adam Toledo tape wasn't the only thing  that happened.   In the city of Chicago, yesterday, Sunday, 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams  was shot and killed in the backseat of a car while with her father at a  McDonald's drive-through. She was one of 27 people shot in Chicago this  weekend--5 of them fatally.   In Kenosha, in the Presiding Officer's home State, a gunman in a  tavern, on Sunday morning, killed three people and wounded three more.   In Austin, TX, three people were fatally shot on Sunday morning in a  reported domestic violence incident.   Then, on Thursday of last week and for the third time this year,  there was another mass shooting in Indianapolis at a FedEx facility.  Eight people died.   These were just some of the more than 100 Americans who are killed  every single day by guns in this Nation. This, unfortunately, is not an  isolated set of incidents, and this is not just a rare tragic weekend.  This is America 2021. One of the key parts of an effective response to  this crisis is understanding it, and that raises important questions  about the news coverage of gun violence as well as anything else.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an April 5  column of the Chicago Tribune, entitled: ``Why aren't Chicago's mass  shootings included in the outcry over recent violence in Atlanta,  Colorado and California?'   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 5, 2021]  Column: Why Aren't Chicago's Mass Shootings Included in the Outcry Over            Recent Violence in Atlanta, Colorado and California?                             (By Heidi Stevens)         When a gunman killed four people and wounded a fifth at a       Southern California office building last week, news outlets,       over and over, called it the third in a string of mass       shootings.        ``The violence in the city of Orange was the third major       mass shooting in just over two weeks,'' an Associated Press       story published on chicagotribune.com read. ``Last week a       gunman opened fire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, and       killed 10. A week before that, six Asian women were among       eight people killed at three Atlanta-area spas.''        No mention of Chicago.        In Sunday's New York Times, Nicholas Kristof wrote a column       headlined, ``How do we stop the parade of gun deaths?''       Chicago gun deaths were nowhere to be found.        But 15 people were shot at a party in Chicago's Park Manor       neighborhood on March 14 (two days before the Atlanta-area       shootings) and eight people were shot outside a Wrightwood       neighborhood storefront on March 26 (four days after the       Boulder shooting and five days before the Orange shooting.)  [[Page S2005]]         What does it say that the violence here is so rarely       included in larger discussions--in the media, among       politicians--about mass shootings and the trauma they inflict       on our nation?        ``Mass shootings are mass shootings when they involve white       people,'' Shaka Rawls, principal of Leo Catholic High School       in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood, told me. ``When       they're Black people, it's just something that happened over       there. When it's violence perpetrated by and on Black people,       the mainstream media can easily turn its back and say, `This       is what happens in those communities.' But the impact is huge       on those communities.''        I called Rawls because the school he leads is located down       the street from the funeral home where 15 people were shot on       a Tuesday evening in July. Rawls raced to the scene as soon       as he heard the news.        ``I will never unsee that,'' he said. ``I'm traumatized by       that, and this isn't my first rodeo. People are laid out on       the ground. People are crying. There's no ambulance on the       scene yet. I'm a school principal. I'm not trained for       this.''        But in the days and weeks that followed, he found himself       having to advocate for his students and staff to receive       counseling and support, when he expected to be fielding       offers of help.        ``So many things that happen in my community are not looked       at as violence perpetrated on human beings,'' he said.       ``Sometimes we have to remind people that these are humans.       The people experiencing this trauma are humans.''        On a day-to-day basis, Chicago's gun violence doesn't go       unnoticed or unremarked upon. City residents and leaders face       near-constant criticism and ridicule for our devastatingly       high number of shootings and deaths.        But I hear those shootings and deaths lobbed as a jeer far       more often than I hear them urgently, thoughtfully discussed       as a crisis deserving of all-hands-on-deck solutions. And the       failure to include Chicago in the national discourse about       mass shootings feels like a symptom of this larger problem:       an ``othering'' of our violence--as if it isn't as tragic,       isn't as much of an assault on humanity, isn't as deserving       of widespread calls for answers and reform.        ``It's because we're killing each other, so it's nothing       out of the ordinary,'' said Danielle Stipe-Patterson, 32, who       lives in Park Manor. ``When it should be out of the ordinary.       This is traumatic. This is trauma. I can't even watch certain       TV shows because I'm living it. Why watch it for       entertainment when I literally hear the gunshots every other       night?''        Stipe-Patterson's dad was shot to death in Roseland when       she was 8 years old. He was outside washing his car when he       was killed.        ``He wasn't affiliated with any gangs,'' Stipe-Patterson       said. ``He was just a boy from Louisiana who had seven kids       and two jobs.''        For several years, Stipe-Patterson worked as a program       associate for the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence       conducting workshops and speaking to students in and around       Chicago about gun violence and the importance of mental       health resources for both prevention and healing.        ``At the beginning, I felt like I made a difference,'' she       said. ``I was able to share my story with kids who lost a       parent or an uncle or a brother, showing them that you can       still make it. After a while, sharing the story over and over       and over and coming home and living the problem in the       community, it was taxing.''        Now she works for a nonprofit that offers arts programming       to kids who can't attend school because of chronic illness.        She started to feel like legislators and other people in       positions of power were less interested in addressing the       root causes--racial segregation, long-term disinvestment on       the South and West sides, lack of mental health resources,       underfunded schools, repeated exposure to trauma--and more       interested in simply chalking up Chicago's violence to gangs.        After a recent shooting on her block, Stipe-Patterson said       she and other neighbors tried to get information from police       about what happened, how they might help solve the crime, and       what to be on the lookout for.        ``They wouldn't tell me anything,'' she said. ``You have to       solve these things in the community, but how are we supposed       to be a community if y'all aren't allowing us to be a       community? How are we supposed to change stuff if y'all       aren't being transparent with us?''        Every shooting--whether it takes place on a city sidewalk       or inside a church or at a suburban high school--is a product       of what the shooter experienced in life, Rawls said.        ``Poverty, a desperate outlook on life, poor parenting,       bullying at school,'' he said. ``How did they get the weapon?       What's the economic impact on that community? What's the       social and emotional impact on that community? There is not a       catchall solution, but those should be the questions in every       case. Every case.''        Firearms are the leading cause of death for children and       teens in Illinois, said Kathleen Sances, president and CEO of       G-PAC Illinois, a gun violence prevention political action       committee.        ``An average of 183 children and teens die by guns every       year in Illinois,'' Sances said. ``The gun violence crisis       disproportionately affects Black and brown children and       teens, who are 13 times more likely to die from gun violence       than their white counterparts.        ``Black and brown children are dying and nobody's doing       anything about it,'' she continued. ``People who don't live       in impacted communities don't see the violence. They       dissociate themselves from those people. And I think the       media reinforces this perspective.''        I agree. Yet, as a member of the media, I am engaged in an       endless internal dialogue about how and how much to write       about the violence in my beloved city. Too little is an       insult to the human lives shattered by it and a dodging of       the responsibility to shine light on our most pressing       problems. Too much risks reinforcing negative stereotypes       about a city that is so much more than the violence that has       forever plagued it.        Rawls said he feels similarly conflicted over whether he       wants more attention paid to Chicago's mass shootings,       whether he would want to see Chicago listed alongside Atlanta       and Boulder and Orange in an AP story.        If the attention would result in more federal resources       directed at the problem? If the attention were accompanied by       an interest in solving the root causes of gun violence, an       understanding of Chicago's porous borders through which       weapons flow, an acknowledgment of the levels of trauma and       fear that many of his students carry on their shoulders?       Sure.        ``But the conversations don't have that tone,'' he said.       ``There's a, `That's what they get. They shouldn't have been       there' tone. I've seen it.''        More media attention? More politicians invoking Chicago in       their gun reform speeches?        ``It could be like throwing water on a grease fire,'' Rawls       said.        I believe we can do better. I believe we--we in the media,       we in Chicago, we Americans--can refuse to settle into a       place where we accept gun violence as simply the cost of       living in this city, where we experience the gun violence       here as somehow less remarkable and less remarked upon than       gun violence elsewhere. Bullets shattering a funeral on 79th       Street are every bit as repellent to human nature as bullets       shattering the aisles of a grocery store in Boulder,       Colorado.        ``I think the best thing to remember is that the things       that divide us are socially constructed,'' Rawls said. ``The       things that separate us are created by society. And if we       created them, we can dismantle them. I would like for       everyone to see each other as humans, to see this is a       problem happening to humans, not just those people over       there.''    Heidi Stevens' column in the Tribune points out that the  media often subjectively defines and covers what it considers to be  mass shootings. All too often, mass shootings in communities of color  are left out of the coverage, and this is wrong. It is unfair. It is  nothing short of an outrage. It needs to change.   We need to understand the full scope of this crisis that is killing  so many Americans, with reliable, objective data that is quickly made  available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps count,  but there is a time lag with its data on firearm deaths and injuries.  Right now, the latest official CDC report on gun deaths is from the  year 2019. There is a website, though, Gun Violence Archive, that keeps  track of shooting incidents virtually on a realtime basis.   I believe that news coverage of mass shootings in America should use  the definition and statistics provided by the Gun Violence Archive.  They define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people  are shot and either killed or injured, not including the shooter. It is  a purely numerical standard. It is not subjective. According to the Gun  Violence Archive's definition--I want to put this on the record in the  Senate--so far this year, by its definition, there have been 153 mass  shootings. Yet we are only 109 days into the year. Nine of this year's  mass shootings so far have taken place in Chicago. Four people have  been fatally shot in these shootings, and 50 have been injured. It is  important to gather this data as quickly as possible so that we can  respond effectively.   Last week, I spoke on the floor and commended President Biden for  speaking out. He recently announced an important set of Executive  actions on gun violence: steps to limit untraceable ghost guns, help  for States to pursue extreme risk protection orders. Incidentally, the  State law in Indiana was not, apparently, solid enough or tamperproof  enough and was overcome there by the latest mass shooting. There is the  reporting on firearms trafficking patterns and nominating experienced  veteran David Chipman to be the first Senate-confirmed Director of that  Agency since 2015.   You see, many of the critics of gun safety legislation say to just  enforce the laws we have, but if you have been around the Senate for  more than 15  [[Page S2006]]  minutes, you will realize the Agency that has a major responsibility in  that, the ATF, is notorious for being underfunded, understaffed, and  going without leadership. That is part of the design of the people who  really don't even want to see the laws enforced.   I am particularly encouraged by President Biden's commitment to  providing Federal resources for community violence interdiction  programs through the American Jobs Plan and other grant programs. This  is the type of serious investment we need to tackle this crisis. This  President is taking constitutional, commonsense steps to reduce gun  violence, but what have we done? Nothing.   I held a hearing on gun violence in the Judiciary Committee a few  weeks ago. We are going to hold more as Senator Blumenthal, of  Connecticut, chairs the subcommittee with that responsibility. Hearings  are important so that we can put together legislative reforms and  appropriate funds. The House has already passed a bipartisan bill to  close gaps in the gun background check system. Really, the ball is in  the Senate's court at this moment. We need 10 Senate Republicans to  help us get to the 60 votes necessary to overcome Republican  filibusters.   Will our Republican colleagues stand up and vote to close these gaps  in the law? Will our Republican colleagues support the President's call  for funding community violence interdiction?   We need to act. Saving lives from gun violence should not be a  partisan issue. It is an American tragedy. Sadly, we learn by the day  that it is not an exclusive blue State problem. It is a blue State and  a red State problem. It is an American problem. We have had too many  mass shootings and too many Americans dying in gun homicides, suicides,  and accidents. Let's take the bold action that meets the scale of this  public health crisis. Our Nation is counting on us.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr.  Heinrich) and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S2037]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1211         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cahokia Mounds Mississippian       Culture National Historical Park Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Historical park.--The term ``historical park'' means       the Cahokia Mounds Mississippian Culture National Historical       Park established by section 3(a).        (2) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``Cahokia       Mounds Mississippian Culture National Historical Park,       Boundary'', numbered CMMC-NHP-107, and dated 05-31-2019.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (4) States.--The term ``States'' means the States of       Illinois and  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1212         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Tomorrow's       Workforce Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of       the Nation's Gross Domestic Product on labor market policies,       less than half of what the United States spent on labor       market policies 30 years ago.        (2) The number of workers receiving federally supported       training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in       technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand       over time.        (3) Job losses from automation are more likely to impact       women, people of color, and workers making less than $40,000       annually.        (4) The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated trends in       automation, with 43 percent of businesses in the World       Economic Forum's Future of Jobs survey indicating they plan       to reduce their workforce as a result of technology       integration.        (5) Strong Federal investment in expanding training       services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation       could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to       changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions       in technologically oriented occupations and industries.        (6) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States       for jobs that utilize advanced technologies could grow wages,       increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness       of the United States.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Automation.--The term ``automation'' means a device,       process, or system that functions without continuous input       from an operator, including--        (A) advanced technologies, such as--        (i) data collection, classification processing, and       analytics; and        (ii) 3-D printing, digital design and simulation, and       digital manufacturing;        (B) robotics, including collaborative robotics, and worker       augmentation technology;        (C) autonomous vehicle technology; or        (D) autonomous machinery technology.        (2) Dislocated worker.--The term ``dislocated worker'' has       the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Workforce       Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102).        (3) In-demand industry sector or occupation.--The term       ``in-demand industry sector or occupation'' has the meaning       given the term in section 3 of that Act.        (4) Integrated education and training.--The term       ``integrated education and training'' has the meaning given       the term in section 203 of that Act (29 U.S.C. 3272).        (5) Eligible partnership.--The term ``eligible       partnership'' means an industry or sector partnership, as       defined in section 3 of that Act, except that--        (A) for purposes of applying paragraph (26)(A)(iii) of that       section, the term ``institution of higher education'' has the       meaning given the term in section 101 of the Higher Education       Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001); and        (B) the partnership shall include, in addition to the       representatives described in clauses (i) through (iii) of       paragraph (26)(A) of that section, representatives of--        (i) a State workforce development board or a local       workforce development board; and        (ii) an economic development organization.        (6) GAO study on automation.--The term ``GAO study on       automation'' means the study on automation conducted by the       Comptroller General of the United States, as directed in       House Report 116-450 (incorporated in the explanatory       statement regarding the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021       (Public Law 116-260) in accordance with section 4 of such       Act).
