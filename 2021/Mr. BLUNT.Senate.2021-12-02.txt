 Mr. President, this is always a very busy time of the year  if we are still here, and it has been a long time since the Congress  wasn't here in the first of December. There have been years within the  last couple of decades where we actually got our work done fairly close  to the time that the spending year started. We are not close to doing  that now. In fact, the apparent best-case scenario is that we will need  to extend this year's spending--the spending that ended on September  30--through most of the month of February before we really can get down  to the work that you and I would like to see happen, as we serve on the  Appropriations Committee.   We are here a lot of times in December, but we are seldom here in  December without having made a real start on the work that has to be  done. Instead of the work that has to be done, we seem to be down to  the work that our friends on the other side really want to do. Of  course, that means the trillions of dollars of spending beyond what we  would normally spend.   That is being described by people as transformative, as once-in-a- century, as FDR-like. The one thing it is for sure is it is 100 percent  partisan. Nobody expects a single Member of the Senate on the  Republican side to vote for this reckless tax-and-spending bill.   You can tell, as you listen to the description of the bill, that  there is beginning to be more and more worry about what the American  people are thinking that this bill might really wind up doing to their  families and to the country. When they hear that it is going to be  transformative, when they hear that the entire economy will be  different and people's problems will change in dramatic ways, people  really begin to have to wonder how that happens, particularly when we  hear that this won't cost anything.   Well, of course it is going to cost something. You can say all you  want to, that the cost is zero, but the cost can't possibly be zero of  something that is going to transform the economy and solve people's  problems. Somebody is going to have to pay for that.   At one time, it appeared that, well, maybe we will just raise every  bit of those extra spending dollars on new tax dollars. That hasn't  happened yet in any bill that has been brought forward. In fact, the  bill that the Senate is going to receive from the House has an actual  deficit, even by the Congressional Budget Office standards, of about  $350 billion.   In 2019, we almost decided that we couldn't move forward on the debt  ceiling because the Speaker of the House said: We are not going to help  on the debt ceiling unless there is another $19 billion of domestic  spending.   This was 2019. We spent weeks fighting about whether we would spend  another $19 billion. The Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Mnuchin,  was down here about once or twice every week in the negotiations that  it would take to decide if we are going to spend $19 billion. Now we  are talking about a $350 billion addition to the national debt, and  that is even if you accept all the gimmicks in the bill.   There are other negative effects as well. One of those big negative  effects will be, of course, the impact of inflation on families. We are  already seeing the impact of the big--the spending bill in March, the  $1.9 trillion of spending that out of nowhere came into the economy,  totally unpaid for, totally partisan.   Last year, we had five bipartisan bills that both sides worked hard  to do what we needed to to respond to COVID, to try to stabilize the  economy. This year, we started off the year in March with an almost $2  trillion totally partisan bill, and that partisan bill is beginning to  have the kinds of effects you would expect it would have.   Costs are going up. There is more money out there, and mostly there  is just money that is just made up out of thin air. It is borrowed,  where the government is borrowing from itself. We are issuing bonds and  buying the bonds at the Fed and then sending money to people. They are  spending that money, and, of course, that has an impact on costs.   Then there are energy policies that have an impact on costs as well-- the immediate decision to not move forward with a significant energy  pipeline that was being built; the immediate decision to do what we  could to reduce the domestic production of energy. That has had exactly  the results you would expect it to have, just like putting this money  into the economy has had a result. So everything from home heating  costs, which are estimated to go up as much as 50 percent this year if  the weather is no worse than last year, to filling up your gas tank--we  have a chance of setting a new personal record every time you pull up  to the gas tank and wonder how much money you can put in that empty gas  tank today--to buying groceries, to even getting people together for  the holidays.   Independent analysts of the big tax-and-spending spree say that the  number isn't $1.7 trillion, but it is about three times that, about  $4.8 trillion. Now, how could you go from 1.7 to 4.8 just like that?  You do it by assuming, as our friends who are sponsors of the bill do,  that the spending in the bill will actually be spent over the entire 10  years.    There is one program where families with kids at home get a check  every month from the government. That program costs about $450 billion  a year, and it is in the bill for 1 year. Well, nobody on the other  side believes it is going to be in the bill for 1 year, and nobody  voting against the bill is at all certain that it is going to be there  for 1 year. Most of the analysts say, no, that is going to be there for  not 1 year but all 10 years. So you add another $450 billion times  nine, and suddenly you have added trillions more in spending to the  bill.   There are other programs that last 2 years, and some programs last 4  years. Almost none of the programs that are to be paid for in 10  years--and even with a $350 billion deficit--almost none of the  programs to be paid for in 10 years last 10 years. They are just in  there to get the program started, to get people convinced that they  really need the government to do something for them that the government  hasn't done before, and then see if we can extend that.  [[Page S8889]]    As I mentioned, back in March, we had already done this once with a  totally partisan $1.9 trillion spending bill. What happened after  March? We got inflation to a 30-year high in the August numbers and  consumer confidence to a 10-year low. You have to work pretty hard to  get inflation at a 30-year high and consumer confidence at a 10-year  low, but that is what happens when you put $1.9 trillion into the  economy that wouldn't have been there otherwise.   So what would happen if you put $4.8 trillion into the economy that  wouldn't be there otherwise? The people who are most impacted by the  results of that are the very people the bill purportedly is going to  help, is designed to help. We are going to solve all of your problems.  Well, first of all, the government is not going to get that done. We  are going to solve Americans' everyday problems, but if you do that by  raising their costs higher than their pay can go up, you haven't done  anybody a favor.   President Biden campaigned on a return to normal, but he is governing  on what his self-described allies say is radical change. Well, those  two things seem to me to be in pretty big conflict. You can't have  ``return to normal'' and ``radical change'' at the same time.   There was no mandate in the last election. The Senate is as evenly  divided as it could possibly be--50-50. In the House, Democrats have  the closest margin that they have had in 170 years and one of the  closest margins that anybody has had in decades.   Americans want their elected representatives to stop selling every  crisis as an opportunity to impose another one-sided view of how the  country needs to move forward.   You hear and I hear at home and even from the press: When is the  Congress going to work together? Well, we worked together last year to  do five bills to respond to the COVID and economic crisis, and we did  that together. That was a pretty good model. Frankly, I think it was  the model that the American people were thinking about when they voted  for this closely divided Congress and in a fairly closely divided  Presidential race at the conclusion of the election.   Families need real solutions to the challenges they face. Reckless  tax and spending, driving inflation, sending gas prices to alltime  highs and home heating prices to alltime highs and increasing the cost  at the grocery store--if there are things to buy at the grocery store-- by 15 or 20 percent surely, isn't what we want to pass on to our  children, our grandchildren, our people, hard-working families out  there today trying to make things happen and make things better for  their families.   I yield the floor.
