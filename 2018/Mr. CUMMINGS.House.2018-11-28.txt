 Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome Minister La'Shawn  Worrell as our guest chaplain here at the United States House of  Representatives.   Minister Worrell has demonstrated leadership in Baltimore and  throughout the Seventh Congressional District of Maryland. She has  served as an associate minister of my church, the New Psalmist Baptist  Church in Baltimore, since 2007.   During her time at New Psalmist Baptist Church, Minister Worrell  received her bachelor of science degree in religious studies from Notre  Dame of Maryland University in May 2017 and completed the Baltimore  City Police Department chaplaincy program in May of this year.   It is clear to me that, considering Minister Worrell's drive and  extensive contributions to our district, she is just getting started.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Minister  Worrell for her leadership and for her wonderful prayer.                            ____________________
