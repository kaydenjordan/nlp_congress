 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Paige  Youschak-Thompson of Laconia as December's Granite Stater of the Month.  Paige is known throughout the Lakes Region for her service to different  organizations. Although she has always volunteered, she became more  active when her daughter was in school, and now, with her daughter an  adult, volunteering has become the equivalent of a full-time job. Paige  volunteers 5 days a week for more than 40 hours a week.   Paige will never say no when someone asks for her help. Although she  does not have a favorite cause or organization, the Saint Vincent de  Paul Society, a local thrift shop, has a special place in her heart  since it is where she first started to consistently volunteer. In  addition, Paige is especially fond of helping kids in the community and  believes in giving all children a chance, regardless of their income  level. She worked with a local boutique to help provide free prom  dresses to girls who may otherwise not be able to have one. Paige is  also the chair of the community engagement committee for the Greater  Lakes Region Children's Auction, which helps local children and  families in need; it has distributed more than $8 million over the last  40 years to the community.   Paige's strong pull towards volunteer work stems from her deep and  lifelong desire to be a person who helps out and holds space for  others. Paige makes other people happy in any way that she can. Being  able to help the community brings her great joy, and she plans to  continue volunteering for as long as she can.   Paige showcases the Granite State spirit of giving every day of the  year, and I am honored to name her Granite Stater of the Month.  Especially as we enter the holiday season, I hope that we can all  aspire to give our time and support to our community as freely as Paige  does.                            ____________________
