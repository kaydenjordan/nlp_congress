 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize KPI  Concepts of West Burlington, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   KPI Concepts was founded by Craig Upton in 1984 out of his garage in  Burlington, IA, building cabinetry for local businesses. Two years  later, KPI Concepts moved to a 4,200-square-foot building with a  workshop. The original building was expanded to 42,000 square feet  between 1986 and 2006, and in 2007, they purchased an additional  65,000-square-foot location. The second location expanded a few years  later. After starting as a commercial cabinetry business, they evolved  to manufacture wind turbine blade components in 2008 with the KPI  Composites division. In 2013, they added a west coast location in  Hurricane, UT, while maintaining their West Burlington headquarters.  Over the years, KPI Concepts has grown to include the KPI Metals  division as well. Today, KPI Concepts is focused on providing  innovative products to the wind energy industry. Throughout this  history of business growth, the company's employees have been  instrumental to its success.   As with many founders, Craig's journey to founding KPI Concepts had  many chapters. After graduating from Burlington High School in 1973, he  went on to attend Southeastern Community College, where he earned an  associate's degree in mechanical technology. He later went on to work  as a design draftsman, welder, and in the data processing department.  When he lost his job, his father, who had a passion for woodworking,  urged Craig to pursue his dream and start KPI Concepts. In addition to  being the Founder of KPI Concepts, Craig Upton has given back to the  community. In 2014, he was recognized by Southeastern Community College  with the Distinguished Alumnus Award.   The KPI Concept's team has been awarded for their contributions to  the industrial services industry. The KPI Metals team was awarded the  Manufacturer of the Year Award by the Greater Burlington Partnership in  2017. Due to the hard work and dedication of the KPI Concepts  employees, they celebrated their 39th business anniversary in 2023.   KPI Concept's commitment to providing high-quality wind turbine  parts, commercial cabinetry, and metal manufacturing services to  customers throughout the United States while maintaining their Iowa  roots is clear. I want to congratulate the entire team at KPI Concepts  for their continued dedication to providing industrial services to  Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Iowa.                            ____________________
