 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Wayne Perkey, a Louisville broadcasting legend, a man of immense  compassion and charity, and my friend. He passed away this weekend  after a hard-fought battle with COVID-19.   A Tennessee native, Wayne landed at Louisville's WHAS as a young  deejay in 1969, and he would ultimately grace our city's airwaves for  more than 30 years, hosting the radio station's daily morning show and  emceeing WHAS11 TV's annual Crusade for Children charity event.   Wayne's skills as a broadcaster were only surpassed by the kindness  he showed to his colleagues and fellow Louisvillians, his dedication to  helping others, and his deep love for his family.   Wayne's passing is a loss for our city and Commonwealth, for all who  remember starting their morning with that familiar cheerful voice, and  for me personally. I am keeping the entire Perkey family in my thoughts  and hope the fond memories we all have of Wayne are a source of  strength for them. He truly was a treasure.                            ____________________
