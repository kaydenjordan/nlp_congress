 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Nani Coloretti's  nomination to be the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and  Budget.   Ms. Coloretti is a dedicated public servant and a proven leader who  is well qualified to serve as OMB Deputy Director. She has over 20  years of experience at the Federal, State, and local level executing  complex government programs, improving service delivery, and managing  large organizations.   Ms. Coloretti served with distinction in the Obama administration as  the Assistant Secretary for Management at the U.S. Department of the  Treasury and then as the Deputy Secretary at the Department of Housing  and Urban Development.   It is absolutely critical that we have Senate-confirmed leaders in  place at OMB, and I have no doubt that Ms. Coloretti's experience will  serve the Agency and the American people well.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Nani Coloretti's  nomination to be OMB Deputy Director.   I yield the floor.
