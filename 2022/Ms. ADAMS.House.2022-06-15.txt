 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  her great work.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the hunger crisis in our  communities and in our schools.   Millions of children will go hungry on June 30, just 2 weeks from  now, if we fail to act. Let me say that again for anyone who may not  have heard me. Millions of children will go hungry on June 30 if we do  not act.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the Charlotte  Observer outlining how the children in my district will be affected.        No More Free Lunch for Some CMS Students Starting Next Year                        (By Anna Maria Della Costa)         A program that has provided free meals to K-12 students in       Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will stop at the end of this       school year.        The U.S. Department of Agriculture's universally free       school meals arose out of pandemic-era waivers that allowed       all K-12 students to get school breakfast and lunch at no       cost regardless of their family's income beginning in March       2020. Those waivers are set to expire June 30, despite school       nutrition advocates urging Congress for an extension in the       federal 2022 spending bill.        School meal programs will return to pre-pandemic procedures       for the 2022-23 school year, which means free breakfast       continues and lunch may not.        ``I just want to remind everybody. it's the U.S. Department       of Agriculture that this falls under, this is not the CMS       Board of Education trying to give everybody a tough time on       free and reduced lunch,'' Interim Superintendent Hugh       Hattabaugh said during the board's meeting Tuesday. ``We were       hopeful that maybe the bill that was set forward would be       approved, but it was not extended out.''            IN CMS, BREAKFAST WILL STILL BE FREE FOR ALL STUDENTS         Cassie Fambro, a media relations specialist with CMS, told       the Observer that breakfast will continue to be provided in       all of the district's schools at no charge for the 2022-23       school year. For each of CMS' summer camps and programs, free       breakfast and lunch also will be provided.        CMS will not raise lunch meal prices for 2022-23, keeping       them at pre-pandemic rates for students. For pre-K students,       the lunch meal price is $2.50; K-8 students pay $2.75 and 9-      12 students pay $3. The reduced price lunch meal is 40 cents.                       PARENTS: FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK         Students attending some CMS schools will have to qualify       for free or reduced-price lunch through direct certification,       which could include families receiving food stamps, students       who are homeless or foster children. Students can also       receive free meals from an approved free or reduced-price       meal benefit application.        Students not approved for free lunch will need to have cash       or money on account to pay for lunch. Fambro said.        Applications will be available online or on paper beginning       August 1.        ``We're not going to let any child walk away without a       meal.'' Hattabaugh said. ``We need help from parents and the       community to assist everybody.''        Board member Margaret Marshall said it's concerning that       the waiver is not going to be extended.        ``We're going to have a lot of families who if they don't       qualify and fill out paperwork are going to have some       problems with food this year,'' Marshall said. ``Make sure       families fill out the paperwork so we can have  [[Page H5595]]       the funds to feed those students and they won't rack up meal       debt which has to come due at some point. This is really       important.''                         68 CMS SCHOOLS NOT AFFECTED         CMS has 68 schools that fall into the Community Eligibility       Provision, an option for schools and districts in low-income       areas. The program allows schools to serve meals at no charge       to all enrolled students, and families do not have to fill       out an application.        Hattabaugh said these schools will not be affected by the       change in meal service.        ``They will still have what they had during the pandemic.''       he said.        The following CMS schools are in the Community Eligibility       Provision:        Albemarle Road Elementary, Albemarle Road Middle,       Allenbrook Elementary, Ashley Park (K-8), Charles Parker       Academic Center, Berryhill School, Briarwood Elementary,       Bruns Avenue Elementary, Walter G.

Madam Speaker, at the beginning of the pandemic, this body  authorized waivers to help make it easier for schools to offer meals to  kids, and we gave access to healthy, nutritious foods to 10 million  more school-age children because finding reliable food sources became a  problem.   In case my Republican friends need a reminder, President Trump signed  that legislation into law. Even as the pandemic continues and food  prices are on the rise, these waivers are set to expire at the end of  the month.   As a 40-year educator, I know that hunger has been a crisis in our  schools and our communities since long before the pandemic. That is  also why when I came to Congress, I founded the Adams Hunger Initiative  to help coordinate the response to the hunger crisis in my community,  and why hunger has been one of my top priority issues in Congress.   In my home State of North Carolina, food insecurity has been a tragic  fact of life for our kids and our students. In fact, I just heard from  members of the North Carolina PTA today about their ever-present  concerns about food insecurity and how it will impact our students.   In 2018, 441,000 North Carolina children participated in SNAP, and  207,351 residents participated in the Women, Infants, and Children  program, or WIC. In 2019, 92,010 students participated in the summer  food service program. Almost 100,000 students needed help from their  school, so they didn't go hungry--again, that was before the pandemic.   In Charlotte, the hunger crisis led at least 24 elementary, middle,  and high schools in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District to open  food pantries to serve students in need during summer breaks and the  vacation.   For example, at Windsor Park Elementary in east Charlotte, members of  the Windsor Park Neighborhood Association donated food to keep the  shelves stocked for scores of food-insecure and housing-insecure  children.   In west Charlotte, University Park Creative Arts School is restocked  on a regular basis by Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, and thanks  to local donors it has a refrigerator and a large freezer to offer  diverse options for students and families. The need is real, and it is  staring us in the face.   It is also important to note that these two schools, along with 66  other local schools that will fall into the Community Eligibility  Provision, will still be able to offer meals and food to students at  the same levels of service as the past 2 years.   However, approximately 114 of our district's schools are not eligible  for that provision, meaning that access to summer nutrition will become  a patchwork. When students return at the end of the summer, fewer  students will get the meals that they need.   Our choice is clear: we can choose to act, or we can let millions of  children go hungry. As always, I am standing with our students.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Omar and the Congressional  Progressive Caucus for hosting this important Special Order hour  tonight.
