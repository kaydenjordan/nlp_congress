 Madam Speaker, there is no doubt the American Dream  and Promise Act will bring much-needed relief to our Dreamers and our  immigrant communities, and I will be voting for the bill.   However, many of my constituents are disappointed that H.R. 6  includes harsh exclusions that will block many of our long-term members  of our community from citizenship simply because of misdeeds, mistakes  that they made years and years ago. I will continue to advocate for  them.
