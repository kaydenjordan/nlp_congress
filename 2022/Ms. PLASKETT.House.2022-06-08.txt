 Madam Speaker, I have shared before that my father was  for many decades a New York City police officer. He had to carry a  firearm to protect himself and others, but was acutely aware of  individuals on the street, often with guns illegally, who could harm  him and those he was tasked to protect.   I do not oppose the right of American citizens to own guns, or intend  to rob any constitutional rights. But, we all know that money, hatred,  and power have used the Constitution to cover themselves from showing  the real intent that they have, the love of greed, desire for power,  ignorance, racism, hatred. That is what many are using that  constitutional protection to cover themselves from.   Over 50 percent of gun violence is attributable to people who use  handguns to commit suicide. The remainder of those deaths and injuries  are largely homicide and murder, such as widespread street crime. Then  there are mass killings, which have been on an uptick in recent years.   On May 24, in Texas, an 18-year old boy acted as a lone gunman in the  second deadliest school shooting on record. Armed with a semiautomatic  rifle and 375 rounds of ammunition, he entered Robb Elementary School,  opened fire, and laid waste to 19 children and two teachers. The  pervasiveness and regularity of such occurrences in the United States  has reached epidemic levels.   In 2020, 45,222 Americans died of gun-related injuries, more than any  other year on record. That is a 14 percent increase since 2019; a 25  percent increase since 2015; and a 43 percent increase since 2010. In  this year alone, almost 19,000 people have already lost their lives; a  number, evidenced by the events of the past couple of weeks, are only  on the rise.   This weekend alone, over a dozen mass shootings took place: Buffalo,  Texas, Philadelphia, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Oklahoma, so  many more. These mass killings are just the tip of the iceberg with  respect to gun violence carnage in America.   Firearms are the leading cause of death for children and teens in  this Nation. How many more children will be sacrificed before action is  taken? How many more schools will we allow to become battlefields and  burial grounds for the sake of the cloak that many are using the  Constitution for.   The time for action is now. We know that our gun violence epidemic  can be substantially curtailed with thoughtful, reasonable commonsense  gun legislation. This includes raising the age, as we have done for so  many things, for automatic purchases to 21, and developing and  implementing more comprehensive background checks to prevent situations  like the Buffalo shooting and the Uvalde massacre.   We need to strengthen gun laws for gun trafficking, which is  devastating our country. Areas with strong gun laws cannot curtail the  influx of illegal guns trafficked in from States with few restrictions.  Places like New York City and Chicago cannot curtail the illegal  weapons coming from other places.   With higher unemployment rates, places like my home, the Virgin  Islands, has the second highest rate of guns smuggled across its  borders and a homicide rate nine times higher than the 50 States.   As well as better establishing and regulating gun storage to prevent  minors from acquiring deadly weapons, it is necessary for Members on  both sides of this debate to come together to protect the lives of our  citizens.   Throw off the cloak that you are using, calling our Constitution to  hover and hide what you are really protecting: money, power, hatred.                            ____________________
