 Mr. President, sometimes when I am traveling across  Tennessee, someone will come up to me and say: Why don't you guys in  the U.S. Senate ever do anything? So I have taken to carrying around a  little card that I keep in my pocket. I hand it to them and I say:  Well, I can read this to you in about 30 seconds, and this is what has  happened in the last 18 months: the best economy in 18 years; lower  taxes; biggest reforms in 31 years; biggest increase in financial  support for the military in 15 years; biggest pay raise in 8 years for  the military; more repeal of regulations than anyone can remember; a  Supreme Court Justice; 21 conservative appeals court judges; Alaska  energy, which took 38 years, and the Presiding Officer knows all about  that; a new National Labor Relations Board, which could be the most  important change of all; repealed the ObamaCare individual mandate; the  Dodd-Frank mortgage rules are gone; Veterans Choice, which the  President signed yesterday; Iran, Russia, and North Korea sanctions.   All of that would not have happened without a Republican President,  and it would not have happened without Republican majorities in the  U.S. Congress. It took both.   The person who asks me ``When are you guys ever going to do  anything?'' will often say ``Well, I didn't know that; I hadn't  realized that.''   So I am very proud of that record; that is in 18 months. I think if  you like a conservative government, a center-right government, you  would have to agree that those are the most accomplishments in at least  30 years in this country. The President should be justly proud of that,  and so should the Congress.
