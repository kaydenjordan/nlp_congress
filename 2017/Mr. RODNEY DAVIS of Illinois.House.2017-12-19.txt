 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions  for his leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are about to make history this week by delivering a  tax cut to families at every income level.   The math clearly shows that the average family of four, making the  country's median income of $73,000, will receive a $2,000 tax cut.   Yet many of my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to say  this bill is going to raise taxes on millions of middle class families.  That is just not true, unless you are referring to 2025, when these tax  cuts expire and we go back to the status quo.   Why is there an expiration date?   Because many of the very same people, using this as a talking point  against this bill, are the reason they sunset. If we could get 60 votes  in the Senate, requiring just a few of my friends on the other side of  the aisle to work with us, we could make this tax cut for middle class  families permanent right now. They have chosen not to work with us.   I will be giving my friends on the other side of the aisle another  chance to support tax cuts for hardworking families in their district.  I will be introducing a bill to make the individual tax cuts permanent.   I am not sure there is anyone who truly believes that a future  Congress would let them expire, given the fact that we have extended  the Bush tax cuts in the past.   Nonetheless, I am introducing this bill to ensure these tax cuts will  be in place for middle class families this year, and to make sure they  are here to stay.   Mr. Speaker, I hope each and every one of my colleagues will sign on  as a cosponsor.
