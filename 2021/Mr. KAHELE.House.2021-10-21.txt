 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, America's broken for- profit healthcare system has left millions of Americans uninsured or  underinsured.   While out-of-pocket costs and corporate profits continue to rise, 8  million Americans have turned to a new form of health insurance, online  fundraisers like GoFundMe, to pay their medical bills.   My nephew, Sean Day, was one of them. He passed away from cancer  earlier this month at just 22 years of age.   Mr. Speaker, we live in the richest country in the world. No one  should be priced out of the healthcare that they need or delay seeing a  doctor just because they can't afford it. No one should be forced to  ask strangers online to crowdsource their medical bills. It is simply  not right.   This is why we must pass the Build Back Better Act. The Build Back  Better Act will invest in our communities' healthcare, expand medical  coverage for our kupuna, and lower prescription drug prices. It will  save lives.   During the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history, we must deliver the  care that American families deserve. We must leave no one behind.                            ____________________
