 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3175 which will designate the  post office located at 135 Main Street in Biloxi, Mississippi as the  Robert S. McKeithen Post Office Building.   Robert McKeithen began his career in service to this great Nation and  ended it in service to south Mississippi.   Officer McKeithen graduated from the University of Mississippi and  went on to serve in the U.S. Air Force where he earned the Air Force  Commendation Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force  Achievement Medal. He retired from the Air Force as a tech sergeant.   After his service in the Air Force, McKeithen became an officer and  worked at the Biloxi Police Department for 24 years. A testament to his  selfless nature, Robert was one of 13 officers in the department  honored with the Medal of Valor for his rescue efforts in the aftermath  of Hurricane Katrina.   I am inspired by his spirit of service and strength of character. A  great man and officer was taken too soon, but he will never be  forgotten.   Officer Robert McKeithen's end of watch was in Biloxi on May 5, 2019,  but this post office renaming will provide for a daily reminder of his  dedication and love for his community and our love and respect for law  enforcement.   I thank the McKeithen family--to include his wife, Pamela McKeithen;  his children, Amy, Levi, Natalie, Logan, Lillian, and Lauren; his  grandchildren, Delmas and Kaiden; his sisters, Melissa and Kathryn; and  his brother, William--for allowing me the honor and privilege to  introduce this piece of legislation in Robert's memory.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3175.
