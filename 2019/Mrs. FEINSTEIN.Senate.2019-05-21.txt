 Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Daniel Collins to the United States Court of Appeals for  the Ninth Circuit.   Mr. Collins had been nominated to a California seat on the Ninth  Circuit over the objections of Senator Harris and myself. Neither  Senator Harris nor I returned blue slips for Mr. Collins, yet the  majority moved forward with his nomination, disregarding our concerns.   This vote on Mr. Collins follows on the heels of last week's vote on  Kenneth Lee, another Ninth Circuit nominee who lacked blue slips from  me and Senator Harris.   So, once again, we see the majority violating Senate norms and  traditions by ignoring home-State Senators, including the Judiciary  Committee's ranking member, and stacking the courts with ideologues.   This breakdown in Senate traditions is harmful to all of us,  Democrats and Republicans. It is also unnecessary.   As I have highlighted before, Democratic Senators have been willing  to work with the White House to find consensus picks for the circuit  courts, but that willingness has been rebuffed by the Trump  administration and disregarded by the majority.   The majority's decision to once again ignore blue slips is short- sighted. After all, what goes around comes around.   Senator Harris and I refused to return blue slips on Mr. Collins for  several reasons.   I have used a bipartisan instate screening commission to vet  potential nominees to California district and Ninth Circuit seats for  my entire career. These are highly respected lawyers from throughout  the State, and they have reviewed and recommended nominees from  Democratic and Republican administrations.   My instate bipartisan commission raised concerns about Mr. Collins's  rigidity, temperament, and history of taking positions in litigation  for the purposes of overturning precedent and challenging legal  boundaries.   The role of a judge is to be an impartial arbiter, not an advocate  and not someone with an agenda, particularly an agenda of overturning  precedent.   Based on this, I am concerned that Mr. Collins has not demonstrated  and does not embody the characteristics that we expect of all Federal  judges.   I also believe that Mr. Collins's record on women's reproductive  rights, executive power, civil liberties, and criminal justice matters  puts him far outside the judicial mainstream.   For example, Mr. Collins was a strong advocate for the Bush  administration's use of military commissions to try enemy combatants  held at Guantanamo Bay. He even went so far as to argue that the  President's authority as Commander-in-Chief allowed him to bypass  Congress and create these commissions without congressional approval.   Mr. Collins also wrote a law review piece in which he argued that  Miranda v. Arizona, a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that  protects the rights of individuals, should be overturned.   For the last decade, Mr. Collins has also defended numerous chemical  and energy companies in lawsuits brought by homeowners, Tribes, and  local governments. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits have argued that  these companies contributed to climate change and its effects, such as  increasing the severity of storms and causing sea levels to rise.   In several of these lawsuits, Mr. Collins argued that climate change  is not even real. For example, in a case representing Shell Oil  Company, Mr. Collins wrote that ``climate change allegedly results from  the aggregate effects of greenhouse gas emissions from billions of  sources around the world accumulating in the global atmosphere over the  course of centuries, and thus it cannot be attributed to . . . energy  companies.''   In addition, in questions for the record, he refused to acknowledge  that climate change is real and that human activity contributes to it.   I understand that Mr. Collins was representing clients in these  lawsuits, but he was the one who chose which arguments to make,  including arguments that climate change is not real. We cannot have a  judge on the Ninth Circuit who denies climate change and its impacts.   At his hearing, Mr. Collins was willing to answer questions from  Republicans on his personal views, but not answer similar questions  from Democrats.   For instance, when asked how he ``feel[s] about the First Step Act,''  Mr. Collins said: ``I think that the First Step Act . . . appeared to  me to be a balanced approach to reform some of the sentencing  provisions which seemed unduly harsh.''   But when asked by Senator Blumenthal whether he believed Brown v.  Board of Education was correctly decided, Mr. Collins refused to  answer.   Nominees should not answer Republican questions and evade Democratic  ones, especially when it comes to answering questions about Brown v.  Board of Education, a monumental case whose correctness cannot and  should not be questioned and has been answered by previous Republican  nominees, including Chief Justice Roberts.   Taken as a whole, I believe Mr. Collins is far outside the legal  mainstream.   Given concerns about his temperament and commitment to upholding  precedent and given the positions he has taken on executive power,  criminal justice, and other matters that could come before the Ninth  Circuit, I cannot support Mr. Collins.   I voted against Mr. Collins, and I urged my colleagues to do the  same.                            ____________________
