 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to make in order the Cole-McCarthy amendment that would ensure the  President can protect the United States and our ally, Israel.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Slavery  and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.   Globally, there are over 40 million victims of human trafficking at  any given time, 75 percent of them women and girls, and 25 percent are  children. While 81 percent are trapped in forced labor, millions more  are in forced sexual exploitation and forced marriages.   Not only is human trafficking at epidemic levels overseas, but it is  also experiencing rampant growth in our own backyard.   Statistics rank the State of Florida as the third highest trafficking  destination in the U.S. Human trafficking traps millions of the most  vulnerable members of society into modern-day slavery and generates  annual profits of $150 billion.   Events like the February Super Bowl in Miami are major targets. It is  imperative that we give law enforcement the tools needed to identify  and prevent human trafficking.   We also need to pass legislation that deters and punishes the  perpetrators and allows the victims to heal and reacclimate.   This rapidly growing issue demands our attention. Let's work  together, no matter which side of the aisle we sit on, to end this evil  for good.                            ____________________
