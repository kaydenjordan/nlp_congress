 Madam Speaker, I stand here representing families all  across this country who are struggling with rising costs of virtually  everything, from gas to groceries. And there doesn't seem to be an end  in sight.   Inflation is taxation, and it has increased every single month since  Joe Biden has been President. Last month marked a 30-year record high  in inflation.   Even worse, real wages have decreased under Biden almost every month  since he has been in office.   So what is causing this inflation? President Biden and his allies in  Congress are continuing to borrow trillions and trillions of dollars to  pay for a massive Big Government expansion. It  [[Page H6838]]  is unsustainable, and we cannot afford it.   It is past time we get this runaway spending under control. As I have  said countless times, Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue  problem.   The American people deserve better than this. It is time that we put  them first and get our economy back on track.                            ____________________
