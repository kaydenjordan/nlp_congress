 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin  Islands (Ms. Plaskett), Mr. Richmond, and all of the distinguished  members of the Congressional Black Caucus for leading this very  important and critical conversation and discussion this evening.   President Trump said it couldn't get any worse for the African- American community. He asked the question: What did we have to lose by  supporting him?                                time  2000    Well, it is even clearer now that we have everything to lose,  starting with health care.   Marian Wright Edelman said: ``The question is not whether we can  afford to invest in every child, but it is whether we can afford not  to.''   Health care, we all know, is one of the most important investments we  [[Page H2230]]  can make in our children. Nearly 12 million African Americans are  insured through Medicaid. In Florida, 41 percent of children, in my  home State of Florida are covered through Medicaid.   This GOP healthcare plan guts Medicaid, cutting funding by $880  billion over the next 10 years. It also eliminates Medicaid expansion,  which covers 1.5 million African Americans.   So what do we have to lose?   Families, children, will lose their health care. For those who do not  lose health care, they will be forced to pay higher premiums. That, for  some families, could mean the difference between a doctor's visit and  food on the table.   Since the ACA was signed into law 7 years ago this Thursday, our  community has seen its insured rate increase to the highest number in  recent history. For a community that has long faced increased barriers  to healthcare access and delayed doctor visits because of the cost, the  ACA has meant the difference between life and death.   There is no question, we can make the Affordable Care Act more  affordable for all Americans, but this bill doesn't do that.   So what do we have to lose?   President Trump, and to my GOP colleagues, I tell you the stakes  could not be higher. Progress will be lost--progress that took many  years to make, progress could be lost--by repealing the ACA.   The most vulnerable of people, the people we really should be taking  care of in a country that we say is the greatest country in the world-- I do believe that to be true--people that we should be taking care of,  including our children, will be hurt the hardest.   Florida has the Nation's highest enrollment number in the ACA, at  1.67 million sign-ups for 2017. But not only does repeal hurt children,  but, in my home State of Florida, it also hurts millions of seniors.   A recent analysis from AARP shows that Florida will be ``Ground  Zero'' for the Republicans' health plan's effects. They found that  nearly a half a million Floridians between the ages of 50 and 64 would  face higher premiums under the GOP plan, more than any other State; the  people affected the most, low-income seniors.   So here is what is at risk in Florida's 10th Congressional District.  The district's uninsured rate has gone from 22 percent to 15 percent  since the ACA was implemented. 343,000 individuals in the district who  now have health insurance that covers preventative services like cancer  screenings and flu shots, without any copays, coinsurance or  deductibles, stand to lose this access if the Republican Congress  eliminates the ACA provisions requiring health insurance to cover  important preventative services without cost-sharing.   392,000 individuals in the district with employer-sponsored health  insurance are at risk of losing important consumer protections. 64,000  individuals in the district who have purchased high-quality marketplace  coverage now stand to lose their coverage if the Republican Congress  dismantles the marketplaces.   Over 60,000 individuals in the district who received financial  assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016 are now at risk of  coverage becoming unaffordable if the Republican Congress eliminates  the premium tax credits.   So what do we have to lose?   The evidence could not be clearer.
