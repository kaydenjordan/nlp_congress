 Madam Speaker, I appreciate you and the great work you  do.   I rise to honor my good friend, Pace Robinson, who recently passed  away at the age of 65. My buddy Steven Rosen called me the other day  and gave me the bad news. They had been playing golf just the day  before, and things seemed to be going really well.   Pace grew up in Knoxville and was a family man through and through.  He worked with his dad, Mitchell, at the Modern Supply until Mitchell  passed away, and Pace became the company's president until he retired  in 2017.   He met the love of his life, Karen, at the 1982 World's Fair, and  they were married for 38 great years. They had two sons together, Eli  and Asher, and he loved them dearly. He also had a granddaughter,  Poppy, and he loved her with all his heart.   Pace was a respected leader in his community. He helped lead the  Knoxville Jewish Federation, The Knoxville Jewish Alliance, the Webb  School of Knoxville, and many other groups over the years.   He was also a great businessman. He was respected by his employees.  He loved his regular poker game where, for over 30 years, the stakes  were still at a quarter a chip.   I have known Pace for a long time, Madam Speaker, and he and his  family supported me through my career, even though they didn't always  agree with me on every issue.   I send my condolences, especially to his wonderful family: Karen,  Eli, Asher, Poppy, and all the friends and family that knew and loved  him.   I will never forget what a good friend he was to me. I know next year  when I go to that first UT football game, and I walk up to the tailgate  and not see him there, it will be a big void there. He was quite a man.                            ____________________
