 Mr. President, what can you say about a dear friend who  has passed away? That he was brilliant? And supremely accomplished?  That he loved family and church? And the law? And people from all walks  of life?   To say these things does not nearly capture the full measure of the  man, the much-beloved lawyer John Cassidy, a wonderful and humble  person who rose to the top of his field, who advised Washington  dignitaries from Presidents on down, indeed so many in this body; a man  who was friends to celebrities, business leaders, and politicians  [[Page S7906]]  alike, to busboys, cabbies, and store clerks as well; a man who lived  life to the fullest and yet always had a kind word for whomever he  encountered in the wide, wide world he so loved to explore.   We lost our friend John Cassidy on October 21. While some might be  tempted to say at 88 years John lived a long life--his incredible  vigor, his youthful enthusiasm, his passion for life, his ready smile,  and the twinkle in his eye--all underscore how the world was robbed by  the sudden death of John Cassidy.   And so I wish to pay tribute to John Joseph Cassidy, a writer and  painter, a gardener and chef, a legal scholar and mentor to decades of  young students, and most of all, a devout family man whose definition  of ``family'' embraced so many beyond his cherished wife Cynthia, his  daughters Susan Ross Cassidy of Newton, MA, Carrie Elizabeth Goertz of  Anchorage, AK, and Alice Madeline Meyre of Richmond, VA, and his six  grandchildren John, Ned, Jennifer, Kate, Margaret, and Thomson.   I was proud to be part of that large extended family, and I mourn his  loss.   Cassidy--how he invariably identified himself on the phone--was a  native Washingtonian, a rarity here in the Nation's Capital. John  graduated from Georgetown University and then its law center and  maintained a lifelong allegiance to both institutions, including  service on the university's board of directors and the law center's  board of visitors. That type of unfailing allegiance is vintage John  Cassidy, as I came to learn over the decades of our close friendship.   Even as a young lawyer, Cassidy became active in civic affairs,  serving as vice chairman of Montgomery County's Law Enforcement and  Criminal Justice Commission and as chair of the town council of Chevy  Chase Section 4. He served in the Army's JAG Corps where, in his  typically self-deprecating style, he described his several years in  Iceland as time honing his salmon-fishing technique with visiting  senior officers.   Upon his return to the United States in the early 1960s, John served  as executive assistant to the board of monitors appointed by the court  to oversee the Teamsters as part of a Department of Justice settlement  with the union concerning charges for corruption. He became a trial  attorney in the Justice Department and a trusted aide to Attorneys  General Robert Kennedy and Nicholas Katzenbach.   To be with Cassidy was to be with history. I remember once, when I  walked him out of the Russell Building by my office in SR-135, he  looked out at the Upper Senate Park extending down to where the  Teamsters building stood. John gazed over and said, ``Hoffa used to  call that the `Trail of Tears' as he came up to testify in the  Senate.'' With that, he was off to Constitution Avenue to flag a cab  back to his office.   That was what life with Cassidy was like, and I will miss that so  much about him.   Indeed, conversations with Cassidy were not ripped from a ``Law &  Order'' marathon, a rapid-fire back and forth of case citations.  Conversations with Cassidy were a meandering path, filled with history,  commentary, a few recipes, jokes, and, yes, gardening tips.  Conversations with Cassidy were an experience to be savored and long  remembered.   In 1965, Cassidy left Justice, forming the Miller, Cassidy, Larroca &  Lewin law firm with several of his former colleagues. Bill France, Sr.,  the founder of NASCAR, a major target of Hoffa's efforts, became one of  the firm's anchor clients, a relationship that lasted for decades.  Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin became a go-to law firm for public  officials and business leaders under investigation for criminal  offenses, a cadre that multiplied during the Watergate prosecutions and  under the Independent Counsel Act that followed.   Miller Cassidy went on to represent a President, two former Attorneys  General, numerous Senators and Representatives, six judges, and dozens  of high-ranking executive branch officials.   When former partner Jamie Gorelick was nominated to be Deputy  Attorney General in 1994, the Wall Street Journal said of the firm in  an editorial that ``among Beltway bigwigs, its phone number is posted  right next to 911.''   For a small law firm, a remarkable number of the firm's alumni were  confirmed by the Senate to positions in the judicial and executive  branches. They include a Deputy Attorney General, a Solicitor General,  two Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing,  General Counsels of the CIA and Defense Department, three Federal  appellate judges, and three U.S. District judges. No fewer than a dozen  alumni became deans or professors at prominent law schools. Nearly all  were mentored during their careers by John Cassidy.   In 2001, John called to tell me that he and most of the other lawyers  from Miller Cassidy were joining the Washington, DC, office of Baker  Botts, where he continued to practice until the brief illness that  preceded his death. Throughout his career at Miller Cassidy and Baker  Botts, John was renowned for how passionately he fought to protect the  interests of his clients, many of whom remained friends for decades  after their legal matters were resolved.   Former Secretary of Treasury and later Secretary of State James  Baker, a senior partner at Baker Botts, said to me about John Cassidy,  ``John Cassidy was a great lawyer, but he was also, I think more  importantly, a great friend. He had all the tools one would look for in  an advocate and an advisor, and he knew how to work both the judicial  process and the negotiating table to the benefit of his clients. But  John also really cared about your response when he asked 'How are you  doing?' He was truly a genuine person, and it seems we are missing too  many of his kind of people these days . . . and not only in the legal  profession.''   There are so many fond memories I have of life with Cassidy. Indeed,  my relationship with him started over a legal matter, but we quickly  became friends, and that was true for so many of my colleagues who  sought John's capable legal advice to save us from demise.   I remember how John would interrupt tense negotiations with a quick  quip or story that changed the room's dynamic and helped bring  resolution to the matter at hand. I remember how he would bring to  restaurants his famous jams from his carefully tended Berry Farm in  Potomac. At Ristorante Tosca, he was often seen bringing his homemade  caramels or preserves into the kitchen, insisting the chef and staff  partake of his food long before he ever ordered his meal.   I remember Cassidy's love of golf led him to significant charitable  work with the Tiger Woods Foundation. John and I were equally skilled  as golfers, and that is not a compliment to him or me. While even on  our very best days neither of us could threaten to break par, playing  golf with John was an experience that ran counter to the title, but  fully in the spirit, of Tom Boswell's wryly named book, ``A Good Walk  Spoiled.''   Spending time with John was always a treasure.   I remember John's vibrant pastel drawings; he often drew inspiration  from his magnificent garden at the Berry Farm--garden with berries and  flowers, herbs, and Mr. Stripey tomato plants ten feet high. Such was  his bounty.   I rue that I will never be able to pour over his draft memoirs,  surely to be one of the most interesting tomes in recent history.   Once, I asked Cassidy when he was planning on retiring. He wasn't  sure. Cindy tells me, at 65, he decided to delay the decision 5 years-- at 70, another 5 years--at 75, another 5 years. I have no doubt, at 90,  he would have given the same reply.   In a tribute to Cassidy, his nephew, Jim, said, ``John Cassidy was a  friend of motorsports, a friend of NASCAR and a friend to just about  whoever made his acquaintance. And he was so much more.''   That sums it up. John Cassidy was a friend to this body, a friend to  our institution, and a friend to me. His passing is a loss to his  family, his many friends and colleagues, and most of all, this country  that he loved so much. I will miss him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court in  Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 2018, struck down the Federal  prohibition of State-authorized sports wagering schemes. I was one of  four original authors of that prohibition, the Professional and Amateur  Sports Protection Act of 1992, Public Law 102-559; 106 Stat. 4227,  which found that ``sports gambling conducted pursuant to State law  threatens the integrity and character of, and public confidence in,  professional and amateur sports, instills inappropriate values in the  Nation's youth, misappropriates the goodwill and popularity of  professional and amateur sports organizations, and dilutes and  tarnishes the service marks of such organizations.''   Today, I joined with Senator Chuck Schumer to introduce the Sports  Wagering Market Integrity Act of 2018, a comprehensive legislative  response to the Murphy decision. This legislation is the product of  nearly one year of discussions with stakeholders on all sides of the  issue, the gaming industry, professional and amateur sports leagues,  consumer advocates, data providers, law enforcement, and many others.   I would urge my soon-to-be former colleagues and other Members of  Congress, should they choose to take up this issue, to use the bill I  have introduced today as a starting point for their work, but recognize  that there is much work to be done, and I would anticipate that any  final legislation might look very different from the bill that was  introduced today. For example, the degree to which the Department of  Justice or other Federal agencies need to be involved in overseeing  state sports wagering regimes, the appropriate level of control that  sports organizations should have over sports wagering, and the basis  for requiring the use of so-called official league data continue to be  open questions in my mind. I do not necessarily believe that those and  other provisions introduced in the bill today reflect a final decision  regarding the appropriate policy. But these provisions do flag many of  the difficult issues to be considered as part of the sports wagering  discussion. I would urge my colleagues not to be discouraged by the  challenges and competing interests, and I look forward to being  supportive of future congressional efforts to engage on this issue.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court in  Murphy v.
