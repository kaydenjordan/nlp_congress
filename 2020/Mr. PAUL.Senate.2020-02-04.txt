 Mr. President, the great irony of the last several weeks in  the impeachment trial is that the Democrats accused the President of  using his governmental office to go after his political opponent. The  irony is, they then used the impeachment process to go after their  political opponent. In fact, as you look at the way it unfolded, they  admitted as much.   As the impeachment proceedings unfolded, they said: We didn't have  time for witnesses. We had to get it done before Christmas because we  wanted it done and ready to go for the election. We had to get it  done--the entire process needed to be completed--before the election.   They didn't have time for the process. They didn't have time for due  process. They didn't have time for the President to call his own  witnesses or cross-examine their witnesses.   The great irony is, they did exactly what they accused the President  of. They used the government and the government's process to go after  their political opponent.   What is the evidence that it is partisan? They didn't convince one  Republican. Not one elected Republican decided that any of their  arguments were valid or that the President should be impeached.   They made it into a sham. They made it into a political process  because they didn't like the results of the election.   When did this start? Did the impeachment start with a phone call to  the Ukrainian President? No, the impeachment and the attacks on the  President started 6 months before he was elected.   We had something truly devastating to our Republic happen. We had,  for the first time in our history, a secret court decide to investigate  a campaign. At the time, when those of us who criticized this secret  court for spying on the Trump campaign, they said: Oh, it is just a  conspiracy theory. None of this is happening. There is no ``there''  there.   But now that we have investigated it--guess what--the FISA court  admits they were lied to. The FBI has now been proven to have lied 17  times. We have a half a dozen people at the top level of our  intelligence community who have admitted to having extreme bias. You  have Peter Strzok and Lisa Page talking about taking down the President  and having an insurance policy against him succeeding and becoming the  President. You have McCabe, you have Comey, and you have Clapper.   You remember James Clapper, the one who came to the Senate, and, when  asked by Senator Wyden, ``Are you storing, are you gathering  information from Americans by the millions and storing it on government  computers?'' James Clapper said no. He lied to Congress. Nobody chose  to impeach him, but he lied to Congress and committed a felony. Is he  in jail? No, he is making millions of dollars as a contributor on  television now, using and peddling his national security influence for  dollars, after having committed a felony in lying to us.   These are the people who plotted to bring the President down. These  are the people who continue to plot to bring the President down. Before  all of this started, though, I was a critic of the secret courts. I was  a critic of FISA. I was a critic of them abusing American civil  liberties. I was a critic of them invading our privacy, recording the  length of our phone calls, who we talk to, and sometimes recording  conversations--all of this done supposedly to go after terrorists, but  Americans, by the millions, are caught up in this web.   But now, for the first time, it is not just American civil liberties  that are being abused by our intelligence agencies. It is an entire  Presidential campaign, and it could go either way. This is why you want  to limit power. Men are not angels, and that is why we put restrictions  on government. We need more restrictions now. We can't allow secret  courts to investigate campaigns.   This started before the election. It went on for the last 3 years,  through the Mueller investigation. They thought they had the President  dead to rights, and they would bring him down through this  investigation. So, initially, the spying didn't work, and the Mueller  investigation didn't work. They went seamlessly into the impeachment.   The question for the American public is now: Will they go on? Are  they going to immediately start up hearings again in the House that  will be partisan hearings again? I suspect they will. They have had  their day in the Sun, and they loved it, and I think they are going to  keep doing it time and time and time again.   Now, during the proceedings, I asked a question that was disallowed,  but I am going to ask that question again this morning, because the  Constitution does protect debate and does protect the asking of  questions. I think they made a big mistake not allowing my question.   My question did not talk about anybody who is a whistleblower. My  question did not accuse anybody of being a whistleblower. It did not  make a statement believing there was someone who was a whistleblower. I  simply named two people's names because I think it is very important to  know what happened.    We are now finding out that the FISA investigation was predicated  upon 17 lies by the FBI, by people at high levels who were biased  against the President, and it turns out it was an illegitimate  investigation. Everything they did about investigating the President  was untrue and abused government to do something they never should have  done in the first place.   So I asked this question. And this is my question--my exact question.  We will put it up here:         Are you aware that the House Intelligence Committee staffer       Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella       while at the National Security Council together? Are you       aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and       Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the       President before there were formal House impeachment       proceedings?    Now, why did I ask this question? Because there are news reports  saying that these two people--one of them who works for Adam Schiff and  one of them who worked with this person at the National Security  Council--that they knew each other and had been overheard talking about  impeaching the President in the first month of his office. In January  of 2017, they were already plotting the impeachment.   And you say: Well, we should protect the whistleblower. The  whistleblower deserves anonymity.   The law does not preserve anonymity. His boss is not supposed to say  anything about him. He is not supposed to be fired. I am for that.   But when you get into the details of talking about whistleblowers,  there is a variety of opinions around here. The  [[Page S825]]  greatest whistleblower in American history, in all likelihood, is  Edward Snowden. What did people want to do with him? Half the people  here want to put him to death and the other half want to put him in  jail forever. So it depends on what you blow the whistle on, whether or  not they are actually for the whistleblower statute.   I am not for retributions on the whistleblower. I don't want him to  go to jail, and I don't want him to lose his job. But if six people,  who all work together at the National Security Council, knew each other  and gamed the system, knowing that they would get these protections-- they gamed the system in order to try to bring down the President--we  should know about that. If they had extreme bias going into the  impeachment, we should know about that.   I think the question is an important one, and I think we should still  get to the bottom of it. Were people plotting to bring down the  President? They were plotting in advance of the election. Were they  plotting within the halls of government to bring down the President?  Look, these people also knew the Vindman brothers, who are still in  government. So you have two Vindman brothers over there who know Eric  Ciaramella, who also know Sean Misko, who also knew two people working  on Adam Schiff's staff, and Adam Schiff throws his hands up and says: I  don't know who the whistleblower is. I have never met him. I have no  idea who he is.   So if he doesn't know who he is and the President's counsel doesn't  know who he is, how does the Chief Justice of the United States know  who the whistleblower is? I have no independent confirmation from  anyone in government as to who the whistleblower is. So how am I  prevented from asking a question when nobody seems to admit that they  even know who this person is?   My point is, is by having such protections--such overzealous  protection--we don't get to the root of the matter of how this started,  because this could happen again. When the institution of the  bureaucracy, when the intelligence community with all the power to  listen to every phone conversation you have has political bias and can  game the system to go after you, that is a real worry. It is a real  worry that they spied on the President.   But what if you are an average ordinary American? What if you are  just a supporter of President Trump or you are a Republican or you are  a conservative? Are we not concerned that secret courts could allow for  warrants to listen to your phone calls, to tap into your emails, to  read your text messages? I am very concerned about that.   So we are going to have this discussion go on. It isn't really about  the whistleblower so much. It is about reforming government. It is  about limiting the power of what they can do as secret courts. I think  the FISA Court should be restricted from ever investigating campaigns.  If you think a campaign has done something wrong, call the FBI, go to a  regular court, where judges get to appear on both sides, and if you  want to subpoena somebody or tap the phone, all right, we can do it,  but it has got to be an extraordinary thing.   Think about it. Think about the danger. The other side says it is a  danger to democracy. Think about the danger to democracy of letting  your government tap the phones of people you disagree with politically.   I don't care whether it is Republican or Democrat. We cannot allow  the intelligence community and secret courts like the FISA court to go  after political campaigns. And I mean that sincerely--Republican or  Democrat. We need to change the rules. We cannot have secret courts  trying to reverse the elections.   I feel very strongly about this. I was for this reform before Donald  Trump ever came on the scene and before any of this happened. I have  been for having more significant restrictions on these secret courts  and more significant restrictions on the intelligence community to make  sure they don't abuse the rights of Americans. This is a big deal, and  if we are going to get something good out of this, if there is going to  be some positive aspect to having to go through this nightmare we have  been through over the last several months or years now, the blessing in  disguise here would be that we actually reform the system so this never  happens to anyone else ever again.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to recognize Ms. Mattie  Florence Jones, recipient of the 2020 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Freedom Award, for her lifetime of commitment to the dream of equality  so beautifully articulated by Dr. King. Her tireless civil rights  advocacy is surpassed only by her loving commitment to her family,  including the dozens of foster children who were welcomed into her  Louisville household. Her legacy of activism and service are  unparalleled and worthy of this special distinction.                            ____________________
