 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to this legislation.   Through the CARES Act and the previous relief packages Congress has  already approved, the Federal Government has acted swiftly to address  our most pressing needs as a result of the coronavirus. Our efforts  thus far have been about three things: saving lives, saving jobs, and  saving our economy.   These bills were negotiated in good faith and passed with  overwhelming bipartisan support to provide immediate resources and a  lifeline to families, workers, businesses, and States.   Mr. Speaker, legislation on the House floor today is not in the same  bipartisan spirit of addressing the urgent needs of Americans during  the coronavirus pandemic. It is written without input from the minority  and prioritizes divisive partisan policies over real relief for  Americans.   One division I am concerned about is agriculture. Instead of simply  supporting farmers, ranchers, and the effectiveness of our feeding  programs, which is where our focus should be, the bill ties the hands  of the USDA. These partisan policies have no place in a relief package,  and this legislation is dead on arrival in the Senate.   As we begin to open up our economy, Congress must continue combating  the virus and getting Americans back to work.    Mr. Speaker, we also could be doing  more for working individuals by including my legislation, the AG CHAIN  Act, which would suspend Federal income tax and payroll taxes for  essential workers during this pandemic.   However, today's legislation was drafted and introduced with  unnecessary haste and lacks bipartisan support  [[Page H2235]]  to become law. I am voting ``no'' on this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
