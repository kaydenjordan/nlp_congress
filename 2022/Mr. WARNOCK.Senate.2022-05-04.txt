 Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct, which is  at the desk.    Mr. President, this legislation will help to lower costs  for hard-working families, create jobs, and equip the Nation to compete  in a changing economy.   Historically Black colleges and universities have been putting in the  work. For years, they have always had to punch above their weight, but  they play a critical role in creating those jobs and in ensuring that  we have a diverse, trained workforce for new technology, for research,  and advanced manufacturing opportunities in Georgia and, indeed, across  the country.   That is why we have to invest in their ability to meet tomorrow's  challenges. When we invest in all of our young people, we position our  economy to be strong for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years into the future.   The purpose of this motion is very simple. It will ensure that our  entire higher education sector can contribute to our growing tech and  innovation economy. We make good use of all of our talent in creating  businesses and good-paying jobs in Georgia and all across the Nation. I  hope that we can adopt this motion by voice vote.                                Vote on Motion
