 Madam Speaker, Otto von Bismarck, in the 1870s, I believe  it was, said: ``Politics is the art of the possible.'' It is still  true.   The Build Back Better bill will be the art of the possible. It will  be good for America. It will create jobs. It will help the middle class  deal with the burdens and blessings of children, childcare, child tax  credits, and education.   It will be a very significant bill passed by this Congress to help  the middle class and help those people who haven't been helped in the  past, as the Trump tax cuts helped the wealthy.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting for it. I thank the people  who are creating the art and making this possible. Politics is the art  of the possible.                            ____________________
