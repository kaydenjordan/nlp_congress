 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1665, the  Disaster Declaration Improvement Act. I thank my colleagues, Mr.  Barletta and Mr. Rodney Davis, for their leadership on this important  issue.   Rural areas are the heart of not only my district, but of America as  a whole. They are the source of food and resources, and are home to  millions of American families. When natural disasters come to these  communities, we should be doing everything in our power to help them  get back on their feet. Instead, the regulatory regime forces these  areas to meet a higher and unfair threshold in order to get the FEMA  resources that they need.   My district faced this problem back in 2013, after a tornado swept  through Washington, Illinois, destroying nearly 1,000 homes. This was a  massive loss, but FEMA's formula for public assistance kept Washington  from getting the assistance it needed to repair the public  infrastructure damaged by the storm. While individuals could get some  relief for personal property, this damage to infrastructure affects  every member of the community.   This is why I am a proud cosponsor and supporter of H.R. 1665, the  Disaster Declaration Improvement Act. This bill will change and  modernize FEMA's formula so that it is easier for rural areas and areas  with lower population density to get the support and assistance they  need after a disaster.   I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage today to ensure that all  Americans, regardless of the town they live in, can know that help will  be on the way after such tragic events happen.
