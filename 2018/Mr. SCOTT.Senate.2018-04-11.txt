 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the service and  achievements of an esteemed and valued member of the U.S. Senior  Executive Service, Dr. Kenneth A. Bertram, who completes a 32-year  career of distinguished service to our Nation on June 30, 2018.   Dr. Bertram has worked tirelessly to improve the medical readiness of  U.S. military personnel, and challenged the constraints of a burdensome  acquisition system that discouraged meaningful partnerships between  military medicine and the commercial sector. His work culminated in the  creation of the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, a South  Carolina-based nonprofit corporation that connects more than 170  private-sector companies, academic research institutions, and nonprofit  organizations to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command,  fostering research collaborations to prevent injuries and disease  impacting our Nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, treating  those who are wounded in conflict and restoring the injured to the  maximum achievable quality of life.  [[Page S2069]]    Dr. Bertram's personal awards include the Meritorious Civilian  Service Medal, the Superior Civilian Service Medal, two awards of the  Legion of Merit, ``A'' Proficiency Designator in Hematology/Oncology  from the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army, Order of Military Medical  Merit, two awards of the U.S. Army Meritorious Service Medal, and two  awards of the U.S. Army Commendation Medal. Dr. Bertram's  professionalism, patriotism, and sustained selfless commitment to  service reflect the very best values of our Nation's Senior Executive  Service. I join his family and friends in wishing him the best in the  years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment  to recognize and honor the life of William ``Bill'' Varn, a great South  Carolinian, who departed this life on November 18, 2017. Bill was a  veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in World War II. After the war,  Bill joined and eventually took over Enterprise Bank, originally  located in Smoaks, SC. Mr. Varn served as CEO from 1951 to 2013, when  he was named director emeritus last spring. It is believed that he is  South Carolina's longest serving banker ever, and dedicated more than  70 years of his life to the industry. Today Emeritus Bank is a $333  million institution spread across six SC counties.   Mr. Varn will be remembered not only for the great contributions he  made in the financial services industry, but also for his love of his  country, State, and family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and  honor Fairview Baptist Church in Spartanburg, SC for their 100th  anniversary, which will be celebrated on June 24, 2018. Fairview  Baptist Church was established in 1918 by a group of residents of the  Fairview community, known also as the Flatwoods, under direction of  Rev. C.M. Ellis and nine charter members. Starting with only 40 members  100 years ago, Fairview Baptist has since grown to include hundreds  from the Spartanburg area, while still remaining a welcoming and  devoted place of worship in the community.   I acknowledge and celebrate the church's 100 years as a congregation  faithfully serving the people of Spartanburg.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and  honor Standing Springs Baptist Church in Simpsonville, SC, for their  200th anniversary, which will be celebrated on October 18, 2018. As  Standing Springs celebrates their bicentennial throughout the week and  weekend, I thank them for their ongoing mission of service and  fellowship that I hope will continue for 200 more years to come. I  acknowledge and celebrate the church's 200 years as a congregation  faithfully serving the people of Simpsonville and Greenville  County.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize the  American Legion Post 29 in Bishopville, SC as they celebrate the  unveiling of the James Davison Heriot statue in downtown Bishopville on  Sunday, November 11, 2018. James Davison Heriot was a South Carolina  National Guard soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions  during World War I.   Post 29 is honoring the Americans who fought in World War I by  unveiling this statue on the 100th anniversary of the end of the  American involvement in the conflict, previously known as Armistice  Day. I look forward to the unveiling of the Bishopville Heriot statue,  as well as all other commemorations that will take place on this  special 100th anniversary.                            ____________________
