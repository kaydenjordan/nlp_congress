 Madam President, there has been a lot of conversation  about this body--quite frankly, around the Nation--about border  security. Rightfully so. It has been top of mind for a lot of cities,  States, for a lot of families, school districts, businesses, especially  along the border States as they have had a disproportionately large  number of people who have come, many of them from all over the world,  many of them non-Spanish speakers, not from Central America and South  America but literally from everywhere.   The Wall Street Journal had a piece just this weekend where it  detailed how hundreds of thousands of migrants from all over the world  are making their way to the southwest border which is causing a surge  in apprehensions, but it is especially people from Asia and Africa.   Human smuggling networks, it says, are widening their reach around  the globe.         Arrests at the Southwest border of migrants from China,       India and other distant countries, including Mauritania and       Senegal, tripled to 214,000 during the fiscal year that ended       in September.    That was up from 70,000 just the year before. That is tripling that  number.   What is happening is on our southern border, the cartels are finding  it more profitable to be able to move people in from farther. So they  are organizing flights for people to go through seven or eight  countries to be able to then arrive in Mexico, and they are moving them  through in what they affectionately call ``donkey flights'' to be able  to reach farther for the cartels to be able to make more and to exploit  our laws.   America has always been open to people and immigration. We are a  nation of legal immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. And what  we are finding at this stage is those laws are being exploited and  being exploited dramatically. Let me give you just an example. There  has been no change in the asylum law since 2010, but, in 2010, we had  21,000 people request asylum on our southern border for the year-- 21,000 the entire year of 2010. That wasn't an anomaly. That was about  a normal amount of people requesting asylum on our southwest border.  Now, we have that many requests of asylum on our southwest border every  3 days. So it has gone from 21,000 in a year to now every 3 days.    Everyone knows this is an issue. Last week, Secretary Mayorkas was in  front of the Homeland Security Committee, and I asked him about this in  a public hearing. I asked him whether there were policy changes that  were needed.   His answer was very direct. He said:         Yes, policy changes are needed.    I asked him specifically on reforming the asylum system, knowing that  it has been exploited. His exact answer was:         The asylum system needs to be reformed from top to bottom.    I asked him about the issue of withholding of removal, which now  about 55 percent of the people who were released into the country were  actually released under something called withholding of removal. I  asked him about that. His response was:         [Withholding of removal and] the companion element is the       convention against torture our system needs to be able to       work efficiently and expeditiously while not compromising due       process.    I asked him about repatriating individuals in difficult countries  that are called recalcitrants. He said:         Our ability to repatriate individuals to the countries of       origin when they do not qualify for relief under our laws is       of vital importance.    Why am I bringing this up? Because it is not just me saying we need  to reform the asylum process. The head of Homeland Security is saying  we need to reform this process. And it is just not the head of Homeland  Security saying we need to reform the asylum process. It is the  administration.   Two weeks ago, the administration requested additional dollars for  the border to be able to put in the supplemental. They asked for  funding for Israel, for Ukraine, for Taiwan, and for border security.  But then, after they put that request out, Homeland Security released  an op-ed in the Washington Post, which said this:         To be clear, this supplemental funding is like a       tourniquet--urgently needed and critical in the short-term,       but not a long-term solution to a deep-seated problem. Our       national immigration laws, having gone through major       revisions by Congress in 1996, are severely out-of-date, and       our system is completely broken. On this, everyone agrees.    The administration itself, just this past March, put out a release  dealing with what they call ``circumvention of lawful pathways.'' In  it, they did a Q&A back and forth to ask people questions on how it  would function. This is one of the answers from the administration  talking about what is happening currently at our border. They said:         [Such a high rate of migration] risks overwhelming the       Department's ability to effectively process, detain, and       remove, as appropriate, the migrants encountered. This would       put an enormous strain on already strained resources, risk       overcrowding in already crowded [U.S. Border Patrol] stations       and border [ports of entry] in ways that pose significant       health and safety concerns, and create a situation in which       large numbers of migrants--only a small portion of whom are       likely to be granted asylum--are subject to extreme       exploitation . . . by the networks that support their       movements north.    I would be glad to have written that myself.   The administration sees the same thing that everyone else who looks  at the border sees. If you take an honest assessment of what is  happening, our system is being exploited by cartels, and people from  around the world are answering ads that are on TikTok and messaging  services saying: I can get you into the United States if you pay me  enough money.   That is why 45,000 people from India came last year requesting asylum  in the United States--because it is easier to get in and to pay the  cartels than it is to go through the legal process. We are  incentivizing illegal activity, and this body knows it.   We are a nation of laws. We should prioritize the law. We should be  open to legal immigration, but we should be opposed to illegal  immigration and what is happening to enrich deadly, dangerous criminal  cartels in northern Mexico.   Again, the administration in their public statement made this  statement just a few months ago:         The current asylum system--in which most migrants who are       initially deemed eligible to pursue their claims ultimately       are not granted asylum in the subsequent [immigration court]       proceedings--has contributed to a growing backlog of       cases awaiting review by asylum officers and immigration       judges.   [[Page S5354]]     What are they saying? The system is broken because it is packed with  people who do not actually qualify for asylum coming in to flood the  system and request asylum.   We all see the challenge. Now the question is, Are we going to do  something about it?   Republicans in the Senate, this past weekend, released a very simple  proposal to deal with what we all know are the problems--closing the  loopholes in the law that have been exploited. And, yes, it deals with  asylum, and, yes, it deals with withholding because those are the areas  that are being exploited. We see it. The administration sees it. The  question is, Do Democrat Senators see it? That is really the issue now.  Everyone else seems to see it and admit to it.   So what did we propose? We proposed some pretty straightforward  things. One is what is called ``safe third country'' transit. These are  individuals like the 45,000 people who came from India last year. They  fly through four or five countries--including dangerous countries like  France--to be able to land here and to be able to cross the border and  say: I need to find asylum.   Almost everyone sees that as an exploitation, and it is not just us.  There is almost no other country that does what we do. This whole issue  about picking and choosing where I want to request asylum is not how  asylum really works. You see, asylum under international law--and most  people in this body know it--``asylum'' and ``refugee'' have the same  definition under international law. A refugee doesn't pick nine  different countries and then pick the one that they want. They flee to  the next safe place. That is the same international rule for asylum.   If you were to request asylum right now in Canada--cross the border  into Canada and request asylum--do you know what is the first question  they would ask you? The first question they would ask you is: Did you  just cross from the United States?   If you answered yes, they would then say: Did you request asylum  there, and were you denied?   If they say, ``I didn't request asylum,'' Canada will turn you right  back around.   And that is not just Canada. That is most of the EU. If you went to  Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany,  Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, the  UK--if you went to any of them, they would ask: What country did you  transit through before you got here, and did you request and were you  denied asylum before you came in? If you said, ``I didn't request  asylum in the places I transited from,'' they would turn you around  because that is not an unreasonable thing.   When you go through five other countries and then request asylum in  the last one, you are actually trying to emigrate to that country, not  requesting asylum under international law. You are trying to pick the  place.   And, by the way, I don't blame them for picking America. It is the  greatest country in the world. But that is economic opportunity, that  is not asylum.   So the question is, Can we incentivize those individuals to not try  to run a loophole through our system but to actually go through the  legal process and request to come here as a legal immigrant?   We love to see people from all over the world, as we always have,  come into the United States legally, just not exploiting a loophole in  the asylum law. That is the wrong way to be able to do it.   The bill that Republicans have proposed also deals with streamlining  the process. Right now, it can take up to 10 years just to get a  hearing with an immigration judge under a standard that most people  know, and the administration has admitted, people won't qualify for  asylum at the end.   Why is that? Because, when you come across the border, you encounter  Border Patrol or CBP or an asylum officer. They do an initial  screening, and the screening is far lower than the actual standard. So  you may qualify under the screening standard, but everyone knows you  are not going to actually qualify for the actual standard for asylum.   So there are two simple things that can be done here. One is to make  the screening standard equal to the actual standard--to say: We all  know this is what you have got to achieve. So screen for that. Is it  reasonable? Is it even a 51-percent chance that you are going to get to  that standard? If it is, then you come in. If you are not, then you are  screened out.   The second is that we actually have three different screenings. Many  people don't know this. We screen for asylum, and then we separately  screen for what is called withholding, and we separately screen for  Convention against Torture. Those three different screenings are made  at three different times--sometimes across a decade of time. Everyone  knows, if you don't qualify for the first one, you are likely not going  to qualify for the other two, either. But you can request it, and you  can run that loophole, and then you are in the United States. And the  cartels literally teach people exactly what to say in their last step  so that they can exploit that loophole.    So let's actually have a screening standard that is the same standard  you have to get to, and let's screen for all three of those things at  the same time. That actually sounds like government efficiency. I know  we are not good at that as a nation, but, if we screen all three of  those things at the same time, it allows somebody to have due process.  We don't want someone not to have due process. If someone is a victim  of torture, we want to make sure they have an opportunity to go through  that process. But why wouldn't we go through all three of those at the  same time, rather than across 10 years, waiting for multiple different  hearings?   Republicans also proposed something pretty simple. Right now, the law  says that if you committed a felony, then you are not eligible for  asylum. But the problem with that is, there are some crimes that are  not considered a felony at the earliest days, and we are still allowing  them in.   Let me give you a for instance. What if you had three DUIs? What if  you are dealing meth? What if you are a member of a gang and you show  it? What if you have a domestic violence conviction?   If you have a domestic violence conviction, you can't own a firearm  in America, but you could get asylum in America. We literally invite  people to be able to come in whom we already know have domestic  violence convictions.   So we are making it pretty simple. We are saying: Hey, listen, let's  keep the standard where it is for a felony, but let's actually prevent  the loopholes.   Why would we invite someone into the country whom we know has had  multiple DUI convictions? Why would we do that? It is not safe for our  streets.   Do any one of you want to sit down with a dad and say: Your daughter  was killed in a DUI because we were loose on our asylum rules? I would  assume not.   We are not asking for something extreme. Again, it is typical for  many places around the world that this is how it would be done. All we  are trying to do is to be able to fix the loopholes and to be able to  secure our Nation.   This proposal we put forward keeps families together. I know there is  going to be an immediate thing that this is about separating families  at the border. Actually, no, it is very explicit that if families  travel together, families stay together for their hearing, to be able  to make sure that we are protecting that family. But we are also  raising a simple question. We all know and we have all seen the  stories, and for those of us who have gone to the border, we have seen  it with our own eyes: children traveling with adults that--we are all  parents, and we can see clear enough that is not really your child-- where children are literally used as a free pass to be able to get into  the country and to be able to expedite.   We would like to be able to protect those children and make sure  children are actually not used to be a free pass into the country.  There is a way to be able to prevent that and to be able to protect  those families that are actually real families at the same time.   We do a couple other things. We also raise just a very simple  statement about the Border Patrol. Many people here may or may not  know, but the Border Patrol can't actually get overtime if you are at a  certain level. If  [[Page S5355]]  you are other Federal law enforcement, you do get overtime. But if you  are Border Patrol, you do not.   So these guys may work 100 hours for 2 weeks, but for the additional  hours they are working, they don't actually get overtime pay. That is  not right.   So what happens is, Border Patrol has a hard time with retention, not  just because the job is incredibly difficult but, once they get to a  certain level, their families encourage them and say: Why don't we do  another Federal law enforcement somewhere else--still stay in Federal  law enforcement, but we can actually earn overtime pay at that point  rather than actually being punished for staying in the Border Patrol  and trying to be able to serve?   Why don't we fix that?   Why don't we fix some of the training issues that have come up?   Why don't we actually try to respond to those things?   Why don't we provide the opportunity for the Biden administration to  be able to lay out a strategy for how to secure the border? We are not  writing it. Just give them the opportunity to be able to do it.   And here is one thing that has been interesting that I have already  heard pushback from. We have a section where we talk about the border  wall. What is interesting is, what we have actually proposed is we  actually fulfill the border wall portion that President Biden has  already said he is going to do. We actually just want to put it in  writing so the President can't just say orally, ``I want to do this.''  We have to actually put it in writing to be able to do it. That is a  reasonable thing to be able to do.   Listen, we are not asking for crazy stuff. We are asking for what  Americans are asking for: Just secure the border. We want to be a  nation that welcomes immigrants, but we also want to be a nation that  honors the law. We can do both. That is what we are setting in front of  this body--to say: When we are talking about the supplemental, let's  actually talk about not just securing Israel and securing Ukraine and  securing Taiwan; let's also secure the United States of America.   With that, I yield the floor.
