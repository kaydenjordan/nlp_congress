Under the previous order, the motions to  reconsider are considered made and laid upon the table and the  President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.                            ____________________     Mr. President, textbook costs are one of the most  overlooked barriers to college affordability and access, and they are  continuing to get more expensive.   Over the last decade, 2006 to 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Consumer Price Index shows that consumer prices for college textbooks  increased almost 90 percent. It means students have to spend more every  year. In 2016 to 2017, the College Board recommended that students  budget an average of $1,250 for their books.   A survey released by the Student Public Interest Research Group  reported that 65 percent of students decided not to buy a textbook  because of the cost, and 94 percent of those students worried it would  hurt their grade.   This week, I joined with Senators Al Franken and Angus King and  Representatives Jared Polis and Kyrsten Sinema to reintroduce the  Affordable College Textbook Act. This bill would establish a grant  program to encourage the creation and use of high-quality open  textbooks which are free to use. Greater access to and widespread use  of these open textbooks can save each student who uses one hundreds of  dollars, and, long term, it puts pressure on the traditional college  textbook market to come up with affordable alternatives.   My home State of Illinois provides an example of how this bill would  work. The University of Illinois used $150,000 in Federal money to  pilot an open textbook project at its main campus. The university,  working With faculty, developed an open textbook, ``Sustainability: A  Comprehensive Foundation.'' This textbook was published electronically  for free and open use. You can go online today and find it.   Instead of a student having to shell out $150 or more for his or her  introductory environmental sustainability class, he or she can use this  free online book. That is a direct savings to a student every time a  professor assigns this text in place of a traditional textbook. Today  it is saving students money in Illinois, but also across the country at  other colleges and universities where it has been adopted by faculty  into their curriculum.   I would again like to thank my colleagues, Senators Al Franken and  Angus King, for joining me in this effort I would also like to thank  the wide variety of organizations that support this bill, including the  U.S. PIRG, SPARC, National Association of Big Ten Students, National  Association of College Stores, American Association of Community  Colleges, United Negro College Fund, and others.   Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues in Congress will join us in  supporting this bill to create a program at the Federal level to  encourage the creation and adoption of these materials. In the  meantime, I hope students across the country will reach out to their  professors and have this conversation with them. Ask them to adopt  these free, quality materials that are available today.                            ____________________
