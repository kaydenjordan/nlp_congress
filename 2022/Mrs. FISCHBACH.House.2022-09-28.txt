 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   We are here to debate the rule providing for consideration of three  bills: H.R. 7780, Mental Health Matters Act; H.R. 3843, Merger Filing  Fee Modernization Act; and S. 3969, Protection and Advocacy for Voting  Access, or PAVA, Program Inclusion Act.   H.R. 3843 would increase funding to the Federal Trade Commission  without justification or restrictions on that funding. This is the same  agency that, through its strategic plan for the next 4 years, removed a  longstanding clause that states the agency will not unduly burden  legitimate business activity.   In the coming term, the Supreme Court will hear a case as to whether  the FTC is mission creeping beyond the bounds of its constitutional  authority. The FTC, through its initiatives in antitrust enforcement,  has taken an increasing liberal view of its traditional focus on  protecting consumers from fraud and ensuring businesses have clear  rules to follow and is instead moving toward an interpretation of  reshaping the American economy through enforcement action.   In the Committee on the Judiciary, my colleagues offered amendments  to put limitations on this funding.   Mr. Roy offered an amendment to prohibit appropriated funds from  being used to promote critical race theory and one to require funds to  be used to enforce antitrust laws as defined in the Clayton Act.   Mr. Fitzgerald offered one to prohibit funds from being used for non- enforcement activities.   Mr. Bishop offered one to limit the scope of the bill to only apply  to mergers involving large technology companies.  [[Page H8172]]    All of these failed on party lines, and I can't understand why,  unless my colleagues on the left want to encourage the FTC to get  involved in issues outside of its purview. The FTC is out of control  under this administration and cannot be trusted with these additional  resources.   H.R. 7780 misses the mark. Republicans are committed to addressing  the mental health crisis facing young people in the country.  Unfortunately, this bill is another one-size-fits-all proposal that  fails to provide local leaders with the flexibility they need to  address the unique problems they face. Republicans support mental  health parity, but this bill will actually do the opposite. It opens  insurers and employers to lawsuits when they voluntarily offer to  provide mental health care benefits.   As with so many bills promoted by the majority this Congress,  provisions of this bill ban arbitration clauses, class action waivers,  and representation waivers, discouraging other means of settling  disputes and pushing creating even more bottlenecks in our judicial  system.   During markup, Republicans offered an alternative bill that  streamlined existing programs, helped the needs on the ground, helped  all students in need regardless of where their school is, and included  important accountability metrics. I wish we were discussing that bill  here today. Unfortunately, this and every other Republican amendment is  effectively blocked from discussion under this rule.   Mr. Speaker, it is for that reason that I oppose the rule and ask  Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question,  Republicans will offer an amendment to the rule allowing for the  immediate consideration of H.R. 6184, the HALT Fentanyl Act.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment into the  Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote  on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, over 100,000 people died from fentanyl  overdoses in a 1-year span, according to the CDC. That is a 30 percent  increase from the year before.   Fentanyl is now the number one cause of death for Americans ages 18  to 45. I think we can all agree that something must be done to put a  stop to this heartbreaking epidemic.                                time  1815    Fentanyl has been temporarily classified as a schedule I substance.  This classification strengthens law enforcement's ability to prosecute  fentanyl traffickers, and DEA reports that it has acted as an effective  deterrent.   The HALT Fentanyl Act would make the schedule I classification  permanent and would also promote research by removing regulations and  streamlining the research process. We should do everything we possibly  can to put an end to the devastation caused by fentanyl in this  country, and the HALT Fentanyl Act is one piece of the puzzle that  could make a real difference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Griffith) to speak further on the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, while I want to be in favor of these bills,  Republicans are in agreement that the underlying problems these bills  seek to solve are valid and warrant our attention. There are serious  flaws with these bills as written that must be considered first. H.R.  7780 is a one-size-fits-all strategy that will not help the people on  the ground. What a school in Minneapolis needs is not likely what a  school in my rural district needs. Furthermore, it pushes people in the  courts to settle disputes and discourages other methods of resolution.   H.R. 3843 trusts the FTC with no-strings-attached funding, even  though the FTC is becoming increasingly partisan and cannot be trusted  with more resources.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I encourage other Members to do  the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.
