 Mr. Speaker, I venture to say that none one of us  who comes to this floor doubts that any local law enforcement, our  neighbors, do any second-guessing to arrest drunk drivers, murderers,  and others, and that they are held to the high calling of justice. I do  not want to be associated with being mild-mannered and weak on those  who would do serious harm, kill, and maim, no matter who they are. That  is not this debate.   This debate is whether or not this bill interferes with the  legitimate enforcement of the law and whether or not it takes away the  mercy that we are known for in the United States. Let me tell you why.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Fraternal  Order of Police--which, by no means, is shy about enforcing the law-- writing to oppose this legislation, saying that local police  departments answer to local civilian government, and it is the local  government which enacts statutes and ordinances.                                            National Fraternal Order                                                       of Police,                                       Washington, DC, 27 June 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to reiterate the FOP's opposition to any       amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law       enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or       resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an       effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The       House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and       Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program       administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance       Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered       by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.        The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly       believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should       cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said,       withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies--      which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety       efforts.        Local police departments answer to local civilian       government and it is the local government which enacts       statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement       officers have no more say in these matters than any other       citizen and--with laws like the Hatch Act in place--it can be       argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to       pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out       lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the       civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to       penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because       Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with       respect to our nation's immigration laws.        The FOP issued a statement in January of this year       regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary       cities as outlined in President Trump's Executive Order. The       President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law       enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the       political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S.       Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of       Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the       public safety impact without an automatic suspension from       Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is       no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's       existing policy.        The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress,       which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and       we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce       or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for       local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect       policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find       another way to do so.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R.       3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to       find a better way to improve public safety in our       communities.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____           Committee on Migration, United States Conference of             Catholic Bishops,                                     Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.                                          Catholic Charities USA,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on       Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/      COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our       opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.        The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare       of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our       parishes include those with and without immigration status,       unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of       crime in the United States, including domestic violence,       armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of       fostering cooperation and information-sharing between       immigrant communities and local law enforcement.        We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on       local governments that we fear--and that many of them have       warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law       enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local       law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure       public safety in all communities.        Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to       jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law       enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and       naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-      compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network,       including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the       federal government on a number of Department of Justice and       Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including       disaster response and recovery, naturalization and       citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,       including victims of human trafficking, and domestic       violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the       protection and promotion of the human person and in some       instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these       important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not       humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.        Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion       of incarceration and does not include adequate protections       for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or       seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable       efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent       criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal       by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal       re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in       these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that       important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to       prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent       crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry       or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does       not advance the common good nor will it ensure that       communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as       introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum       seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented       themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from       violence), from being able to access protection, and instead       face fines, imprisonment or both.        We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of       a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration       reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family       unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs       and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and       security.        The United States has a long and proud history of       leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their       circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready       to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to       this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of       our views in this regard.            Sincerely,                                             Most Rev. Joe Vasquez,          Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.                                        Sr. Donna Markham, OP, PhD,      President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.                                   ____                 [From the Houston Chronicle, Apr. 30, 2017]               Police Chiefs: SB 4 is a `Lose-Lose' for Texas                   (By Art Acevedo and James McLaughlin)         No one believes in the ``rule of law'' more than the Texas       Police Chiefs Association and the Texas Major Cities Chiefs,       which besides Houston include Austin, Arlington, Dallas,  [[Page H5323]]       Fort Worth and San Antonio. We work tirelessly to make our       communities safer, within the confines of the U.S.       Constitution, by arresting those who commit criminal actions       that threaten our communities. We specifically target those       individuals committing violent crimes and arrest anyone who       threatens the safety of our communities, regardless of their       immigration status.        Police chiefs across the state work extremely hard to       develop law enforcement agencies that build and maintain       trust, communication and stronger relationships with minority       communities through community-based policing and outreach       programs. So we know well that no good can come of Senate       Bill 4, which the state House of Representatives, joining the       state Senate, passed last week.        SB 4 requires local law enforcement to take a more active       role in immigration enforcement; this will tear down what       we've worked so hard to build up. Officers will start       inquiring about the immigration status of every person they       come in contact with, or worse, only inquire about the       immigration status of individuals based on their appearance.       This will lead to distrust of police, less cooperation from       members of the community and will foster the belief that they       cannot seek assistance from police for fear of being       subjected to an immigration-status investigation.        This is a lose-lose situation for everyone.        Distrust and fear of contacting or assisting the police has       already become evident among legal immigrants. Legal       immigrants are beginning to avoid contact with the police for       fear that they themselves or undocumented family members or       friends may become subject to immigration enforcement. Such a       divide between the local police and immigrant groups will       result in increased crime against immigrants and in the       broader community, create a class of silent victims, and       eliminate the potential for assistance from migrants in       solving crimes or preventing crime.     Law enforcement officers have to be able to abide by  the law. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they  serve because Congress disagrees with the enforcement priorities with  respect to our Nation's immigration laws. And they are right. But they  also say that they need to build trust in our communities.   This bill destroys community trust. It also penalizes hardworking  governments of mayors and county leaders who are, in fact, trying to  run the government and ensure that victims of domestic violence and  crime, even as immigrants, are able to be treated in a manner where  justice is had.   What about the National Sheriffs' Association or the Texas Police  Chiefs in Texas' major cities who indicate that this bill will serve no  good and no good can come to a similar bill in the States?   Let me say to you, I stand with the Catholic church, and I am not  Catholic. What are our values? This church opposes the idea of our  values.   Let me be very clear as I close. We are doing the sanctuary cities  bill, but I want to know about the integrity of this place.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3003, the ``No  Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' which requires state and local  cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, expands DHS detainer  authority, and expands detention authority.   I oppose this bill mainly because it directly violates the  Constitution of the United States.   If H.R. 3003 were to become law, it will coerce states and localities  to cooperate with immigration enforcement, it will hurt victims and  witnesses to crimes, and ultimately make communities less safe, which  directly contravenes the stated and alleged goals of this bill.   Police Chiefs across the nation are responding to less disturbances,  not because crime is magically disappearing, but because immigrant  communities are afraid to report them out of fear of being targeted.   H.R. 3003 will completely strip state and local jurisdictions of  their ability to enact common-sense policies that breed respect and  trust and turn local law enforcement into an auxiliary arm of the  federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).   To ensure compliance, this bill coerces states and localities by  imposing penalties that will deny federal funding for critical law  enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim  initiatives.   This divisive and vindictive administrative policy abridges the Tenth  Amendment to the Constitution, which states:   ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,  nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States  respectively, or to the people.''   H.R. 3003 also violates the Fourth Amendment's proscription against  unreasonable searches and seizures in respect to the changes it makes  to DHS's detainer authority.   It expands upon current DHS detainer practice by broadening the ways  in which DHS can determine it has probable cause to issue a detainer  and it significantly expands the time an individual may be held by law  enforcement.   The Supreme Court has stated that the Fourth Amendment requires a  judicial finding of probable cause, usually within 48 hours of arrest.   H.R. 3003, however, allows law enforcement to hold a person up to 96  hours before DHS takes custody, and there is no mention of when the  person will even see an immigration judge.   H.R. 3003 compounds these constitutional violations by eliminating  the ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent,  individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral  decision-maker.   This bill also authorizes DHS to detain individuals in removal  proceedings without time limitation and it expands the categories of  individuals who would be subject to such a detention on a mandatory  basis.   These provisions make it substantially more difficult, if not  impossible, for individuals to obtain release on bond while removal  proceedings are pending, thus increasing detention costs and separating  families while they seek to litigate their immigration cases.   H.R. 3003 is nothing but an anti-immigrant, enforcement-only proposal  that represents another step in Trump's mass deportation plan.   Mr. Speaker, rather than forcing state and local officials into a  one-size-fits-all federal enforcement scheme, Congress and the  administration should enact legislation and adopt policies that  integrate unauthorized immigrants into our communities--approaches that  the American public supports by a wide margin.   For these reasons, I join with local law enforcement chiefs and faith  community leaders in denouncing and opposing this mean-spirited, ill- considered, and un-American legislation.   I end, Mr. Speaker, by apologizing to Mika Brzezinski, to the press,  for the horrible words that were said about a bleeding face.   There is no way that we can entrust this law or any other laws to  this President of the United States. He has lost the trust, and I will  vote for nothing until he steps down.    Mr. Speaker, as we go home to commemorate the birth  of this Nation, to wish all well, we would hope we would be able to go  home by feeling comfortable that the administration was taking care of  the American people.   We have come to find out that the EPA is reversing a decision of the  Obama administration to allow a pesticide by the name of--trade name  Lorsban, that is chlorophyll-based, to be utilized on fruits and  vegetables.   I understand the needs of farmers, but there are documented studies  that indicate that it may have a significant impact on the brain  function of little children as young as 7 years old.   Where is the care of the Nation by this administration?   And then, they are planning a healthcare bill that will see this  young lady lose her healthcare.   In my district, 89,000 people will lose their insurance when they cut  $854 billion out of Medicaid; 16,000 will be children.   Where will the hospitals survive if they are closed in rural and  urban America, and where will the seniors be when their nursing home  puts them out because the Medicaid that has been for working seniors  but now retired in nursing homes who rely on Medicaid?   The TrumpCare bill in the Senate is a devastating bill. We need to  have an administration that takes care of the American people.                            ____________________
