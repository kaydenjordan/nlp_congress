Almost one-third of fiscal year 2018 is gone. At some point in time-- the majority leader is not available right now, therefore, I am not  asking him to yield, because he has something important that he is  doing now--but at some point in time, Madam Speaker, I am hoping that  the majority leader will come before us and we can have a colloquy on  what we intend to do during the course of this day, perhaps tomorrow,  perhaps Sunday, perhaps Monday, perhaps Tuesday, in order to get the  business of the country done.   I am urging my Members to be available on very short notice so that  they can complete the work of funding our government for fiscal year  2018. I hope that all other Members will be available to do so as well.  That is our responsibility. We have not yet met that responsibility.  Therefore, I want to give notice to my Members that we need to be here.   The Senate has not acted. We do not know what they will do. We need  to be available for their action. I know the majority leader suggested  that it was okay to leave and go home. I want to make it clear that is  not my view. We have not completed our work. The American public  expects us to do that.   I would hope that we would all remain available to complete the work  of funding the government between now and fiscal year 2018 ending, of  course, on September 30.                            ____________________
