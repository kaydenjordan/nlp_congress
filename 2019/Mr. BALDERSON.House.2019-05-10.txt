 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  David Blom, who is retiring from his service as president and CEO of  OhioHealth this July.   Under David's watch, OhioHealth has grown leaps and bounds into  central Ohio's largest healthcare system. In 17 years at the helm, Dave  built OhioHealth into a top employer and economic driver in Ohio.   When his tenure began, OhioHealth employed 14,000 associates and  caregivers. That number has more than doubled to more than 30,000  OhioHealth associates and caregivers today.   What is more, OhioHealth was just named to the Fortune 100 Best  Companies to Work For in 2019 for the 19th straight year, fostered by  Dave's leadership.   Moreover, when Dave took the reins in 2002, not a single OhioHealth  hospital existed in what is now my congressional district. Today,  OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital, Grady Memorial Hospital, Dublin  Methodist Hospital, and Westerville Medical Campus all lie in the 12th  Congressional District.   Throughout this rapid development, Dave has kept an unwavering  commitment to keeping care local for patients across Ohio's  communities.   Keeping care local isn't merely a slogan for Dave. Rather, it  represents a cultural focus on serving each community, creating access  to care, and establishing standard practices and procedures around  medicine and patient care, all so Ohioans can receive the healthcare  services they need close to home.   Dave has been gracious in sharing his leadership with the central  Ohio region. During his tenure as chairman of the Columbus Chamber of  Commerce, the chamber elevated its mission and made a profound impact  on regional growth.   Dave also serves on the Columbus Partnership executive committee, a  nonprofit organization of more than 70 CEOs of Columbus' leading  businesses and institutions.   Dave has positively impacted so many lives by making care accessible  for Ohioans--for urban, suburban, and rural areas alike--and by growing  OhioHealth into a robust employer in the region I call home. I thank  him very much for his service.                            ____________________
