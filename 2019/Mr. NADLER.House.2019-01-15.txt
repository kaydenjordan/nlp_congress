 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 41) rejecting White nationalism and White  supremacy.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 41         Whereas, on January 10, 2019, Representative Steve King was       quoted as asking, ``White nationalist, white supremacist,       Western civilization--how did that language become       offensive?'';        Whereas a 2006 Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI)       assessment defined a White supremacist as follows: ``White       supremacists believe that the white race is superior to all       other races and was created to rule them. They view non-      whites as subhuman and usually refer to them in derogatory       terms'';        Whereas the same 2006 FBI intelligence assessment defined a       White nationalist as follows: ``To be a white nationalist is       to be pro-white. The domestic white nationalist movement       seeks to promote, honor, and defend the white race. They       believe the white race is under attack from Jewish interests       that dominate the government (referred to as the Zionist       Occupied Government, or ZOG), the media, banking, and       entertainment industries and act to the detriment of the       white race. White nationalists view multiculturalism,       diversity, and illegal immigration as direct assaults on the       white race and race-mixing as akin to white genocide. They       hope to appeal to mainstream whites, believing that the       majority of white people do not understand the imminent or       long-term threat to their race. Many contend that a race war,       often referred to as RAHOWA, or Racial Holy War, is a       certainty'';        Whereas White supremacy and White nationalism are contrary       to the ideals of the United States of America, which was       established according to the principle stated in the       Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, a       principle that was updated in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York,       to include all people;        Whereas while our country has often fallen short of these       ideals, patriotic Americans have sought to form a more       perfect Union by rejecting White nationalism and White       supremacy, embracing inclusive patriotism, and welcoming       immigrants from across the globe who have continuously       enriched our Nation;        Whereas Abraham Lincoln in an 1858 speech said of the       Founders, ``Wise statesmen as they were, they knew the       tendency of prosperity to breed tyrants, and so they       established these great self-evident truths, that when in the       distant future some man, some faction, some interest, should       set up the doctrine that none but rich men, or none but white       men, were entitled to life, liberty, and pursuit of       happiness, their posterity might look up again to the       Declaration of Independence and take courage to renew the       battle which their fathers began--so that truth, and justice,       and mercy, and all the humane and Christian virtues might not       be extinguished from the land; so that no man would hereafter       dare to limit and circumscribe the great principles on which       the temple of liberty was being built'';        Whereas Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., while recognizing that       ``no other nation can mean to us what our nation means'',       condemned ``nationalism perverted into chauvinism and       isolationism'' as ``preached by . . . the advocators of white       supremacy'' and asked, ``Will we continue to serve the false       god of racial prejudice or will we serve the God who made of       one blood all men to dwell upon the face of the earth?'';        Whereas President Reagan observed in a 1988 speech,       ``Anyone, from any corner of the Earth, can come to live in       America and become an American . . . This, I believe, is one       of the most important sources of America's greatness. We lead       the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people--      our strength--from every country and every corner of the       world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our       nation. While other countries cling to the stale past, here       in America we breathe life into dreams. We create the future,       and the world follows us into tomorrow. Thanks to each wave       of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we're a nation       forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas,       and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to       the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a       nation. If we ever closed the door to new Americans, our       leadership in the world would soon be lost'';        Whereas according to FBI statistics, hate crimes nationwide       increased in 2015, 2016, and 2017, the three most recent       years for which data is available;        Whereas the perpetrator of the shooting that killed 9       African-American worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist       Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on June 17,       2015, was motivated by White supremacy and White nationalism       to carry out this act of terrorism, and stated that he would       ``be rescued by white nationalists after they took over the       government'';        Whereas the perpetrator of the shooting that killed 11       Jewish worshippers at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh,       Pennsylvania, on October 27, 2018, accused Jews of ``waging a       propaganda war against Western civilization'' and       ``committing genocide'' against Whites by promoting       immigration and refugee resettlement, and accused the       President of being ``a globalist, not a nationalist'' because       of the ``infestation'' of Jews; and        Whereas Public Law 115-58, a joint resolution signed into       law on September 14, 2017, rejects ``white nationalism, white       supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate       groups'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives once again       rejects White nationalism and White supremacy as hateful       expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the       values that define the people of the United States.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this resolution stands for one very simple  proposition: White nationalism and white supremacy are hateful  expressions of intolerance that have no place in the United States of  America.   Unfortunately, what should be an obvious statement in 2019 has been  challenged in recent days, and not for the first time, by one of our  own colleagues. As those elected to represent all of America, Members  of Congress should be the first to condemn white nationalism and white  supremacy, which are the source of so much violence, so much hatred,  and so much divisiveness throughout our Nation's history. These hateful  ideologies are diametrically opposed to what America is supposed to be.   But, as the New York Times reported last week, Mr. King of Iowa was  quoted as saying:   ``White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization--how did  that language become offensive?''   Well, I will tell him, and anyone else who may be confused.   This language has always been offensive. We fought a civil war to  establish that. But this language and the philosophy it represents  persisted. It motivated the Ku Klux Klan to terrorize African  Americans; it sparked Jim Crow laws that oppressed African Americans  through institutionalized racism; it inspired the murder of nine Black  congregants in a Charleston, South Carolina, church; and the murder of  11 Jewish worshippers in a Pittsburgh synagogue; and it inspired  racists, anti-Semites, and other assorted bigots at the Unite the Right  rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that spread fear, hatred, and,  ultimately, violence in celebration of white supremacy.   These hateful ideologies are dangerous, not because they too often  lead to violence. These noxious views can also infect the policies that  govern our Nation, sowing more division, and leading to more injustice  in our society. When we establish Muslim bans; when we try to build  walls to keep out those who do not look like us; and when we reverse a  half century of progress on voting rights and civil rights, we are  putting these hateful views into action.   I thank the distinguished majority whip, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), for bringing this resolution forward. He knows  from his experience--both as a leader in the civil rights movement, and  as a Member of Congress whose own constituents were recently targeted  in a vicious attack motivated by white supremacy--that when we see  bigotry and hatred expressed in any form, we must condemn it, loudly  and forcefully.   We can pretend that these sentiments do not exist in our country, in  this Congress, or in the White House. We can try to sweep them under  the rug, and to convince ourselves that we have moved past our shameful  history on race. But we ignore white supremacy at our peril. If we do  not speak out now, collectively as a Congress, clearly and without  reservation, we will send the message that these views are acceptable,  and they will continue to fester in communities across the country,  generating more hatred, more repression, and more violence, in their  wake.   Madam Speaker, I call upon all of my colleagues--Republican and  Democrat alike--to reject the hateful ideology of white nationalism and  white supremacy, the policies that flow from such hatred, and anyone  who would espouse those views. Vote ``yes'' on this important  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished majority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Washington an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Allred) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. ALLRED asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi) to close the debate on our  side.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
