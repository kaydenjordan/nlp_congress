 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I agree  with my colleagues across the aisle. We should have been here weeks  ago: weeks ago to get more money for our hospitals, weeks ago to  protect testing, weeks ago to improve this program for small  businesses.   But, alas, only in Washington, D.C., would we wait weeks when we all  agree. But let's move forward because our frontline workers right now  cannot afford for us to stand by for politics.   Leader McConnell said to our cities and States, to our cops and  firemen and teachers, he told them to drop dead. Well, why don't we put  politics aside, rise up, and tell him that we put the country first.
