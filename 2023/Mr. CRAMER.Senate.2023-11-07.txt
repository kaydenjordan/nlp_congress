 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American and  an exceptional member of the U.S. Air Force, Maj. Andrea May.   As an Air Force Senate legislative liaison officer, from June 2021 to  May 2023, Andrea performed her duties with exceptional professionalism  during the 117th and 118th U.S. Congresses. Andrea distinguished  herself through her professional character and dedication by serving  this Nation in uniform, leading the division's collaboration with the  Senate Space Force Caucus, coordinating six events critical to  educating Members and their staff on the Department of Defense's newest  service, and helping to advocate for Space Force priorities. Her  efforts helped solidify the establishment of the U.S. Space Force,  ensured the confirmation of the 26th Air Force Secretary, and secured  the Department of the Air Force's support of the national defense  strategy in our return to Great Power Competition.   A motivated leader and thoughtful relationship builder, Andrea  expertly conveyed Department of the Air Force positions on the Air  Force Future Design that included the future bomber, tanker, and  fighter force. Andrea's direct support provided the U.S. Senate  critical information necessary for two National Defense Authorization  Acts. Additionally, Andrea served as a liaison between the Department  of the Air Force and 19 U.S. Senate offices, including mine. When I had  concerns, she was the airman with whom I spoke to address them. Andrea  helped ensure that the airmen and guardians of North Dakota were well  cared for and that their concerns and interests were known to the  leadership of the Department of the Air Force.   In her role as a liaison for the Air Force, she also coordinated  responses to more than 200 requests for information and led delegations  for 70 Senators, Representatives, and congressional staff on visits to  showcase Department equities across the United States and abroad, to  include the bicameral Reagan National Defense Forum. Andrea's  significant efforts led to successful engagements between this  governing body and senior Department of Defense officials, including  the Secretary of the Air Force. All of these engagements helped U.S.  Senators understand defense equities and their impact on national  security. Due to her direct involvement and stewardship, Members of  Congress were able to make informed decisions and ensured the  Department of the Air Force was properly resourced and funded.   Lastly, Major May was also responsible for helping prepare the  Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the  Chief of Space Operations, and other senior leaders for more than 80  engagements with Senators and their staff and three Senate Armed  Services Committee hearings. After serving in this crucial role and  becoming a fixture on Capitol Hill, Andrea recently moved on to serve  as a pilot in the 89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews.   I am thankful for Andrea's service and her work with my office and  the Senate over the past 2 years on issues of vital importance to the  United States. I salute this American patriot whose selfless work has  kept our country safe and strong. I join countless others in thanking  her for her service.                            ____________________
