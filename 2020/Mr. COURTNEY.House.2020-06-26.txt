 Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, right before  Memorial Day, President Trump very quietly, behind closed doors, vetoed  this bill, a bill that protects a borrower defense rule, which was  supported by a wide range of veteran service organizations.   For years, young veterans who sought an education after serving their  country have been targeted by for-profit, rip-off education factories  that swallow up their GI benefits and then pile on new student loans.  [[Page H2551]]    Stories abound about men and women who wore the uniform of this  country left with crushing debt and worthless degrees that denied them  the rewarding careers they were promised. Although many today are  entitled to loan forgiveness, the Department of Education, under  Secretary Betsy DeVos, has willfully made this process as onerous as  possible.   Mr. Speaker, if we listen to the American Legion, the Iraq and Afghan  Veterans of America, and the Vietnam Veterans of America, vote to  override, and we can restore these victims of fraud and greed some  semblance of financial solvency. If we do not override this veto, the  share of eligible debt forgiveness will drop from 53 percent to just 3  percent, and we will betray thousands of Americans who stepped up and  volunteered to protect our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to override.
