 Mr. President, the majority leader said that this is a  promising day, and I would just say that I think it is more than that.  It is really a milestone to have the majority leader of the Senate  working with a bipartisan group of us to lift a restriction that is  anti-farmer, certainly anti-consumer, and anti-common sense. This  industrial hemp restriction really, in my view, is working in needless  hardships from sea to shining sea.   I am going to take a minute to build on some of the majority leader's  remarks.   Colleagues may have heard me say that, for me, this issue goes back  several years. My wife was pregnant, and she and I headed from our  house in Southeast Portland, and we went off to the nearby Costco  store. We were walking through the aisles, and we came across a huge  bag of hemp hearts. It said: Great fiber. Terrific source of protein. A  variety of different attributes were spelled out on this package. Good  for your heart, and good for your blood pressure.   I looked at the package, and the package clearly indicated that it  had been grown outside the United States. So I said to my wife, who is  a businesswoman and savvy about such matters: What would be wrong with  saying that if you can buy it in a major supermarket in America, our  farmers ought to be able to grow it in America?   She said: Well, dear, that just sounds way too logical for what goes  on in your world.   I think what the leader has said--and I just want to back this up  with a little more detail--is that the current policy is somehow based  on the idea that hemp is a dangerous drug, meaning that if you look at  the way some people have attacked this idea in the past, that was  always the heart of it, that hemp was a dangerous drug.   Hemp does not produce the high associated with marijuana. The only  thing you are going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting your  breath, wasting your time, and wasting lighter fluid. That is pretty  much what you would accomplish. This misguided policy of treating hemp  like it is some kind of peril, an imminent threat to the American  people, is, I think, a mistake, and it means that the hemp products  that are lined up on shelves all across America simply aren't going to  be fully American-made.   Senator McConnell and Senator Paul have heard that from farmers in  Kentucky, and Senator Merkley and I have heard that from farmers in  Oregon. That is why it is so important that we move to a system that is  built on common sense, something that will be good for farmers, and  something that will be good for consumers and certainly offer  additional consumer choice.   If I might build on the now sort of memorialized words of Nancy  Wyden, because when we talked about, hey, if you can buy it in a market  in Oregon, the farmers ought to be able to grow it--I think that is a  pretty good watchword for this bipartisan bill we are undertaking.    I look forward to working closely with you, Mr. Leader. We are  obviously going to be working with Chairman Roberts and Senator  Stabenow, the ranking Democratic leader. This is long, long overdue.   As you noted, we have bipartisan supporters, and we are going to pull  out all the stops to get this legislation passed. I think I mentioned  to the majority leader that those who have been involved in this  effort--and it has been a really impressive coalition of farmers,  health advocates, and others--are watching the Senate this morning.  They are saying that the Senate has finally come to understand what is  relevant for this century. The policies that have been so flawed in the  past are sort of outdated relics of yesteryear, and I am pleased that  Senator Merkley and I can join you and Senator Paul. We will have  colleagues on both sides involved in this legislation. It is long  overdue.   I thank the leader.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, every day, Social Security provides vital  benefits to millions of Americans who worked and paid into the system,  and I cannot overstate the important anti-poverty role that the program  plays. Supplemental Security Income or SSI is the safety net of last  resort for individuals who have not worked enough to qualify for Social  Security. Even with these critical income support programs, more and  more seniors and people with disabilities find themselves struggling to  keep up with the costs of the things they need just to get by.   Although Social Security and SSI automatically increase each year  when there is an increase in the cost of living, over time those  increases do not allow beneficiaries to maintain their standard of  living. Because Social Security provides an increasingly larger share  of the elderly's income as they age, even a slight decrease in value of  these lifeline benefits can lead to poverty and hardship. Too many  seniors are walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill  against their rent against their utility bill. It's time to update  Social Security's guarantee of a secure retirement, and this bill is a  landmark step towards accomplishing that goal. I'm particularly hopeful  about the benefits this bill will have for older American women, who  live longer and often have less retirement savings.   To help combat the risk of poverty among the most vulnerable  receiving Social Security and SSI, I, along with Senators Brown and  Casey, are introducing the Elder Poverty Relief Act. This bill creates  a monthly Poverty Relief Benefit for almost everyone over age 82,  individuals who have been relying on Social Security or SSI for a long  time, or who have worked in low-paying jobs and receive a very small  Social Security benefit. The Poverty Relief benefit will also go to  seniors who receive only SSI. If enacted, in 2019, the Poverty Relief  Benefit would provide an additional $85 a month to almost 14 million  people. The Poverty Relief Benefit will grow by roughly 4 percent each  year. SSA estimates that the enactment of the Poverty Relief Benefit  would reduce poverty among seniors who received the benefit by almost  25 percent in 2030 which would lift 420,000 seniors out of poverty.  Notably, the enactment of the Poverty Relief Benefit would not  accelerate the depletion year of the Social Security trust funds. The  bill has been endorsed by the Gray Panthers, Justice in Aging, the  National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Social  Security Works, and the Strengthen Social Security Coalition.   For most seniors, Social Security is the only income they will  receive that's guaranteed to last as long as they live. But despite  these important benefits, poverty among seniors grows--with some  studies showing the poverty rate among the very old is between 12 and  19 percent. We simply must do more to protect the financial stability  of our elderly friends, neighbors, and relatives and enactment of the  Poverty Relief Benefit would help reduce poverty among America's  seniors. These are workers who sent a chunk of every paycheck to the  Federal government with the understanding that they'd be getting it  back in their later year when they needed it most. We must do right by  them.   Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the  National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare be inserted  into the  [[Page S2122]]  Record following my remarks about the Elderly Poverty Act.                                      National Committee to Preserve                                     Social Security & Medicare,                                     Washington, DC, March 16, 2018.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Wyden: On behalf of the millions of members       and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social       Security and Medicare, I write to endorse your bill, the       ``Elder Poverty Relief Act.'' We applaud your leadership in       developing new and innovative approaches for alleviating       poverty among America's seniors.        The ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' addresses the long-      standing problem of seniors falling into poverty after being       on the Social Security rolls for many years. This occurs when       inflation, only partially offset by annual cost-of-living       adjustments, gradually erodes the purchasing power of a       Social Security benefit for beneficiaries who have       participated in the program for several years.        The ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' will help alleviate       poverty among the elderly and the disabled by granting each       beneficiary a monthly increase in their benefit equal to       about $85. This bump-up will increase for future       beneficiaries in tandem with growth in wages in the economy.        Benefits under the ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' will be       paid to:        Social Security beneficiaries beginning at age 82 (or       older) and to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients       when they reach their full retirement age (currently 66,       increasing gradually to age 67);        Social Security and SSI beneficiaries who have received       benefits for 20 years; and to        Social Security beneficiaries with low monthly benefits       (currently about $944) when they reach their full retirement       age.        The ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' embodies legislation that       the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and       Medicare has supported for a number of years. In testimony       given before the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing on       December 9, 2014, Catherine Dodd, who is the chair of the       National Committee's board of directors, recommended       increasing benefits for seniors who have received Social       Security for many years.        For these reasons, the National Committee endorses your       bill, the ``Elder Poverty Relief Act.'' We thank you for your       leadership on this matter and look forward to working with       you to enact this important improvement to Social Security.            Sincerely,                                                      Max Richtman,                                                 President and CEO.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
