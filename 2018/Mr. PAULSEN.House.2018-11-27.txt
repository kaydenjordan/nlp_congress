 Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the Champlin Park  Rebels girls volleyball team on winning the Minnesota State High School  Championship, the first team in school history to bring a championship  trophy back to Champlin Park.   Their victory came after outlasting a very talented Eagan team,  playing in its sixth consecutive state final. But the Rebels were just  too much for them, starting strong and then never looking back.   The pressure was on for the Rebels to win their school's first ever  state title, and they delivered every step of the way. They showed the  kind of true determination that makes them champions both on and off  the court.   So, Madam Speaker, congratulations to these student athletes, the  coaches, their parents, and all of the fans, and the entire Champlin  Park community on a well-deserved, hard fought win becoming state  champions.                            ____________________
