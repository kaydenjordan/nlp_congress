 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I thank him for his leadership. It is extremely important.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in adamant opposition to what is a  disastrous package. Disastrous. This very well may be one of the most  consequential votes any of us, any of us have ever taken on this House  floor.   Yet, it has never, never gone through the proper process. It never  received the proper consideration this body demands of any piece of  legislation, the least of which would be one of the most consequential  pieces of legislation that we have ever considered.   I am sure most Members, on both sides of the aisle, do not fully know  what is actually in this bill. Has anybody, has any Member actually  read this bill? Anybody?   My colleagues across the aisle are attempting to pass the most  expensive bill, the most expensive bill, not by a little bit, by a lot.  It is, yes, it is the most expensive bill by a lot that has ever been  passed in American history. It has the largest tax increase ever  considered and the biggest expansion of government in a generation; all  while they have the slimmest of majorities. This is not a mandate.   Look, what is going on? Look, what is happening here? The American  people are rejecting this. You saw what happened in Virginia. You see  what is happening now.   We have got all these things going on.    Americans are told that they shouldn't have a  say in their children's education. They watched as Americans were  abandoned behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. They see the crisis at our  border. They go to the gas station; they see an increase in gasoline  prices. They see increases at the grocery store. This legislation makes  it worse. This legislation pours fuel on the fire.   Madam Speaker, I sincerely urge all of my colleagues to oppose this  misguided and profoundly consequential bill.
