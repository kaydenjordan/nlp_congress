 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize one  of my constituents, F. Anthony ``Tony'' Clifford, who is retiring on  June 22, 2019, after 50 years of Federal service as an engineer at the  National Institutes of Health.   Tony has dedicated his career to helping advance NIH's mission:  seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature of living systems and  applying that knowledge to advance the health of all people. He has  done this by working to ensure that NIH's buildings and facilities  create a world-class environment for conducting biomedical research.   Throughout his service as an engineer with NIH, Tony has been  committed to creating state-of-the-art research facilities. In 1969, he  started his work as an NIH staff engineer. Beginning in 1992, he led  the NIH facility program as director of engineering services until  becoming chief engineer in the Office of the Director in 2003.   Tony holds a bachelors of mechanical engineering degree from the  University of Maryland at College Park, which presented him in 2016  with the Golden Terp Award from the University's Clark School of  Engineering for his 50 years of engineering practice. His numerous  other awards include multiple NIH Directors and Merit Awards, the  Federal Energy Award, Vice President Gore's Hammer Award, and Special  Recognition by the Society of American Military Engineers.   In addition to his work in the field, Tony was instrumental in  recruiting engineering interns by representing NIH at career fairs and  STEM events. In this way, his impact on scientific discovery will last  for years to come, as he has inspired young scientists to  [[Page S2922]]  pursue science and engineering employment opportunities in the  government.   I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Tony Clifford for  his distinguished service to our country and to wish him all the best  in the coming years as he enjoys his well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
