 Mr. President, I call up Senator Blackburn's amendment  No. 1349, and I ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, let me first thank Senator King for  inviting me to join him in this colloquy this evening. Tonight, we  honor and remember our fellow Mainers who lost their lives in a  senseless tragedy, a senseless act of violence, as well as those who  were wounded in this heinous attack. We also remember the family  members and the loved ones who grieve for them.   We want to recognize the people of this proud community of Lewiston  who have rallied together to support each other during these dark and  difficult days: first responders; law enforcement; healthcare  providers, especially at Central Maine Medical Center; businesses and  community members who provided food for law enforcement; State and  local officials; Federal agents. So many people deserve our thanks.   Those efforts and more will be acknowledged by the city of Lewiston  tomorrow as it hosts an Act of Kindness and Gratitude Day. The city  intends for this to be an annual occasion for the community to come  together and celebrate the spirit of kindness and unity which  characterizes our wonderful State.   As the phrase ``Lewiston strong'' echoes across our State and our  country, the grit, resolve, and compassion of the people of Lewiston  have rallied and inspired the Nation.   No words can diminish the pain, shock, and understandable anger felt  by the families who lost loved ones. Nevertheless, it is my hope that  they will find solace and strength in knowing that they are in the  hearts of so many. As my colleague from Maine has just said, Maine, in  many ways, is a small town, a place of caring communities where people  know their neighbors.   One of my staffers in my Lewiston office knew 9 of the 18 people who  lost their lives that horrible day.   Members of the close-knit deaf community had gathered at a local  restaurant to play cornhole that night. Four members of that community  lost their lives in the attack. One of the family members taught me the  American sign language symbol for ``I love you.'' It reminds me of this  proverb:         Death leaves a heartache no one can heal; love leaves a       memory that no one can steal.    In their memory, let us support one another through this difficult  grieving period and hope for brighter days.  [[Page S5251]]    Senator King and I will now read the names of those who lost their  lives: Tricia Asselin. Tricia, age 53, was a part-time employee at  Just-In-Time Recreation and was fatally shot while calling 9-1-1. She  was a mother who worked three jobs, an accomplished athlete, and a  terrific volunteer.   Peyton Brewer-Ross. Peyton, 40, was a new father and a pipefitter at  Bath Iron Works. He enjoyed playing cornhole and often brought beanbags  to family gatherings, according to his brother. He was described as the  life of the party.   William Frank Brackett. William was 48. He was part of the gathering  of deaf people who were playing cornhole. He was known for his ability  to help place those who were deaf in the workplace. He had just  celebrated his third wedding anniversary with his wife in August and  leaves behind a 2\1/2\-year-old daughter.   Thomas Ryan Conrad. Thomas, 34, was manager of Just-In-Time  Recreation and was an Army veteran who served tours in Iraq. He had  just returned to the State of Maine to be closer to his daughter. And  he was one of the brave individuals who attempted to stop the shooter.   Michael Deslauriers. Michael was fatally shot while trying to rush  the gunman at Just-In-Time Recreation. His close friend Jason Walker  was also killed in the bowling alley. The two men made sure that their  wives and children were under cover before charging at the killer.   Maxx Hathaway. Maxx was 35 and a stay-at-home father. He and his wife  were expecting their third child in a little more than a month. He was  described as a ``goofy, down to earth person'' who always had an  ``uplifting attitude no matter what was going on.'' He was working on  completing his degree in business administration at the University of  Southern Maine.   Bryan MacFarlane. Bryan, 41, had recently moved back to Maine to be  closer to his mother. He was playing in the cornhole tournament for the  deaf community at the restaurant and bar. He loved the outdoors and was  one of the first deaf people in Vermont to earn his commercial driver's  license. He was often accompanied on the road by his beloved dog, M&M.   Keith Macneir. Keith Macneir was 64 and lived in Florida. He was  visiting Maine to celebrate his 64th birthday with his son. He most  recently worked as chief of maintenance at the Virgin Islands National  Park.    Ronald Morin. Ronald, 55, was a dedicated husband and father, too,  and was described by his family and friends as having an ``infectious  personality.'' He was a sales merchandiser for Coca-Cola and was an  avid cornhole player.   Now Senator King will resume the reading of the rest of those who  lost their lives.
