 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate  August 7, Assyrian Genocide Memorial Day.   Many Americans are already familiar with the horrors of the Armenian  genocide. But not nearly as many know about the genocide of innocent  Assyrian civilians by the Ottoman Empire; which is why I am leading a  resolution to finally recognize the genocide of Assyrians in the Middle  East.   Many of my Assyrian friends and neighbors in California's Central  Valley still carry the weight of this horrific event.   Beginning in 1914, the Ottoman Empire is estimated to have  slaughtered 300,000 innocent Assyrians; but some experts believe the  true death toll is much higher. On August 7, Shovah b'tabakh, we  remember those who were lost, and we say never again.   My resolution would take simple steps to do both. It would assert  that Turkey, the inheritor of the Ottoman tradition, must recognize the  genocide; and it would condemn any efforts to associate the U.S. with  genocide denial.   My resolution would recognize the resilience of the Assyrian people  who endured the genocide, the Simele massacre, and are now threatened  once again by holdouts in ISIS. And they have survived all of this  without a homeland to call their own.   Today, we remember the Sadih, the martyrs. We think of their  families. We recommit ourselves to upholding the rights of all people  to live freely and in safety.                            ____________________
