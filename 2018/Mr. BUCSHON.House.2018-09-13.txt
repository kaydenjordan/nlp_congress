 Madam Speaker, unnecessary government red tape is  preventing us from taking advantage of clean, renewable hydropower  generation at existing nonpowered dams. The current regulatory process  simply takes too long, taking up to a decade for the project to be  approved.   We can change this by supporting America's Water Infrastructure Act  of 2018, which includes the Promoting Hydropower Development at  Existing Nonpowered Dams Act, which I authored. This legislation  instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to create an  expedited permitting process that will result in a final decision on an  application in 2 years or less.   The legislation also requires FERC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  and the Department of the Interior to develop a list of existing  nonpowered dams that have the greatest potential for hydropower  development. Streamlining the permitting process will incentivize  investments in clean hydropower development and help modernize our  existing infrastructure.   I ask my colleagues to join me today in supporting this legislation.
