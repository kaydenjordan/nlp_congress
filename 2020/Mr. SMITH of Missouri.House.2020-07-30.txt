 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendment that requires the Secretary  of Health and Human Services to coordinate with the heads of the  relevant agencies to compile a list of critical medications the Federal  Government should ensure are readily available in the event of another  public health emergency.   In recent decades, the United States has become more reliant on  foreign countries for the production of general pharmaceutical drugs.  Today, only a small portion of generic drugs are produced in the United  States. That is one thing that the coronavirus pandemic has taught us  is that we should not be reliant on our adversaries for our generic  drugs.   Hostile authoritarian regimes like the Chinese Communist Party should  never have the ability to decide the drugs that American people have  access to. We cannot allow China to hold American lives in its hands.   My amendment will ensure we are properly informed about our  pharmaceutical supply chains.
