 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin, I would like to express  my dismay at House Democrats' decision last night to block legislation  to provide enhanced security for Supreme Court Justices and their  families.   Due to the unprecedented leak of an early draft of the Supreme  Court's Dobbs decision and the resulting hysteria from members of the  pro-abortion left, the Supreme Court asked Congress for additional  authorities to protect Justices' families. This happened 4 weeks ago.  And yesterday's arrest of an armed man near Justice Kavanaugh's home--a  man who told police that he intended to kill a Supreme Court Justice  and has been charged with attempted murder--made clear just how needed  that protection is.  [[Page S2878]]    The Supreme Court security legislation in question passed the Senate  unanimously 4 weeks ago but has faced inexplicable delays in the House  of Representatives.   This should not be a partisan issue. The Senate Democratic Whip said  just yesterday that the House should pass this legislation.   And I really thought that yesterday's arrest of an individual bent on  assassinating a Supreme Court Justice would have forced House Democrats  to abandon political gains and provide this urgently needed protection.   There is no excuse for further delay. One press report suggests that  Democrats may be rethinking their opposition. I hope that is true.  House Democrats should abandon the political games today and pass this  legislation.                                Student Loans    Madam President, recent reporting suggests that President Biden may  be contemplating forgiving $10,000 in Federal student loan debt per  borrower. That is a bad idea for many reasons. It is difficult really  to know where to start, but let me begin by pointing out the obvious:  that forgiving $10,000 in Federal student loan debt will do absolutely  nothing to address the underlying problem and, in fact, would likely  make things much worse.   The price of higher education has risen stratospherically in recent  decades. The cost of 1 year of attendance at some colleges--just 1  year--is more than many Americans' yearly salaries. And that is a  problem. But forgiving $10,000 of student loan debt would do absolutely  nothing to fix the problem of soaring tuition costs. As I said, it  would very likely make things worse.   What incentive would colleges have to rein in costs if they could be  confident that part of their students' bill would eventually be picked  up by the Federal Government; because, of course, no one should be  deceived into thinking that student loan forgiveness would be a one- time thing?   One estimate suggests that the student loan burden in this country  would return to its current amount within 4 years--4 years--of $10,000  in debt being forgiven, and calls to forgive more debt would  undoubtedly come much sooner.   Future graduates are very likely to want the same deal that would be  offered to graduates today--the wiping away of $10,000 in debt--which  brings us to another problem: some students opting to take on  unrealistic levels of debt to finance their educations.   How much greater is that problem going to be if students think that  the Government is likely to step in and forgive some of the debt that  they have agreed to repay? It is very easy to imagine a student feeling  free to take on more debt than he or she otherwise would, believing  that the Government is likely to reduce the resulting debt burden.   Another massive problem with President Biden's plan is, of course,  its complete unfairness. Under President Biden's plan, an individual  who just finished paying his or her student loans after years of work  would not receive a penny. Meanwhile, a student who graduated a month  ago and hasn't yet paid a dime on his or her loans could see a  substantial part of his or her debt wiped away.   The President's plan is also incredibly unfair to the tens of  millions of Americans without any student loan debt who would be asked  to subsidize a student loan debt of a small percentage of Americans.  Somewhere around two-thirds of millennials have no student debt, either  because they didn't attend college or didn't take out any loans to  attend college. The president's plan is unfair to those who avoided  loans by working their way through school or choosing a lower-cost  college option. It is unfair to parents who worked for years to ensure  that they could finance their kids' education. And it is unfair to  those who chose not to attend a traditional 4-year college and,  instead, trained in one of the many essential trades we depend on, from  plumbing to air conditioning to broadband installation, at a  significantly lower-cost community college or technical school.   Another problem with the President's plan is what it would teach  about the sanctity of contracts. While it may, at times, be ill- advised, students freely enter into the agreements when they take out a  loan. Should we really be teaching that agreements and contracts mean  nothing, that people can incur debt and then not have to pay it off?   Another important point to make here is that the average debt for  undergraduate education in this country is not as crippling as it might  be portrayed. Now, there is no question that there are students out  there who were encouraged to take on unrealistic levels of debt and are  currently struggling with huge debt burdens made up of private as well  as Federal loans, but the average debt, the average debt for an  undergraduate education is somewhere around $29,000. That is not chump  change, for sure, but it is also not an unmanageable level of debt for  the average college graduate--especially with the availability of  extended repayment plans and income-driven repayment programs.   Average student loan debt rises substantially for those with advanced  degrees, and there are certainly those who take on far too much debt  for graduate education, but it is also important to know that those  with advanced degrees have higher--and in some cases much higher-- earning potential.   Doctors, for example, take on medical debt north of $190,000 on  average, but once they have completed their education and training they  can expect to make a robust--sometimes a very robust--six figures per  year, making repaying debt of that size a very feasible proposition.   There is no question that the cost of higher education is out of  control and that students sometimes take on unrealistic levels of debt  to pay for it. But forgiving student loan debt is not the answer for  the reasons I have mentioned, among others. Instead, we should be  exploring ways to drive down education costs.   We should be also highlighting affordable education options like our  Nation's community colleges and technical schools. These institutions,  like the outstanding tech schools we have in South Dakota, provide  students with associate's degrees, certificates, apprenticeships,  opportunities to learn a trade, and more.   There are also things we can do to help students pay off loans  without forcing taxpayers to shoulder the burden. In December of 2020,  Congress passed a 5-year version of legislation that I introduced with  Senator Warner to allow employers to help employees repay their loans.  Our Employer Participation in Repayment Act amends the Educational  Assistance Program to permit employers to make tax-free payments on  their employees' student loans. It is a win for employees, who get help  paying off their student loans. And it is a win for employers who have  a new option for attracting and retaining talented workers.   Our bill isn't a cure-all, but it will certainly help ease the pain  of paying back student loans for a number of Americans. I am pleased  that it was enacted into law for a 5-year period, and I hope at some  point Congress will act to make it permanent.   Another big thing we can do, of course, is to make sure that  graduates have access to good-paying jobs. This is key to enabling  people to pay off their debt, and we should resolve to build on the  economic progress that we had made prepandemic and focus on policies  that will allow our economy to thrive.   Republicans are not alone in thinking that forgiving $10,000 in  student loan debt is fraught with problems. As one Democrat Senator  said:         An across-the-board cancellation of college debt does       nothing to address the absurd cost of college or fix our       broken student loan program. It offers nothing to Americans       who paid off their college debts or those who chose a lower-      priced college to go to as a way of avoiding going into debt       or taking on debt. . . . [R]really importantly, it ignores       the majority of Americans who never went to college, some of       whom have debts just as staggering . . .    That is from one of our Democrat colleagues here in the Senate.   The New York Times editorial board, not exactly known for toeing the  Republican line, noted:         Canceling this debt, even in the limited amounts the White       House is considering, would set a bad precedent and do       nothing to change the fact that future students will graduate       with yet more debt--along with the blind hope of another,       future amnesty. Such a move is legally dubious, economically       unsound, politically fraught and educationally problematic.    That was from the New York Times editorial board.  [[Page S2879]]    With inflation near a 40-year high, with the President's approval  rating hitting a new low, and with Democrats' prospects for November  looking less rosy, it is not exactly surprising that the President  would look toward student loan forgiveness as a way of distracting  voters or that some Democrats are reportedly pushing for student loan  forgiveness as a way to boost their chances in November; but I very  much hope that the President will decide that temporary political gain  is not a good reason to put American taxpayers on the hook for billions  of dollars in student loan debt that is not their own.   As the New York Times noted, the President's plan is ``legally  dubious, economically unsound, politically fraught, and educationally  problematic.''   I strongly, strongly encourage the President to abandon a plan that  even the Democratic Speaker of the House has suggested he doesn't have  the authority to implement.   I yield the floor.
