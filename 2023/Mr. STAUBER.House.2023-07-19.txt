 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment from  the distinguished gentleman from California.   Rural districts like the one I represent often get written off as  ``flyover country.'' Essential Air Service, or EAS, ensures that  ``flyover country'' is just a saying and is not a reality.   As I have mentioned before, Minnesota's Eighth District is the most  beautiful place in the world. Just take a flight to International  Falls, Minnesota, and check out Voyageurs National Park, or fly to  Brainerd and recreate in one of the many beautiful family-owned  resorts. Fly to Bemidji and see beautiful Lake Bemidji, or take a  flight to Hibbing, Minnesota, and fly over the biggest mining country  that we have. None of this would be possible without EAS.   For most in Minnesota's Eighth District, getting down to Minneapolis  Airport can be a real challenge. The EAS airports in my district  provide an opportunity for my rural constituents to quickly,  conveniently, and safely connect with the rest of this Nation and the  world.   I want the constituents that I represent to have access to air travel  just like everyone else, not be punished because we live in rural  America.   My constituents matter. Our local economies and our local airports  matter, and rural America matters.
