 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Friday, July 17, after six decades as  one of our Nation's most preeminent civil rights leaders, Congressman    John Lewis--the conscience of the Congress--passed away at the age of  80. His trials and tribulations and, ultimately, his triumphs are well  known to all of us.   At the ripe old age of 25, he led thousands of marchers across a  bridge in Alabama. They risked their lives for their constitutionally  guaranteed right to vote and, in doing so, shook the conscience of a  nation and hastened the demise of Jim Crow. On that fateful Sunday,  battered and bruised, his head dizzy and bleeding from the policeman's  rod,   John Lewis found the courage and the strength to reach the other  side of that bridge, and he never stopped marching.   From the Freedom Rides to Selma, from his leadership of the SNCC, to  his four decades in Congress,   John Lewis never stopped marching. His  actions as a young man helped change the trajectory of a nation and  brought about the Voting Rights Act, and then   John Lewis went to  Congress and renewed that law again and again. He sat in against  segregation at lunch counters in the Jim Crow South and, over 40 years  later, led another sit-in on the House floor against gun violence. He  spoke out for marriage equality long before it was popular. He  challenged those who walked the corridors of power and then trod those  corridors himself to bring quality healthcare, fair wages, and social  justice to Georgians and Americans everywhere.   It is one thing, inflamed with the passion of youth, to join in brave  endeavors and challenge the status quo. It is a good thing. Yet it is  even beyond that to sustain that activism and vision and efforts and,  yes, that ``good trouble'' he talked about getting into over the steady  and persistent dedication of a lifetime. That is who   John Lewis was  deep in his soul--a man on a mission, who forcefully but gently led us  all to do more and to do better, who loved his country so much that he  risked his life and then spent his life trying to change it.   We are an imperfect nation, for sure, but we have a tremendous  ability to reinvent ourselves. The story of America is one of constant  renewal, but that renewal has never been preordained. It is because  Americans have pushed and prodded, used their voices and their votes to  force our country to change over time to move ever closer to our  highest ideals.   In the story of America, there are certain heroes whose moral clarity  has shone out like a beacon for others to follow--North Stars who have  inspired their fellow Americans to join them in the glorious work of  bending the moral arc of the universe toward justice.   John Lewis was  one of those special heroes. He paved the road, lit the path, and  pointed the way toward other bridges for us to cross. It was not by  always being the loudest voice or the most intemperate; he led by the  moral force of his example. Whether he would admit it or not, he  inspired millions.   At President Obama's inauguration, John asked the new President to  sign a commemorative photo of the event. President Obama simply wrote:  ``Because of you, John.''   I don't know how many people must have said that over the years-- ``because of you, John''--and I could never guess at the number who  didn't even know to say it but whose lives were forever altered, whose  dignity and freedom was made whole because of you, John.   As a new generation of young people lift up their voices to proclaim  ``Black lives matter'' and to fight for the Justice in Policing Act,  the memory and legacy of   John Lewis lives on in each and every one of  them.   There are very few people who have changed the world for the better.    John Lewis is one of them. His life is a reminder of all that is the  best in us and that we are all capable of doing that best.   As we mourn his loss, I would ask my fellow Americans, including my  colleagues in this body, to take up his mission. Many of the old  enemies John faced down have not been vanquished. Racial disparities  persist and gnaw at the fabric of our society, and so does the police  violence that met a young   John Lewis and thousands of law-abiding  Americans on that bridge over 50 years ago. The bridge he crossed is  still named for the Confederate officer, not for the man who led a  righteous movement for equality. The law he nearly died for has been  gutted by the Supreme Court. Congress has the power to restore it, but  only one political party seems interested in doing so.   At the 50th anniversary of the march on Selma, Congressman Lewis  acknowledged that his mission was not yet complete. ``There is still  work left to be done,'' he said. ``We must use this moment to recommit  ourselves to finish the work.'' He told us to ``get out there and push  and pull until we redeem the soul of America.''   As we confront our turbulent present--a pernicious disease, vast  economic hardship and inequality, the ancient evil of racial  injustice--the loss of   John Lewis feels even more devastating and  leaves many searching for answers. But   John Lewis has already pointed  the way. ``There is still work left to be done,'' he said. ``Finish the  work. Get out there and push and pull until we redeem the soul of  America.''   May he forever rest in peace.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
