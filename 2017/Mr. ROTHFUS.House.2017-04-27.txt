 Mr. Speaker, as President Trump and Republicans in  Congress work toward finally delivering the American people relief from  ObamaCare, it is important to remember how we got here and why we find  ourselves in this position today.  [[Page H2927]]    We are approaching the fork in the road for health care in our  country. We have a choice of two paths, and they lead to very different  outcomes.   ObamaCare's regulatory behemoth is collapsing the individual market  and is paving the way toward a disastrous result, namely, socialized  medicine--and the crowded waiting rooms, scarce access to physicians,  and low-quality health care that comes with it, not to mention an  unprecedented accumulation of power in Washington, D.C.   This is not conjecture. Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and a whole host of  ObamaCare supporters have been completely candid about their ultimate  goal of a single-payer healthcare system, which could then seamlessly  devolve into socialized medicine.   The time to right our course is now. Republicans are offering the  American people a better way, one that fosters choice, lowers  healthcare costs, and improves Americans' health outcomes. We have two  clear and very distinct options. Let's make the right choice and pull  back from the brink of socialized medicine.                            ____________________
