 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking  member for their support and work on this bill as well.   I certainly rise today in support of this measure sponsored and  introduced by my friend and colleague, Mr. Meadows, also from North  Carolina. We know firsthand just how badly this legislation is needed.   In my district alone, which has been a victim of two major hurricanes  in the last 3 years, Matthew in 2016, and Florence just this past fall,  after both hurricanes, Congress appropriated disaster aid funding for  rebuilding and recovery efforts. To date, very little of that money,  quite honestly, has been channeled to the State.   Taxpayers in North Carolina and across the rest of the country  deserve to know how the Federal Government is spending these recovery  funds, or whether they are being spent at all.   More transparency means more accountability and making this disaster  funding data available online to the public will help ensure that these  dollars that Congress has appropriated are being spent in a timely and  effective manner.   As we continue to recover from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, and  prepare for yet another hurricane season this year, it is more  important than ever that we make sure we are getting the most out of  every single dollar that Congress appropriates. This bill will go a  long way in helping to ensure just that.
