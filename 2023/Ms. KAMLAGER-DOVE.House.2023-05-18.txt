 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose this  resolution, a deeply partisan, messaging tactic from House Republicans  who are more focused on inflaming divisions in our country than on  working for the American people.   If Republicans cared about public safety, they would work to address  the gun violence epidemic in our Nation, which even law enforcement  says is out of control.   If they really cared about law enforcement, they would not try to  defund agencies like the ATF and FBI.   This resolution is harmful and misleading. Violent leftist extremists  and progressive politicians do not want to defund law enforcement. This  characterization is a corrupt narrative that runs counter to the real  conversations that Americans want to have about the issues their  communities face.   The true irony here is that in the same breath that they denounce  these so-called violent leftist extremists, they stay silent on the  extremists from their own party that stormed the Capitol and attacked  the United States Capitol Police, men and women still working here  today, disrespected every single day by my colleagues.   Silence on this issue.   Republicans are wasting time with empty bills and malignant rhetoric.   Yes, absolutely, we should be investing in people's livelihoods. Why  is that wrong?   How come we cannot support good public safety and work to keep people  alive, all people?   A study just came out yesterday that said Black people are twice as  likely to die than anyone else just because we are Black, and that  includes interacting with law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that we vote ``no'' on this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a vision for  our Nation that values the well-being of the communities we serve.   As a new Member of Congress, I have plans for what I want to  accomplish for the people of California's 37th District which is to  LEAD, to focus on land, economic justice, art, and democracy.   Land means finding ways to mitigate the climate crisis to put us on a  sustainable path for the future. Focusing on economic justice means  ensuring that marginalized communities can access economic  opportunities.   The ``A'' refers to art and education. I will always be an advocate  for the future of the arts and the unique stories artists tell.   Lastly, I am laser focused on safeguarding our democracy. The past  couple of years have taught us it is fragile, vital, and worth fighting  for.   My priorities are not the GOP's priorities. So far, the GOP has put  forward bills attacking our education system, parents, and immigrants,  as well as plans that would be catastrophic for our environment and  economy.   I am committed to my plan for Angelenos and to lead us to this moment  fiercely hoping we can push toward progress together.                            ____________________
