 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague from not too far away in Trenton, New Jersey, as well as my  colleague from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 207 Glenside  Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post  Office Building.   Staff Sergeant Taub, a constituent of my 13th Congressional District  of Pennsylvania, was a shining example of the best our country has to  offer. He exemplified unwavering patriotism and heroic bravery.   Peter made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when a suicide  bomber took his life in Afghanistan in December 2015. Renaming the  Wyncote Post Office in his hometown is really the least we can do to  honor him. It is a small but important symbol of our eternal thanks. I  am here today urging the House to pass my legislation to do just that.   Peter was born on November 2, 1985, in my hometown of Philadelphia,  to his parents, Joel Taub and Arlene Wagner. Peter was then raised in  Wyncote,  [[Page H9294]]  Pennsylvania, and graduated from Cheltenham High School in 2004.   His mother, Arlene, and brother, Jonathan, run the very popular  Washington, D.C., sandwich shop called Bub and Pop's.   Peter was inspired by his grandfather's service in World War II, so  he enlisted in the Air Force in December of 2007 after attending  community college for some time.   During his career in the military, Peter was assigned to a base in  Japan, where he loaded missiles onto F-15 fighter jets. Three years  later, he was transferred to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota,  where he specialized in arming B-1 bombers.   Peter went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity and was  hired as a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations in December 2013. During his service, Peter participated  in more than 12 combat missions in hostile areas.   Peter was killed, along with four other airmen, in a suicide ambush  attack in Afghanistan on December 21, 2015.   Peter is survived by his wife, Christina; their 3-year-old daughter,  Penelope; and another daughter, Petra, who was born after Peter's death  in the summer of 2016.   President Obama paid tribute to Peter, as well as the other troops  who were killed in the attack, calling their service ``outstanding''  and ``brave.'' I second those descriptions.   Posthumously, Peter was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart,  the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Combat Action  Medal.   It is my hope that, with this legislation, the 13th District of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will pay daily tribute to the memory of  one of our heroes, Staff Sergeant Peter Taub.
