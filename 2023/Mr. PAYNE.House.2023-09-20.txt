 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the dangerous  Republican budget cuts and how they will hurt American families, damage  education, and threaten our communities.   They will force Border Patrol agencies to fire 800 agents and make  our country less secure.   They will remove 40,000 teachers from classrooms and affect the  education of 33.5 million students.   They will deny 55,000 American workers the money they earned on the  job.   They will take 4,000 law enforcement officers off our streets and  make our neighborhoods less safe.   In addition, these cuts will take food out of the mouths of millions  of American children and seniors.   If they do not get their way, Republicans will shut down the  government and hurt more Americans, including our veterans. Clearly,  this behavior does not represent a party working for the American  people.                            ____________________
