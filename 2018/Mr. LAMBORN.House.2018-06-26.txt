 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 2083.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 2083, a bipartisan effort by Ms. Herrera Beutler and Mr.  Schrader, aims to cut red tape by updating Federal law to provide a  temporary, expedited process to give States and Tribes the ability to  address California sea lion predation of endangered salmon and other  species on a limited basis.   Right now, ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest invest hundreds of  millions of dollars each year to help recovering salmon populations,  only to have them end up in the stomachs of sea lions. Federal law  provides conflicting mandates to protect each species but does not  provide the flexibility to account for broader ecological interactions.   California sea lion populations on the West Coast have exploded, yet  salmon runs continue to decline. According to the Northwest Power and  Conservation Council, the sea lion population has grown to a level of  roughly 300,000 individuals, and marine biologists conclude that their  population is currently at carrying capacity.   Historically, California sea lions have foraged at the mouth of the  Columbia River, but they have recently continued to move inland. As the  sea lions move further upstream to feed, their diet exists increasingly  more of endangered salmon.   H.R. 2083 will authorize the Secretary of Commerce to provide to  State and local Tribes the tools necessary to humanely manage sea lions  that have migrated outside their historic range and pose an imminent  threat to fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act.   Federal permits authorized under H.R. 2083 would be limited to State  and Tribal fishery managers who have a direct stake in a healthy  regional ecosystem. It is absolutely imperative that we give local  stakeholders the tools they need for a balanced ecosystem where both  fish and sea lions can thrive.   This bipartisan bill has broad support from States, Tribes, public  utility districts, advocacy groups, and hundreds of local businesses  across the Pacific Northwest. It is a win for not only the endangered  fish of the Pacific Northwest, but the ratepayers who are heavily  invested in keeping these fish stocks flourishing and healthy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan,  commonsense bill.   And that is just the way it is.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Chairman, I would only say that, when there is a  population of 300,000 sea lions, I would not call that endangered. They  are protected under a Federal law, but they are not found to be  endangered or threatened, as far as I know.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Schrader), who is also a bipartisan cosponsor of this bill.                                time  1445     Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Chair, I include the Record letters of support for  this legislation from Trout Unlimited, the Pacific Coast Federation of  Fishermen's Associations, and an additional list of supporters.                                                Trout Unlimited,                                                      June 26, 2018.      Re Trout Unlimited Support for H.R. 2083, Endangered Salmon           and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We, the undersigned represent the       nearly 10,000 members of Trout Unlimited in the states of       Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Trout Unlimited is the       country's largest and oldest, coldwater conservation       organization with over 300,000 members and supporters       nationwide.        TU has been deeply engaged in wild salmon and steelhead       recovery efforts in the Columbia Basin for several decades,       and it is our goal to restore healthy, fishable, naturally       reproducing salmon and steelhead populations.        Many issues impact salmon and steelhead recovery efforts in       the Columbia Basin.  [[Page H5700]]       Habitat degradation, hydropower operations, harvest and       hatchery management issues are all significant factors. This       legislation will help to provide resource managers with the       necessary tools to help reduce predation by pinnipeds, a       problem which has become increasingly significant over the       last decade, and is particularly impactful at key locations,       such as Willamette Falls.        Pinniped predation rates in the basin are significant. NMFS       marine mammal biologists believe that sea lion predation       accounts for 20% of Spring Chinook Salmon losses in the       Columbia. Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has       completed a risk analysis that place the likelihood of       extinction for wild winter steelhead in the Willamette river       at 90% due in part to pinniped predation at the falls in       Oregon City.        H.R. 2083 would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act to       allow NOAA to issue permits allowing state agency       representatives in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, as well as       several area tribes to use lethal take of sea lions in a       portion of the Columbia river or certain tributaries in order       to protect fish from sea lion predation.        While we support a targeted approach to culling individual       sea lions in specific areas to help reduce the impact to wild       salmon and steelhead populations, we recognize that this       action is necessary, but not at all sufficient, to help       recover salmon and steelhead populations. To rebuild wild       salmon and steelhead we need to take a comprehensive,       science-based approach that addresses other major factors in       their decline. Restoring their habitat, improving hatchery       operations and fine-tuning angling regulations must be part       of the long-term solution. Many of these actions are       underway, and we need to redouble these efforts.        We urge you to vote yes on H.R. 2083.            Sincerely,      Terry Turner,        Oregon Council Chair.      Ed Northern,        Idaho Council Chair.      Brad Throssel,        Washington Council Chair.                                   ____                                            Pacific Coast Federation                                     of Fishermen's Associations,                                                      June 25, 2018.        Dear Representative: The Pacific Coast Federation of       Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) is the largest organization       of commercial fishermen on the West Coast, representing the       interests of hundreds of family-owned commercial fishing       operations who harvest and deliver fresh seafood to American       consumers and for export. Collectively, we represent many       thousands of family wage jobs and a West Coast commercial       fishing industry that contributes billions of dollars to the       U.S. economy.        On behalf of the hundreds of hard working commercial       fishermen we represent, we write to request your SUPPORT for       H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation       Prevention Act. This bill would allow state and tribal       wildlife managers to apply for a permit to humanely euthanize       individual marine mammals in the Columbia River that are       known to prey on endangered salmon as they line up at fish       ladders attempting to return to their natal streams to spawn.        This bill provides an immediate, surgical solution to a       significant problem in a highly impacted western river, the       Columbia. Impediments to fish passage and severe flow       curtailment from hydropower dams have resulted in severe       depletion of the Pacific Northwest's most productive salmon       river. These impacts have cost commercial fishing families       billions of dollars in lost opportunity. While long-term       solutions including dam removal and robust instream flow       requirements will ultimately be required, immediate-term       approaches like this bill are desperately needed. The       limited, targeted culling of salmon predators on the Columbia       is one such solution that will yield immediate results while       long-term approached can be designed. We therefore urge your       support for this bill.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Noah Oppenheim,      Executive Director.                                   ____         American Sport Fishing Association; Association of       Northwest Steelheaders; Coastal Conservation Association of       Washington; State of Idaho; State of Oregon; State of       Washington; Chelan PUD; Douglas PUD; Grant PUD; Northwest       RiverPartners; Yakima Bait co.; Leisure Sales; North Point       Personalized Wealth; Northwest Sportsman Magazine; O'Loughlin       Trade Shows; Island Creative Printing & Publishing; Active       Outdoors; Stevens Marine; Day One Outdoors, LLC & CK; Eagle       Cap Fishing Guides.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler), who will talk, among other things,  about the mitigation efforts that the ratepayers have been funding for  the salmon.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot of debate. This has been a good  debate. I have been struck by the fact that every single speaker from  the Northwest, on both sides of the aisle, has spoken in favor of this  piece of legislation.                                time  1515    I find that very remarkable. Rarely do we have that kind of  consensus, and yet we have that here with H.R. 2083.   Just to conclude, I would say that this is a commonsense piece of  legislation. Unfortunately, the Federal Government sometimes has  conflicting mandates. We have a law, on the one hand, that protects sea  lions, but we have the endangered status of various salmon. These two  are in conflict, unfortunately.   So let's take the side of the endangered species. We can do so on a  limited and scientific basis, with the way that this bill has been  crafted through a lot of compromise. In fact, before it even takes  effect, there will be an environmental impact statement, which is a  very lengthy process with lots of public comment, lots of judicial  scrutiny, and so on.   So I find this to be a very commonsense piece of legislation with a  lot of compromise built in, a lot of consensus. It makes so much sense  that I hope that there would be no opposition or almost no opposition  when this comes up for a vote. Let's all adopt H.R. 2083, a great piece  of legislation for our environment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we have no objection to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we have no objection to this amendment, as  modified.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of the bill, H.R. 2083, the Clerk be authorized to make  technical corrections and conforming changes to the bill including the  changes I have placed at the desk.
