 Madam Speaker, this September, the Biden  administration paved the way for $6 billion in sanctioned funds to be  accessed by the Iranian regime in exchange for the return of American  hostages.   Authorizing this transfer puts us in an incredibly dangerous position  and will only encourage Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism to  kidnap more hostages in the future.   What we saw in the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and what we  are seeing, once again, is that President Biden has failed to manage  our Nation's foreign policy.   This deal gives Iran access to more money to fund more terrorist  activities, including support for regional proxies like Hamas and  Hezbollah.   We know that the Iranian regime is highly skilled in sanctions  evasion, and they will do everything they can to hide the true use of  these funds.   One thing is for certain, this money would not be used for  humanitarian purposes, as the Biden administration has claimed.   It is time to pass the No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act and freeze  this money in Qatari banks where it is currently being held.   We cannot allow the Iranian regime to enrich itself and continue to  funnel money into the hands of known terrorists.          Public Lands Shouldn't Be Used to House Illegal Immigrants     Madam Speaker, in the past week, the  Tucson, Arizona, sector of our southern border has encountered over  2,000 illegal immigrants each and every day.   This crisis has pulled in Border Patrol resources, including highly  trained BORTAC units to confront the surge of illegal immigrants from  across the southwest.   This has left dangerous gaps in our border security for cartels to  exploit, smuggling deadly drugs like cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl into  the United States.   Now, after repealing Trump's remain in Mexico policy, the Biden  administration is attempting to use public lands and national parks to  house illegal immigrants.   This policy shift is a failure, and it is a failure that will  continue to have immediate and negative consequences for so many  American communities.   Places like the Gateway National Recreational area in New Jersey  should not be used to house illegal immigrants who have been allowed by  President Biden to remain in America for far too long.   Our communities cannot afford to continue down this treacherous path.   It is time for Congress to pass legislation that prevents our public  lands from being used to support the crisis that President Biden has  failed to address with our failed ability to maintain the sovereignty  of our country by making sure that all of our borders are secure.
