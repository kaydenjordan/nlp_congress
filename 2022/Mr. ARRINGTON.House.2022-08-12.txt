 Madam Speaker, the last time my Democrat colleagues  used reconciliation to jam through a massive partisan spending spree,  it was under the pretense of COVID recovery. Not only did they ``fail  to rescue America,'' they destroyed our recovery efforts and sent us  spiraling into recession.   Now, in the aftermath of their self-inflicted economic disaster, my  Democrat colleagues' response is to run the same play and expect a  different result.   Another false promise under the guise of a grandiose title, the  Inflation Reduction Act.   Nobody in America, Madam Speaker, believes that this bill will reduce  inflation. In fact, it is going to make inflation worse by imposing  massive tax hikes on U.S. job creators, strangling domestic oil and gas  production, unleashing an army of tens of thousands of IRS agents to  shake down working families and small businesses, handing out hundreds  of billions of dollars in Green New Deal giveaways that will jeopardize  America's energy security, putting America in the same position of  weakness as our European allies.   Mark my words, Madam Speaker, this bill will further fuel inflation,  deepen our recession, cripple our competitiveness, and increase costs  at the pump.
