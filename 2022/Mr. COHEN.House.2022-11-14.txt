 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member  Bost for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our bill, H.R. 6863, to name  the Memphis VA hospital in honor of a true World War II hero and a hero  in American life, Lieutenant Colonel Luke Weathers, Jr.   I didn't know of Lieutenant Colonel Weathers until his passing, and I  read about his passing in the Memphis newspaper, the Commercial Appeal,  and I went and attended his funeral at St. Theresa Little Flower  Church, where he was a member. I think he integrated the church. The  church is a large church and it was packed.   In spite of the fact that he had moved to retire to Arizona, possibly  in Tucson, maybe 15 or 20 years earlier, the people knew Lieutenant  Colonel Weathers, they knew his work, they knew his good deeds in the  community, and they knew his actions. I was honored to be at that  funeral, and I thought this man is something else.   It has been well documented what he did with his life and with the  Tuskegee Airmen and the Red Tails and the several airplanes he shot  down.   There is a movie coming out now that is getting a lot of  advertisement, and all Members of Congress have been invited to see  this week, called ``Devotion,'' about an African-American pilot who was  a star in the Korean war.   It was Lieutenant Colonel Weathers and the Tuskegee Airmen who were  the predecessors of that gentleman's opportunity to defend his country  and to show his skills. That is another reason why his name at the  veterans hospital will be so important, to inspire people to go into a  military career and pursue aviation, which Lieutenant Colonel Weathers  encouraged people to do, particularly African-American young men.   I was also honored to attend his funeral. It was a funeral with a  flyover, military caisson, and ``Taps,'' as befitting a gentleman who  had served his country as he did.   His family is very strong in Memphis in support of their father's  legacy. I met them in St. Theresa Little Flower Church at his funeral  in 2011.   Lieutenant Colonel Weathers paved the way for many to become pilots,  and his legacy endures in the countless lives that he touched.   I thank our Tennessee delegation who unanimously supported this  legislation and this naming of the new Memphis VA Medical Center. It  was also endorsed by The American Legion, the Disabled American  Veterans, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.   I thank Chairman Takano, Ranking Member Bost, and the members of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee for advancing the bill through  committee and bringing it to the floor today. I thank Mr. Hoyer for his  help with that, too.   We have done a good thing today to honor a true American hero. I  think fondly of him. I had commissioned a plaque to be created and  installed at the Memphis airport recognizing his service in the Federal  Aviation Administration and integrating that facility. I am honored I  will be a part of keeping his memory alive forever.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and  the entire committee for their work in passing this bill out of  committee. I know it was somewhat contentious. It shouldn't have been,  but it was.  [[Page H8475]]    I rise in strong support of H.R. 5441, the Prevent All Soring Tactics  Act, acronym, the PAST Act, which I proudly introduced with several  prime cosponsors who worked on it, including Brian Fitzpatrick, Jan  Schakowsky, and Vern Buchanan. Mr. Buchanan, like Mr. Bilirakis, is a  Member of the class of 2006, of which I am, as well.   The PAST Act will shut down the cruel practice of horse soring, which  has been described here on the floor. It is a horrendous practice that  horse trainers have used in the Tennessee Walking, Spotted Saddle, and  Racking Horse shows.   The horses have a beautiful gait to start with. They have a natural  gait, a smooth, natural gait. It is revered in Tennessee. It used to be  Tennessee Walkers paraded at the University of Tennessee football games  to great applause and great thrill of the fans.   However, some people, to make it even more imposing, took away their  natural gait, which is enough of a miracle and enjoyment to watch, and  put in these soring practices to get a high gait, extremely high gait,  known as the Big Lick. The Big Lick is wrong. To achieve the Big Lick,  horse trainers irritate or blister a horse's forelegs through the  application of caustic chemicals such as mustard oil, cut the horse's  hooves painfully short, or use mechanical devices to inflict pain, all  of which is reprehensible. Anyone who cares about horses realizes they  have lives and senses, and as well, they suffer pain just like every  other animal does.   Far too often, those involved in showing the Tennessee Walking Horses  have turned a blind eye to this abusive act of the trainers. They do  little to try to police it, and the penalties are so minor it does  nothing to prevent this barbaric act.   I have led this legislation for years. My chief of staff, Marilyn  Dillihay, has been strongly supportive of this. As we all know, we work  for our constituents and then for our chief of staff.   The PAST Act would codify key elements of the Horse Protection Act  rule that the USDA finalized in January of 2017 by eliminating the  failed system of industry self-policing and prohibited the use of  devices that are integral to the soring practice and Big Lick. It would  also strengthen penalties and increase consequences for individuals  caught soring a horse.   I thank Chairman Pallone and Chairwoman Schakowsky for their support  and work on this bill. I also particularly thank Priscilla Presley,  Elvis' widow. Priscilla and Elvis had Tennessee Walkers at Graceland.  They loved their Tennessee Walking Horses, which had a natural gait,  and Priscilla has lobbied on this for many years and come to many  activities, encouraging the passage of this act.   Priscilla Presley is a pretty amazing human being, and this is one of  the areas where she has surpassed just being the spouse of the rock and  roll legend, Elvis Presley, and being a star in her own right in many  ways.   I thank the 263 bipartisan Members who cosponsored the bill and the  hundreds of stakeholder groups and individuals who have lent their  support, including the Humane Society, the American Horse Council, U.S.  Equestrian Federation, American Veterinary Medical Association,  American Association of Equine Practitioners, the State veterinary  organizations of all 50 States, National Sheriffs' Association, and the  Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.   The plague of soring has marred the Tennessee Walking Horse and  related breeds for more than six decades. I am proud to lead the fight  to end it. We are going to end it.
