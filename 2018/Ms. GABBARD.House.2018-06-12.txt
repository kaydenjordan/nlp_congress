 Mr. Speaker, just 6 months ago, my constituents and  people all across Hawaii received a harrowing alert that came across  their cell phones saying that a ballistic missile was incoming and to  take cover immediately.   It turned out to be a false alarm, but the terror that my family,  friends, people all across the State of Hawaii experienced was very  real, shining a light on the stark reality and the seriousness of the  North Korean nuclear threat that hangs over them and this country.   The agreement that came from the U.S.-North Korea summit that just  concluded late last night, committing North Korea to complete  denuclearization, is a first step, but there is far more work to be  done. We have to be vigilant to make sure that the details of this deal  ensure complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North  Korea.   You hear talking heads on TV talking about who put up more points on  the scoreboard, missing the seriousness and the actual point of what we  are dealing with, that this is not a game. There are lives at stake.   In the interest of peace and humanity, we should all be rallying  around our country's success and continuing to pursue diplomacy and  peace to remove this threat and denuclearize North Korea.                            ____________________
