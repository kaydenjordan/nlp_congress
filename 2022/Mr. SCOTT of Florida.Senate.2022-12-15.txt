 Mr. President, I move to concur in the House  amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1437 with amendment No. 6540.    Mr. President, everyone in this Chamber spoke  about the pain American families are feeling as they deal with the  raging inflation brought on by Joe Biden's reckless spending, so it was  shocking to many of us when Senate Democrats approved $70 billion to  supersize the IRS with 87,000 new agents. That means more audits on  families and small businesses just as they struggle to get by thanks to  skyrocketing prices.   What is worse, the Biden administration is also changing IRS  standards to begin tracking financial transactions Americans make in  excess of $600 to vendors like Cash App and Venmo and PayPal. It is an  outrageous violation of Americans' privacy. It is stuff we see in  communist China.   That is why I filed an amendment to strike the funding for the new  IRS agents to prevent the IRS from spying on your bank accounts.   I urge my colleagues to protect Americans' privacy, stop the  ridiculous audits on families, and support my amendment.   I yield back my time.    I yield back.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
