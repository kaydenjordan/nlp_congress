 Mr. President, this week, I have the honor of  recognizing Philipsburg Brewing Company in Philipsburg, MT.   Philipsburg Brewing Company opened in August of 2012. What started as  a four-person team has since grown into a 16-person operation. With the  expansive growth in their business, their product now reaches almost  the entire State. Recently, they were named the Best Brewery in Montana  by Montana Mint.   While their business has expanded tremendously, it is their impact on  the community that stands out most. Before they opened, the community  did not have a gathering place. With the opening of the Philipsburg  Brewing Company, folks now have a great atmosphere to be together with  their friends, families, and dogs.   I congratulate Philipsburg Brewing Company on their tremendous  success and thank them for their positive impact on the community. I  look forward to seeing their business grow and visiting the brewery  again soon.                            ____________________
