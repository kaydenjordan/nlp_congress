 Mr. President, April is National Autism Awareness  Month. Although much of our focus is on the challenges that children  with autism face, today I wish to recognize April 21 as Autism After 21  Day, representing the age when Federal services for children end and  adulthood begins.   In declaring this day, we draw attention to the fact that there are  millions of Americans with exceptional gifts who need our help in  overcoming the unique challenges that they face. In Maryland,  approximately 1 in 55 8-year-old children have autism, and I am  committed to ensuring that these kids are empowered to live independent  and fulfilling lives. As someone who has personally employed  individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD, I can attest to the  outstanding talents that this population brings to the workforce.   I am so proud of the organizations in my State that are working  tirelessly to address these needs. To celebrate their work and advocate  for adults all over this Nation with ASD, I call on the Senate to  recognize Autism After 21 Day and acknowledge the millions of people  who are navigating an uncertain adulthood to reach their full  potential.   We all must work together to ensure that this journey is not lonely  and isolated. Rather, these individuals must be recognized as an  important part of our communities. Twenty-eight years after the passage  of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, adults with ASD deserve  access to the goals set by the ADA: equality of opportunity, full  participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.   Thank you.                            ____________________
