 Mr. President, I oppose this outrageous resolution,  which would overturn a Fish and Wildlife Service ecosystem management  rule for the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. This resolution is a  cruel measure that has horrified many of my constituents, and I share  their strong opposition.   The purpose of our National Wildlife Refuge System is to protect  wildlife across the country. It does so by maintaining sustainable  populations and balanced ecosystems. The Alaska National Wildlife  Refuge is a stunning habitat that attracts hikers, fishers, hunters,  and photographers to take in the beauty of the landscape and enjoy the  wildlife there.   The Fish and Wildlife Service rule simply codifies scientifically  based wildlife management practices. It does not affect subsistence  hunting by rural and Native Alaskans.   By overturning this rule, Congress would permit extreme and cruel  hunting practices that include killing wolves and pups in their dens  and trapping, baiting, and using airplanes to  [[Page S1871]]  scout and shoot bears and cubs. This so-called predator control is  unnecessary and indefensible. Most Alaskans oppose these extreme  practices. The resolution of disapproval would impede the Federal  Government's ability to manage 76 million acres of public lands that  Congress set aside for all Americans.   The Fish and Wildlife Service is charged with balancing multiple  needs in wildlife refuges and conserving natural diversity. Overturning  its rules to allow a small minority of hunters to use cruel and  inhumane practices in a wildlife refuge is wrong. I oppose this  resolution.
