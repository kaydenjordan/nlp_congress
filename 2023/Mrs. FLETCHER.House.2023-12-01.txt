 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the lifetime of service  and the exceptional work of Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris  County CEO Tom Lambert.   Tom is a true public servant who has made a difference for all of us  in Houston. For more than four decades, Tom has worked at METRO.   Focusing these four decades on the safety of METRO riders, his  improvements to the system will benefit them for years to come.   His ability to listen to riders led to streamlined services with  improved schedules. His leadership led to the completion of an  additional 15 miles of light rail in 2015, and his commitment to moving  Houstonians in new ways helped pave the way, literally and  figuratively, for bus rapid transit.   Tom has demonstrated his dedication to keeping our community  informed, engaged, and moving forward. Tom exemplifies the very best of  Houston: innovation, collaboration, vision, and leadership.   I send sincere thanks to Tom for his work and for his commitment to  our community and congratulate him on his retirement.                            ____________________
