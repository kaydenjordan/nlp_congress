 Mr. President, NASA recognizes that competition makes  us better. That is why they asked Congress to fund a second provider  for the lunar lander.   Developing additional designs was NASA's original intent--a type of  built-in insurance. It helps foster greater astronaut safety, which you  can appreciate, and minimize the impact of delays; in the end,  protecting the American taxpayers' investment in the Artemis program.   To continue advancements in American ingenuity and innovation,  Congress must embrace competition, safety, and public-private  partnerships.   My colleague from Vermont's motion would take a sledgehammer to  American ingenuity and the Artemis program.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion.
