 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Department of  Defense Appropriations Act of 2017. Last year, I was unable to vote for  this legislation, but the bill before us today is improved, and it is  one that I can support.   I was unable to vote for the previous bill because it included budget  gimmicks that would have jeopardized a full year of funding for our  troops and threatened readiness. I am very pleased to see this problem  has been resolved. This bill provides the funding for the remainder of  the 2017 fiscal year without breaking the budget caps. It also includes  a much-needed pay raise for our servicemembers and ensures that they  will have the equipment that they need to complete their missions and  come home.   What is disappointing is that we are voting on this legislation  today, halfway through the fiscal year. This work should have been  finished months ago. Instead, a stalled appropriations process has left  the Defense Department and our troops operating under a damaging  continuing resolution. Right now it doesn't appear that the FY18  process will go any smoother.   President Trump's proposed $54 billion increase for defense will come  at the expense of essential domestic programs that our servicemen and - women and their families depend upon: education for their children,  quality healthcare for their families, safe roads to drive on,  protection of our clean air and drinking water. The list goes on and  on.   Mr. Speaker, I am voting for this bill today, but I want to make it  clear that I am very concerned about President Trump's proposed cuts  that would pit our national security against the domestic needs of all  Americans.
