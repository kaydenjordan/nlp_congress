 Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss two amendments to the  America COMPETES Act that were offered by me.   The first amendment would direct relevant Federal agencies to  identify U.S. allied countries that are key research partners so that  we can develop and implement security procedures safeguarding our  research.   When we lead with diplomacy and ensure our Nation's scientists,  businesses, and workers compete on a level playing field, the result is  innovation, opportunity, and prosperity for Americans and our allies  alike. I thank Representatives Gallagher, Cheney, and Casten for  joining with me on this bipartisan effort.   Madam Speaker, my second amendment dealt with the human rights crisis  in the Philippines. President Duterte's so-called ``war on drugs'' has  served as a pretext to conduct an estimated 30,000 extrajudicial  killings to unjustly detain, torture, repress, and assassinate labor  activists and other dissidents, including a U.S. citizen, activist  Brandon Lee, who remains paralyzed from the chest down as a result of  an assassination attempt.    This amendment says that U.S. taxpayer funds in the bill cannot go to  Philippines' police forces as long as basic human rights are flagrantly  violated. It is a historic step forward.                            ____________________
