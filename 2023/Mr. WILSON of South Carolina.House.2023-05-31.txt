 Mr. Speaker, today on behalf of all  Americans, the House will be voting on the Fiscal Responsibility Act to  restore fiscal sanity and hold Washington accountable.   Yesterday, a New York Post editorial acknowledged that the debt limit  deal from Speaker Kevin McCarthy is a win for the Nation.   It advances the GOP's control-spending agenda significantly, on  multiple fronts. Most crucially, it starts reducing Federal outlays  immediately and it  [[Page H2670]]  cuts some spending. That by itself is the first such major spending  reduction ever.   It also claws back tens of billions of dollars in unspent COVID  relief. It adds work requirements for food stamps. It also adds some  budgeting/appropriations rules that should prevent another omnibus  monster to avoid a government shutdown. It is the first reform in  decades of environmental rules that slow major energy and  infrastructure projects.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden's open borders.                            ____________________
