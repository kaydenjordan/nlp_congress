 Mr. Speaker, from the mother of four with a  preexisting condition to the family of a young boy who can now afford  health insurance for the first time--we have heard constantly and over  and over how the Affordable Care Act has saved lives. The Affordable  Care Act provides quality, affordable insurance to millions of  Americans.   For example, just in my district alone, nearly 100,000 people who are  now covered through the Covered California exchange or through the  Medicaid--which is in California Medi-Cal--expansion, they stand to  lose coverage if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.   It is completely irresponsible to speak about repealing the  Affordable Care Act with no replacement. I urge my colleagues to think  about their own constituents before doing so.                            ____________________
