 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize a distinguished World War II veteran, Judd Burchfield of  Rockland Township in Venango County.   Mr. Burchfield celebrated his 102nd birthday on Sunday, November 19.  Mr. Burchfield is believed to be the oldest veteran in Venango County.  He grew up in Mt. Joy, and later returned to the area following his  service in World War II.   Over the course of the war, Mr. Burchfield was an auto equipment  mechanic as part of the Army Air Corps. He spent time in both North  Africa and Italy, and eventually rose to the rank of staff sergeant.  Because of his courage, he was awarded the European-African-Middle  Eastern Theater Ribbon with a Bronze Star, a Good Conduct Medal, and  the World War II Victory Medal.   After returning home to Venango County, Mr. Burchfield started his  own farm, raising just about every farm animal. He started his own  business, B&M Farm Supply, and worked for Richland Township running a  road grader and a backhoe.   We thank Mr. Burchfield for his gallant service to our country and  wish him the happiest birthday.                            ____________________
