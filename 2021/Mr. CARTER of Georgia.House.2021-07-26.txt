 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Colonel Edward Wexler, of Savannah, Georgia, who  passed away on June 30 at the age of 75.   Colonel Wexler was a Savannah native who lived a truly remarkable  life. After graduating from The Citadel, he was commissioned as a  second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. Colonel Wexler  traveled the world with the United States Air Force, serving in many  different countries. He retired from the Air National Guard in 2006,  having over 35 years of service.   Following retirement, Colonel Wexler continued to serve his  community. He became director of the Combined Federal Campaign for  Coastal Georgia, president of the Savannah Military Officers  Association, and junior vice commander of the Veterans Council of  Chatham County.   Colonel Wexler's dedication to improving the lives of others will  never be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with Colonel Wexler's  family, friends, and all who knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
