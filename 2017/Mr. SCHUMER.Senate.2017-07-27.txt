 First, let me thank my colleague, the senior Senator  from Delaware, not only for his remarks but for his constant,  conscientious concern about this country in just about every area.  Whenever he speaks, he has a great deal of thought behind it because he  is always thinking. My guess is, he is thinking while he sleeps at  night. He has so many thoughts. It also comes from a good soul and a  good heart because he really cares about making this country better and  is working together in a bipartisan way to do that whenever he can. I  thank my colleague.   Mr. President, it is likely, at some point today, we will finally see  the majority leader's final healthcare bill, the bill he intends to  either pass or fail. Thus far, we have been going through a pretense,  defeating Republican bills that never had enough support even within  their own caucus to pass. Repeal and replace has failed. Repeal without  replace has failed. Now we are waiting to see what the majority leader  intends for the Republican plan on healthcare. If the reports in the  media are true, the majority leader will offer a skinny repeal as his  final proposal.   As I mentioned last night, Democrats will offer no further motions or  amendments until we see this skinny bill, but make no mistake, once we  do see the bill, we will begin preparing amendments. In the event the  bill fails, we can move directly to the NDAA, and out of deference to  my dear friend Senator McCain, we will work to move that piece of  legislation quickly.   If the skinny bill passes, remember, Democrats have an unlimited  right, after it passes, to offer an unlimited amount of amendments.  Now, many of my colleagues have many amendments on healthcare. They  have just been waiting to see the final bill Leader McConnell will  bring to the floor.   I want to put my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on notice, my  Democratic and Republican colleagues, that they should prepare for  numerous Democratic amendments if the skinny bill passes. With the  skinny bill passing--I hope it doesn't, but if it does--it will not be  the last vote. There will be many more after that to change it and to  modify it. I want everyone to understand that.   I also want everyone in this body to understand the consequences of  the skinny repeal. We Democrats asked the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office to score the skinny repeal based on the four or five  provisions of the bill that seem to be what the majority leader is  considering: get rid of the individual mandate, get rid of the business  mandate, get rid of the Cadillac tax, get rid of the tax on medical  devices, and get rid of some of--I believe they considered getting rid  of some of the essential healthcare provisions as well. Even if the  bill is slightly different from the one we asked to be scored, the  score will be pretty much the same.    To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are thinking of  voting for this skinny bill, listen to what the CBO said, which is  nonpartisan and headed by a Republican whom Senator McConnell and  Speaker Ryan agreed to appoint. The Congressional Budget Office said  that a skinny repeal would cause 16 million Americans to lose  insurance, and millions of Americans would pay 20 percent more for  their premiums starting next year. Premiums would go up 20 percent--not  3 years from now but in January--according to the CBO.   Let me repeat that.   A skinny repeal means 16 million fewer Americans with insurance and  premiums up 20 percent next year and will stay there. It is not that  they go down later, as in one of these CBO estimates of one of the  other Republican bills. They stay there, getting higher every year,  with people paying more and more. The premiums will go up immediately,  as early as January 1, as I mentioned--not 3 years forward but on  January 1. One of the promises our Republican friends have made over  and over is to bring down premiums, but a skinny repeal would break  that promise, and the American people would see it in just 5 months.   Yesterday, a bipartisan group of Governors sent a letter that urges  us away from a skinny repeal--these are the Governors, bipartisan-- warning that it would ``accelerate health plans leaving the individual  market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access  to coverage.'' Republican Governors Sandoval and Kasich and a few other  Republican Governors were on that letter.   Now, the argument from the Republican leadership is for Republicans  to vote for this bill because they made a campaign promise to repeal  and replace the Affordable Care Act. Yet I ask my Republican friends:  Did you  [[Page S4353]]  promise the American people that you would raise premiums on everyone?  I didn't hear that in the promises. That is what a skinny repeal does.  Did you promise the American people that you would take healthcare away  from tens of millions? I didn't hear that. That is what the skinny bill  does.   No, the Republicans not only promised to repeal the Affordable Care  Act, but they promised to replace it with something better. I do not  know why, but, somehow, the first promise is more important than the  second. The skinny plan manages to anger everyone--conservatives, who  know it is a surrender and know it does not come close to the full  repeal they promised, and moderates, who know that it will be terrible  for their constituents.   Is this the one plan that finally unites the Republican Senate--a  plan that angers everyone--conservatives, moderates, and, perhaps, most  of all, the American people? I cannot believe that, and I hope it would  not.   If the Republicans pass such a devastating plan, either one of two  things could happen. The House could simply take up the skinny bill  repeal, making all of those terrible possibilities a reality--premiums  would go up in January, and insurance markets would collapse. In fact,  if the House passed this skinny bill, our entire healthcare system  could well implode. Everyone who voted for it, regardless of  motivation, will regret it.   Or they could take it to conference, which is a pathway to full  repeal. In conference, the Freedom Caucus will demand a full repeal--or  something close to it--with all of the associated cuts to Medicaid and  tax breaks for the wealthy, which so many here in the Senate have  labored months to undo.   So this thing is turning into a game of hot potato. The House passed  a bill that they do not like. They had to hurry it up. They had to do  it twice and pass the hot potato to the Senate. Senator McConnell is  juggling that hot potato. He cannot get the repeal, and he cannot get  repeal and replace. So he comes up with this plan that no one likes,  but they say: OK, we can send the hot potato back to the House.   How many more months is this going to go on, when we could be sitting  down, in a bipartisan way, as my good friend from Arizona has  recommended, and work together in the committee process?   In the gym this morning, I saw Lamar Alexander, the head of the HELP  Committee. We see each other just about every morning in the gym. I was  wearing, I think, my Syracuse T-shirt, and he was wearing his Tennessee  Volunteers T-shirt.   I said to Lamar: If this skinny bill goes down, as it should--and I  spoke to Patty Murray, our ranking member--we will sit down and work in  a bipartisan way to improve ObamaCare. We know that ObamaCare needs  some work. We do not deny that. Let's do it in a bipartisan way instead  of passing this hot potato back and forth, back and forth, back and  forth, and not getting anything done.   While our leaders are passing this hot potato, insurers will be  setting their rates for 2018. That means that insurers will lock in  rates for the next year with this massive uncertainty hanging over  their heads, leading to huge rate increases or decisions to pull out of  markets. A skinny repeal as a way to get to conference is a recipe for  disaster. Beyond that, it is a shameful way of legislating.   My Republican friends should listen to the wonderful speech that the  man whom we admire gave--John McCain--when he came back. We should be  working in a bipartisan way. My Republican friends, you should not be  passing a bill that you do not support or believe in, that you pray  will not become law. If you believe that this bill should become law,  vote yes, but if you do not believe that the bill should become law,  you vote no--plain and simple. Then we can resume in the Finance  Committee and in the HELP Committee a bipartisan process of making the  present healthcare system better, which needs to be done.   You do not vote to advance terrible legislation and hope that it will  magically get better in conference. Let's not forget that, months ago,  many House Republicans justified their voting for their nightmare bill  because they thought that it would get better in the Senate. It has not  gotten any better. In fact, it has only gotten worse, and a conference  will be no different. Voting yes on a bill that you do not support just  to get it to conference is an unserious way of legislating,  particularly on this issue, but that is, so far, what the Republican  leader is doing.   There may be no better example than the amendment offered by Senator  Daines, which favors Medicare for all. I cannot believe that this is  happening, because all of the Republicans are going to vote against it.  It is just pure cynicism, pure politics, and is not a serious effort to  legislate and make things better when people need help. Senator Daines  does not support the bill. He just wants to get Democrats on the  record. The majority leader has made pending an amendment that both he  and the author of the amendment will oppose, and that is the very  definition of a political game.   We Democrats are not going to go along, because this is not a game.  This is not a joke. It is not hot potato. We are talking about people's  lives. We do not have time for phony amendments or phony bills. You do  not play games with the healthcare of the American people.   As I said, anyone who listened to the eloquent words of my dear  friend from Arizona should blush at this process. His was a clarion  call that both sides of the aisle can do better. He criticized his side  for being partisan, and he criticized our side for being partisan. He  is right on both counts. We all can do better. Let's start. The Daines  amendment does not do that. That is for sure. The only answer is to  start over together, to work together through regular order, and to get  some legislation that we can all live with.                               Russia Sanctions    Mr. President, I have one other point, on Russia sanctions. It is  apropos. I didn't know, when we read all of this stuff, that my good  friend from Arizona would be here. Even as we debate other items on the  floor, we should not delay this legislation on the Russia sanctions any  longer.   Last night, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee here in  the Senate said that he was ready to move the package quickly. That is  what Senator Corker said, and I am glad he did. I will work with the  majority leader to send this legislation to the President's desk before  the recess. We have already cleared this legislation on the Democratic  side. We are prepared to move it by unanimous consent at any time.   I hope the White House signs this. This morning, the White House  Communications Director said that President Trump may veto the  legislation so that he could make a tougher deal with Russia than could  Congress. The idea that the President would veto this legislation in  order to toughen it up is laughable. I am a New Yorker, too, and I know  bull when I hear it. If the President vetoes this bill, the American  people will know that he is being soft on Putin, that he is giving a  free pass to a foreign adversary who violated the sanctity of our  democracy by meddling in our election and who seeks to undermine  democracy and American life in any way he can. I hope and expect, if  the President decides to use the first veto of his Presidency on this  bill, that Congress will swiftly override it.   I see my friend here, the majority leader. I appreciate his work on  making this Russia sanctions bill happen and being available. I hope  that we will get the House bill to the President's desk, and I hope the  President signs it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I will just clarify, the Republican  leader and the chair of the Armed Services Committee want to discuss  NDAA. They will not make any motion to move to it. I have no problem  with them discussing it.    Will my colleague from Arizona yield so that I can  answer him before the majority leader speaks?    First, I wish to express our respect for the Senator  from Arizona. My dear friendship--really love for the man is unbounded.   I am repeating in my head, as many of us have, the speech our friend  from Arizona gave when he came back, and we were all so joyous that he  did. He talked about going to regular order. He talked about working in  a bipartisan way. He talked about doing this healthcare bill the right  way--with hearings, with debate, with amendment. Even I accepted his  chastisement that we passed a partisan bill. He knows the record shows  I didn't want to do that. But we did have debate and amendments. We had  a process where six people--three from each party--spent 6 months  trying to come to an agreement. They did not.   But I must say the reason that we must ask unanimous consent to go to  the bill is because we are in reconciliation--the very process that has  prevented us from debating, from having hearings, from having some kind  of bipartisan input. I would say to my colleague, if you want to get  rid of this reconciliation, fine. Let's recommit the bill to committee  and start on a fair process, and we can go to NDAA immediately--in an  hour--if we were to do that.   The reason we can't do that is our dear friend the majority leader is  insisting on the reconciliation process. And you can't say--we can't,  because we feel defense is important and we feel the healthcare of tens  of millions of Americans is equally important. And we can't say you can  turn on and turn off the reconciliation process when you want to and  when you don't. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.   If reconciliation is poor and prevents NDAA from coming up  immediately, it is equally poor--maybe more so--when it comes to  healthcare.   So my plea and suggestion: Let's not go forward with this bill. We  don't even know what it is yet. Let's go back to committee.   I spoke to Senator Alexander, I spoke to Senator Murray this morning.  If this bill fails, they will go back and try to negotiate bipartisan  improvements--just as my good friend from Arizona recommended when he  came back and gave his moving speech.   But my caucus--I have spoken to a few--feel very strongly that this  process on healthcare has been awful, and it is because of  reconciliation, and now reconciliation has put NDAA in a bind as well.  Let's get rid of reconciliation, and we can do what the Senator from  Arizona wants and what I think the American people want--a fair  process.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks  count against leader time.    Mr. President, I would simply say once more to my  colleague briefly--    We can do both. We can do both. It is very simple. It is  just what my dear friend from Arizona asked about 2 days ago: regular  order on both. We can have both.   You can't ask--it is unfair, in my judgment--and I have great  respect--to ask for one and then continue to tie our hands on  reconciliation on healthcare.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on  leader time.    Mr. President, last year, we know the United States was  victim of an attack by a foreign power on the very foundation of this  dear democracy--the right of the people to a free and fair election.   The consensus view of 17 agencies is that Mr. Putin interfered in the  2016 election. For that alone, the United States has more than just  cause to sanction President Putin and the intelligence apparatus he  directs. To date, Mr. Putin and his allies have not suffered serious  repercussions for this stunning breach of our right as a sovereign  nation not to have our elections disturbed by a foreign capital. That  all changes today.   Congress has drafted this sanctions bill to hold Mr. Putin  accountable for his actions and to send a message to him and the rest  of the world that any further attempts to degrade our democracy will  meet further sanctions and action. We will not stand by idly as this is  done.   There is no process more sacred in a democracy than the guarantee of  free and fair elections. That fundamental right was attacked by Mr.  Putin. With this vote, let us finally--finally--officially condemn and  forcefully respond to that attack on our country. Let us send this bill  to the President's desk for his signature.   We still don't know if President Trump will sign this legislation. I  say to my colleagues: If the Congress speaks loudly enough and strongly  enough and we send this bill with a veto-proof majority, it will not  matter what President Trump decides.   Before I yield the floor, I wish to thank my colleagues. At the top  of the list are Senators McCain and Graham, who early on had the idea  to do this. Their strength against transgressions against this country  is wonderful.   I thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He had to  pursue this legislation through ups and downs. He didn't relent, and  here we are today because of his efforts.   I thank his ranking member, Senator Cardin. They are a great  bipartisan team.   Similarly, Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown, again, in a  bipartisan way, not letting partisan politics get in the way--they  passed this legislation.   I would like to thank leader McConnell because when he and I talked  about bringing this legislation to the floor, he didn't blink. He  didn't hesitate. He was forthright and said: Let's do it.   This piece of legislation proves that when this body works the way it  should, when both parties talk to each other, work with each other, and  the committee chairmen and ranking members negotiate legislation  through proper procedure, we can produce good, strong bipartisan  legislation.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention, in this moment of  bipartisanship, the same thing could happen with healthcare.   With that, I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before the  next amendment each side be given 2 minutes.    Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, first on the issue before us, most  Democrats--the vast majority--are for repeal of the Cadillac tax. We  are not for many of the other provisions being put forward. This  requires the two to be tied together. We are for repealing the Cadillac  tax but not harming the healthcare of millions of Americans.   I want to make another point, especially to my friends, Senators  McCain, Graham, Johnson, and Cassidy, who said correctly that the  skinny bill was totally inadequate and they would require assurances  from the House.   Let me first read what Mr. Ryan said: ``If moving forward requires a  conference committee, that is something the House is willing to do.''  That is not worth anything--only if moving forward is required.   But I make another point that makes the case proof positive that this  bill could pass and there is no assurance from the House. The House  Rules Committee. There was a motion to limit the waiver of clause 6(a)  of rule XIII--    I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.    To limit it just for motions to go to conference;  rejected 4 to 9.   If the House was intent on going to conference, they would have voted  for this rule. It means they want to pass this bill, this skinny  repeal, and send it to the President.   I would urge my four colleagues and all the others to vote no until  they get that assurance.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Cornyn  can conclude, but I be given 5 minutes and the Senator from Oregon be  given 5 minutes.    Senator Cornyn is to speak after us.    No. I ask 5 minutes for the Senator from New York, 5 for  the Senator from Oregon, and 5, finally--or however much time the  Senator from Texas wants.    I would simply say to my friend, this is a huge bill. We  have not had a huge amount of time to debate it. We have just seen it  for 2 hours. To ask for another 5 minutes on our side for the ranking  member of Finance, in addition to mine, is not too much to ask.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be  given 5 minutes to the Senator from Oregon, 5 minutes to myself, and,  in conclusion, 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.    Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle for yielding us time.   This august body has been around for over 220 years. It has rules. It  has traditions we are very proud of. In recent years--both parties to  blame--many of those traditions have been eroded. What happens when you  erode the traditions--the bipartisanship, the ability to work through  the regular order--is very simply that the product that emerges is not  very good. There is a reason this body has been the greatest  deliberative body in the world, and it is because it had those  traditions. Now we don't have them.   We have a bill that we have seen for 2 hours. It affects the  healthcare, perhaps the lives--almost certainly the lives--of millions.  It affects the daily lives of men and women and children. We haven't  even had a chance to explore all the ramifications. There is a lot of  anger on the other side at the ACA. I understand that, but you are  repeating what you claim are the same mistakes.   Just as maybe ObamaCare could have been made better if it were a  bipartisan proposal, this one certainly would have been made better.  This skinny repeal, CBO tells us, will kick 15 million people--16  million people--off care. This skinny bill, after all the cries of  reducing premiums as the major reason that ObamaCare needed changes,  will raise premiums 20 percent a year, ad infinitum. The average  working family is going to struggle to get healthcare even more than  they have now.   Why is this being rushed through this way? Why is this being done in  the dark of night? I can't believe my colleagues are proud of it. If  they were, there would be brass bands down the streets of smalltown  America celebrating this bill. That is not what is happening. It is  midnight. Debate is curtailed. We can't amend it in the open. We can't  do what is needed.    So I would plead once more with my colleagues, let's start over. We  are the first to admit that the present law needs some changes. We are  the first to want--maybe having learned our own lessons--that it should  be done in a bipartisan and sharing way. Let's start over.   We can do better. We can do better for all those people who are going  to be hurt. We can do better for the traditions of this great  institution. We can do better as Americans who love our country and  love our democracy and love our process. It is not too late to turn  back from this proposal ideologically driven and do better because we  all are not proud of this product. I don't think there is hardly anyone  in this body who is proud of this product.   Let's make this a turning point, not just on healthcare but in how we  function together. We plead with you, let us commit this bill. Let us  vote against skinny repeal, and let's work together to improve our  healthcare system in the way our Founding Fathers intended us to  improve it.   I yield the floor    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, let me say that it has been a  long, long road for both sides. Each side had sincere convictions, and  we are at this point.   I want to say three things. First, I suggest that we turn the page.  It is time to turn the page.   I say to my dear friend the majority leader that we are not  celebrating. We are relieved that millions and millions of people who  would have been so drastically hurt by the three proposals put forward  will, at least, retain their healthcare, be able to deal with  preexisting conditions, deal with nursing homes and opioids that  Medicaid has paid for.   We are relieved, not for ourselves, but for the American people. But  as I have said over and over again, ObamaCare was hardly perfect. It  did a lot of good things, but it needs improvement. I hope one part of  turning that page is that we go back to regular order, work in the  committees together to improve ObamaCare.   We have good leaders--the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from  Washington, the Senator from Utah, the Senator from Oregon. They have  worked well together in the past and can work well together in the  future. There are suggestions we are interested in that come from  Members on the other side of the aisle--the Senator from Maine and the  Senator from Louisiana.   So let's turn the page and work together to improve our healthcare  system, and let's turn the page in another way. All of us are so  inspired by the speech and the life of the Senator from Arizona, and he  asked us to go back to regular order, to bring back the Senate that  some of us who have been here a while remember. Maybe this can be a  moment where we start doing that.   Both sides will have to give. The blame hardly falls on one side or  the other, but if we can take this moment--a solemn moment--and start  working this body the way it had always worked until the last decade or  so, with both sides to blame for the deterioration, we will do a better  job for our country, a better job for this body, a better job for  ourselves.   Finally, I am glad that the leader asked us to move to NDAA. We need  to do it. I can say that on this side of the aisle, we will move  expeditiously. I know that the Senator from Rhode Island has worked  with the Senator from Arizona on a list of amendments that can be  agreed to, and we can finish this bill up rather quickly. As I  mentioned to the majority leader, there are some other things we can do  rather quickly, including moving a whole lot of nominations.   We can work together. Our country demands it. Every place in every  corner of the country where we go, the No. 1 thing we are asked--and I  know this because I have talked to my colleagues from the other side of  the aisle--is: Can't you guys work together? Let's give it a shot.  Let's give it a shot.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1668         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
