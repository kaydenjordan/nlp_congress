 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I complete my  remarks before we move to the vote to confirm our next Secretary of  Defense.    Mr. President, we are in a great position that we are not  very often in. We have someone who is enthusiastically supported by  Republicans, by Democrats, and he is obviously the right person. He has  the trust of our President, he has the trust of our military, and he  has the trust of Congress and the country to keep our Nation safe.   Dr. Mark Esper is the right man for the job. He is a great choice to  lead the Pentagon, and I am proud to support him. And I am not the only  one. In fact, I would like to take a moment to share some of the  bipartisan support we have for Dr. Esper from the defense experts,  former officials, and my own colleagues.   Senator Kaine from Virginia said this at Dr. Esper's confirmation  hearing:         He is a person of sound character and moral courage. He's       been proactive and transparent . . . trademarks of       exceptional leadership.    Secretary Mattis--you remember him--when Dr. Esper was being sworn in  as the Secretary of the Army, then-Secretary of Defense Mattis said:         The bottom line is the virtuous and vile alike have written       history, but let's remember here today that we're the good       guys . . . and this is the man who can take us forward.    Mark Jacobson, a senior adviser to Ash Carter, said:         This is someone who can work across the aisle. This is       somebody who can work with Congress. And that's really what       defines him. A soldier, a scholar.    The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said:         Anybody impartial would have to have come away impressed by       Dr. Esper's mastery, intelligence, and thoroughness.    My colleagues in the Armed Services Committee also widely support Dr.  Esper's nomination, advancing his nomination with an overwhelming  bipartisan vote.   Across the Capitol, both the chairman and ranking member of the House  Armed Services Committee support Dr. Esper. They all support him.  Chairman Adam Smith said that Dr. Esper is ``capable of executing the  National Defense Strategy in a way that is insulated from outside  influence and political considerations. . . . The Department would  benefit from his leadership.'' That is my counterpart over in the  House.   Ranking Member Mac Thornberry said he has ``done an outstanding job  as Secretary of the Army.'' I agree with Congressman Thornberry.   Under Dr. Esper's leadership, we saw Army modernization leap forward  by leaps and bounds. He managed the largest reorganization of the Army  in 45 years, prioritizing research, development, and innovation. He  showed accountability to the taxpayers by being responsible with his  budget, making tough decisions, tough choices, streamlining legacy  programs, and directing defense dollars to critical future needs.   It is impressive, but being a good Army Secretary isn't enough on its  own. Secretary Mattis reminded us that civilian leaders in our military  must be more than their past accomplishments. Mark Esper is more  because he truly respects and honors his commitment to the men and  women in uniform. I have seen this firsthand.   Back in April, I asked Dr. Esper to join me on a visit to Fort Sill  in my State of Oklahoma. What impressed me was how well he communicated  with the troops in the field. He is one of the troops out there, and  you could see the love that he had for them. In Fort Sill, he even  joined them--and I was there--for an Army combat fitness test workout.  He participated with the troops. He ate the MREs out in the field.  Anyone who has been in the Army can tell  [[Page S4993]]  you that you don't often find people who choose to do that, but Mark  Esper did.   Dr. Esper deeply cares about the troops, whether it is making sure  that they have the weapons, equipment, and training they need to  succeed in their missions or simply that they have quality housing when  they are on base.   We moved quickly to consider Dr. Esper's nomination here on the  floor, but that isn't because we didn't fulfill our duty of advice and  consent. We did. Dr. Esper testified for over 3 hours. Between his  hearing and his followup questions for the record, he answered  approximately 600 questions. It is clear that Dr. Esper has what it  takes to lead the Department of Defense and that most of my colleagues  think so as well.   He has served the Nation with honor and integrity, and I am certain  that he is going to continue to do so when he is confirmed.   I strongly request a strong vote to confirm Dr. Mark Esper to be our  next Secretary of Defense.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
