 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize The  Foxhole of Smiths Grove, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Take a look at any small town American Main Street, and you will  likely see a common trend: small businesses are a bastion of  creativity. All around the country, entrepreneurs break out into new  ventures based on an idea that is uniquely theirs, and they work hard  to support the enterprise that is their dream. Such is the story of  Kellie B. Long and her store, The Foxhole. Founded in 2017, Kellie set  out to open a store that offered a wide variety of items, from clothes  and jewelry, to furnishings and tableware. In the years since her  opening, the store has grown in its product variety, staff capacity,  and customer reach. Though The Foxhole is well-loved by the residents  of Smiths Grove, customers travel from all across Kentucky to peruse  items that could only be found at this unique shop.   When customers walk in the door, they are surrounded by Kellie's  unique vision for what defines beauty and creativity. This entrepreneur  does not rely on products that are freshly made or unused; she curates  a wide array of distinctive items that cannot be found in the typical  clothes or home goods store. Moreover, Kellie appreciates the quality  of a product that has been loved by a previous owner, and she takes  pride in her keen eye for identifying items that deserve to be loved  again. Her store offers products that are notably vintage, along with  lightly used items, as well as the occasional new and custom-made  products. Despite the fact that her store is filled with products that  are hard to find and potentially irreplaceable, Kellie is not shy or  finicky about welcoming all clientele, even making the store dog  friendly for those who cannot part with their pups. Furthermore, Kellie  participates in ``Second-Saturdays,'' which is a communal outdoor  shopping experience for the residents of Smiths Grove. Second-Saturdays  bring out food trucks, vendors, and entertainment for locals to shop,  eat, and enjoy with their neighbors and friends.   Her participation in Second-Saturdays is not the only way Kellie  stays involved in the community. Outside of her regular commercial  activities, The Foxhole offers the occasional Bible study for residents  of Smiths Grove to gather and share in their religion and faith. And  though her Bible study is not a routine part of The Foxhole's  activities, Kellie makes sure to incorporate her giving spirit into the  running of her business. Every year as Americans observe Memorial Day,  Kellie opens up her business to a greater cause, by donating 10 percent  of her Memorial Day weekend sales to the Wounded Warriors project.  Kellie understands that we all have a veteran in our life, and she does  her part in giving back to the community that gave their all.   In addition to their annual sales donations to charity, Kellie is  sensitive to whatever needs may arise from her Kentucky neighbors.  After devastating tornados struck western Kentucky in late 2021, Kelly  donated 21 percent of all of The Foxholes' sales recorded in the last 2  weeks of December to the Bowling Green Tornado relief fund. Kellie  ensures that The Foxhole is a place where customers can find beautiful  and unique items, while promoting community involvement and goodwill to  all who dawn her storefront.   I want to congratulate this upstanding entrepreneur for her  dedication to her community and for her drive to bring creativity and  beauty to her corner of Kentucky. Congratulations to Kellie Long and  the entire team at The Foxhole. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
