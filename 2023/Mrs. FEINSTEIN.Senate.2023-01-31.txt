 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Wildfire Emergency Act, bipartisan legislation that Senators Padilla,  Daines, Wyden, and I are introducing today, to help address the threat  of catastrophic wildfire throughout the West.   Wildfires have always been a part of life in California and other  Western States, but climate change and drier forests have increased the  threat of catastrophic wildfire. The new fire season is nearly year- round, and the wildfires themselves are more destructive as they spread  faster and burn hotter.   The new reality of the wildfire threat requires transformative action  to protect our forests and neighboring communities. Our bill would do  just that, empowering Federal, State, and local land managers to make  both our forests and infrastructure more resilient.  [[Page S175]]    The most recent National Climate Assessment, conducted by leading  scientists from the research community and across the Federal  Government, found that the number of acres burned in the Western United  States is double what would have burned without climate change.   My home State of California knows this all too well as it is the  epicenter of this destructive phenomenon. The top three worst wildfire  seasons in California were all in the last 5 years, including the  largest single wildfire in California history in 2021. Since 2017,  wildfires have burned more than 11 million acres, killed nearly 200  people, and destroyed more than 32,000 homes.   Worryingly, these wildfires are predicted to only grow worse as  climate conditions continue to change, and the Federal Government has  not yet adequately responded. Important investments in wildfire  resilience were included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  and the Inflation Reduction Act, which were enacted in the last  Congress, but stakeholders are nearly unanimous in supporting  additional policy changes to improve the pace and scale of wildfire  resiliency treatments.   At the same time, the urgency of this crisis should not prompt  Congress to vitiate important environmental safeguards. Throughout my  time in the Senate, I have consistently championed the preservation and  careful stewardship of our treasured forests, and this bill will be no  different.   Our Wildfire Emergency Act is the result of a considered approach to  the wildfire crisis and includes feedback from conservationists, public  and private stakeholders, and the U.S. Forest Service.   First, it would provide the U.S. Forest Service with a pilot  authority to leverage private financing options to increase the pace  and scale of forest restoration projects. These projects would involve  a collaborative approach to forest management to ensure that the  forests are protected.   This conservation finance model would be a new way of implementing  forest restoration work, but the principle at its core is that forests  are vital to a healthy environment and populace. Forests provide shade  and wind breaks, stabilize steep mountain slopes, and help purify our  water. These benefits have tangible value, and the financing model we  develop here would make those benefits plain for all to see.   In addition, the bill makes energy resilience a priority across the  Federal Government. It would help develop and fund backup power for  critical infrastructure like drinking water or hospitals, and put a  renewed focus on wildfire detection and monitoring. As vulnerable as  our forests are, it takes just one spark to ignite an entire mountain.  The sooner our firefighters can detect and respond to these fires, the  better our chances of preventing more communities from devastation.   In addition, the bill would provide grants to low-income households  to make fire-resilient upgrades to their homes. Thanks to home  insurance regulatory changes taking place in California, wildfire  retrofits could also help lower insurance premiums and reduce the  financial burden on rural homeowners. The bill would also make grants  available to low-income communities to help involve them in planning  and implementing forest restoration projects on the lands surrounding  their homes.   Lastly, our bill recognizes that the forest management workforce is  also in crisis. The U.S. Forest Service and Department of Interior have  experience chronic staffing shortages in wildland firefighters for  years. And even though the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation  Reduction Act provided historic levels of funding for forest  conservation work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts an overall  decline in the forest conservation workforce in the next 10 years.   To address these issues, our bill would create new funding sources  for forest management education and firefighter training. It would also  establish a prescribed fire training center in the Western United  States, to train the next generation of firefighters and forestry  technicians in the landscapes where their skills are most needed.   The simple reality is that wildfires will continue to happen in the  West. They are an integral part of the West's ecology, even if climate  change has exacerbated their scale and intensity. Our job must be to  prepare for these wildfires to the extent we are able, to use the best  available science to make our forests more resilient, and ensure that  our communities remain safe.   That is why Senators Padilla, Daines, Wyden, and I have introduced  this bill today, and I urge my colleagues to support and pass it as  soon as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Wildfire Emergency Act, bipartisan legislation that Senators Padilla,  Daines, Wyden, and I are introducing today, to help address the threat  of catastrophic wildfire throughout the West.
