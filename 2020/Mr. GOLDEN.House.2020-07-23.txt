 Madam Speaker, the purpose of my amendment is to call  attention to the shortage of VA mental health and substance use  disorder facilities.   For example, veterans in my home State of Maine must travel hundreds  of miles out of State to access long-term treatment facilities. That is  just unacceptable.   A proposed residential unit at the Togus VA hospital in Maine would  provide treatment beds to 24 veterans. But until VA approves this new  construction project, veterans in Maine have few options.   VA needs to ensure long-term inpatient mental healthcare and  substance use disorder services are provided as close to each veteran's  home as possible.   That is why I am proud to have worked with you, Madam Chair, to  secure $20 million above the budget request in the MILCON-VA bill for  medical facilities. I thank the gentlewoman for her strong leadership  on this and also other critically important issues for our Nation's  veterans.   In addition to the extra funding, the bill directs VA to prioritize  construction that expands access to overnight bed space for veterans  seeking mental healthcare.   Moving forward, I ask that the committee continue to push VA for  answers on progress toward boosting inpatient capacity, prioritizing  construction for these lifesaving services.    Madam Speaker, I am not sure who outed me on the  birthday, but I appreciate the well wishes.   Madam Speaker, I thank the subcommittee chairwoman for her strong  support on this issue. This is the second year in a row that the  chairwoman and her committee and the committee staff have supported an  increase like this for inpatient facilities for veterans who are  struggling with mental health  [[Page H3712]]  or substance use issues and need treatment, and I appreciate their  advocacy very much.
