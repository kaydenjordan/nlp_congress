 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules  Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1562 and the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the Warner  substitute at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that the majority  has rejected this request before I can even lay out why I think it is  needed. My request was to take up and pass the filed S. 1562, as  amended.   This legislation is pretty simple, even for this body. It would  require that any Presidential campaign that receives offers of  assistance from an agent of a foreign government have an obligation to  report that offer of assistance to law enforcement--specifically the  FBI.   Remember, our laws already prohibit campaign assistance from foreign  governments. Let's take a moment and see how we got here. I am going to  lay out a little bit of history, and then I am going to ask the  minority leader to make a couple of comments, and then I will come back  and finish my statement. Before I turn it over to the minority leader,  let me refresh my colleagues on the other side and others as to how we  got here.   In 2016, Russia and its agents intervened in our Presidential  election--breaking into personal files, attempting to hack into our  voting system, and using Facebook and Twitter to create fake accounts  to splinter our country.   During the campaign, then-Candidate Trump publicly called on Russia-- that if they had any damaging information on then-Candidate Clinton,  they should release it. Remarkably, that very same day was the first  day Russia started to dribble out its damaging information.   The unanimous consensus of the entire American intelligence  community, the Mueller investigation, and the bipartisan Senate  Intelligence Committee, of which I am proud to be vice chairman--all  have stated that Russia massively intervened in our elections, and they  did so in an attempt to help then-Candidate Trump and hurt Candidate  Clinton.   President Trump's own FBI Director and his Director of National  Intelligence have said that Russia or others will likely be back in  2020 because their tactics in 2016 were both cheap and effective. We  are now 17 months before the 2020 election. I personally believe we are  not prepared.   This body needs to take up bipartisan election security legislation  to ensure there is a paper ballot trail after all the voting in America  so Americans can have trust that the integrity of their votes will be  counted. We need to work together--I know there are many working on  this issue--to put some guardrails on our social media platforms like  Facebook, Twitter, and Google so they are not as easily manipulated by  foreign agents to create fake accounts.   Unfortunately, this White House and this President still don't seem  to appreciate the seriousness of the threat. Mr. Trump continues to  undermine the Mueller report. As a matter of fact, it has been reported  that he won't even convene a Cabinet meeting on election security. His  Homeland Security Secretary was told not to have that meeting because  it might offend the President. Against the advice of his own FBI  Director, who said just in the last 2 weeks--he said yesterday--even in  a world where we have gotten used to outrageous statements coming from  the White House, he said yesterday that he might not report and he  would maybe even welcome Russia or China or other bad actors if they  again offered him assistance in the next campaign.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from New  York, the minority leader, and I agree with him.  [[Page S3623]]    This is really unfortunate timing. I can't imagine--I always thought  that in today's political environment, you always think yesterday's  could be the greatest outrage, but the fact that yesterday, the  President of the United States said--after all that we have gone  through in the last 2\1/2\ years, after all of the evidence of Russian  intervention has been out and vetted, after 140 contacts between  Russian officials and folks affiliated with the Trump campaign or Trump  business operations, you would think there would be a sense of some  level of moral obligation, even if we are not backward-looking, to say  that on a going-forward basis, we ought to make clear that if any  foreign power tries to intervene again in an election, the least we can  do is ask for a requirement to report it to law enforcement.   (Mr. CRAMER assumed the Chair.)   I heard yesterday the President went on and kind of said: Oh, it is  no big thing; everybody does it.   No, Mr. President, everybody doesn't do it.   The Presiding Officer who just left the chair--I have no question in  my mind that if a foreign power tried to intervene in his campaign, he  would report it to law enforcement. All evidence in the past of  attempted foreign intervention--candidates stepped up--it didn't matter  which party--and did the right thing and reported it to law  enforcement.   One of my colleagues on the other side said that they don't want to  relitigate 2016. There will be other times and places to further  litigate whatever happened in 2016. In terms of today, I don't want to,  either. I just want to make sure that we are safe from foreign  intervention in 2020. What is remarkable is that we now live in a world  post-9/11 that dramatically changed things for a whole host of us. We  have a whole series of new--appropriately so--security at our airports.  The mantra at our airports that TSA and Homeland Security always try to  promote is ``If you see something, say something.'' It is not an undue  burden, I think, on the traveling public, and because of that  involvement, I think the airports are safer. Shouldn't we have the same  de minimis standard to protect the integrity of our election system? If  you see something, say something.   All my legislation is requiring is this: If there is indication that  agents of foreign governments are trying to intervene in our elections,  tell law enforcement. Tell the FBI.   I tried to draft my legislation in ways to make sure it wouldn't  involve any of our activities in an official sense. It wouldn't involve  dealings at Embassy parties, and it wouldn't involve contacts in the  normal course.   I would say to my friends on the other side, if there are ways to  improve this legislation to make sure we can reach agreement on what I  have to believe is common agreement here--that we don't want foreign  governments intervening in our Presidential elections--I am wide open  as to how we can change this to make it better. But to say, in the face  of this President's own FBI Director, who has said it would be  important that the FBI have this information about foreign  intervention, and then to have the man sitting in the White House  saying that his own FBI Director is wrong--I would ask my colleagues,  do you agree with Christopher Wray, the FBI Director, about the  importance of law enforcement seeing the evidence of foreign  intervention, or do you believe it is not a big thing? Now I am anxious  to hear a response from my colleagues.   I know there may be questions such as, what about the Steele dossier?  That was somewhat of a foreign intervention, Mark. What about the  Steele dossier?   Well, that was reported to the FBI. It was given to the FBI in the  summer of 2016.   If there are ways we can make sure on a going-forward basis that any  of those foreign-based activities are appropriately reported to law  enforcement, let's have at it. But to say that we don't think this is  important enough or that somehow this issue of the integrity of our  election system shouldn't be debated or shouldn't be taken up to put  protections in place is frankly astonishing.   It is astonishing to me as well that 17 months out from the next  election, we have a White House where there is no one in charge of  election security. We are 17 months out from the next election, and we  have let sit fallow bipartisan election security legislation that would  ensure that there is that paper trail and there is that ability to  audit the actions after the fact so we can make sure Americans have  faith in the integrity of the election system.   It is pretty remarkable that we are 17 months out from the next  election and 3 weeks after we saw manipulation of a video of the  Speaker of the House--that clearly was manipulated--that spread a false  impression around the country and around the world, and we don't have  common agreement on some basic rules of the road so that social media  is not manipulated again in 2020 the way it was in 2016. We only need  to look at how social media manipulation leads to hate and bloodshed in  India and Burma and countries around the world.   Not taking action on these items is the height of irresponsibility.  This most basic of all requirements simply says: If you see something,  say something. If there is foreign intervention, tell the FBI. Let them  make the judgment.   Why would anyone say that is not necessary when we have seen the  recent history in our country, and for that matter, we have seen the  same tactics Russia has used in America used in the Brexit vote and in  the French Presidential elections? Again, I go back to Director of  National Intelligence Coats, who said they will be back, and FBI  Director Wray, who said they will be back, and they need this  information.   I hope that maybe after the weekend, my colleagues on the other side  will reconsider and take up this issue.   I will close with this: I just can't imagine--and I know some of my  colleagues on the other side have already started to speak out, and I  appreciate that. I appreciate their speaking out at a time when there  is huge fear of the White House and this President's willingness to  take vendettas out against anyone who raises a voice in opposition.   Think for a moment. Think for just a moment about what Donald Trump  said yesterday from the Oval Office. A President's words from the Oval  Office still carry weight. The President of the United States said:  Well, everybody does this. So he would take a look at assistance that  might come from Russia or China or some other adversary nation. My  goodness gracious. The modern father of the Republican Party, Ronald  Reagan, must be spinning in his grave.   Again, Mr. President, I am not here to relitigate 2016. I am here to  make sure that we do our job, that we honor that oath to protect and  defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I  don't know about you, but I would call the actions of Russia over the  last few years the actions of a foreign enemy.   We also have an obligation to make sure we protect the integrity of  our election system. So let's take off the Republican and Democratic  hats for a few minutes, and let's go ahead and pass election security  legislation. Let's go ahead and put some basic guardrails around social  media so we are not manipulated in future elections. Let's make sure we  go ahead and put an obligation on all Presidential campaigns going  forward that if they see evidence of foreign intervention, they report  it appropriately to the FBI and law enforcement.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I hope to reserve  the right, if my colleague from Tennessee is going to respond to my  comments, to have a chance to respond to her comments as well.    I see the Senator from the Finance Committee is here. I  will not take but a couple of moments.   I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Tennessee. She agrees  we ought to make sure there is not foreign intervention in our  elections. That ought to be a fairly easy thing to agree to.   I want to point out that her reading of my legislation is not  accurate. The only thing that would have to be reported is if an agent  of a foreign government or foreign national offered something that was  already prohibited, not a foreign national wanting to volunteer on a  campaign. We already laid out prohibited activities that violate the  law. The only action reported would be those actions that are  prohibited.   Again, I will take my colleague at her word. If there are ways to  improve on this legislation, I am wide open for business.   I think in past elections, she is right. She ran for Governor. My  friend from Iowa has run for a lot of elections. I think most of us in  this Chamber would never think about taking help from a foreign  government. If there are ways to work better, I welcome it.   We are only here having this discussion and debate because, in a lot  of ways, the rules of the game changed in 2016. A foreign power,  Russia, caught our government, our political system, and our companies  totally off guard. They hacked into the Democratic National Committee's  individuals' personal accounts.   I would remind the Presiding Officer of the very day then-Candidate  Trump said on national television during the campaign: If the Russians  have dirt on Hillary, bring it on. It was the very first day the  intelligence community, the Mueller report, and our bipartisan Senate  Intelligence Committee found out that the Russians actually took him at  his word and started releasing information to him that day.   I think the integrity of our election system is terribly important.  Russians tried to penetrate 50 States and got into 21 of them. I think  they could have changed totals if they wanted to. They chose not to  that year.   We have done better in 2018, but I think we can even do more and,  again, only for States that want to take additional Federal assistance.  That has been the working arrangement with our colleagues from the  other side. I know very few folks who wouldn't say that with the  ability to have systems hacked into--that are as much different today  than it was 20 years ago--having that paper trail after the fact makes  a lot of sense. Let's agree to work on that.   We have this whole new beast of social media companies out there that  provide a lot of good, but we have seen in repeated ways that they can  be manipulated. What we saw in 2016 is going to pale in comparison with  the advent of deepfake and other serious incidents. We got caught off  guard. We should not be caught off guard in 2020.   I filed this legislation a month ago because I thought we needed to  be absolutely clear going forward. The reason for the immediacy of this  legislation proposed, and why it is so necessary, is because the  President of the United States, yesterday, from the Oval Office, said  that everybody in politics takes input from foreign governments. He  left everybody with that impression. I don't. I absolutely believe the  Senator from Iowa doesn't. He said, even after all that has happened in  the last 2\1/2\ years, that if Russia or China or other countries  intervene again, he might take that information, take that assistance  again.   Our country is better than that. Our democracy is more important than  a willingness to be traded away for the short-term political gain of  being in cahoots with a foreign power. I am not saying that has  happened, but, boy oh boy, what an invitation we made yesterday to  folks, as the Senator from Tennessee just indicated, who don't wish us  well.  [[Page S3625]]    If there are ways to improve on this legislation, I am wide open for  that, but if we don't put in place an obligation that is up-to-date and  a moral obligation that I think we have all honored, if we don't put in  place a legal obligation to make sure that if you see evidence of  foreign intervention, you report it, then shame on us.   I will close with this. We do it at the airport--you see something,  say something. Shouldn't we have at least those same standards, in  terms of protection of our critical democracy, going forward?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
