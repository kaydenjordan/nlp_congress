 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for all his hard  work on the NDAA. I fully support this measure.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of en bloc 1 which includes  my two amendments, amendment No. 29 that creates an Afghan refugee  special envoy position and amendment No. 117 that requires the  Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that all women veterans  receive quality healthcare in a safe and dignified manner and on a  timely basis.   The Afghan refugee position assures that our allies who fought  alongside American soldiers for 20 years receive the support that they  need to resettle in the United States and are integrated into our great  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support amendments en bloc 1  and to support my amendments, No. 29 and No. 117.
