 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the brilliant  life of Louis O'Neil Dore.   Dore was everything the Lowcountry could ask for in a hometown hero.  Born in Beaufort in 1945, he attended Morehouse College and worked  three jobs to put himself through college. After graduating, he  returned home to teach high school and helped guide the desegregation  of Beaufort's school system. He eventually obtained his law degree at  the University of Georgia, where he was one of only four Black  Americans in his class.   Dore was a tireless advocate for civil rights and a champion of  voting rights, education, and improved health standards for the people  of the Lowcountry. Dore served as the legal officer for the Beaufort- Jasper-Hampton Comprehensive Health Services, fighting for the rights  of Black doctors to treat patients in Beaufort and Jasper Counties.   As chairman of the South Carolina Board of Education, Dore worked  with leaders and legislators to pass the Education Improvement Act of  1984, which is considered some of the most comprehensive education  reform legislation of its time.   Throughout the course of his life, Dore would return home to Beaufort  to break historic ground, including becoming the first Black lawyer to  be named partner at a South Carolina firm.   I know that I speak for the entire State when I say that Louis Dore  is one of the greats, and we are honored that he shaped our history.                            ____________________
