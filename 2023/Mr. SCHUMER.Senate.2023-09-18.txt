 Madam President, the lesson of the past few years has  been that bipartisanship is key to getting things done in the Senate,  even in these divided times.   A few months ago, bipartisan majorities in both Chambers passed an  agreement on appropriations top lines for the fiscal year 2024 and  avoided a catastrophic default, which would have been so damaging to  America.   Since then, Senate appropriators, led by Chair Patty Murray and Vice  Chair Susan Collins, have drafted legislation honoring this bipartisan  agreement. It took months of work and a lot of compromise, but all 12  appropriations bills have made it through the committee, all of them  bipartisan and many with unanimous support. Nobody got everything they  wanted, but disagreements did not stymie progress.   So, again, bipartisanship is getting things done. That has been  proven over and over again in recent years. But the reverse is also  true. When a small band of Senators chooses partisanship over  progress--when they mimic the chaos of the House Freedom Caucus--it  threatens the good work of this Chamber.   That is what happened last Thursday, when one Senator's objections  prevented us from moving forward with the appropriations process. One  Member, mimicking the House Freedom Caucus, has derailed the Senate and  prevented us from considering amendments, including Republican  amendments.   It is a reminder that in both Chambers a small band of hard-right  Republicans are dead set on grinding down the gears of government. For  these MAGA Republicans, it is as if gridlock is a virtue and  cooperation a crime.   I ask this small group of Senate Republicans: What happened to  wanting to do appropriation bills regular order?   We said we would allow amendments. We have put a minibus on the floor  with the cooperation and guidance of Senate Republican appropriators.  These stunts of this very small band  [[Page S4544]]  only serve to undermine regular order in the first place and fly in the  face of what our Republican colleagues asked us to do.   That is the danger of MAGA extremism. It is incapable of governing.  It only produces chaos. It is so bad that, last week, MAGA extremists  in the House prevented even a defense bill--even a defense bill--from  moving forward. It is a scary pattern we are seeing emerge with some on  the hard right: extremism at all costs, even at the cost of our  national defense. I urge my Republican colleagues to resist and reject  these hard-line attempts to derail the Senate's work.   A great majority of Senators from both parties want to see us move  forward. In the coming days, I will work with my colleagues on getting  the appropriations process back on track so we can finish processing  these appropriation bills and get us one step closer to funding the  government, because we all know, if the government shuts down, it will  hurt millions and millions and millions of Americans who did nothing at  all.                            Continuing Resolution    Madam President, on the CR, September 30 is only 12 days away. If  bipartisanship is allowed to work, we can avoid a government shutdown  before then. Sadly, things in the House are not off to a good start.  Last night, House GOP Members released what they called a deal for a CR  but in reality reads like a hard-right screed. Instead of working with  Democrats to keep government open, House Republicans want to cut  virtually all nondefense spending by a devastating 8 percent--8  percent--8 percent cuts to law enforcement, cancer research, and other  critical priorities. Not one penny is dedicated to the President's  disaster relief request, despite the anguish in so many States. No  health extenders are included, no attempt to reauthorize the FAA.   And with no Ukraine funding, the proposal is an insult to Ukraine and  a gift to Putin. I cannot think of a worse welcome for President  Zelenskyy, who visits us this week, than this House proposal, which  ignores Ukraine entirely.   Last night's proposal in the House can be boiled down to two words:  slapdash, reckless--slapdash because it is not a serious proposal for  avoiding a shutdown and reckless because, if passed, it would cause  immense harm to so many priorities that help the American people.  Again, this Freedom Caucus wish list is not a serious proposal for  avoiding a government shutdown and, if passed, would never have enough  votes to make it through the Senate.   To his credit, the Speaker knows a shutdown would be a terrible  outcome. When I spoke with him in late July, we had a very encouraging  conversation about the need for bipartisanship to avoid a shutdown. We  both recognized that a bipartisan CR would be the way forward. Two  months later, a bipartisan CR is still the only answer for avoiding a  government shutdown.   I urge Speaker McCarthy, as well as reasonable House Republicans, to  resist the 30 or so extremists within their ranks who seem dead set on  provoking a crisis. The House Freedom Caucus cannot be allowed to bully  the rest of the House into submission, as hard as they might try.   Time is short to finish the job. If both sides embrace  bipartisanship, a shutdown will be avoided. If the hard right is given  a license to run the show, a shutdown is almost inevitable. It is that  simple.                          United Auto Workers Strike    Madam President, now, on the UAW strike, today, the United Auto  Workers enters its fourth day on strike for better wages, health  benefits, and safer working conditions.   America wouldn't be what it is today without strong unions like the  UAW. The UAW helped build and strengthen the middle class, and, for  decades, the UAW has been a leader in the fight for workers' rights and  fair labor standards. So it is no surprise that the UAW is once again  leading the way with this historic strike on the big three car  companies.   The UAW's demands to these companies are simple: better pay, better  benefits, better working conditions. Surely, that is not too much to  ask of these car companies, which brought in record profits over the  last few years. The workers helped create those profits. They are  largely the reason there are such profits, and now, they deserve to get  some of the benefits.   I stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters at the UAW, and I  urge the big three car companies to bargain in good faith to quickly  reach a new contract that is fair and equitable for workers.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, in a moment, Senator Murray will move  to suspend rule XVI and file cloture on that motion. This is an effort  to move forward on the minibus and keep the appropriations process on  track here in the Senate.   It is unfortunate that one Member who does not represent the views of  most Senators prevented us from moving forward last week, but I believe  a majority of Senators want to keep moving forward.   Our Republican colleagues have asked for regular order, and we have  worked with them to let that happen. It was with the cooperation and  guidance of Republican appropriators that we brought these three  appropriations bills to the floor, and we have said we will allow  amendments.   In short, we are doing what our Republican colleagues have properly  asked for--pursuing regular order. So I hope Senators from both sides  will vote to allow the appropriations process to continue.   A deep debt of gratitude and thank you for the hard work to Chair  Murray, Vice Chair Collins, and appropriators on both sides of the  aisle.                          Withdraw Motion to Commit    Madam President, I withdraw my motion to commit H.R. 4366 to the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam President, I move to commit the bill, H.R. 4366,  to the Appropriations Committee with instructions to report back  forthwith with an amendment.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 347, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 348, which was submitted  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 334.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  10 a.m. on Tuesday, September 19; that following the prayer and pledge,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  to resume consideration of the Oliver nomination postcloture; further,  that all time be considered expired at 11:30 a.m. and following the  cloture vote on the Lin nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m.  to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; that if cloture is invoked on  the Lin nomination, all time be considered expired at 2:15 p.m. and  that upon disposition of the Lin nomination, the Senate resume  legislative session and the consideration of H.R. 4366; finally, that  if any nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:07 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, September 19, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
