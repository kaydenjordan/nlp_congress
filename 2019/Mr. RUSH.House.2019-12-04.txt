 Madam Speaker, it goes without saying that the love and  respect that I have for my colleague from the Seventh Congressional  District of Illinois, my good friend Congressman Danny K. Davis, a man  who is such an inspiration to us all, a man who is steadfast in all  that is good as it relates to what an elected official and public  servant should look like, should be like, should walk like, and,  hopefully, if they are giving it, should talk like, speak like. If we  all could have the voice of Congressman Davis, we would be much better  off. But if we can't have his voice, maybe we can aspire to the heart  that Congressman Davis possesses.   Madam Speaker, I am here this afternoon, as I have been many years  now, speaking from the well of this Congress in this institution that  is the envy of all governments throughout the world.   I am here for one purpose today and one purpose only, and that is to  commemorate the life of a young man who was killed on this very day,  December 4, in 1969. His murder was not an accident. His murder was  planned by the highest levels of law enforcement in our Nation.   Madam Speaker, the Federal Bureau of Investigation collaborated on,  conspired on, and coordinated the assassination of Frank Hampton and  Mark Clark. Fred's and Mark's assassinations, if not the only, were two  of a few instances of proven political assassination by police forces  or law enforcement agencies of this country.   I say that because toxicologists' reports concluded after the autopsy  on the body of Fred Hampton that he had the barbiturate Seconal in his  body. He had been drugged with Seconal. They said he had enough Seconal  in his body to immobilize an elephant.  [[Page H9250]]    They came into that apartment, Madam Speaker, on a cold December  morning at 4:30 a.m. Nobody was moving on the streets. They came into  the West Side community camouflaged in Commonwealth Edison trucks.                                time  1500    They came into that community with machine guns, with a definite  purpose of killing Fred Hampton and anybody else who was in that  apartment.   They came using public utility trucks, not marked police cars, but  trucks that would not look out of place at that hour in the morning.   They knocked on the door when they got to that apartment. Half the  police officers went to the front door. Half went to the rear door.   They knocked on the door, and Mark Clark, who was in the apartment,  asked, ``Who is it?'' at 4:30 in the morning. He got a response from  one of the police officers, who answered by saying, ``Tommy.'' When he  said, ``Tommy,'' he came in shooting.   When they heard the first round of gunfire at the front door, the  other half of the raiding team, the assassination team, came in through  the rear door, shooting also.   There were 12 people in that apartment, including the pregnant wife  of Fred Hampton, who was asleep in the bed with him. He had been  drugged. She didn't know that he was drugged.   He came home late that evening, had a meal. Fred loved Kool-Aid. His  Kool-Aid was laced with the aforementioned Seconal.   They came in shooting from the front of that apartment and the back,  the rear of that apartment.   Someone, a Panther on the inside by the name of Louis Truelock,  shouted out: Stop shooting. Stop shooting. There is a pregnant woman in  here.   The shooting stopped. A patrolman by the name of Daniel Groth went  into that apartment where Fred had been shot, blood all over the  mattress. They heard two other shots of gunfire from a handgun. Groth  came out and said: ``He is good and dead now.''   This was a political hit by the FBI, by the Chicago Police  Department, by the Cook County State's attorney.   Why did they kill Fred? Why was this 21-year-old young man such a  threat that the law enforcement agencies of this entire Nation would  conspire to murder him and drug him? Because Fred Hampton was a young  man who had remarkable, extraordinary gifts.   He was a charismatic individual. He could speak and was considered a  great orator for his time and for his age. He could move masses through  his charisma and through the strength of his conviction and ideas and  through his courage.   Fred Hampton, at age 21, was a leader of men and women. Adults  followed him. But more than anything else, Fred Hampton was a man who  everybody knew said what he meant and meant what he said.   There was a conspiracy, an assassination, a political assassination  because the FBI, Edward Hanrahan, the Cook County State's Attorney's  Office, and the Chicago Police Department knew that Fred had been  convicted of armed robbery. They said he had held up a Good Humor ice  cream truck and took $71 of ice cream on a hot August day and had given  the ice cream sandwiches, ice cream bars, and Dreamsicles away to the  children in the community because it was so hot.   That is what he was convicted of. He was sentenced to 5 years in  prison for stealing, according to them, $71 worth of ice cream.   He had been out on appeal, and his appeal had been denied. The FBI,  State's attorneys, Edward Hanrahan, and the Chicago Police Department  knew that on December 13, some 9 days later, Fred was going to report  back to the Illinois Department of Corrections to finish off his  sentence. They knew that Fred would not be on the streets.   Why did they kill him? Because of his courage, his charisma, his  commitment. Fred was committed, not just to Black people, and he was  committed to Black people, but to all poor people.   Fred used to say that you cannot kill racism with racism. You kill  racism with racial solidarity.   Madam Speaker, on this day, the 50th anniversary of the murder of  Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, I remember so well so many things that  Fred said, and one thing that he said really stands out to me on this  very day. He used to say: ``You can kill a revolutionary, but you can't  kill a revolution.''   Madam Speaker, that ought to mean something to this body because no  matter where we are today, this body, this United States of America,  was founded on the premise of a revolution.   Fred was right. Revolution continues even to this day. Fred's blood  still is producing fruit. Congressman Davis mentioned it. Look at the  people who were inspired by Fred and his ultimate sacrifice:   Harold Washington, elected the first African American mayor of the  city of Chicago, in direct response to the murder of Fred Hampton and  Mark Clark and the wounding of seven other Panthers;   Carol Moseley Braun, the first female African American U.S. Senator  in the history of this Nation;    And the mayors from Baltimore to Seattle to New York and other places  inspired by Harold Washington's election, which was inspired and which  was founded on the blood of Fred Hampton.   All these things would not have existed had Fred not given his life  for the cause of freedom, justice, and equality.   Yes, Madam Speaker, even the 44th President of the United States,  Barack Obama, Fred Hampton's life was given so that Barack Obama could  come from Chicago, from the State of Illinois, and become a U.S.  Senator and then the President of the United States.   Even now, young protest groups, Black Lives Matter and others, were  founded on the premise of and came into existence because of the blood  of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.   Madam Speaker, I am here today because he was my friend. He was my  colleague. I remember December the 4th, 1969. I couldn't sleep last  night because my mind kept going back to 1969, the calls that I got,  waiting in the basement of an apartment, listening to news radio,  trying to figure out what really was going on, what was happening.   I identified Fred's body in the morgue that very morning, later that  morning. I remember going to the morgue and identifying Fred's body. I  identified his body.   They came to my apartment the very next morning. I was supposed to  have been in the same apartment with Fred on December 4. The very next  morning, at 5 a.m., they came to my apartment looking for me. I had  gone underground.   If I hadn't been in that apartment with my wife and my children, if  we hadn't been in that apartment, I wouldn't be here today, speaking in  the well of this Congress.   ``You can kill a revolutionary, but you can't kill a revolution.''
