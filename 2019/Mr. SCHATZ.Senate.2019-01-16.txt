 Madam President, I have a simple request for my  Republican colleagues, and that is this: Open the government. Open the  government. There have been too many people suffering for too long for  this to go on any further.   One of those people is named Scott Pekalib. He lives in Hilo, HI, and  works for the U.S. Geological Survey. He has had a rough few months.   In October, his husband Jay went into the hospital for a routine  surgery that went horribly wrong. He went into cardiac arrest and was  in an induced coma for several days. He had to be flown to another  island to receive the care that was necessary. Scott and Jay spent all  of their savings to get through this ordeal. After paying for medicine,  hotels, and airfare, they were living paycheck to paycheck.   Now, because of this government shutdown, Scott's paycheck reads  zero. He doesn't know how he is going to buy gas to take his husband to  the doctor or how they are going to pay the bills that are due. Scott  is making impossible choices between buying the prescription drugs he  needs and the ones that his husband needs. All of this pain and  suffering is because the Senate will not vote to reopen the government.   So I ask my Republican friends to call for a vote, and if the  President vetoes the bill, let's act like a separate, coequal branch of  government and override that veto. That is our prerogative in the  United States, and that is our obligation in the U.S. Senate--to do  what is best for the Nation, for the health, safety, and economic  security of all of our constituents.   Let's reopen the government.   I yield the floor.
