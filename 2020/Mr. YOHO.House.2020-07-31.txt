 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Jose Arce. He  is poised to make history for being the first person from Puerto Rico  to be elected to the post of the American Veterinary Medical  Association as president.   Dr. Arce was born and raised in Puerto Rico. He is a 1997 graduate of  the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine. Dr. Arce returned to Puerto Rico  and now is president and co-owner of Miramar Animal Hospital in San  Juan, where he practices with his wife, Dr. Anik Puig, who also is a  veterinarian.   Jose has been an active member in the field of veterinary medicine,  holding many positions in its leadership, from adviser to the board of  directors of the American Veterinary Medical Foundation.   The AVMA is fortunate to have such a passionate advocate  representative of the profession. His election to the president of the  AVMA will inspire people from all backgrounds and heritage and show  that if you are willing to dream and dream big, and you are willing to  work, those dreams come true. That, and he, are the essence of the  American Dream.                            ____________________
