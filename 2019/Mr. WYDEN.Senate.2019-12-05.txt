 Mr. President, I along with Finance Committee member  Senator Cassidy are introducing a bill to make a common-sense, low-cost  change to the law that will help American workers help themselves when  preparing for retirement: The Know Your Social Security Act. This bill  is simple: it clarifies the law about Congressional intent so that  every worker over 25 receives a Social Security statement in the mail  each year, unless the worker has accessed their statement online or  declined to receive the statement in the mail.   The history of the Social Security statement runs right through the  Senate and the ``powerful'' Committee on Finance. Senator Daniel  Patrick Moynihan summed up the intent very well: ``All of us pay into  Social Security but rarely, until we become beneficiaries, do we ever  hear from Social Security . . . . in every paycheck, we see money  withheld for Social Security, but we hear nary a word from the Social  Security Administration. Let us take this simple step [sending  statements] to reassure Americans that Social Security will be there  for them.'' The Social Security statement has three goals: to provide  workers with information about their Social Security benefits, to help  workers plan for the future, and enable workers to review their  earnings records.   After enactment and once fully phased in, every worker aged 25 and  older received an annual statement from Social Security starting in the  year 2000. After a few years, Social Security's website allowed workers  to obtain a Social Security statement online. At the time, the online  option was a good step forward in customer service. But as sometime  happens, advances in technology shortchanged good intentions. Due to  tight budgets, SSA came to view the online option as  [[Page S6891]]  ``providing'' the worker with a statement and fulfilling their  responsibilities under the law. SSA stopped mailing the statements in  2011 in order to shift resources towards other priorities. Currently,  only individuals over the age of 60 who are not receiving benefits  receive statements through the mail.   Paper statements delivered through the mail are desirable because no  action is necessary by the worker and the statement is a yearly  reminder to the worker to think about the future. Research has shown  that workers provided with statements are significantly more likely to  save, more certain about their retirement income, and have higher  satisfaction with their finances relative to those who are not provided  with any type of financial planning materials. Providing Social  Security statement through the mail is a simple policy that could help  many workers, hopefully leading to better decisions about their  financial future.   Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman John Larson and  Ways and Means Committee Member Vern Buchanan are introducing the  companion bill in the House of Representatives. We have received  letters of endorsement from AARP, the Coalition for Paper Options,  Justice in Aging, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security  and Medicare, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Social Security Works, The  Arc of the United States and The Senior Citizens League. I ask that the  letters be included in the Record following my remarks.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us and cosponsor the  Know Your Social Security Act. Together, we can work towards better  retirement outcomes for all Americans.                                                           AARP,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Wyden and Senator Cassidy: On behalf of       our nearly 38 million members and all older Americans       nationwide, AARP is pleased to endorse the Know Your Social       Security Act. This bipartisan bill would once again place       vital, paper Social Security statements in the hands of       millions of Americans, to help them more effectively plan for       retirement, identify fraud and correct earnings records, and       better understand their stake in Social Security.        The Social Security statement is an essential financial       planning tool that provides key information on an       individual's earnings and payroll tax contributions record,       as well as an estimate of their earned monthly benefits. When       Social Security sends this statement through the mail, more       Americans are able to better plan for their future, not only       due to an increased understanding of their Social Security       benefits, but also any gaps in their current retirement plan.       Having a hard copy of your Social Security statement also       allows an individual to spot and correct errors or even to       detect outright fraud. Finding and correcting these errors in       a timely manner will save workers and the Social Security       Administration frustration, time and money. Finally, when       Americans receive an annual statement in the mail, it helps       them better understand the importance of Social Security as       part of their overall retirement plan. Paper statements are       annual reminders, especially to younger workers, that they       have contributed to Social Security and have earned a stake       in the program.        AARP believes strongly that all Americans, unless they opt-      out, should have access to their Social Security statements       via mail. We are pleased to endorse the Know Your Social       Security Act to once again place vital, paper statements in       the hands of millions of Americans.

Hon. John Larson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Larson, Buchanan and Senators Wyden       and Cassidy: The Coalition for Paper Options--an alliance of       consumer organizations, labor unions, rural advocates, and       print communications industry leaders is pleased to support       today's introduction of the bipartisan Know Your Social       Security Act. Introduced in both the House and Senate, the       bill would require the Social Security Administration to       reinstate the mailing of annual Statement of Earnings until       such time as a wage earner establishes an on line account.        The annual Statement, which summarizes each wage earner's       recorded earnings and projects future retirement benefits,       has been hailed as one of the most important financial       planning tools that most Americans will ever see, yet the       Social Security Administration stopped sending these       statements to workers in 2017 without any congressional       oversight. A report released in February 2019 by the Social       Security Administration's Inspector General highlights a       tremendous decline in overall access since the primarily       online-only policy took place.        The Know Your Social Security Act would reinstate the       mailing of the Statements until a wage earner accesses their       account through the my Social Security online portal. This       would allow the Social Security Administration to economize       as online participation grows, but it would not force       citizens into online access before they choose or are able to       manage it.        CPO's diverse network of allies includes: Consumer Action,       Social Security Works, the National Consumers League, the       National Grange, the National Association of Letter Carriers,       as well as leading organizations in the paper and print       communications industry is pleased to endorse this important       legislation and offer our full support.            Regards,                                                       John Runyan,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                 Justice in Aging,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2019.        Dear Representatives Larson and Buchanan, and Senators       Wyden and Cassidy: Justice in Aging endorses the bipartisan       Know Your Social Security Act, which would reaffirm SSA's       obligation to send Social Security statements by mail to all       workers each year. This legislation would clarify SSA's duty       and ensure that workers understand the Social Security       benefits they are earning over time.        Many people are not fully aware of the level of Social       Security benefits they could receive when they retire, nor do       they realize the Social Security benefits available for       themselves and their family members in the event that they       experience a disability that limits their capacity to work,       or in the event that they pass away leaving a spouse, young       children, or other eligible survivors. The Know Your Social       Security Act would provide this important information, as       required, to ensure that workers know what benefits are       available to them and their loved ones, allowing them to       better plan for retirement as they age.        We believe it is not only SSA's obligation to send these       statements, but that it is vital to the well-being of workers       who need to be fully informed about their potential Social       Security benefits in order to make decisions about their own       working lives, and their retirement. While those who choose       to get this information electronically and decline a paper       statement have clearly demonstrated their awareness of the       benefits they may receive in the future, others who do not       make this choice should receive the statement in the mail as       required under the law. For these reasons, Justice in Aging       supports this bill.            Sincerely,                                                  Tracey Gronniger,      Director of Economic Security.                                   ____                                     National Committee to Preserve,                                      Social Security & Medicare,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2019.      Hon. John B. Larson,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security, Committee on Ways           and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy, M.D.,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Larson, Congressman Buchanan, Ranking Member       Wyden and Senator Cassidy: On behalf of the millions of       members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve       Social Security and Medicare, I am writing to endorse your       bill, the Know Your Social Security Act. This important       legislation requires the Social Security Administration to       resume annual mailing of Social Security statements to all of       the estimated 150 million American workers who are eligible       to receive them, and have not otherwise accessed them through       their My SSA account.        For nearly a decade now, SSA has unilaterally nullified       section 1143 of the Social Security Act by refusing to mail       annual statements to workers, even though section 1143 is       unambiguously clear that such statements are required. The       Know Your Social Security Act clarifies that mailings are       required, a measure that is deeply appreciated by our       members.        The Social Security statement is one of the many enduring       legacies left to the nation by one of its most distinguished       lawmakers, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. He       regarded the statement as a simple and efficient way of       building public  [[Page S6892]]       support and understanding for Social Security. Not       surprisingly, Senator Moynihan's simple, common sense       amendment worked as intended while SSA was producing the       statements each year. In fact, the bipartisan Social Security       Advisory Board of 10 years ago found that SSA's own survey       data showed ``. . . a link between increasing public       confidence and receipt of a statement. People who receive a       statement not only experience higher knowledge of Social       Security than non-recipients, but also exhibit greater       confidence that the program still will be there for them when       they need it.''        The statement also raises workers' awareness of the need       for retirement planning by focusing attention on their future       retirement income. It brings clarity to an often confusing       and perplexing subject by providing a starting point: the       individual's estimated Social Security benefits, whether       retirement, survivors or disability insurance. From there,       workers can determine how much more they need to save for the       future. Because the statements were intended to reach people       early in their working lives, they provided an invaluable       service.        Another important function of the Social Security       statement, if it were to be delivered annually as Congress       intended, would be to enable workers to determine the       accuracy of the wage records maintained by SSA for each       worker. As the statement indicates, workers are encouraged to       review the chart showing their reported wages, comparing the       amounts reflected on SSA's records with information from the       worker's own records. Workers are further advised that only       they can perform this function and that they should report       discrepancies to SSA as soon as possible.        We have been especially concerned that, with the suspension       of statements to all but those who are approaching retirement       age, few workers have been able to check the accuracy of       SSA's wage records. The annual statement, when it was being       provided, helped to assure that if errors were made in the       reporting of wages that they could be quickly discovered and       corrected while the required evidence would still be readily       at hand. Since SSA has suspended the statements now for       nearly a decade, we are concerned that many errors in SSA's       records will go undetected and that some workers' benefits       will be reduced as a result.        As mentioned earlier, one function performed by annual       distribution of Social Security statements was to inform       workers of the kinds of benefits that are provided by Social       Security. The statements focused on retirement, survivors,       and disability benefits. In other words, the statements were       an invaluable annual tutorial of what Social Security is all       about. And knowledge about Social Security is vitally       important to the successful functioning of the program. We       see that reflected in recent work that finds that one reason       for the seemingly inexplicable recent decline in disability       applications is related to the suspension of the statements.       Clearly, restoration of annual production and mailing of the       annual statements, as is required in the Know Your Social       Security Act, is long overdue.        When it was being mailed to all eligible workers, the       Social Security statement was able to play a critical role in       building and strengthening public confidence in Social       Security. It provided workers with the only meaningful pre-      retirement information that they ever received about the       program and the benefits they could expect when they retire       or otherwise qualify for benefits. SSA's decision to end       annual mailings has harmed many workers. It is time for SSA       to undo this harmful decision and to follow the clear,       unambiguous requirements of the law to mail statements to all       eligible workers. We applaud you for your leadership in       introducing the Know Your Social Security Act, and look       forward to working with you to enact this important measure.            Sincerely,                                                      Max Richtman,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                    Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Senate Finance Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Larson,      Chairman, Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Ways and Means Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Wyden and Cassidy, Chairman Larson and       Representative Buchanan: Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)       is pleased to support the Know Your Social Security Act. PVA       is the nation's only Congressionally chartered veterans       service organization solely dedicated to representing       veterans with spinal cord injuries and/or disorders. Many of       our members are among the nine million veterans who receive       Social Security retirement or disability benefits. Others are       among the millions of veterans and military service members       and their families who will at some point in their lives       benefit from the system.        For many years, the Social Security Administration (SSA)       issued paper earnings and benefits statements that helped to       inform people about their status under Social Security and       what they might expect to receive in retirement or in the       event of a catastrophic disability. When SSA suspended that       practice in favor of disseminating the statements only       online, it meant that people who lack internet access or who       prefer not to set up an internet account lost access to that       information. These Americans are then denied knowing about       what they have accumulated on their earnings record, what       their retirement benefits might be, what they might receive       in spousal benefits, or the fact they qualify for disability       or survivor benefits.        As we understand, your bill will clarify that the existing       requirement in the Social Security Act for SSA to provide an       annual Social Security Statement means providing this       document by mail. The bill also clarifies that SSA may       provide an on-demand electronic statement when an individual       chooses electronic delivery. Furthermore, the bill stipulates       that SSA has met its requirement to mail an annual statement       if individuals have accessed their statements electronically       in the prior year and have declined to receive their       statements by mail for that year.        This will be a very helpful measure for millions of       Americans. PVA thanks you for introducing the Know Your       Social Security Act and urges Congress to do all it can to       quickly pass this bipartisan legislation this year.            Sincerely,                                                 Heather Ansley,                                       Associate Executive Director,      Government Relation.                                   ____                                            Social Security Works,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Larson,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Wyden, Senator Cassidy, Chairman Larson, and       Representative Buchanan: We strongly endorse your new       legislation, the Know Your Social Security Act. Your bill       clarifies the important law Congress passed in 1989 requiring       the Social Security Administration (SSA) to mail Social       Security earnings statements to those earning benefits with       every paycheck.        When the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan introduced       the original earnings statement legislation in 1988, he       explained one of the reasons mailing these statements is so       crucial:        ``All of us pay into Social Security but rarely, until we       become beneficiaries, do we ever hear from Social Security .       . . every month, in every paycheck, we see money withheld for       Social Security, but we hear nary a word from the Social       Security Administration. Let us take this simple step       [mailing Social Security earnings statements] to reassure       Americans that Social Security will be there for them . . .''        Social Security earnings statements help families plan for       the future. The statements educate and inform working       families of the kinds of benefits they are earning.       Crucially, they allow workers to identify and correct their       earnings records in a timely way, when mistakes are made.        Your wise legislation clarifies that these vital statements       are to be mailed automatically each year. Distressingly, more       and more private and public services are being shifted to       individuals. This should not happen with Social Security. As       technology continues to progress, there is a tendency for       administrators to lean more on its capabilities and move       communications with consumers and constituents online.       Electronic communication is, no doubt, desired in many       situations. However, the most important financial documents,       including the Social Security earnings statements, should       default to postal mail as intended by the original law.        That the earnings statements be mailed is vital for       everyone, including those who have access to high speed       computing. Of course, not everyone even has this kind of       access. For example, a 2018 Pew Research Survey found that       one in four Americans living in rural areas lack reliable       access to high speed internet service. Other polling found       that Americans, even those between ages 18 and 29, prefer not       to receive important information from SSA online.        We applaud your effort to clarify the requirement that       annual Social Security earnings statements be mailed. We are       confident that the Know Your Social Security Act will help       strengthen Social Security. We look forward to working with       you to see this excellent bipartisan legislation become law       quickly.            Sincerely,      Nancy J. Altman,        President.      Alex Lawson,        Executive Director.

Representative Larson,      Washington, DC.      Senator Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Representative Buchanan,      Washington, DC.      Senator Cassidy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Larson, Representative Buchanan,       Senator Wyden, and Senator Cassidy: The Arc of the United       States writes in support of the Know Your Social Security       Act. The Arc is the largest national community-based       organization advocating for people with intellectual and       developmental disabilities (I/DD) and their families.        Social Security statements are a crucial tool to help       recipients plan for their future by providing accurate       information about their earnings and future benefits. In       addition, the statement raises awareness about all Social       Security benefits, including about the Disability and       Survivors Insurance that helps many people with I/DD. It also       allows claimants to ensure that their earnings records are       accurate.        We are concerned that recent changes that the Social       Security Administration has made to only mail paper       statements to a limited population means that many people are       not receiving this crucial information. While the information       may be available via the My Social Security website, less       than half of registered users of the website checked their       statements in 2018. In addition, low income households are       less likely to have internet access at home and be able to       access the website, despite the importance of Social Security       benefits to these households; using library or other public       internet sources is not advised due to the highly private       nature of the information and the risk of identity theft.       Without mailed statements, those households may have no       access to the crucially important information about their       Social Security benefits in the statement necessary to plan       for their futures.        For these reasons, we strongly support the Know Your Social       Security Act. Please contact Bethany Lilly at       [email protected] with any questions, or if you would like to       further discuss these issues.            Sincerely,                                                     Bethany Lilly,      Director of Income Policy.                                   ____                                       The Senior Citizens League,                                   Alexandria, VA, December 4, 2019.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Larson,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressmen Buchanan, Congressman Larson, Senator       Cassidy and Senator Wyden: On behalf of the approximately one       million supporters of The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), I       would like to thank you for being true champions for Social       Security beneficiaries.        The Senior Citizens League lends its enthusiastic support       to the ``Know Your Social Security Act''. Every American who       pays into Social Security has a right to see a written       statement from Social Security to ensure their record is       accurate, and to learn the estimated amount of their       benefits. A printed record is important for those who do not       have the means to routinely access their record       electronically and it serves as a critical planning tool for       determining the best retirement dates. Regular receipt of       these statements serves to remind and educate older workers       of the benefits of staying in the workforce. Doing so       strengthens retirement benefits, strengthens Social Security       and strengthens our national economy.        As such, TSCL salutes you for introducing legislation that       clarifies that the requirement in the Social Security Act for       SSA to provide an annual Social Security Statement means       providing it by mail. The bill also clarifies that SSA may       provide an on-demand statement electronically when the       individual chooses electronic delivery for that request; and       that SSA has met its requirement to mail an annual Statement       if an individual has accessed their Statement electronically       in the prior year and has declined to receive their Statement       by mail for that year.        We look forward to informing our supporters about your       leadership on this important issue in Congress. In the       meantime, if we may be of assistance to you or your staff in       any way, please do not hesitate to call upon us. Again, thank       you for being a positive voice for America's seniors.            Sincerely,                                                      Rick Delaney,                                                          Chairman.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE:   S. 2990. A bill to require that the Federal Government procure from  the private sector the goods and services necessary for the operations  and management of certain Government agencies, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.    Mr. President, I along with Finance Committee member  Senator Cassidy are introducing a bill to make a common-sense, low-cost  change to the law that will help American workers help themselves when  preparing for retirement: The Know Your Social Security Act. This bill  is simple: it clarifies the law about Congressional intent so that  every worker over 25 receives a Social Security statement in the mail  each year, unless the worker has accessed their statement online or  declined to receive the statement in the mail.   The history of the Social Security statement runs right through the  Senate and the ``powerful'' Committee on Finance. Senator Daniel  Patrick Moynihan summed up the intent very well: ``All of us pay into  Social Security but rarely, until we become beneficiaries, do we ever  hear from Social Security . . . . in every paycheck, we see money  withheld for Social Security, but we hear nary a word from the Social  Security Administration. Let us take this simple step [sending  statements] to reassure Americans that Social Security will be there  for them.'' The Social Security statement has three goals: to provide  workers with information about their Social Security benefits, to help  workers plan for the future, and enable workers to review their  earnings records.   After enactment and once fully phased in, every worker aged 25 and  older received an annual statement from Social Security starting in the  year 2000. After a few years, Social Security's website allowed workers  to obtain a Social Security statement online. At the time, the online  option was a good step forward in customer service. But as sometime  happens, advances in technology shortchanged good intentions. Due to  tight budgets, SSA came to view the online option as  [[Page S6891]]  ``providing'' the worker with a statement and fulfilling their  responsibilities under the law. SSA stopped mailing the statements in  2011 in order to shift resources towards other priorities. Currently,  only individuals over the age of 60 who are not receiving benefits  receive statements through the mail.   Paper statements delivered through the mail are desirable because no  action is necessary by the worker and the statement is a yearly  reminder to the worker to think about the future. Research has shown  that workers provided with statements are significantly more likely to  save, more certain about their retirement income, and have higher  satisfaction with their finances relative to those who are not provided  with any type of financial planning materials. Providing Social  Security statement through the mail is a simple policy that could help  many workers, hopefully leading to better decisions about their  financial future.   Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman John Larson and  Ways and Means Committee Member Vern Buchanan are introducing the  companion bill in the House of Representatives. We have received  letters of endorsement from AARP, the Coalition for Paper Options,  Justice in Aging, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security  and Medicare, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Social Security Works, The  Arc of the United States and The Senior Citizens League. I ask that the  letters be included in the Record following my remarks.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join us and cosponsor the  Know Your Social Security Act. Together, we can work towards better  retirement outcomes for all Americans.                                                           AARP,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Wyden and Senator Cassidy: On behalf of       our nearly 38 million members and all older Americans       nationwide, AARP is pleased to endorse the Know Your Social       Security Act. This bipartisan bill would once again place       vital, paper Social Security statements in the hands of       millions of Americans, to help them more effectively plan for       retirement, identify fraud and correct earnings records, and       better understand their stake in Social Security.        The Social Security statement is an essential financial       planning tool that provides key information on an       individual's earnings and payroll tax contributions record,       as well as an estimate of their earned monthly benefits. When       Social Security sends this statement through the mail, more       Americans are able to better plan for their future, not only       due to an increased understanding of their Social Security       benefits, but also any gaps in their current retirement plan.       Having a hard copy of your Social Security statement also       allows an individual to spot and correct errors or even to       detect outright fraud. Finding and correcting these errors in       a timely manner will save workers and the Social Security       Administration frustration, time and money. Finally, when       Americans receive an annual statement in the mail, it helps       them better understand the importance of Social Security as       part of their overall retirement plan. Paper statements are       annual reminders, especially to younger workers, that they       have contributed to Social Security and have earned a stake       in the program.        AARP believes strongly that all Americans, unless they opt-      out, should have access to their Social Security statements       via mail. We are pleased to endorse the Know Your Social       Security Act to once again place vital, paper statements in       the hands of millions of Americans.

Hon. John Larson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Larson, Buchanan and Senators Wyden       and Cassidy: The Coalition for Paper Options--an alliance of       consumer organizations, labor unions, rural advocates, and       print communications industry leaders is pleased to support       today's introduction of the bipartisan Know Your Social       Security Act. Introduced in both the House and Senate, the       bill would require the Social Security Administration to       reinstate the mailing of annual Statement of Earnings until       such time as a wage earner establishes an on line account.        The annual Statement, which summarizes each wage earner's       recorded earnings and projects future retirement benefits,       has been hailed as one of the most important financial       planning tools that most Americans will ever see, yet the       Social Security Administration stopped sending these       statements to workers in 2017 without any congressional       oversight. A report released in February 2019 by the Social       Security Administration's Inspector General highlights a       tremendous decline in overall access since the primarily       online-only policy took place.        The Know Your Social Security Act would reinstate the       mailing of the Statements until a wage earner accesses their       account through the my Social Security online portal. This       would allow the Social Security Administration to economize       as online participation grows, but it would not force       citizens into online access before they choose or are able to       manage it.        CPO's diverse network of allies includes: Consumer Action,       Social Security Works, the National Consumers League, the       National Grange, the National Association of Letter Carriers,       as well as leading organizations in the paper and print       communications industry is pleased to endorse this important       legislation and offer our full support.            Regards,                                                       John Runyan,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                 Justice in Aging,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2019.        Dear Representatives Larson and Buchanan, and Senators       Wyden and Cassidy: Justice in Aging endorses the bipartisan       Know Your Social Security Act, which would reaffirm SSA's       obligation to send Social Security statements by mail to all       workers each year. This legislation would clarify SSA's duty       and ensure that workers understand the Social Security       benefits they are earning over time.        Many people are not fully aware of the level of Social       Security benefits they could receive when they retire, nor do       they realize the Social Security benefits available for       themselves and their family members in the event that they       experience a disability that limits their capacity to work,       or in the event that they pass away leaving a spouse, young       children, or other eligible survivors. The Know Your Social       Security Act would provide this important information, as       required, to ensure that workers know what benefits are       available to them and their loved ones, allowing them to       better plan for retirement as they age.        We believe it is not only SSA's obligation to send these       statements, but that it is vital to the well-being of workers       who need to be fully informed about their potential Social       Security benefits in order to make decisions about their own       working lives, and their retirement. While those who choose       to get this information electronically and decline a paper       statement have clearly demonstrated their awareness of the       benefits they may receive in the future, others who do not       make this choice should receive the statement in the mail as       required under the law. For these reasons, Justice in Aging       supports this bill.            Sincerely,                                                  Tracey Gronniger,      Director of Economic Security.                                   ____                                     National Committee to Preserve,                                      Social Security & Medicare,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2019.      Hon. John B. Larson,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security, Committee on Ways           and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy, M.D.,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Larson, Congressman Buchanan, Ranking Member       Wyden and Senator Cassidy: On behalf of the millions of       members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve       Social Security and Medicare, I am writing to endorse your       bill, the Know Your Social Security Act. This important       legislation requires the Social Security Administration to       resume annual mailing of Social Security statements to all of       the estimated 150 million American workers who are eligible       to receive them, and have not otherwise accessed them through       their My SSA account.        For nearly a decade now, SSA has unilaterally nullified       section 1143 of the Social Security Act by refusing to mail       annual statements to workers, even though section 1143 is       unambiguously clear that such statements are required. The       Know Your Social Security Act clarifies that mailings are       required, a measure that is deeply appreciated by our       members.        The Social Security statement is one of the many enduring       legacies left to the nation by one of its most distinguished       lawmakers, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. He       regarded the statement as a simple and efficient way of       building public  [[Page S6892]]       support and understanding for Social Security. Not       surprisingly, Senator Moynihan's simple, common sense       amendment worked as intended while SSA was producing the       statements each year. In fact, the bipartisan Social Security       Advisory Board of 10 years ago found that SSA's own survey       data showed ``. . . a link between increasing public       confidence and receipt of a statement. People who receive a       statement not only experience higher knowledge of Social       Security than non-recipients, but also exhibit greater       confidence that the program still will be there for them when       they need it.''        The statement also raises workers' awareness of the need       for retirement planning by focusing attention on their future       retirement income. It brings clarity to an often confusing       and perplexing subject by providing a starting point: the       individual's estimated Social Security benefits, whether       retirement, survivors or disability insurance. From there,       workers can determine how much more they need to save for the       future. Because the statements were intended to reach people       early in their working lives, they provided an invaluable       service.        Another important function of the Social Security       statement, if it were to be delivered annually as Congress       intended, would be to enable workers to determine the       accuracy of the wage records maintained by SSA for each       worker. As the statement indicates, workers are encouraged to       review the chart showing their reported wages, comparing the       amounts reflected on SSA's records with information from the       worker's own records. Workers are further advised that only       they can perform this function and that they should report       discrepancies to SSA as soon as possible.        We have been especially concerned that, with the suspension       of statements to all but those who are approaching retirement       age, few workers have been able to check the accuracy of       SSA's wage records. The annual statement, when it was being       provided, helped to assure that if errors were made in the       reporting of wages that they could be quickly discovered and       corrected while the required evidence would still be readily       at hand. Since SSA has suspended the statements now for       nearly a decade, we are concerned that many errors in SSA's       records will go undetected and that some workers' benefits       will be reduced as a result.        As mentioned earlier, one function performed by annual       distribution of Social Security statements was to inform       workers of the kinds of benefits that are provided by Social       Security. The statements focused on retirement, survivors,       and disability benefits. In other words, the statements were       an invaluable annual tutorial of what Social Security is all       about. And knowledge about Social Security is vitally       important to the successful functioning of the program. We       see that reflected in recent work that finds that one reason       for the seemingly inexplicable recent decline in disability       applications is related to the suspension of the statements.       Clearly, restoration of annual production and mailing of the       annual statements, as is required in the Know Your Social       Security Act, is long overdue.        When it was being mailed to all eligible workers, the       Social Security statement was able to play a critical role in       building and strengthening public confidence in Social       Security. It provided workers with the only meaningful pre-      retirement information that they ever received about the       program and the benefits they could expect when they retire       or otherwise qualify for benefits. SSA's decision to end       annual mailings has harmed many workers. It is time for SSA       to undo this harmful decision and to follow the clear,       unambiguous requirements of the law to mail statements to all       eligible workers. We applaud you for your leadership in       introducing the Know Your Social Security Act, and look       forward to working with you to enact this important measure.            Sincerely,                                                      Max Richtman,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                    Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Senate Finance Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Larson,      Chairman, Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Ways and Means Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Wyden and Cassidy, Chairman Larson and       Representative Buchanan: Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA)       is pleased to support the Know Your Social Security Act. PVA       is the nation's only Congressionally chartered veterans       service organization solely dedicated to representing       veterans with spinal cord injuries and/or disorders. Many of       our members are among the nine million veterans who receive       Social Security retirement or disability benefits. Others are       among the millions of veterans and military service members       and their families who will at some point in their lives       benefit from the system.        For many years, the Social Security Administration (SSA)       issued paper earnings and benefits statements that helped to       inform people about their status under Social Security and       what they might expect to receive in retirement or in the       event of a catastrophic disability. When SSA suspended that       practice in favor of disseminating the statements only       online, it meant that people who lack internet access or who       prefer not to set up an internet account lost access to that       information. These Americans are then denied knowing about       what they have accumulated on their earnings record, what       their retirement benefits might be, what they might receive       in spousal benefits, or the fact they qualify for disability       or survivor benefits.        As we understand, your bill will clarify that the existing       requirement in the Social Security Act for SSA to provide an       annual Social Security Statement means providing this       document by mail. The bill also clarifies that SSA may       provide an on-demand electronic statement when an individual       chooses electronic delivery. Furthermore, the bill stipulates       that SSA has met its requirement to mail an annual statement       if individuals have accessed their statements electronically       in the prior year and have declined to receive their       statements by mail for that year.        This will be a very helpful measure for millions of       Americans. PVA thanks you for introducing the Know Your       Social Security Act and urges Congress to do all it can to       quickly pass this bipartisan legislation this year.            Sincerely,                                                 Heather Ansley,                                       Associate Executive Director,      Government Relation.                                   ____                                            Social Security Works,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Larson,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Wyden, Senator Cassidy, Chairman Larson, and       Representative Buchanan: We strongly endorse your new       legislation, the Know Your Social Security Act. Your bill       clarifies the important law Congress passed in 1989 requiring       the Social Security Administration (SSA) to mail Social       Security earnings statements to those earning benefits with       every paycheck.        When the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan introduced       the original earnings statement legislation in 1988, he       explained one of the reasons mailing these statements is so       crucial:        ``All of us pay into Social Security but rarely, until we       become beneficiaries, do we ever hear from Social Security .       . . every month, in every paycheck, we see money withheld for       Social Security, but we hear nary a word from the Social       Security Administration. Let us take this simple step       [mailing Social Security earnings statements] to reassure       Americans that Social Security will be there for them . . .''        Social Security earnings statements help families plan for       the future. The statements educate and inform working       families of the kinds of benefits they are earning.       Crucially, they allow workers to identify and correct their       earnings records in a timely way, when mistakes are made.        Your wise legislation clarifies that these vital statements       are to be mailed automatically each year. Distressingly, more       and more private and public services are being shifted to       individuals. This should not happen with Social Security. As       technology continues to progress, there is a tendency for       administrators to lean more on its capabilities and move       communications with consumers and constituents online.       Electronic communication is, no doubt, desired in many       situations. However, the most important financial documents,       including the Social Security earnings statements, should       default to postal mail as intended by the original law.        That the earnings statements be mailed is vital for       everyone, including those who have access to high speed       computing. Of course, not everyone even has this kind of       access. For example, a 2018 Pew Research Survey found that       one in four Americans living in rural areas lack reliable       access to high speed internet service. Other polling found       that Americans, even those between ages 18 and 29, prefer not       to receive important information from SSA online.        We applaud your effort to clarify the requirement that       annual Social Security earnings statements be mailed. We are       confident that the Know Your Social Security Act will help       strengthen Social Security. We look forward to working with       you to see this excellent bipartisan legislation become law       quickly.            Sincerely,      Nancy J. Altman,        President.      Alex Lawson,        Executive Director.

Representative Larson,      Washington, DC.      Senator Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Representative Buchanan,      Washington, DC.      Senator Cassidy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Larson, Representative Buchanan,       Senator Wyden, and Senator Cassidy: The Arc of the United       States writes in support of the Know Your Social Security       Act. The Arc is the largest national community-based       organization advocating for people with intellectual and       developmental disabilities (I/DD) and their families.        Social Security statements are a crucial tool to help       recipients plan for their future by providing accurate       information about their earnings and future benefits. In       addition, the statement raises awareness about all Social       Security benefits, including about the Disability and       Survivors Insurance that helps many people with I/DD. It also       allows claimants to ensure that their earnings records are       accurate.        We are concerned that recent changes that the Social       Security Administration has made to only mail paper       statements to a limited population means that many people are       not receiving this crucial information. While the information       may be available via the My Social Security website, less       than half of registered users of the website checked their       statements in 2018. In addition, low income households are       less likely to have internet access at home and be able to       access the website, despite the importance of Social Security       benefits to these households; using library or other public       internet sources is not advised due to the highly private       nature of the information and the risk of identity theft.       Without mailed statements, those households may have no       access to the crucially important information about their       Social Security benefits in the statement necessary to plan       for their futures.        For these reasons, we strongly support the Know Your Social       Security Act. Please contact Bethany Lilly at       [email protected] with any questions, or if you would like to       further discuss these issues.            Sincerely,                                                     Bethany Lilly,      Director of Income Policy.                                   ____                                       The Senior Citizens League,                                   Alexandria, VA, December 4, 2019.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Larson,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressmen Buchanan, Congressman Larson, Senator       Cassidy and Senator Wyden: On behalf of the approximately one       million supporters of The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), I       would like to thank you for being true champions for Social       Security beneficiaries.        The Senior Citizens League lends its enthusiastic support       to the ``Know Your Social Security Act''. Every American who       pays into Social Security has a right to see a written       statement from Social Security to ensure their record is       accurate, and to learn the estimated amount of their       benefits. A printed record is important for those who do not       have the means to routinely access their record       electronically and it serves as a critical planning tool for       determining the best retirement dates. Regular receipt of       these statements serves to remind and educate older workers       of the benefits of staying in the workforce. Doing so       strengthens retirement benefits, strengthens Social Security       and strengthens our national economy.        As such, TSCL salutes you for introducing legislation that       clarifies that the requirement in the Social Security Act for       SSA to provide an annual Social Security Statement means       providing it by mail. The bill also clarifies that SSA may       provide an on-demand statement electronically when the       individual chooses electronic delivery for that request; and       that SSA has met its requirement to mail an annual Statement       if an individual has accessed their Statement electronically       in the prior year and has declined to receive their Statement       by mail for that year.        We look forward to informing our supporters about your       leadership on this important issue in Congress. In the       meantime, if we may be of assistance to you or your staff in       any way, please do not hesitate to call upon us. Again, thank       you for being a positive voice for America's seniors.            Sincerely,                                                      Rick Delaney,                                                          Chairman.                                  ______
