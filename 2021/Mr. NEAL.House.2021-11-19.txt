 Madam Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to close? I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.   Madam Speaker, this debate has gone on now for 3 months in the  Committee on Ways and Means. Sixty amendments from the opposition were  offered. This was fully vetted over 4 days of public scrutiny, and all  maintained in daylight. I made sure of that, on purpose.   And this, as I indicated last night, as I quoted a son of  Massachusetts, Mr. Webster, I said rhetorically he asked, ``Did we do  something worthwhile in our time?'' Today, we are going to answer that  question. I am sorry that last evening when I quoted Webster it  triggered an outburst from the Republican leader because we quoted an  individual who was devoted to the Constitution of the United States and  the premise that everybody in America gets a chance.   Now, it is an honor for me to yield to the Speaker of the House,  secure in her caucus, secure in her beliefs, and secure knowing what we  are doing today in but a few minutes.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
