 Mr. Speaker, we were promised a middle  class tax cut. This is not it. What we have instead are tax cuts for  the wealthiest paid for by the rest.   So what happened?   Maybe Trump thinks multimillionaires are the middle class or maybe  this all is just a tax scam.   To see how working families will pay for corporate interest, all you  have to do is read the bill, which is hard to do, because it was  written overnight behind closed doors.   Tax cuts: they reduce the tax rate for the wealthiest from 39.6  percent to 37 percent.   State and local taxes: they cap the deduction to just $10,000. But in  my State of California, the average deduction is $18,500, meaning  families will be forced to pay taxes now on twice their income in order  to give a staggering tax break to corporations.   So hear this: 83 percent of the benefits of this bill goes to the top  1 percent.   Who gets cut?   Seniors, families, children.   Is this the right thing to do?   The answer is a resounding no.
