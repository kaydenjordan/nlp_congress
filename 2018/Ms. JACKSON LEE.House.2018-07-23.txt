 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2345, the  ``National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act,'' which provides resources  to improve suicide hotlines in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we address the public heath crisis  of suicide in the United States.   Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States--each  year, 44,965 Americans die by suicide, more than half by firearm.   On average, 123 Americans commit suicide each day.   The 2016 annual age-adjusted suicide rate in my state of Texas was  12.57 per 100,000 individuals, which was similar to the national  average for that year.   However, there has been a steady increase in suicides in the decade  since 2007, when the suicide rate was 10.48 per 100,000.   Suicides in Texas have increased by 23 percent over the past 15  years.   The steady increase coincides with new data that names suicide as the  second leading cause of death among people ages 10-34 in America.   Even more alarming are rates of suicide among our veterans--those who  have given the ultimate sacrifice and deserve protection tantamount to  their service.   According to a Veterans Affairs study released last year, risk for  suicide was 22 percent higher among veterans when compared to U.S. non- veteran adults.   After adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide was 19  percent higher among male veterans when compared to U.S. non-veteran  adult men.   After adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide was 2.5  times higher among female veterans when compared to U.S. non-veteran  adult women.   But the victims of suicide are more than mere statistics.   They are our parents, children, siblings, and loved ones.   They are our co-workers, our peers, and our servicemen and women.   They deserve more.   There are many organizations and individuals working tirelessly to  ensure all of our fellow citizens receive the aid they need.   I commend the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a network of 161  crisis centers that provides a 24/7, toll-free hotline available to  anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress.   There are five such centers in Texas, including one in my home city  of Houston.   The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline reports that it experienced  an increase of 100 percent in calls between 2014 and 2017, revealing  just how prevalent suicide has become.   The helpline answered more than 2 million calls in 2017, up from  approximately one million calls in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the helpline  answered more than 1.5 million calls each year.   Those on the front lines of the suicide prevention efforts deserve  more help.   H.R. 2345, the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act, would  require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to coordinate with  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and  consult with the Department of Veterans Affairs for suicide prevention  efforts.   The Act would lead to the examination of the feasibility of  designating a three-digit dialing code for a national suicide  prevention and mental health crisis hotline system.  [[Page H6595]]    Further, the Act directs the FCC to study and report to Congress on  the effectiveness of the current National Suicide Prevention Lifeline,  including how well it addresses the needs of veterans.   Mr. Speaker, our citizens and our suicide prevention centers deserve  decisive action against suicide.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 2345 to reduce the  incidence of suicides in America.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 959,  the Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act of 2018.   It is undeniable that nurses play a critical role in our society's  function, as they are trusted healthcare professionals who are the  heart and soul of the healthcare system.   H.R. 959 amends the Public Health Service Act by extending support  for nursing workforce programs and grants through the fiscal year 2022.   This bill will reauthorize the Title VIII nursing workforce  development programs.   Further, eligibility for advanced nursing education grants will be  expanded to include education programs for clinical nurse leaders and  all combined registered nurse and graduate degree programs.   The Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act bolsters nursing education  at all levels, strengthens nursing education and funds institutions  educating nurses to practice in rural and medically underserved  communities.   For nearly six decades, the nursing workforce development programs  have helped fortify the workforce by increasing the number of students,  faculty, and practicing nurses.   Unfortunately, health inequities, inflated costs, and poor health  care outcomes are intensifying because of today's shortfall of  appropriately prepared licensed vocational/practical nurses (LVNs/ LPNs), registered nurses (RNs), advanced practice registered nurses  (APRNs), and nurse faculty.   This trend must be ameliorated, as the importance of nurses cannot be  understated.   Nurses are extremely vital components to quality healthcare and  patient education.   Nurses are the primary professionals delivering quality health care  in the nation, as there are over 4.2 million Registered Nurses in  practice today.   Moreover, the nurse workforce is expected to continue to grow, due to  the current technological advancements for treatments, preventive care  needs, and the rising demand from new health reform enrollments.   It is imperative that the nursing shortage in society be eliminated,  as the need for qualified, experienced nurses is rising and will  continue to do so.   Insufficient federal investments in nursing education, training, and  the overall workforce will only be a detriment to our nation's quality  of healthcare.   H.R. 959 ensures that nursing workforce development programs will  continue to address the specific needs of the nursing and nurse faculty  workforce as well as patients in our communities.   By modernizing the current nursing workforce development programs,  through technical training and further financial funding, nurses will  be able to fulfill the needs of their patients at the highest level.   Further funding and training for nurses at all levels ensures that  all types and levels of nurses have concrete training and are able to  deliver high quality healthcare.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 959, which will  strengthen the future of nursing and the health of the nation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5954, the  Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018, which amends title 18 of the  United States Code to clarify the meaning of the terms ``act of war''  and ``blocked asset.''   Mr. Speaker, it is vital that we correctly classify terrorist  activities.   H.R. 5954 (1) clarifies ambiguities in the Anti-terrorism Act of 1992  (ATA's) ``act of war'' exception that allow designated foreign  terrorists and their supporters to avoid liability; (2) closes a  loophole that prevents victims of narco-terrorism from enforcing their  judgments against terrorist assets that have been blocked by the  Treasury Department; and (3) addresses lower court decisions that have  allowed entities that sponsor terrorist activity against U.S. nationals  overseas to avoid the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.   This will amend the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) to make it easier for  plaintiffs to pursue claims under that statute.   H.R. 5954 has three principal provisions.   First, it would clarify and narrow the ``act of war'' exception to  liability under the ATA.   Second, the bill would provide that ATA plaintiffs may reach the  assets of a defendant That have been blocked pursuant to the Foreign  Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act to satisfy an ATA judgment.   Third, H.R. 5954 would establish that for purposes of any ATA civil  action, a defendant is ``deemed to have consented'' to personal  jurisdiction in such civil action regardless of when the act of  international terrorism at issue took place if the defendant accepted  U.S. foreign assistance funds or, in certain circumstances, the  defendant maintains an office or other facilities within U.S.  jurisdiction.   H.R. 5954 legislation is necessary to allow injured persons to pursue  their claims and I offer my support.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5954.    Mr. Speaker, there are three items that I think are  important for our colleagues.   A number of Members traveled to Texas to physically assess where we  were in the reunification of these children and their families. Let me  just say that those who are tasked with trying to do this dastardly,  difficult task are putting their best foot forward, but they are  dealing with a policy that is broken and chaotic. I witnessed the  attempt to reunify families. There were about 20 children in the room,  and we witnessed four reunifications, and each of us would have our  heart broken, because children are still in shock, some didn't  recognize their parents. I believe that this is a chaotic system that  this administration must fix immediately.   I also want to bring to the attention of my colleagues about the  Medicare payments to doctors, unequal payments. I am absolutely  opposed. Give doctors a fair assessment of their treatment.   And, finally, do we realize, Mr. Speaker, that those immigrants who  joined the military are now being kicked out? Do we have any heart?  They have sacrificed their lives to wear the uniform. We need to stand  up against it, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to join my colleagues in  unequivocally condemning the President's gross assault on the  independence of the federal judiciary by stacking the federal courts  with unqualified nominees.   Since his inauguration a year and six months ago, the President and  his supporters in the Senate have proceeded at breakneck speed to  nominate ideological, often-unqualified candidates.   In his first 330 days in office, the President had won confirmation  for 12 of his appeals court nominees--the most in an administration's  first year since creation of the circuit court system in 1891.   The President's appellate nominees were approved by the Senate in an  average of just 20 days after being voted out of the committee--which  is eight times faster than President Obama's nominees.   As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I am concerned by the  pervasive lack of oversight and partisanship that has poisoned our  judiciary far more than the collection of highly publicized incidents  would have us believe.   We must remember that the judiciary abuses of this Administration are  the continuation of the shameless partisanship of Senate Republicans  first began with the theft of the seat of Judge Merrick Garland.   Judge Garland had long been considered a prime prospect for the high  court, serving as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit--a frequent source of justices that is  sometimes called the ``little Supreme Court.''   Widely regarded as a moderate, Judge Garland had been praised in the  past by many Republicans, including influential senators such as Orrin  Hatch of Utah.   But even before President Obama had named Judge Garland, and in fact  only hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Majority  Leader Mitch McConnell declared in February 2016 that any appointment  by the sitting president would be null and void.   Senator McConnell foreclosed any consideration of a nominee for the  vacancy until after the 2016 election, nearly a year away.   Mr. Speaker, Supreme Court picks have often been controversial.   There have been contentious hearings and floor debates and contested  votes.   But never has a nominee been ignored entirely, as if no vacancy  existed.   A federal lawsuit was filed to compel Senator McConnell to hold a  vote on Judge Garland, but it was dismissed because the plaintiff  lacked stand-ins.   This president has used the levers of his office to continue to  divide, rather than unite.   When confronted with a replacement to the Supreme Court's swing vote,  the President has chosen an ideologue and a foot soldier of  [[Page H6645]]  the Republican Party and the conservative movement.   To be sure, Brett Kavanaugh has acceptable credentials and has  enjoyed an undistinguished tenure as a member of the United States  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.   But, it is not his credentials or his pedigree which is worrisome.   Rather, throughout his entire career--as a deputy in the right-wing's  crusade against President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, as a political  operative fighting to prevent the recount in Florida in 2000, which  paved the way for the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, and  thereafter a decade as a stalwart conservative on the country's most  important federal appellate court--Brett Kavanaugh has used his legal  acumen in the service of decidedly and uncompromisingly conservative  causes.   Instead of ensuring that the court will protect the rights of  minorities, women, children, and society's most vulnerable, the  President has chosen to politicize our halls of justice.   This President has used his Constitutional powers to push down on the  scales of lady justice.   Both of the President's Supreme Court appointees--Neil Gorsuch and  Brett Kavanaugh--have drawn withering criticism from respected  organizations across the nation.   Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, the oldest  and largest community-based nonpartisan civil rights organization of  its kind, condemned Neil Gorsuch's nomination and the regression of the  Supreme Court on civil rights issues.   More recently, the National Urban League, National Action Network,  NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense Fund & National Coalition on Black Civic  Participation urged citizens to contact Senators to delay confirming  Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.   The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonprofit formed  in 1963 at the request of President Kennedy to involve the private bar  in providing legal services addressing racial discrimination,  explicitly denounced Kavanaugh's nomination.   President and executive director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil  Rights Kristen Clarke remarked that in this critical time for civil  rights protections under attack by the administration, ``it would be an  abdication of [the Senate's] constitutional responsibility to merely  rubber stamp Kavanaugh's nomination'' on partisan grounds.   Rev. Al Sharpton, civil rights leader and President of National  Action Network (NAN), released the following statement following  President Donald Trump's announcement of the nomination of Brett  Kavanaugh:         Some will pass this off as a middle of the road pick. Don't       be fooled. On every issue, Kavanaugh has proven to be an       ideologue who will ignore our rights . . . This is a fight       for the soul of our country, and we at National Action       Network call on the Senate to stop Kavanaugh's nomination at       any cost--his confirmation would be a disastrous attack on       basic human rights.    The NAACP--with its cherished heritage of struggling for fair-minded  justice, including when it was instrumental in defeating a Herbert  Hoover nominee to the Supreme Court, John Parker--characterized the  Kavanaugh nomination as an effort to ``re-make the Court in President  Trump's own image.''   Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO of the National Women's Law  Center (NWLC) expressed strong concern that Kavanaugh's nomination  could put women's health, equality, dignity, and even lives on the  line: ``it will shift the balance of the Court, and could roll back  rights for an entire generation.''   The backlash has not only to do with the abandonment of the pursuit  of justice for blatant partisanship, but also the flagrant breach of  protocol in nominating Kavanaugh.   Usually, the White House Counsel's office maintains a list of  potential nominees on hand, along with some basic information about  them, long before an opening appears.   An informal working group is assembled from several sections of the  White House, including not just the counsel's office but legislative  affairs, the vice president's office, the chief of staff, and the  Attorney General.   Congressional leaders from both parties are consulted, as well: GOP  strategist Ken Duberstein, who helped shepherd half a dozen Supreme  Court nominees, said in an interview that it is critical the  administration reaches out to both parties on Capitol Hill, as ``there  has to be some consultation, on both sides of the aisle, coming from  the White House.''   Instead of this time-honored, bipartisan process, the President has  relied heavily on the Federalist Society--a nationwide organization of  conservative lawyers that openly seeks to ``reorder priorities within  the legal system to place a premium on conservative values.''   Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society,  went as far as to take leave from the Society to construct a list of  nominees for the President: granting such unprecedented access to an  unashamedly partisan organization is a departure from convention.   This approach--partisanship above justice; loyalty above protocol-- should be concerning and insulting to every American whose civil  liberties are at stake.   But more disturbing than partisanship in judicial nominations is the  deliberate appointment of unqualified candidates.   Thomas Farr, the Raleigh attorney nominated for a judicial  appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  North Carolina, received the wholehearted support of the President and  North Carolina's two U.S. senators, while two qualified African- American women could not even get a hearing.   Farr has been the lead attorney in a series of recent legislative  efforts to suppress political participation by African Americans in the  state.   In 2010, Farr advised the General Assembly in what federal courts  later termed a ``racial gerrymander'' of North Carolina House, Senate  and U.S. Congressional districts.   In separate lawsuits, each redistricting plan was proven to have  intentionally discriminated against African-American voters.   In 2013, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted a bill that  shortened early voting, required voters to present government-issued  IDs and eliminated same-day voter registration and out-of-precinct  voting--all of which are forms of marginalization and voter  suppression.   Farr advised the legislature on the bill and then became lead counsel  in a three-year battle to defend it.   Federal courts ruled the law unconstitutional and an attempt to  disenfranchise African-American voters ``with almost surgical  precision.''   Farr began his notorious in voter suppression and race-baiting career  as a campaign aide to Senator Jesse Helms, who entered public life in  campaigns that urged ``White People Wake Up'' and smeared the  University of North Carolina as ``the University of Negroes and  Communists.''   Helms was infamous for his diatribes against ``Negro hoodlums'' and  ``forced integration,'' and for touting the ``purely scientific  statistical evidence of natural racial distinction in group  intellect.''   Helms became the state's most vociferous opponent of the civil rights  movement, which, as late as 2005, Helms railed had ``ripped away at the  customs and institutions people cared about.''   During Farr's time on the campaign, the Helms Campaign Committee sent  more than 105,000 post cards to African Americans falsely warning that  they were ineligible to vote and could be arrested for voter fraud if  they appeared at the polls.   Farr denied having any knowledge of this effort, but a former  Department of Justice official said the Helms disciple ``absolutely''  was involved in this and earlier illegal voter suppression tricks that  the campaign described as ``ballot security efforts.''   A 1992 consent decree prohibited the campaign from tactics ``to  intimidate, threaten, coerce, deter, or otherwise interfere with a  qualified voter's exercise of the franchise''--and Thomas Farr signed  the decree.   More than 20 years later, during Farr's defense of the election law  that the Fourth District Court ruled targeted African-American voters  ``with almost surgical precision,'' the judge in Winston-Salem asked  Farr, ``Why don't y'all want people to vote?''   A track record that continues to raise this question should prevent  anyone from being appointed to the federal bench.   But the problem is compounded by the fact that Farr would preside  over the Eastern District, which contains a majority of the state's  counties with the highest percentages of African-American residents.   Despite being home to North Carolina's ``Black Belt,'' the Eastern  District has never had an African-American judge in its nearly century  and half of existence.   Senator Burr says Farr will ``serve North Carolina well,'' and  Senator Tillis--a supporter of the massive voter suppression and  racialized redistricting that allowed Republicans to take a super  majority in the state legislature--calls the President's nominee  ``impeccably qualified.''   In doing so while blocking the hearings of May-Parker and Timmons- Goodson, these Senators insist North Carolina be revealed as backward- looking and bitter during nationally televised Senate hearings for a  morally stained and unrepentant figure like Thomas Farr.   Being a conservative is not the same thing as spending almost 40  years fighting to block full citizenship for all Americans.   This nomination is not just about what Thomas Farr stands for--it is  about what America stands for.   Some nominations have been entirely inconsiderate of any standards of  qualification that judicial nominees would otherwise be subject to.   Matthew Petersen, a Trump nominee to a lifetime appointment on the  U.S. District Court  [[Page H6646]]  for the District of Columbia, withdrew from consideration for the seat  in December 2017 days after a video clip showed him unable to answer  basic questions about legal procedure.   Petersen, a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, was a  member of the Federal Election Commission since 2008 but had no trial  experience.   His only connection to the Trump Administration was that his tenure  on the FEC overlapped with that of White House counsel Don McGahn for  about five years.   Petersen was one of three judicial nominees picked by President Trump  to have withdrawn in that week amid criticism about their  qualifications.   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley told the  White House to ``reconsider'' the nominations of the other two  nominees, both of whom were reported to have endorsed positions or  groups that embrace discrimination.   A day later, both nominations were pulled.   This gross disregard for competence is inconceivable in any  profession, much less our government.   One of the two withdrawn for discrimination was Brett Talley.   Talley had been rated ``unanimously unqualified'' for the post by the  American Bar Association after an evaluation that questioned his  experience.   Talley had never argued a case, or even a motion, in federal court,  he testified.   Mr. Talley nevertheless won preliminary approval from the Judiciary  Committee's Republican majority to be a judge.   Even after Talley's nomination advanced through the Senate Judiciary  Committee on an 11-9 party-line vote, media reports and good government  groups cast doubt on his credentials for the spot on the U.S. District  Court in Alabama.   As he was awaiting a Senate floor vote, it emerged that Mr. Talley  had not disclosed that he was married to White House Counsel Don  McGahn's chief of staff.   It was further publicized that he had failed to disclose that he had  apparently written thousands of pseudonymous posts on a University of  Alabama sports fan website, including one defending the early Ku Klux  Klan.   Talley's withdrawal is celebrated as a case in which civic awareness  and activism by various groups from media to good governance  organizations pressured the government to do the right thing.   One such organization that is critical to safeguarding fairness of  justice in our courtrooms is the American Bar Association, which gave  Talley the ``unanimously unqualified'' rating.   Since 1953, this venerable legal organization has played a critical,  behind-the-scenes role in assessing judicial nominees and their fitness  to serve on the bench.   By the end of President Trump's first year, the ABA deemed at least  four of Trump's judicial nominees ``not qualified.''   But with the ABA emerging as a major stumbling block in President  Trump's effort to transform the courts, our colleagues in the GOP  accused the nonpartisan group of holding a liberal slant and is seeking  to sideline it.   Instead of being equally concerned of the quality of judicial  nominees put forth by this Administration, our colleagues chose to  ignore the ABA and discredit the century-old group.   ABA President Hilarie Bass said the group is a ``nonpartisan  organization that has focused on legal issues and not politics'' and  that it has vetted thousands of judicial nominees ``fairly and in a  nonpartisan fashion'' under both Republican and Democratic  administrations.   However, our colleagues are engaged in a desperate charge against  factual truth itself.   ``The ABA's record on judicial nominations has been highly  questionable,'' said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, ``it has demonstrated over past decades repeatedly  partisan interests and ideological interests.''   Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee and  is a vocal GOP critic of Trump, added: ``Not a big fan of the ABA.''   ``It's blatantly political,'' Flake said. ``Often. Not always.''   In a shift from the Obama Administration and a return to the policy  of President George W. Bush, the administration decided earlier this  year not to allow the ABA to review potential candidates before they  were nominated.   Trump officials are abandoning the practice so Republicans can push  through younger, conservative attorneys who may not have as much--if  any--experience to a lifetime position on the bench.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in opposition of the Trump  Administration's misguided and foolish judicial nominations.   I stand today as a woman, who fears for my fellow woman's right to  choose.   I stand today as a granddaughter of immigrants, who recognizes the  value of immigration to our, society and national identity.   I stand today as an African American, who celebrates the progress our  community has made in expanding civil rights in our nation, but  recognizes the struggle yet left ahead.   I stand today as a mother and grandmother, who is determined to hold  our courts accountable to safeguarding our nation's civil liberties for  generations to come.   I stand today as an American, because a judiciary that dispenses  evenhanded justice is what defines who we are and what we stand for.   Mr. Speaker, fellow members of Congress, let us be unequivocally  clear that it is our responsibility and our high call of service to our  fellow citizens to defend the rule of law and preserve our courts as  the bastion of justice in our nation.
