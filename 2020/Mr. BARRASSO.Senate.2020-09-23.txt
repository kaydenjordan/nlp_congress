 Madam President, I rise today in celebration of Rhonda  Zimmerman, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming's 2020 honoree.   Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming has worked to  make a positive difference in the lives of children. Their mission is  to inspire all youth, especially those who need them the most. They  strive to help young people reach their full potential as productive,  responsible, and caring citizens. The programs, leagues, and activities  serve the children in our community by cultivating academic success,  healthy lifestyles, and good character and citizenship.   On October 21, 2020, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming will  host the 22nd Annual Awards and Recognition Breakfast. Every year at  this event, the Boys and Girls Club honors a member of the community  who has made outstanding contributions to their organization, Wyoming  youth, and the city of Casper. It is an inspiring celebration.   This year's honoree is Rhonda Zimmerman. She is an ideal choice to  receive this honor because of her lifelong dedication to our children  and families. With this award, the Boys and Girls Club of Central  Wyoming shows their gratitude for Rhonda's work, which mirrors the  Club's important mission.   Rhonda has given of her time and talents to the youth of our  community for her entire life. Being raised in the Zimmerman family,  she was taught the value of hard work and giving back to others. She  grew up in Casper, the oldest of her siblings, Mitch, Michael, and  Renee, and with her loving parents, Gail, Lois, and later Anne. Their  character contributed greatly to Rhonda's Christian values and giving  nature. Rhonda attended Casper College, earning an associate's degree  in criminal justice and social work and later earned her bachelor's  degree in social work from the University of Wyoming at Casper College.   Rhonda's passion for her community and the well-being of her  neighbors has shown time and again through her work as a counselor at  the Youth Crisis Center, the Wyoming Behavioral Institute, and Central  Wyoming Counseling Center. In 2011, Rhonda cofounded Casper Family  Connections. Their mission is to provide children who are unable to  live with one or both parents a safe and conflict-free environment.  They provide also for healthy contact with the noncustodial family.  They offer parenting classes as well as mental health services on top  of their important mission, giving children and families a strong  foundation on which to build.   Family holds a particularly special place in Rhonda's life. She  raised two children, Greg and Kendra. Together, Greg and Rhonda own and  operate E&F Towing and Transport in Casper. She also serves on the Boys  and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming board of directors along with her  brother Mitch.   Rhonda sets an example everyone can follow. She is the first to offer  a helping hand and shows a passion for improving the lives of others.  The Code of the West charges us to live each day with courage. Not only  does Rhonda embody this principle, but she gives everyone around her  the tools they need to live the same. Wyoming, Casper, and the Boys and  Girls Club of Central Wyoming are fortunate to have her.   It is with great honor that I recognize this outstanding member of  our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our  congratulations to Rhonda Zimmerman upon her selection for this special  award.                            ____________________
