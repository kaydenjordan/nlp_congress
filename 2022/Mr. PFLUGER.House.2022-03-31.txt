 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Odessa and  Midland Chambers of Commerce during  [[Page H4017]]  their fly-in to Washington, D.C., this week. It was incredible to host  nearly 70 business and community leaders, elected officials, students,  teachers, and staff from all throughout the Permian Basin, including  the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, engaging with lawmakers,  advocating for their community and advocating for energy independence.  Thank you to the Odessa Chamber president, Renee Earls, the Midland  Chamber president, Bobby Burns, and all the fantastic staff, leaders,  and volunteers who helped make this fly-in successful.                             Title 42 Rescission     Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's handling of the  border crisis is not humane. It is heartbreaking.   Yesterday, the White House confirmed their intention to rescind Title  42, one of the only policies in place that is helping quell the border  crisis.   This decision will have disastrous consequences on the already  several million illegal immigrants who have flooded into this country.  Human trafficking and smuggling across our border have reached historic  highs, and our border States are paying the price. In fact, every State  is a border State.   Texas is suffering from record-high levels of fentanyl and drugs  pouring across the border, increased crime, high-speed chases, and  more.   DHS already lacks the capacity to process, retain, and apprehend  illegal immigrants along the border. Rescinding Title 42 will only  double down on the amount of people that are illegally crossing the  border, making it that much more difficult for those in the Border  Patrol and Customs, and other agencies, who are trying to do their job  to keep this country safe.   The small communities along the border are already overwhelmed and  they cannot withstand a surge of hundreds of thousands of illegal  migrants reportedly waiting on the other side of the border to get in  once Title 42 is rescinded.   Migrants will pour into this country in a flood as our communities  experience the catastrophic results. Patrol facilities and local  communities will once again be forced to absorb at least double the  current number. Title 42 is the only policy that is helping.   The administration has abandoned Texas, has abandoned other border  States, and has abandoned its duty to secure our country. Making any  changes to this policy will have disastrous consequences.   And get this straight, I remind everyone in this House that we still  have a mask mandate on board aircrafts in this country to keep us safe  from COVID. Yet, we are rescinding Title 42, also in place because of  the pandemic. Think about that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  stand with us and to help come up with a reasonable solution. Title 42  rescission is not that solution. President Biden must not rescind Title  42.                      Recognizing Elizabeth Ann Mafford     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a staple in the  Odessa, Texas, community, Ms. Elizabeth Ann Mafford, also known as  ``Ms. Ann''.   Ms. Ann recently celebrated her 10th work anniversary at Chick-fil-A  in Odessa, Texas. And while this was a special occasion in and of  itself, it comes on the heels of Ms. Ann also celebrating her 90th  birthday.   Ms. Ann is a constant in Odessa, Texas, bringing joy and light to  everyone she encounters. From working the drive-through and the front  counter and just greeting customers on the way in, she continuously  spreads light throughout the entire community.    In a testament to Ms. Ann's life, her celebration of her 10th  anniversary on the job was recognized community-wide. Folks posted  online in recognition of Ms. Ann's kindness and love, and I would like  to personally thank her for living the American Dream, for showing  everyone throughout this country that even at 90 years young that she  can still work and be a productive member of our community, bringing so  much light and joy throughout Odessa, the Permian Basin, and Texas.   Ms. Ann, thank you for what you do for our community and the joy you  spread.                            ____________________
