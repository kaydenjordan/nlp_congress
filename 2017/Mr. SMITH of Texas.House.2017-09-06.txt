 Mr. Speaker, the American people have lost faith  in the liberal national media, and we know why. They tell the American  people what to think rather than report the facts in an unbiased  manner.   A new NBC Marist Poll revealed that two-thirds of Americans trust the  media not very much or not at all. A Morning Consult/Politico poll  found that 41 percent of registered voters have more trust in their  local news outlets than the national media to report the truth,  compared to only 27 percent who said the national media.   And a Quinnipiac poll showed that an astounding 55 percent of  Americans disapprove of the way the news media covers President Trump.   The national media's endless drumbeat of negative coverage of the  Trump administration has come with a cost: the loss of trust of the  American people.   If the media want to improve their credibility, they should report  the news fairly and without bias.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from New Jersey, for yielding  me time.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support H.R. 3354, the Make America  Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act of 2018, which includes the  Commerce-Justice-Science funding bill that provides appropriations for  many of the programs within the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee's jurisdiction.   Chairman Culberson has worked closely with us on the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee to include responsible, pro-science funding  levels for NASA, the National Science Foundation, NOAA, and the  National Institute of Standards and Technology. His consultation and  cooperation are much appreciated. I thank Chairman Culberson and his  clerk, John Martens, for their leadership in passing this legislation  that sets America on a path to remain the world's leader in innovation.   The appropriations included in this legislation are consistent with  the NASA Transition Authorization Act, the American Innovation and  Competitiveness Act, and the Weather Research and Forecasting  Innovation Act, all three of which were enacted into law earlier this  year.   The CJS bill fully funds the planetary science and exploration  programs at NASA, implements a national interest standard for every NSF  grant, and increases weather research and commercial data use to  improve forecasting to save lives and property, which is especially  timely today.   Later, I will offer an amendment, with Chairman Culberson's support,  to increase basic research in the physical and biological sciences at  the National Science Foundation.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this pro-science,  fiscally responsible appropriations bill.
