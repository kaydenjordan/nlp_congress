 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain Candice  Bowen who, this week, became the first woman to lead a Virginia  National Guard infantry company. On Saturday, she took command of the  Woodstock-based Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment,  116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.   After being deployed to Qatar in 2016, Captain Bowen then volunteered  for an assignment in Afghanistan, where she earned a Combat Action  Badge. Her superiors say that she has ``demonstrated the absolute  ability to lead soldiers in close combat.''   Captain Bowen had already earned the distinction of becoming the  Virginia National Guard's first female infantry officer in 2019, and  when she spoke after accepting her command, Bowen encouraged other  women to follow in her footsteps and join an infantry unit. In short,  she said to jump in there, do it aggressively, and give it everything  you've got.   I wish Captain Bowen the best of luck in this new endeavor and know  that those under her command in Bravo Company are in good hands.                            ____________________
