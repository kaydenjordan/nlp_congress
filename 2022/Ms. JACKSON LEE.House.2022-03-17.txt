 Madam Speaker, I thank my friends and colleagues,  Chairman Johnson and Chairman Nadler, for this long overdue legislation  that we voted on last year; and, as well, to acknowledge the forced  arbitration legislation that was signed by the White House dealing with  sexual assault.   Now we have come full circle, so let me try to reinforce, because our  friends on the other side of the aisle--and I call them friends--not  only have it wrong, they have it upside down. It is completely  misconstrued as to what this legislation does.   And if you go out on the street corner and talk to any American they  will say, of course I want the FAIR Act, because forced arbitration  says to them that, in essence, you are obligated, you are indentured to  the contract that you signed to get a job, to buy a phone, to get that  big TV, and that you are not able to pursue your due process rights.   Now, this is a constitutional issue. The Fifth Amendment completely  indicates that you cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property  without due process of law, however you choose your due process of law.   We go on to the 14th Amendment; of course, part of the historic 13th,  14th and 15th Amendments, and it indicates that no State shall make or  enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of  citizens of the United States under this Constitution, which includes  the right to a trial by jury, nor shall any State deprive any person of  life, liberty, or property without due process again; and that you  would guarantee equal process and justice under the law.   So let me factually say, though the signing of any contract or  document is voluntary, often large corporations make it impossible to  use their product or be employed without agreeing to a contract with a  forced arbitration, making signing of the contract or document anything  but voluntary; and clearly, it has constitutional implications.   Something that should alarm all American consumers is that according  to a study commissioned by University of California Davis Law Review,  81 companies in the Fortune 100, including subsidiaries or relating  affiliates, have used arbitration agreements in connection with  consumer transaction.   Now let me be very clear. When you have a dispute, we are perfectly  happy for you, as the individual, part of the contract, to say to the  corporation, I don't care about my rights. I am going to throw myself  on the mercy of arbitration. And in doing so, you may subject yourself  to a limited decision, as Brian Flores was finding out.   Madam Speaker, let me tell you that American economic supremacy does  not stem from the contributions of modern-day oligarchs, billionaires,  CEOs, or the wealthy. It comes from the middle class. It comes from  those 60 million workers and countless others who put in an honest 8- hour day, five times a week, in the simple pursuit of trying to feed  their families and take care of their communities.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  generosity.   I oppose the upcoming amendment that talks about not excluding  unions. Unions have agreements between individuals. Unions have the  power, through their persons they represent, to vote yea or nay for  that contract. So if they vote yea or nay on that contract, their eyes  open on the arbitration, it is the union that will be protecting that  individual. They will not be in that process alone.   In the instance of an individual and the contracts that are signed,  they will be alone. But they will not be alone if the FAIR Act is  passed and the Constitution is upheld. That is why I support  enthusiastically the FAIR Act and oppose the amendment to be  forthcoming.  [[Page H3794]]    Pass the FAIR Act because justice and the Constitution requires it.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 963, ``The FAIR Act''  which prohibits a predispute arbitration agreement from being valid or  enforceable in an employment, consumer, antitrust, or civil rights  dispute.   Action on this legislation is long overdue considering the long  history of the problems caused by forced arbitration. The FAIR Act was  passed by the House in the 116th Congress, so I hope we can pass it  again now and that the Senate will do the same this time so we can  finally resolve this problem.   Forced arbitration is typically due to a clause in a contract that  takes away employees' and consumers' rights to pursue litigation in the  case their legal rights are violated. 60 million American employees and  myriad consumers are unfairly, and usually unknowingly, subjected to  its limitation of their legal rights.   Though the signing of any contract or document is voluntary, often  large corporations make it impossible to use their product or be  employed without agreeing to a contract with a forced arbitration  clause, making signing of the contract or document anything but  voluntary.   Something that should alarm all American consumers is that, according  to a study commissioned by the University of California Davis Law  Review, 81 companies in the Fortune 100, including subsidiaries or  related affiliates, have used arbitration agreements in connection with  consumer transactions.   The study also found that possibly two-thirds of American households  are covered by consumer based forced arbitration agreements.   This means nearly 86 million American households have their  Constitutional right of access to the judicial system restricted.   For American employees, the numbers are also staggering. Similarly,  60 million American employees are subject to forced arbitration  agreements of which they are often unaware until a dispute arises for  which they seek judicial redress.   The extensive reach of arbitration clauses is only increasing, with  the Economic Policy Institute estimating 80 percent of private sector  nonunion workers being subject to forced arbitration clauses by 2024.   Madam Speaker, American economic supremacy does not stem from the  contributions of modern-day oligarchs, billionaires, CEOs, or the  wealthy; it comes from the middle class. It comes from those 60 million  workers and countless others who put in an honest 8-hour day 5 times a  week in the simple pursuit of trying to feed their families and take  care of their communities.   The fact that so many of these hard-working Americans are having  their legal rights taken away without them knowing it is morally  reprehensible and must be put to an end. The FAIR Act remedies that 1  problem.   In addition to being sound policy, the FAIR Act promotes racial  equity in our rapidly diversifying country and workforce.   Another study from the EPI found 59.1 percent of African American  workers (7.5 million workers) are subject to mandatory arbitration, as  are female workers (at 57.6 percent).   Unfortunately, this is not surprising considering African Americans  and women are two of the most historically discriminated against groups  in the United States.   Forced arbitration continues the struggles of African Americans in  the workplace, from slavery, sharecropping, and redlining to ongoing  segregation, discrimination, racism, and voter suppression. As these  statistics show, our struggle for equity in the workplace continues.   We are exhausted, yet we remain in the fight. We must continue to set  right historical wrongs, and the FAIR Act provides us an avenue to do  so.   Fairness in the workplace for women is also further remediated by  this legislation. In this country, we have a disgraceful wage gap  between men and women of 82 cents to the dollar, according to the  latest Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.   As a Member of the Women's Caucus, I have been fighting for pay  equity for American women since before I arrived here as a  Representative in 1995, and I believe that equal pay for equal work is  a simple matter of justice.   Wage disparities are not simply a result of women's education levels  or life choices. In fact, the pay gap between college educated men and  women starts as soon as they enter the workplace and expands shortly  thereafter. Women can have the same background, work in the same field,  and perform the same functional position, yet still be grossly  underpaid. Disproportionately subjecting women to forced arbitration is  yet another stain on this country's historical attitude towards women  in the workforce.   I have consistently been a proud sponsor and cosponsor of legislation  that expands legal rights, creates a more level playing field, and  erodes long standing social disparities.   The FAIR Act achieves these goals, and I therefore urge my colleagues  to support the FAIR Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Massachusetts for his leadership.   How honored I am to be on the floor with Richard Neal, who had a  major and forceful engagement in bringing about the recognition of  those who were murdered in 1972.   I thank my friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle for  joining in  [[Page H3801]]  this bipartisan effort, and I reenforce Chairman Neal's comments about  the bipartisan celebration of this great day and the great people of  Ireland.   I am happy to be on the floor on St. Patrick's Day, and I wish all of  my constituents, and friends across the nation of the great green, a  happy St. Patrick's Day. But I come to make sure this day, Bloody  Sunday, is certainly not forgotten.   I am so glad Chairman Neal indicated its inspiration came from the  toil and the soldiers on the battlefield, Madam Speaker, our beloved  friend John Lewis, in the civil rights movement, and those who are  willing to sacrifice for their belief and justice.   I am so glad that we ultimately found the truth to recognize John  ``Jackie'' Duddy, Patrick ``Paddy'' Doherty, Bernard ``Barney''  McGuigan, Hugh Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, Michael Kelly, John Young,  William Nash, Michael McDaid, James ``Jim'' Wray, Gerald Donaghy,  Gerald McKinney, William ``Willie'' McKinney, and John Johnston, who  tragically lost their lives.   As this resolution indicates, British soldiers came and shot them  down. They did not understand their seeking of dignity and the rights  that they had. So Bloody Sunday almost tracked some of the terrible  issues that we had, but these people died and were injured, and many  families for decades were denied truth.   I think it is very important that we stand on the floor today in a  bipartisan way to honor that and to applaud Prime Minister David  Cameron, who went to the House of Commons and apologized and said that  the events that took place on Bloody Sunday were unjustified,  unjustifiable, and wrong.    Madam Speaker, how sad and maybe even criminal it  was to ignore this for so many years. How grateful we would be when  those who died for their rights, for justice, for equality, the very  same tenets we all adhere to here in the United States.   Let me draw in now and conclude my remarks by joining in the  resolution that urges the European Union, including the Republic of  Ireland and the United Kingdom, to act in good faith with regard to  negotiations around Brexit and the implementation of the Northern  Ireland Protocol. But more importantly, let me emphasize the importance  of the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and  Ireland. Let me track the fact that we believe in justice, we believe  in civil rights, and we believe in the idea of the speech of  empowerment and the speech of democracy.   Let us not resort to bloodiness and the killing of those who simply  seek to speak for justice for them and their families.   Today, in commemoration of Bloody Sunday, never again.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 888, which expresses the  hope for justice for the victims of Bloody Sunday, one of the most  tragic of days during the Troubles, on its 50th anniversary, as well as  acknowledging the progress made in fostering peace in Northern Ireland  and on the island of Ireland in recent decades.   On January 30, 1972, 26 unarmed civilians were shot by British  soldiers during a protest that began peacefully in Derry, resulting in  the death of 14 individuals in a massacre now known as Bloody Sunday,  or the Bogside Massacre.   Bloody Sunday is one of the most significant and deadly injustices to  take place during the Troubles--also known as the Northern Ireland  conflict--and describes the struggle between Irish Roman Catholics and  British who sided with Irish Protestants that lasted from the 1960s  until 1998.   None of the 26 unarmed people shot by British Army soldiers posed a  threat of causing death or serious injury, or were doing anything that  could justify their shooting.   The families of these victims were denied for decades an honest and  comprehensive assessment of the events that took place on Bloody  Sunday.   In 1998, after campaigns from the families of those injured and  killed on Bloody Sunday, a second inquiry was established by the  British Government, and it found without doubt that the shootings were  the result of wrongful actions taken by British soldiers.   The lack of accountability and justice provided to those who perished  and their families from this heinous use of force was unacceptable.  They deserved justice.   Accountability and justice for the victims of Bloody Sunday would  represent a step toward addressing Northern Ireland's legacy of  violence and promoting reconciliation.   This conflict was rooted in suppression, silencing the voices of  those who differ from you by taking away their freedoms and their  liberties.   As an African American woman in the United States, I know too well  the struggles of oppression.   The march led by our Beloved John Lewis from Selma to Montgomery,  Alabama that resulted in the brutal beating of marchers by police is  known as Bloody Sunday is a turning point in the civil rights struggle.   I stand with the victims of Bloody Sunday, because whenever  oppression happens anywhere around the world, and people risk losing  their freedoms and their liberty, I will always stand with them.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal and Congressmen  Doggett and Blumenauer for this important statement.   Slaughter is not a sufficient definition of what Putin and Putin's  war is doing to the innocent Ukrainian people.   I rise in strong support of totally removing from them normal trade  relations, as just a few weeks ago I was on  [[Page H3808]]  the border of Lithuania and Belarus, where the 30 to 40,000 Russian  troops were poised, poised, ready to move and to slaughter.   How outrageous, when babies are killed, when hospitals with pregnant  women, when a mother who lost her life because her pelvis was crushed,  her baby and herself died because of Putin.   They continue to slaughter. They continue to destroy historic places.  They continue to destroy hospitals and government buildings, and they  are not ceasing.   So glory to Ukraine. We must stand with them and realize that their  fight is our fight. As we in the civil rights movement experienced the  idea of lack of justice, we know that this does not even equate to the  violence that Russia is putting forth. I support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 7108, The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and  Belarus Act. The Act takes decisive action to respond to Russia's  continued unprovoked attacks on the people of Ukraine and holds Belarus  accountable for its support for Russia's aggression. This legislation  counters Russia's unconscionable actions and Belarus' complicity by  suspending normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus.   This legislation includes additional provisions to expand the United  States' trade tools to stop Russia's unacceptable and unjust war on  Ukraine and to hold Belarus accountable for its involvement.  Specifically, the bill:   Provides the President with time-limited authority to increase  tariffs on products of Russia and Belarus, until January 1, 2024;   Requires the U.S. Trade Representative to use the voice and influence  of the United States to seek suspension of Russia's participation in  the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to halt Belarus' WTO accession  and accession-related work; and   Provides the President with the authority to restore normal trade  relations with Russia and Belarus if these countries have ceased their  acts of aggression against Ukraine and other certain conditions are  met. Congress has the authority to overrule such decision through a  congressional disapproval process.   Since Vladimir Putin began this war, the United States has had a  relentless and devastating economic response in the form of sanctions.   Even prior to this legislation, the United States has already carried  out the following actions:   The connection to the U.S. financial system for Russia's largest  financial institution, Sberbank, including 25 subsidiaries, has been  severed by imposing correspondent and payable-through account  sanctions. This action restricts Sberbank's access to transactions made  in the dollar. Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia, holds nearly  one-third of the overall Russian banking sector's assets, is heavily  connected to the global financial system, and is systemically critical  to the Russian financial system.   Russia's second largest financial institution, VTB Bank (VTB),  including 20 subsidiaries, have been appropriately subject to full  blocking sanctions. This action freezes all of VTB's assets touching  the U.S financial system and prohibits U.S. persons from dealing with  them. VTB holds nearly one-fifth of the overall Russian banking  sector's assets, is heavily exposed to the U.S. and western financial  systems and is systemically critical to the Russian financial system.   Full blocking sanctions also extend to the three other major Russian  financial institutions: Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC, and  Novikombank- and 34 subsidiaries. These sanctions freeze any of these  institutions' assets touching the U.S financial system and prohibit  U.S. persons from dealing with them. These financial institutions play  a significant role in the Russian economy.   New debt and equity restrictions have been imposed on thirteen of the  most critical major Russian enterprises and entities. This includes  restrictions on all transactions in, provision of financing for, and  other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new  equity issued by thirteen Russian state-owned enterprises and entities:  Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian  Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, Rostelecom,  RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. These entities,  including companies critical to the Russian economy with estimated  assets of nearly $1.4 trillion, are no longer able to raise money  through the U.S. market--a key source of capital and revenue  generation, which limits the Kremlin's ability to raise money for its  activity.   There are additional full blocking sanctions on Russian elites and  their family members: Sergei Ivanov (and his son, Sergei), Nikolai  Patrushev (and his son Andrey), Igor Sechin (and his son Ivan), Andrey  Puchkov, Yuriy Solviev (and two real estate companies he owns), Galina  Ulyutina, and Alexander Vedyakhin. This action includes individuals who  have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian state, and have  elevated their family members into some of the highest position of  powers in the country. It also includes oligarchs who sit atop Russia's  largest financial institutions and are responsible for providing the  resources necessary to support Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This action  follows up on yesterday's action targeting Russian elites and their  family members and cuts them off from the U.S. financial system,  freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their  travel to the United States.   Costs on Belarus for supporting a further invasion of Ukraine by  sanctioning 24 Belarusian individuals and entities, including targeting  Belarus' military and financial capabilities by sanctioning two  significant Belarusian state-owned banks, nine defense firms, and seven  regime-connected official and elites have been enacted.   Sweeping restrictions have been implemented on Russia's military to  strike a blow to Putin's military and strategic ambitions. This  includes measures against military end users, including the Russian  Ministry of Defense. Exports of nearly all U.S. items and items  produced in foreign countries using certain U.S.-origin software,  technology, or equipment will be restricted to targeted military end  users. These comprehensive restrictions apply to the Russian Ministry  of Defense, including the Armed Forces of Russia, wherever located.   Russia-wide restrictions to choke off Russia's import of  technological goods critical to a diversified economy and Putin's  ability to project power are also present. This includes Russia-wide  denial of exports of sensitive technology, primarily targeting the  Russian defense, aviation, and maritime sectors to cut off Russia's  access to cutting-edge technology. In addition to sweeping restrictions  on the Russian-defense sector, the United States government will impose  Russia-wide restrictions on sensitive U.S. technologies produced in  foreign countries using U.S.-origin software, technology, or equipment.  This includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors,  telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation,  avionics and maritime technologies. These severe and sustained controls  will cut off Russia's access to cutting edge technology.   Historical multilateral cooperation serves as a force multiplier in  restricting more than $50 billion in key inputs to Russia--impacting  far more than that in Russia's production. As a result of this  multilateral coordination, the United States has provided an exemption  for other countries that adopt equally stringent measures. Countries  that adopt substantially similar export restrictions are exempted from  new U.S. licensing requirements for items produced in their countries.  The European Union, Australia, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and the  United Kingdom, have already communicated their plans for parallel  actions. This unprecedented coordination significantly expands the  scope of restrictions on Russia. Further engagement with Allies and  partners will continue to maximize the impact on Russia's military  capabilities.   Madam Speaker, taking further action against both Russia and Belarus  on the international stage is of the utmost necessity in showing our  European allies that we are steadfast in our opposition to this bloody  war. The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act  does exactly that symbolically and literally, and I am confident it  will play a role in ending this war.   It is for that reason, Madam Speaker, that I rise in strong support  of the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act  and urge my colleagues support for the Act.    Mr. Speaker, earlier today during the debate dealing  with removing the normal trade relations from Russia and Belarus, I  indicated that ``slaughter'' is too nice a word to describe the actions  of Vladimir Putin against the innocent people of Ukraine. I insist on  that definition. One Member rose and said it was genocide. Certainly,  it is near that devastating and deadly system that we have seen used  elsewhere.   As Russian soldiers come home in body bags and as Russian mothers  begin to mourn, I make this plea to the Russian people: This is an  illegal war. Putin is a war criminal. We can only now count on you. The  Western world has done every single thing that they can do to stop the  pillage, the violence, the killing of pregnant women, the slaughtering  of babies in the street.   It is time now for the Russian people to unleash the shackles around  your mind and your hands, to be able to stand up and say to Putin--who  is now leading your country into an end that you will never, never,  never forget or be forgiven for.   Why don't you stand up and speak eloquently to stop this violence and  this war, to ask for peace, to get to the peace table, and make a  difference in Russia saving lives, and for the people of Ukraine.                            ____________________
