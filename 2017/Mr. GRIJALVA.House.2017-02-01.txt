 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which would put coal  company profits ahead of clean water and public health. The stream  protection rule has been in development for 7 years and puts in place  modest, commonsense protections for people who live near coal mines.   This isn't just a rule to protect streams. This is a rule to protect  people's health, to protect people's homes, and to protect the clean  water that they rely on. These folks felt strongly enough about this  rule to submit public comments.   The rule is designed to protect people like Donetta from West  Virginia, who nearly lost her life when chemicals from coal fields  found their way into her water supply and interacted with her  medication in such a way that it nearly destroyed her liver.   The rule is designed to protect people like John from Alabama, who  reports lakes that have turned gray and streams that have turned  orange.   This rule is designed to protect people like David from Tennessee,  who watched a creek near his grandmother's home become lifeless due to  strip mining nearby.   This rule is designed to protect people like Josh from North  Carolina, who can no longer fish in the streams near a family home and  wants coal companies to be held accountable for the damage that they  did.   This rule is designed to protect people like Jonita from Kentucky, a  coal miner's daughter whose water supply is tainted with heavy metal  and other toxins from coal sludge. She wrote: ``Coal put the food on my  table. It also put the poison in my water. Reasonable trade-off?''   I don't believe that Jonita or anyone else should have to make that  trade-off. No one's water supply should be sacrificed in the name of  higher bonuses for coal company CEOs. Those coal executives have made  it their overriding goal to kill this regulation; and after spending  nearly $50 million on political campaign contributions over the past 6  years, they now have a Congress and a President to do it.   So for the first time in 16 years and just the second time ever,  Republicans are going back to Newt Gingrich's playbook and trying to  successfully use the Congressional Review Act simply because the coal  industry feels like it shouldn't be held accountable.   But as we know, this is only the first of five regulations that we  will be repealing just this week. Later today, they are going to get  rid of the rule  [[Page H841]]  that requires increased transparency on the part of oil, gas, and the  mining industry. Later this week, we will be fighting for the right of  oil and gas companies to pollute the air with methane.   This is the Republican agenda in the age of Trump; an attack on clean  water, an attack on clean air, an attack on transparency, and an attack  on human health. If you are a CEO or a wealthy Republican donor, this  is great news; and you will love the next couple of years. But if you  are an ordinary American that depends on their government to hold  companies accountable through tough but fair enforcement of  regulations, you should be extremely worried.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lowenthal), the ranking member of the Committee on  Natural Resources' Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals Resources.    Mr. Speaker, it should be noted for the record that the  Republican majority conducted a 4-year investigation into the  development of this rule, holding 12 hearings, issuing two subpoenas,  collecting 25 hours of audio recordings and 13,500 pages of documents,  but were unable to uncover any political interference or misconduct in  the development of this rule.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, if there is a war on coal, it is being led  by the natural gas industry who produces a cheaper product at a lower  cost. And if there is any trouble that coal is in, it is directly  attributed to the free market and that competition.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Huffman), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water, Power and  Oceans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin), the ranking member of the  Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  resolution to overrule the stream protection rule, just as I would  oppose any measure that threatened the quality of our drinking water.   Clean drinking water is a fundamental health need, and meeting that  need is one of our most basic responsibilities in this Congress. We  must not put special interests ahead of the health of our constituents.   The stream protection rule is very simple:   It strengthens and clarifies existing water quality protections with  respect to mining.   It requires that affected streams be restored when mining is  finished.   It gives communities accurate information about water quality so they  can best protect themselves from pollution.   Mr. Speaker, these protections are not onerous, but their benefits  are vast.   We have seen in Flint, Michigan, and elsewhere the painful  consequences when people lack access to safe drinking water. We must do  more to prevent that kind of suffering and damage. Nixing this rule  would, instead, mean that we are doing less.   The stream protection rule is the product of a careful year's-long  process. Countless stakeholders participated at two dozen public  meetings, and regulators received tens of thousands of public comments.   Mr. Speaker, this rule was crafted in the sunshine, but we are about  to overrule it in the dead of night. After all of that work, this  resolution of disapproval did not even receive a committee hearing.   Mr. Speaker, if this body is seriously going to weaken vital drinking  water protections, the American people deserve ample opportunities to  inform themselves and to make their voices heard. This rushed-through  proposal denies them that opportunity.   I find this measure to be very disturbing, and I find the process  concerning. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not  to go down this path.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).    I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H845]]         I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H845]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to read a few lines from letters of opposition to this  resolution. The first comes from a coalition of 75 national and local  environmental groups who are strongly opposed to this bill.   They write: ``This long awaited rule provides local communities with  information they desperately need about water pollution caused by  nearby coal mining operations, and includes several important  protections for clean water and the health of communities surrounding  coal mining operations. Any attack on the safeguards in the Stream  Protection Rule is an attack on clean water and should be opposed.''   Wildlife and sportsman groups are also opposed.   The National Wildlife Federation writes: ``The Stream Protection Rule  is an important water quality rule for our nation. It seeks to empower  State regulatory authorities to ensure coal mining and reclamation best  practices, taking into account their unique regional distinctions and  impacts to local communities and wildlife.   ``. . . any efforts to undermine the safeguards afforded by the  finalized Stream Protection Rule, a rule with years of stakeholder  outreach and engagement, would be an attack on clean water and should  be opposed.''   Travel Unlimited says: ``The rule is a worthy, sensible effort to  reduce the huge impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining . . . on our  Appalachian streams and rivers.''   And it goes on and on. They all go on to point out the specific  impact of mountaintop removal mining on fishing and wildlife and  sportsmen.   ``Mountaintop removal mining practices create a survival risk for  brook trout and other wild trout populations, and impede efforts to  restore brook trout in already degraded watersheds.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The use of the Congressional Review Act has been categorized as  reckless and extreme. The CRA was going to cause significant and  lasting harm.   If successful, two things are going to happen: the regulation is void  and the agency is prohibited from issuing another similar rule ever  again.   I mention that because this is about health. It is about the health  of the people living around those mining operations and it is about  mountaintop removal and the documented analysis  [[Page H846]]  that proves that it is a danger to health. It contaminates water and it  is destructive to the environment.   It is curious that we had 13 hearings--I stand corrected--and an  investigation that went on in perpetuity, it seemed like. Yet, once the  rule was finalized and published in 2015, we never had another hearing  on the item again, which begs the question: If the whole point was to  delay and prevent this rule from ever taking effect and, more  importantly, make it susceptible to the Congressional Review Act,  mission accomplished for the majority.   But the long-term consequences of using the CRA on a rule that is  designed to protect people's health, on a rule that is designed to make  coal companies be transparent and disclose to the public, on a rule  that every scientific analysis and the science is clear that this rule  was indeed there to protect both people and communities, I think that  is the permanent harm being done by this action today--denying the  people in those communities to return to past practices that created  the problem that we are dealing with and that this rule attempted to  address that created that problem.   Now we return to those times where unregulated mountaintop removal  causes the destruction to both human beings and the environment that we  see as a legacy. I think it is not only disrespectful to the people of  those regions, but it, again, puts their health and the well-being of  both the environment and humanity in that area at major risk. It is not  only reckless and extreme to use the CRA, it is also dangerous.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our opposition to this action being proposed by the  Republicans to eliminate the stream protection rule is, indeed, an  action that goes against fundamental science, goes against the public  health of the American people in those communities, and, overall, takes  the Congressional Review Act and uses it as a bludgeon to keep  generations and generations in those areas at risk in their health,  their water, and the general environment in the area.  [[Page H847]]    The issue of cost is an issue that comes up. The loss of jobs has  been the creation of competition, not because of any proposed rule.   Second of all, when we were dealing with the horrors of black lung,  we were dealing with issues of mine safety for coal miners and the  struggles that their unions had to go through to get mine safety and  healthcare protection for their workers.   At the time, I am sure, those were considered cost factors and why  not do it. The cost factor here is about human life and it is about  protection of water. I would suggest that that should be the priority  of this Congress and not emboldening or enriching the mine operators  and their profit line.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my friend.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have been involved for 28 years on the  Natural Resources Committee on these issues.   What we are talking about today is simple here. Yes, it is cheaper.  If you blow the top off a mountain and you dump it in the valley and  you bury a stream, it is cheaper. Okay.   Is that what we are all about here? The most destructive, least  environmentally responsible, but cheapest way of doing things?   If we are going to set the precedent here, I can think of a whole lot  of other areas that relate to clean water, clean air, and things that  are important to the American people and the sustainability of our  environment that will go away because it would be cheaper. If we can  just dump the waste out the back door of the factory, that is cheaper.                                time  1500    If we can just put whatever we want up the stack and people wear gas  masks, that is cheaper. That is the major argument we are hearing  today. This rule, a 100-foot buffer--a 100-foot buffer--for toxic  materials around streams is too expensive. It is cheaper to blow the  top off the mountain, get the coal out, and take all the overburden and  other assorted stuff and dump it in the valley and bury the stream.   The only problem is then it rains. What happens when it rains? Well,  you can either cap that whole thing and make it impermeable and then  have big runoff downstream or, as it generally happens, the water  percolates down through all the waste and becomes a toxic flow.   Now, you say, well, these are only seasonal streams. Well, seasonal  streams run into other streams. What happens when you get those toxic  flows is you kill the other streams. I am seeing this actually in my  district, not from a coal mine, but from a foreign corporation which  improperly mined and went bankrupt and left us with the waste. I have  seen the miles of stream that are killed from the toxics that are  leaching out from the overburden from the mining that is done. This is  an absurd place to say we are overregulated.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote. I think the  arguments have been made. The precedent being set tonight by this House  is a dangerous and extreme precedent that we will all come to regret. I  urge a ``no'' vote.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
