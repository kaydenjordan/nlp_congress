 Mr. President, today I stand before you to  express my gratitude and admiration for the exceptional students who  joined our team as fall interns in 2023. These talented young women and  men brought a unique blend of enthusiasm, dedication, and a passion for  making a difference to my offices in Washington, DC, office and across  the State of Nebraska.   Our interns have consistently shown a motivation to learn and a  strong commitment to our State. Their presence has not only enriched  our workspace, but also inspired my team and me. As the torchbearers of  the next generation, their spirit and determination fill us with  anticipation for what the future holds.   As they leave our office, I want to take a moment to extend my  sincerest thanks to: Sarah Gregory, Johnathan Smith, Stephen Trainer,  and Kayla Fink, who served in my Washington, DC, office; Abbie Russman,  and Ava Verzani, who served in my Omaha office; and Reagan Connelly,  who served in my Lincoln office.   Your dedication and contributions have truly made our team stronger.  I hope you will carry the lessons learned here into your bright  futures. Congratulations and best of luck.                            ____________________
