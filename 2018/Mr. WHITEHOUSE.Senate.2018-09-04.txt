 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am very grateful to my colleague  from New Mexico, Senator Udall, for joining me today for my 218th  ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. Senator Udall is a formidable advocate for  conserving public lands and protecting endangered species--helping to  ensure that future generations will inherit a healthy and beautiful  planet. These lands and creatures Senator Udall fights so hard to  protect are under direct attack from the current administration and the  heavy hand of industry that guides it both through regulatory rollbacks  and other efforts to weaken protections for special places and special  wildlife. These species and places are also under siege from the  consequences of climate change.   Just last week, both the Washington Post and The Atlantic reported on  a recent study in the prestigious journal Science. The titles of their  articles were foreboding--``Climate change could render many of Earth's  ecosystems unrecognizable'' from the Washington Post and ``No Ecosystem  on Earth Is Safe from Climate Change'' from The Atlantic. The study  looked at historic vegetation and temperature records to predict how  global warming will transform our world.   Dr. Stephen Jackson, a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey and  the lead author, told The Atlantic:         Anywhere on the globe, the more you change climate, the       more likely you are to see major ecological change. Having       this kind of change occur at such a massive scale in such a       short period of time is going to create unprecedented       challenges.    Dr. Dorothy Peteet, a researcher with NASA who commented on the  article, said: ``There are notable effects of climate change we are  seeing today . . . and they will probably be much more exacerbated in  the future.''   From the mountains to the sea, from the North Pole to the South,  climate change is wreaking havoc on our natural systems and the living  creatures that rely on them for survival. A study from Global Change  Biology earlier this year found ``a strong association between rapid  climate warming and declines of bird and mammal populations . . .  showing that population declines have been greatest in areas that have  experienced most rapid warming.''   Birds are often seen as sentinels of an ecosystem's health and are  especially vulnerable to climate change. In particular, migratory  birds, some of which travel thousands of miles each year to breed, rely  on a delicate balance of temperature cues and food availability to  successfully make their impressive journeys.   Here on the east coast, Delaware Bay enjoys an annual visit from the  rufa red knot, a bird with a body not larger than a teacup but whose  wings carry it on a more than 9,000-mile journey from Tierra del Fuego  on the southern tip of South America to the Canadian Arctic. After  spending the summer nesting in the north, they make their return trip  back south to winter in the Southern Hemisphere.   On the northward journey, the red knots make a straight leg from the  coast of Brazil to Delaware Bay. Think about that. These tiny birds  take off from the coast of Brazil, and they fly all the way to Delaware  Bay. They lose as much as half their body weight on this arduous trip,  but Mother Nature provides a bounty for them upon their arrival.   Delaware Bay is the largest horseshoe crab spawning area in the  world, and each May, millions of horseshoe crabs take part in a mating  ritual that predates the dinosaurs. Each female horseshoe crab can lay  up to 90,000 eggs, and horseshoe crab eggs make excellent fuel for  little birds relishing a pause in their long journey. But warming  waters and shifting seasons threaten to knock the timing of both  species' cycles out of whack. If the environmental signal comes too  early or too late and these little birds fly all that way and they get  to Delaware Bay and the horseshoe crabs aren't there, that will shake  the species.   Predictability in seasonal changes affects the survival of much of  the world's wildlife. In 2014, the National Audubon Society published a  comprehensive review of how climate change would affect the ranges of  nearly 600 North American bird species. More than half of the species  studied are at risk of losing more than 50 percent of their current  range to climate change by 2080. Around a quarter of the species  studied could see their range shrink that much by 2050.   Mr. President, may I interrupt my remarks for a moment? I see the  minority leader on the floor. If he seeks recognition, Senator Udall  and I have time to do a pair of climate speeches. I am more than happy  to interrupt and have him do what he needs to do.   I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the leader's  remarks, I be recognized and resume my remarks and that at the  conclusion of them, Senator Udall be recognized.    Mr. President, as I resume my remarks, we head  westward to the tallest peaks of the Rockies, where, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey, the Northern Rocky Mountains have been warming  more than three times as fast as the global average over the past 100  years.   A 2014 Union of Concerned Scientists report warned that the Rocky  Mountains will ``become even hotter and drier,'' which will lead to  increased  [[Page S6016]]  wildfire, reduced snowpack, and declines in the keystone trees that  define the Rocky Mountain forests.   A recent study by U.S. Forest Service and Oregon State University  researchers found that species like the pygmy rabbit, wolverine, Canada  lynx, and snowshoe hare, which have specific habitat requirements, will  be particularly vulnerable. Some mountain amphibians are even at risk  from a harmful, invasive fungus that thrives in warmer temperatures.   The increased spread of disease and invasive species is a recurring  theme of climate change. Animals and plants that are already stressed  from depleted food and changing temperatures are more susceptible to  disease, and stressed ecosystems leave openings for invasive species to  move in and take over. After hitting U.S. shores in the early 2000s in  wood packing material, the invasive and injurious emerald ash borer has  spread to around 30 States and has destroyed tens of millions of ash  trees in its wake. In July, my Rhode Island Department of Environmental  Management discovered this invasive species in our State.   We look seaward from Rhode Island, and coastal States like ours are  facing a red menace in their waters--the harmful algae blooms known as  red tide. Florida is battling a devastating toxic algae bloom that has,  according to Quartz, ``killed masses of fish, 12 dolphins, more than  500 manatees, 300 sea turtles, countless horseshoe crabs, [and] a whale  shark'' as of August 22. Those were just the ones whose bodies came  ashore. Locals and tourists alike are greeted with decaying marine life  along the docks and beaches and with air that is tainted with the  algae's toxins. Quartz writes that this year's ``red tide in Florida  doesn't just make the issue of global warming visible; it's an all-out  sensory onslaught.''   Though algal blooms occur annually in Florida, this year's bloom is a  harbinger of the shifting reality of climate change. The Washington  Post notes: ``As air and ocean temperatures increase, the environment  becomes more hospitable to toxic algal blooms.''    In addition to these warmer water temperatures, climate change also  spurs heavy downpours, which wash more fertilizer from farms and lawns  into the water, providing nutrients that spur the growth of the algae.  Sea level rise expands the area of shallow coastal waters, where warm  temperatures and ample sunshine bolster growing algae.   The oceans are experiencing ``marine heat waves.'' According to a  recent review in the prestigious scientific journal Nature, these  extended periods of elevated sea-surface temperatures ``have caused  changes in biological production, toxic algal blooms, regime shifts in  reef communities, mass coral bleaching, and mortalities of commercially  important fish species, with cascading impacts on economies and  societies.''   That is ``science-ese'' for a pretty tough formula for coastal  communities.   Indeed, a marine heat wave is responsible for the dramatic coral  bleaching that occurred in the Great Barrier Reef, killing about half  of the reef since 2016. In recent weeks, San Diego recorded its highest  seawater temperature, around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, since measurements  started in 1916.   The Nature study attributed 87 percent of modern marine heat waves to  human-caused climate change. They warn that these heat waves ``will  become very frequent under global warming, probably pushing marine  organisms and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience and even  beyond.'' Couple these extreme heat spells with ocean acidification,  deoxygenation, and changes in ocean circulation and currents, and you  are looking at a perfect storm for coral reefs, fisheries, and ocean  wildlife.   Marine and atmospheric heat waves are also contributing to the rapid  opening of Arctic sea ice. The iconic images of starving polar bears  have brought this concern home for many, but sea ice also provides  protection for narwhals, hosts algae that feed Arctic cod and whales,  and provides an interstate highway of sorts for wolf and fox  populations. This ice is the crux of the Arctic ecosystem, and it is  falling apart.   For the first time since scientists started monitoring the Arctic's  sea ice in the 1970s, the waters north of Greenland are breaking  through the usually permanently frozen ice cover. Until now, this area  had been assumed to be the Arctic ice's stronghold--the strongest and  oldest ice plane in the Arctic. But spikes of warm temperatures earlier  this year allowed the weakened ice to be pushed from shore, leaving it  vulnerable to wind and waves.   Dr. Walt Meier, with the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center,  called this loss of sea ice ``a pretty dramatic indication of the  transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.'' A researcher  with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute put it even simpler,  calling it ``nice and scary.''   I will now yield to my friend the Senator from New Mexico in the  hopes that at some point this body will find the sense and the courage  to address this problem as we see its manifestations from north to  south, from pole to pole, and from the depths of the sea to our highest  mountaintops.   I yield the floor.
