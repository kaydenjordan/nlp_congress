 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, the gentleman  from Minnesota, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 544. This legislation  ensures that the approximately $1 billion left in Choice funding is  spent on the critical mission of providing veterans timely access to  care.   It would be an abdication of our responsibility to veterans if we  allowed this money to go back to the Treasury instead of going to those  who need and deserve our support.   I appreciate the efforts from my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for advancing this legislation.   The Choice Act was designed as a rapid response to the veteran wait  time crisis, but its framework and implementation has been deeply  flawed. Objective analyses found that it is not meaningfully reducing  veterans' wait times, and its arbitrary standards have added a layer of  confusion for both patients and providers.   There is bipartisan consensus that these concerns must be addressed  when the Choice Act sunsets and the funding expires. We can and must do  a better job of prioritizing and streamlining veterans' access to care  in the community. We can and must do better than the existing Choice  Act.   Now, the Choice Act was a temporary emergency measure to address an  unacceptable crisis. Unfortunately, it contained language that  undermined protections against workplace discrimination for Federal  contractors. The next iteration of this law cannot subvert the rights  of those who treat and serve our veterans.   The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs continues to be a  vital tool for ensuring fairness and equality in the workplace. It  should apply to everyone that does business with the Federal Government  because the Federal Government cannot endorse discrimination of any  kind.   I will fight to ensure that this committee and this Congress restores  their commitment to equality and fairness as we develop a more  streamlined and thoughtful method for connecting veterans with  community care.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter echoing these concerns  from the Human Rights Campaign, the National Women's Law Center, The  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National  Partnership for Women & Families.                                                      April 5, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write to express our serious       concerns about H.R. 369/S. 544, which would eliminate the       sunset of the Veterans Choice Program. The Veterans Choice       Program currently includes a provision exempting it from       oversight by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance       Programs (OFCCP). This has diminished civil rights       protections when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)       enters into federal contracts for veterans' health care       services. The Veterans Choice Program was always intended to       be a temporary solution to ease the health care access crisis       faced by the veterans receiving care through the VA. We fear       that removing the sunset will open the door to extension of       the program, including extending the provision that strips       critical equal employment opportunity protections from the       men and women serving our nation's veterans. OFCCP must have       full jurisdiction to protect against employment       discrimination and promote equal employment opportunities.        The antidiscrimination rules enforced by OFCCP ensure that       federal contract dollars further equal employment opportunity       and are not used to subsidize unlawful discrimination. OFCCP       plays a unique and vital role in combating unlawful       employment discrimination by federal contractors on the basis       of sex, race, national origin, religion, color, sexual       orientation, gender identity, and disability. It also       enforces the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance       Act, or VEVRAA, which requires nondiscrimination and       affirmative action for special and disabled veterans of any       war, campaign, or expedition in which a campaign badge has       been authorized. In addition, OFCCP guides contractors and       subcontractors on affirmatively promoting equal opportunity       in the workplace and promotes fair and nondiscriminatory       federal contractor workplaces. Many of its regulations       require contractors to take affirmative steps to expand the       pool of individuals from which it recruits, and evaluate       their own practices to identify and address conduct that       limits equal employment opportunities for protected classes       of workers. By conducting compliance audits and systemic       investigations, through its data collection and investigative       authority, OFCCP can aid contractors in identifying and       resolving practices that limit equal employment       opportunities, without relying solely on individuals who are       willing to risk retaliation to challenge unfair employment       practices. OFCCP's historic and current role in ensuring       artificial barriers do not restrict employment based on sex,       race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation,       gender identity, disability, or veteran status has improved       opportunities for a wide range of workers across the country       and has ensured that federal tax dollars do not subsidize       discrimination.        Carving out the VA provider agreements from these       antidiscrimination protections, affirmative action rules, and       data reporting requirements has the effect of narrowing       employment opportunities for women, people of color, people       with disabilities, veterans, and LGBT individuals and removes       critical tools for ending employment discrimination and       harassment. Extending the provision that weakens these       protections ultimately threatens harm not only to workers,       but to those who depend on them for care.        There is no appreciable administrative burden that       justifies continuing to suspend these protections and       requirements. Federal contractors and subcontractors with       less than 50 employees and $50,000 in contracts or       subcontracts are not covered by OFCCP's affirmative action       requirements. More than 94 percent of health care and social       assistance firms had fewer than 50 employees in 2009. The       larger providers, those with 50 or more employees and $50,000       or more in federal contracts, should be well-equipped to meet       the minimal administrative obligations associated with       maintaining an affirmative action plan.        The carve-out of VA contractors from the employment       discrimination rules applicable to federal contractors not       only has a detrimental impact on the workforces affected, but       sends a disturbing message that ensuring fair treatment for       women, people of color, LGBT people, veterans, and people       with disabilities is unnecessary and inconsequential. It sets       a precedent for future carve-outs and represents a step       backward from equal opportunity. Any continuation of the       Veterans Choice Program must ensure OFCCP jurisdiction to       enforce the antidiscrimination rules and other equal       employment opportunity protections for these providers.
