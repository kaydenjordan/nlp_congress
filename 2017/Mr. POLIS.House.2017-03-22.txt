 Mr. Speaker, I have a privileged resolution at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.   The Clerk read as follows:   Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and balances,  Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of  government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public  interest is placed first;   Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since  Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public;   Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because  they contain highly instructive information including whether the  candidate can be influenced by foreign entities and reveal any  conflicts of interest;   Whereas, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution states that no  person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without  the consent of Congress, accept any present, emolument, Office or  Title, of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or foreign State;  [[Page H2309]]    Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns is important  towards investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election,  understanding the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation  and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any  partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing  agreements with Russia or Russian nationals, formally or informally  associated with Vladmir Putin;   Whereas, The New York Times has reported that President Trump's close  senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and  General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal  Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation;   Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told  Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016, that ``there  were contacts'' with Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, and it has been  reported that members of President Trump's inner circle were in contact  with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign;   Whereas, General Michael Flynn, former national security adviser of  President Trump, received almost $68,000 in fees and expenses from  Russian entities in 2015, including by an entity recognized by U.S.  intelligence agencies as an arm of the Russian Government;   Whereas, FBI Director Comey stated in the Select Intelligence  Committee hearing on the Russian interference with the November 2016  election that ``there is no information to support those tweets,''  relating to President Trump's allegations that President Obama  illegally wiretapped the Trump campaign;   Whereas, distracting investigators with dead-end leads and outrageous  statements is a common tactic from those with a guilty conscience or in  a deliberate effort to throw off investigators;   Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal  Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in  companies located in the United States and around the world;   Whereas, according to The Washington Post, the Trump International  Hotel in Washington, DC, has hired a ``director of diplomatic sales''  to generate high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic  delegations;   Whereas, the chairman on the Ways and Means Committee, Joint  Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority  to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the tax  code;   Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014  to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;   Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not  their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to  international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise:   Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives  shall:   One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald J.  Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive  session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under section  6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information  therein to the full House of Representatives;   Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding  tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their  tax returns.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Colorado wish to  present argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution  presents a question of the privileges of the House?    Yes, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized.    Yes, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized.    Yes, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized.    Yes, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized.    Yes, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized.    Mr. Speaker, under rule IX, clause 1, questions of the  privileges of the House and those affecting the rights of the House,  its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings, that is the  section we are talking about here today when we are talking about  privilege.   Mr. Speaker, truly, there is nothing more of a threat to the very  integrity of the legislative branch in the House than ignoring our duty  to provide a check and balance on the executive branch.   To restore the dignity of the House inherent in rule IX, clause 1, we  absolutely must use our authority to request that President Trump's tax  returns are given to the American people. The American people demand to  know the full scope of the President's financial background because  there are legitimate concerns which, frankly, were worsened this very  week by the hearing in the Select Intelligence Committee where the FBI  and NSA testified there is an ongoing investigation to determine if  there was coordination between the President's campaign and Russia.   The Internal Revenue Code already has language that lays out a path  for the Ways and Means Committee to obtain those tax returns and review  them in a respectful manner; and, frankly, there is precedent for that  provision being used. Fifty-one tax returns of Americans were requested  the last time they used it.   The House needs to demonstrate that our Members are listening to the  valid concerns about the integrity of the Republic. The House needs to  show that we care about protecting our Constitution and our system of  checks and balances.   When I look at the language, the privileges of the House, those  affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity,  and the integrity of its proceedings, I can see nothing that fits that  language more than this motion before you today.   Let's shine a light on the President's conflicts so we, as a  Congress, and the American people can judge what is occurring, where  the conflicts lie, whether his decisions are being made for himself or  his business interests or foreign interests or for the greater good of  the American people.   I call upon the Speaker to rule in favor of allowing this privileged  resolution to move forward and for the President to disclose his tax  returns immediately.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on  the question of order?    Point of parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary  inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, how many Members must come before the Speaker  establishing that this qualifies under the privileges of the House  affecting the integrity of the House until the Speaker rules in our  favor?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is prepared to rule.    Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Chair will rule favorably on  behalf of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado seeks to offer a  resolution as a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX.   As the Chair ruled on February 27, 2017; March 7, 2017; and March 15,  2017, the resolution directs the Committee on Ways and Means to meet  and consider an item of business under the procedures set forth in 26  U.S.C. 6103 and, therefore, does not qualify as a question of the  privileges of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the  Chair stand as the judgment of the House?                               Motion to Table     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on the motion to lay the appeal on the table will be  followed by 5-minute votes on the motion to recommit on H.R. 372 and  passage of H.R. 372, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 230,  nays 189, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 9, as follows:                               [Roll No. 182]                                 YEAS--230       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Black      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
