 Madam President, Mrs. Kelly Loeffler, of Georgia,  rejects the assertion by Mr. Chuck Schumer, of New York, that there is  no precedent for a Supreme Court justice being confirmed after July 1  in a Presidential election year.   In fact on three separate occasions, a duly-elected President  appointed and the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court justice in a  Presidential election year: John Hessin Clarke: confirmed by the Senate  on July 24, 1916; George Shiras, Jr.: confirmed by the Senate on July  26, 1892; and Melville Fuller: confirmed by the Senate on July 20,  1888.   The Constitution does not limit the President's nomination powers  during the fourth year of his term.   I support President Donald J. Trump's decision to nominate a justice  [[Page S5828]]  to the Supreme Court who will uphold the rule of law and the  Constitution as written. I look forward to performing my constitutional  duty to advise and consent on his nominee before November 3, 2020.                            ____________________
