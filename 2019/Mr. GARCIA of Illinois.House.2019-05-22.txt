 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support  of the Consumers First Act and thank Chairwoman Waters and Speaker  Pelosi for their leadership.   I remember the housing market collapse in 2009 very clearly. I  remember the foreclosure signs going up all over Chicago and in my own  neighborhood of Little Village, a working-class community. Families  lost homes. They skipped meals. They took second and third jobs just to  scrape by. Too many families never recovered.   President Obama and the Democratic majority swore to never allow a  Great Recession to happen again. Never again would we allow Wall Street  to go unchecked and allow consumers to be ripped off wholesale by the  big banks.   We passed sweeping legislation, Dodd-Frank, and we created the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB. In short, CFPB was  going to be the consumer watchdog for everyday hardworking Americans.   Since Trump's election, every day has been an assault against these  protections: payday lending protections, reversed; student loan  protections, reversed; predatory auto and home loan protections,  reversed. Instead of protecting consumers, Trump and Mick Mulvaney have  made their priorities clear: banks over people, business over the  consumer.   Systematically, Mulvaney and Trump have been busy dismantling the  CFPB, the same agency that recently helped a man in New York who had  lost $1,200 wrongly taken from his account. He was able to recover it  thanks to the CFPB. That man is one of thousands that have been helped  by the agency. That is the power of government when it is empowered to  fight for every American.   Meanwhile, Mulvaney has called the CFPB's public complaint database  nothing but a ``yelp for financial services.''   At a time when this administration is working at the behest of Wall  Street, the 1 percent, and the big banks, this Democratic majority is  moving forward to protect consumers.
