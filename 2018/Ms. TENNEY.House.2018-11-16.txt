 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend our country reflected on  the bravery and sacrifice of veterans who answered the call to defend  our Nation.   New York's 22nd District is home to more than 55,000 veterans, and it  is a true honor to serve each and every one of them in Congress.  Whether part of the Marine Corps, Navy, Army, Air Force, or Coast  Guard, our men and women in uniform have served and sacrificed greatly  to secure the freedoms we enjoy at home.   When our veterans come home from serving our Nation, it is our  responsibility to ensure they receive quality healthcare, provide them  with the tools to start their own business, and find educational  opportunities for them following their great service.   They stood for us, and now we must stand for them. To all of our  veterans: Thank you for everything you have sacrificed for our freedom.  You truly represent the best in America.   Mr. Speaker, I also have a special thank you to every veteran who has  continued to serve in this great body on both sides of the aisle, and  with a special thank you to our presiding Speaker today, who has also  served in our military honorably.   A final thank you to all of my friends in the Marine Corps for a  happy 243rd birthday, and especially to my dear son, Captain Trey  Cleary, who is also a U.S. Naval Academy graduate.   Thank you so much to all of you who serve. We are indebted to you and  grateful to you for your service to keep our freedoms and to continue  making this a great Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to highlight a couple of  things. First of all, I will comment on a really important issue in my  region. Upstate New York communities have suffered tremendously from  the opioid crisis ravaging our Nation.   In 2016, opioid overdoses rose by 121 percent in New York State and  opioid deaths doubled in Broome County,  [[Page H9554]]  which is part of New York's 22nd District, during the very same time.   During the most recent district work period, the President signed  into law the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention Act that Promotes Opioid  Recovery and Treatment--SUPPORT--for Patients and Communities Act,  which included the Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and  Payment Act, which I coauthored.   This bipartisan legislation directs the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission, or MedPAC, to issue a report regarding perverse incentives  that lead to overprescription of opioid-addictive drugs.   This legislation is important in my district because studies have  shown that 29 percent of patients prescribed an opioid for pain, go on  to misuse the drug. The Federal Government should be doing all it can  to prevent overprescribing. Enacting this important bill is a critical  first step in this process.                         Recognizing Small Businesses     Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to recognize a very important  industry in my region, and it is a great honor for me to be able to  represent a place called Revere Copper Company in Rome, New York. Yes,  Revere was actually founded by none other than the great Paul Revere of  our great history in this country.   This great company was North America's first copper rolling mill and  it was founded, again, by our great patriot, Paul Revere, in Rome, New  York.   It still resides in Rome, New York over 200 years later. Small  businesses like this are the backbone of employment in New York's 22nd  District, accounting for 98 percent of jobs created in our private  sector. While everyone thinks all jobs are created by big companies, in  fact, our small business community has 98 percent of those jobs  created.   In Congress, we need to make sure that we keep empowering our small  businesses, creating a fair tax and regulatory environment that allows  them to grow, to hire more workers, and to reinvest in our communities.  Too many of our local businesses are held back by skyrocketing  healthcare costs which cut into their bottom line, and our regulatory  code, which requires a team of lawyers to decode, just to comply with  the endless amounts of bureaucracy--something that I have experienced  personally as the owner of a small manufacturing business in upstate  New York.   The time for debate and verbal platitudes need to end when it comes  to our small business community, our employers need solutions. We must  work to make the middle class and small business tax cuts permanent.   I am very proud to be a person who voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, which tremendously helped our community. We have seen an  unprecedented amount of gains in our economy locally; a glimmer of hope  in an area where we have seen very little progress over the decades  because of some of the policies that have been enacted that really have  hurt our small business community and have caused New York to have the  highest out-migration of people in the entire Nation. Over 1 million  New Yorkers have left New York State because of these policies just  since 2010.   We must fight to continue to contain healthcare costs, to provide for  a public healthcare system, but also an affordable care system for  people who are just simply not able to see their doctors.   We must stand for a country that represents everyone and not just the  powerful. That is something I have done as a corruption fighter. As a  person who stood up to the leaders in both parties, to the most  powerful and wealthiest people in our community, I stood up to them and  fought for the middle class, and fought for the average worker, people  across our Nation.   To our small businesses, I just want to say thank you so much for all  you do every day. As a small business owner, I know how difficult the  fight is, how difficult the struggle is. You are the American Dream in  our communities. You provide the hope for our future, and you provide  the most jobs that we are going to see as we grow into the coming  years, and hope that we can keep our economy moving.   To my small business community, I just want to say thank you so much  for all that you have done in adding jobs, in providing responsible  employment for our communities, for individuals, for giving hope, for  giving people first starts, for everything you have done in our  community.   It has been an amazing opportunity for me to represent a community  that really cares. My community is well-known for its generosity. I  find that in our small business community, much like the business I  own, we do so much for our communities that doesn't get recognized. We  don't have big profits. Many of us operate at less than profit.   But what we do is we give dearly to our communities. We provide for  the Little League teams, and for the people who are struggling from  diseases that cannot be cured.                                time  1130    We provide in greater numbers. While, yes, big companies can provide  a large check, our small-business community does what it can on a scale  that is much greater by proportion.   So I am really grateful to all the people I have served in my  community who do so much to help all of us. I want to make sure that  our small-business community is recognized. Often in government, we  hear an awful lot about the big businesses. But it is really the small  businesses that are the backbone of our community. They are the heart  of entrepreneurship.   I just want to say that, as a small-business owner, I am deeply  grateful for all the work that you do, the late nights, the hard work  of your employees to put out a beautiful product. It is something that  you are helping your local and fellow citizens, even across the  country. I am just really grateful.                            Recognizing Jason Gray     Mr. Speaker, on another issue, I would like to make sure  we recognize a man named Jason Gray. He is a paramedic from Norwich,  New York.   Last month, when Hurricane Michael left Florida's homes, beaches, and  businesses in ruins, Jason Gray uprooted his life in Norwich to assist  in medical relief efforts.   What Jason Gray and his team at the National Disaster Medical System  did to help the most vulnerable Florida residents is simply incredible.  He provided on-the-ground medical help to hundreds of victims  devastated by Hurricane Michael.   Our community is really lucky to have a selfless person like Jason  Gray and so many others. I would like to give him special recognition  for his willingness to go help others in need outside of our own State  and to really use his skills and his talent to bring relief and some  sense of sanity to people who are really suffering in the panhandle, in  the tough parts of Florida.   I want to say thank you again to Jason for what he does for our  communities and what he has done for Florida. It is a tremendous honor  to represent him, and it is my distinct honor to represent him here on  the floor of the House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
