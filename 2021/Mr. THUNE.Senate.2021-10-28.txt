 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to speak for up to 15 minutes.    Madam President, work continues on Democrats' socialist  spending spree, and the Senate seems to be on track to vote on their  bill in the near future. Well, maybe. It depends on who you ask at any  given time around here these days.   Just to highlight the high level of uncertainty surrounding this  process, President Biden was on Capitol Hill just this morning--his  second visit this month--to twist the arms of still-undecided  Democrats.   As they continue to see what sticks to the wall, it is good to know  that priorities like government jobs for climate activists, tax credits  for environmental justice programs at colleges and universities, and a  $200 million park in Speaker Pelosi's district may soon come up for a  vote in the Senate. It is just too bad that Democrats have been so  focused on expanding government that they haven't actually taken time  to do some of the essential business of government.   Fiscal year 2021 ended a month ago. We are into fiscal year 2022.  Yet, so far, the Senate has not taken up a single appropriations bill  for the 2022 fiscal year.   On the other hand, perhaps it is not surprising, since the 2022  appropriations bills recently introduced by the committee chair are  rabidly partisan productions packed with poison pills, that one can  only assume are designed to make the bills fail: the taxpayer funding  of abortion, a measure that would allow Democrats to use the IRS for  partisan purposes, policies that would allow certain criminal illegal  aliens to be released into the United States.   Well, we may be better off without these bills.   One bill--of which there is no question we should have taken up  months ago, however--is the National Defense Authorization Act. The  NDAA is one of the most important bills we consider each year. It  authorizes funding for national defense priorities, like critical  upgrades to our defense capabilities, as well as funding for our  military men and women--from pay increases to protective equipment, to  investments in Impact Aid.   It is not a bill we can afford to ignore, but under Senate Democrats,  the bill has taken a back seat to Democrats' pet priority, and that is  this massive, partisan tax-and-spending legislation. So, while  Democrats focus on expanding the size of government, critical military  priorities are going unauthorized and unfunded.   Without the National Defense Authorization Act, and then the Defense  appropriations bill that falls from it, the military can't sign off on  contracts for critical new equipment. Shipbuilding projects, military  infrastructure projects, the development of new combat systems--they  are all having to wait while Democrats negotiate over their socialist  spending spree.   In my home State of South Dakota, Ellsworth Air Force Base is  currently preparing to be the first home of the B-21 bomber, where we  will host both the Formal Training Unit and first operational squadron.   The B-21 bomber will eventually replace the Air Force's aging B-1  fleet and ensure that we have a long-range strike asset and leg of the  nuclear triad capable of meeting the threats of the 21st century,  wherever in the world they are found.   This year's NDAA authorizes critical funding for developing the B-21  and starting to transform Ellsworth to prepare for the mission, plus a  requirement to maintain the remaining B-1 fleet until the bombers can  be replaced by the B-21.   This is just one of the many critical national security investments  we cannot afford to delay, but I guess our military men and women will  just have to understand that Democrats' socialist spending spree takes  priority.   It is not just our military men and women or appropriations bills  that have had to take a back seat to the Democrats' burning desire to  expand the size of government and its reach into Americans' lives. With  their single-minded focus on their tax-and-spending spree and, of  course, on federalizing election law to give themselves a permanent  advantage in future elections, real crises facing our Nation seem to  barely register on Democrats' radar.   We are in the midst of a serious, increasingly long-term inflation  problem--a problem Democrats helped to trigger by dumping a lot of  unnecessary government money into the economy earlier this year; yet  Democrats are not only ignoring this crisis, they are preparing to make  things worse by dumping even more government money into our economy.

Madam President, in just a few minutes, we are going to  take another vote here in the U.S. Senate. It is just an ordinary vote  for most of us, unless you are Susan Collins because this next vote we  are going to take in the Senate will be Susan Collins' 8,000th  consecutive vote. That is right. The leader described it, she is the  Cal Ripken of the U.S. Senate. He played 2,632 consecutive games, and  Susan Collins has been showing up every day for work and bringing her A  game, literally, since January of 1997.   It is an extraordinary number. But what it represents is what really  matters, and that is Susan's work ethic, her tenacity, and her  unshakable commitment to the people of Maine. If there is one thing  that the people of Maine can depend on, it is that Susan Collins will  be there to represent them, not just on the big days or for the big  votes but every day on every single vote.   I am also proud to stand up today and to recognize Susan.   Susan, congratulations on this incredible milestone. You truly are  the workhorse of the U.S. Senate. Here is to the next 8,000.   (Applause.)
