 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for several minutes on this amendment.    Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I am  the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for Homeland  Security. The President's budget request included a rescission of $2  billion that we, as Members of this body, put, enacted, as the  gentleman from Wisconsin has clearly illuminated.   And, at the same time, we are having a tremendous problem at our  southern border. We all know this. We don't have the July numbers out  yet, but we know that apprehensions are going to be in excess of over  200,000 in 1 month.   The July numbers also indicate that the number of unaccompanied  children is the largest ever encountered in 1 month.   There are currently now over 150 miles of wall system projects that  we as Congress legally funded that are now in jeopardy of being  canceled. When you go to the border, you see millions of dollars' worth  of steel slats lying on the ground that were to be constructed until  President Biden canceled those projects. Do you know who else sees  those border walls on the ground? Human traffickers. Drug smugglers.   I have, as we all have, been to the southern border several times.  Customs and Border Patrol agents have told us that a border wall is a  necessary part of a system to stop the flow of illegal immigration and  illicit drugs.   The border wall is infrastructure. It is infrastructure to keep  America safe. It is infrastructure to keep drugs out of this country.  It is infrastructure to control illegal immigration.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Johnson amendment to prohibit  the cancelation of contracts to build the border wall.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   I would just like to add my voice with the chairman of the EPW  Committee.   I think, in consideration of everybody's time, we have got four more  amendments and maybe more. We could roll through these if we would just  be concise with the time and come in and vote on time.   So if we don't, we might look for more punitive measures; right, Mr.  Chairman?    Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   I am in full support of using the 15-minute deadline that we have  anyway and actually enforcing this.  [[Page S5816]]    There is a lot of interest in this bill, as there should be. There  are a lot of amendments pending. We want to get as many Members in--and  have their amendments in the queue--as we possibly can.   But if people don't come down and vote and show courtesy to  everybody, I said in my last statement we are going to go to punitive  measures. I am not sure voting within the allotted time is really a  punitive measure, but that is what we are aiming for, and I am fully  supportive of that.    I am in support also as a ranking member.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2358
