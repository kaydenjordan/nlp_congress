 Mr. President, I thank my friend Mitch, and I thank my  friend Chuck for their remarks. I will have more to say to them later.   On March 9, 1967, Senator Howard H. Baker, Jr., the newly elected  Senator from Tennessee, made his maiden address, his first speech on  the floor of the U.S. Senate. He spoke for too long.   The Republican leader of the Senate, who was also Baker's father-in- law, Senator Everett M. Dirksen, walked over to congratulate him and  then said, ``Howard, occasionally, you might enjoy the luxury of an  unexpressed thought,'' which is good advice for a farewell address as  well.   As Senator Baker's legislative assistant, I was also his speech  writer for that maiden address, or at least I thought I was. He had  developed a bad habit of not saying what I wrote for his speech. So I  asked to see him, and I said: Do we have a problem with our  relationship?   He said: No, we have a perfect relationship. You write what you want  to write, and I will say what I want to say.   I learned a couple of other things about ``saying what I want to  say.'' One came from Alex Haley, the author of ``Roots,'' who heard me  speak once and called me aside afterward and said: May I make a  suggestion? He said: If, when you begin a speech, you would start by  saying, ``Instead of making a speech, let me tell you a story,''  someone might actually listen to what you have to say.   And then, from David Broder, who gave this advice to Ruth Marcus when  she got her column for the Washington Post: one idea per column.   So here is a story about my one idea for this speech.   In August of 1968, Senator Baker was in the Republican leader's  office, where Senator McConnell is today. He overheard this  conversation. Senator Dirksen was saying:         [No,] Mr. President, I cannot come down and have a drink       with you tonight. I did that last night and Louella is very       unhappy with me.    About 30 minutes later, there was a commotion out in the hall, and in  the door of the Republican leader's office came two beagles, three  Secret Service men, and the President of the United States. And Lyndon  Johnson said to Everett Dirksen: ``Everett, if you won't come down and  have a drink with me, I'm here to have one with you.'' And they  disappeared into the back room.   Later that same year, around a long table, in that same office, the  Democratic President and the Republican leader worked out the Civil  Rights Act of 1968. It took 67 votes to break a filibuster, but when  the bill passed and Johnson signed it, the Senators who voted no went  home and said: It is the law. We have to accept it.   And it still is today, along with many other civil rights laws.   So that is the one idea I have for this speech. Our country needs a  U.S. Senate to work across party lines to force broad agreements on  hard issues, creating laws that most of us have voted for and that a  diverse country will accept.   In the 1930s, we needed a Senate to create Social Security; after  World War II, the United Nations; in the 1960s, Medicare; in 1978, to  ratify the Panama Canal Treaty; in 2013, more recently, to tie interest  rates for student loans to the market rates, saving student borrowers  hundreds of billions of dollars in the last several years; in 2015, to  fix No Child Left Behind.   That bill had 100 alligators in the swamp. The Wall Street Journal  said, when we finished, that it was the largest evolution of power from  Washington to the States in 25 years. When President Obama signed it,  he said it was ``a Christmas miracle'' because, in the end, 85 Senators  voted for it. In 2016, as Senator McConnell mentioned, there was the  21st Century Cures Act, moving medical miracles faster to patients and  into doctors' offices. That bill ran off the track every 2 or 3 days.  On one of those days, I called the Vice President, Joe Biden. I said:  Joe, I am stuck in the White House. I have the President's personalized  medicine in this. I have your Cancer MoonShot. Senator McConnell's  regenerative medical proposal is in it. Speaker Ryan has worked out a  way to pay for it. But I can't get the White House to move. I feel like  the butler standing outside the Oval Office with a silver platter, and  nobody will open the door and take the order.   And Joe Biden said: If you want to feel like the butler, try being  Vice President.   Well, in the next few weeks, the Senate rules literally forced us to  come to an agreement, and, in the end, we almost all voted for it.  Senator McConnell said then, as he said today, it was ``the most  important legislation'' of that Congress. And, today, it is helping to  create vaccines and treatments in record time. Then, in 2018, there was  a once-in-a-generation change in the copyright laws to help songwriters  be fairly paid; this year, the Great American Outdoors Act. Everyone  agrees that it is the most important outdoor and environmental bill in  50 years.   All of that took a long time, a lot of palavering, many amendments,  many years. Too many years, civil rights advocates, students, patients,  songwriters, and conservationists would say. But the point was that  those bills didn't just pass. They passed by big margins. The country  accepted them, and they are going to be there for a long time, and most  of them were enacted during divided government, when the Presidency and  at least one body of Congress was of different political parties.   That offers an opportunity to share the responsibility or the blame  for doing hard things, like controlling the Federal debt. That is why  our country needs a U.S. Senate, to thoughtfully and carefully and  intentionally put country before partisanship and personal politics, to  force broad agreements on controversial issues that become laws that  most of us will vote for and that a diverse country will accept.   Nearly 60 years ago, I had traveled from my home in the mountains of  Tennessee to New York University's Law School in Manhattan, on  Washington Square. It was my first trip ever to New York City, and I  had asked for a roommate whose background was as different from mine as  possible. One of those roommates turned out to be a tall skinny guy  from New Jersey. When I would go to his home in New Jersey and spend  the night--his mother was a seamstress and his dad was a contractor;  they were Italian immigrants--his mother would become so concerned  about my frayed collar on my one white dress shirt that she would turn  it while I slept.   Years later, that roommate, Paul Tagliabue, invited me to go to the  Italian American Dinner here in Washington. They were bursting with  pride  [[Page S7147]]  for the Italian-American heritage at that dinner: cheers for Scalia,  the Justice, and for Pelosi, the Congressman, and for Stallone, the  actor, and for Tagliabue, the National Football League Commissioner.  But what struck me was, as proud as they all were of their Italian  heritage, they were most proud to say: We are all Americans.   Ken Burns, whose films tell the story of who we are, reminds us that  the late Arthur Schlesinger once wrote that our country needs less  ``pluribus'' and more ``unum,'' and the fact that we have attracted  people from everywhere in the world has made our country richer and  stronger, but it is more important and a greater achievement that we  have combined all of that diversity into one country. That is why the  motto above the Presiding Officer's desk is not one word--``pluribus.''  It is ``e pluribus unum''--out of many, one.   More than ever, our country needs a United States to turn  ``pluribus'' into ``unum,'' to lead the American struggle to forge  unity from diversity.   Now, some advocate operating the Senate in a different way: End the  filibuster--the Senate's best-known tradition. In the movie ``Mr. Smith  Goes to Washington,'' he calls it ``the right to talk your head off.''  They say: Don't worry about party lines. Pass everything with a  majority vote.   Presidents would like that. They have said so. They would get their  way more easily if we allow the passions to roar through the Senate  like they roar through the House of Representatives. So if the  Democrats are in charge, we could abolish every right-to-work law,  repeal all limits on abortion, and pass restrictions on guns. That is  very appealing for the moment, but what about if the train roars in the  other direction and Republicans say: Let's impose a right-to-work law  on every State and pro-life laws and gun rights laws.   Is such back and forth and back and forth what we really want as a  country? The Framers didn't think so. They created this cooling saucer  for those passions that Washington talked about, and the filibuster-- ``the right to talk your head off''--is the preeminent tool we use to  force broad agreements on tough issues that most of us will vote for  and that the country could live with   Alexis de Tocqueville, the remarkable young Frenchman who wandered  through our country in 1831 and 1832 and who wrote the best book yet on  democracy in America, saw two great dangers for our future: One,  Russia; and, two, the tyranny of the majority.   Ending the filibuster will destroy the impetus for forcing the broad  agreements I have been talking about, and it would unleash the tyranny  of the majority to steamroll the rights of the minority.   Well, you may say that the Senate isn't solving some big problems,  and you would be right. We are not even voting on some big problems.  Sometimes it is because the majority doesn't bring it up, and sometimes  the minority obstructs. If a carbon tax is a good idea, why aren't we  voting on it? Or if we want to help the DACA kids, why aren't we voting  on it? Or if the Federal debt is out of control, why aren't we voting  on it?   It doesn't take a genius. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how  to gum up the works in a body of 100 that operates mostly by unanimous  consent. But here is my different view of why we are here. It is hard  to get here. It is hard to stay here. And while we are here, we might  as well try to accomplish something good for the country. But it is  hard to accomplish something if you don't vote on amendments.   Lately, the Senate has been like joining the Grand Ole Opry and not  being allowed to sing. It is a real waste of talent. Think about this  body. Over the years, we have had astronauts, former Governors, Supreme  Court law clerks, military heroes, turnaround CEOs. We even had one of  us who ran the Olympics. A group of that much talent ought to  accomplish a lot more, and you don't have to eliminate the filibuster  to accomplish a lot more--meaning, restore the Senate to a time when it  was working across party lines more often to solve big problems.   Not so long ago, the Senate worked Monday through Friday, considered  hundreds of amendments. Most votes were by majority, and conferences  worked out broad agreements. That was under the existing rules. Let me  say that again. That was under the existing rules. So the Senate  doesn't need a change of rules. It needs a change of behavior, and the  behavior to change first is to stop blocking each other's amendments.  If you are against it, vote no. Why stop the entire body from even  considering it? Why join the Grand Ole Opry if you don't want to sing?  I guarantee you that if 15 to 20 Democrats and 15 to 20 Republicans  decided they wanted to change that practice, they could do it.   Some Governors don't like being a U.S. Senator, but not me. The jobs  are different. Both jobs cause you to want to see an urgent need,  develop a strategy to deal with it, and then try to persuade at least  half of the people that you are right. But the Governor's job is more  like Moses. You say: Let's go this way. The Senator's job, if you want  to get something done, is more like a parade organizer. You pick the  route, you recruit the marchers, you select the music, you even pick  the drum majors sometimes, and then you march in the middle of the  parade and hope it doesn't run off the road more than a half dozen  times on the way to where it is going.   I love the traditions of the Senate, the hard marble floors, the  elaborate courtesies, Barry Black's prayers, and scratching my name  beside Howard Baker's and Fred Thompson's names in this desk drawer.   I have made a lot of friendships in the Senate. My best friendship  began at a softball game between Senator John G. Tower's staff of Texas  and Senator Baker's staff, in the summer of 1967, when a 21-year-old  Smith College graduate named Honey slid into first base wearing red  shorts.   I was not only surprised but captivated, and 18 months later we were  married. And for 52 years she has been an unselfish and caring wife,  mother, campaigner, and advocate for families and children, especially  her own.   In 1969, as the leader mentioned, Senator Baker said to me: You ought  to get to know that smart, young legislative assistant for the new  Kentucky Senator, Marlow Cook. That smart, young legislative assistant  was Mitch McConnell, and it began a half century of friendship.   Mario D'Angelo, in the barbershop here, first cut my hair in 1977  when I came up for 3 months to work with Senator Baker when he was  suddenly elected Republican leader.   Some of my experiences in the Senate haven't been so friendly, such  as my confirmation hearing in 1991, when Senator Metzenbaum of Ohio  said: Governor Alexander, I have heard some very disturbing things  about you, but I don't think I'll bring them up here. And he then put a  hold on my nomination for 2 months, until I was mysteriously confirmed  late one night--and I still don't know how.   Back then I found a new way to make friends among Senators when I  went to the Republican retreat, and they said: If you will stop talking  and play the piano, we will support Bush's education program. So I did,  and they did.   I have strengthened friendships in the so-called ``inner sanctum''  that Chuck Schumer and I resurrected downstairs. It provides a private  space for Senators to have a snack and a conversation.   One-third of this body, of the Senators and their spouses, have come  to the Smoky Mountains to be guests of Honey and me in our home for the  weekend. We don't talk about politics much there. We talked about lost  hikers and told bear stories.   And I have even learned here how to count--how to count my friends.  In 2006 I wrote 27 thank-you notes for 24 votes when I lost the race by  1 vote to be the Republican whip. Having learned to count, I got to be  the Republican conference chairman. I enjoyed that, but 9 years ago I  left to focus on issues that I cared the most about. Since then I have  done my best to leave footprints that I hope are good for the country:  fixing No Child Left Behind and 21st Century Cures and simplifying  FAFSA, working with Patty Murray--Michael Bennet was there at the start  for the FAFSA; working with Dianne Feinstein in building up our  National Laboratories and supercomputing; joining the bipartisan parade  of Portland and Warner and Gardner and King and Manchin and Daines and  Heinrich and Burr and Cantwell that created the Great American Outdoors  Act; the law  [[Page S7148]]  to help songwriters; working with Murray and Jones and Tim Scott on  permanently funding Black colleges; with Blunt and Shelby on the shark  tank of the National Institutes of Health, creating new diagnostic  tests, new ways; with Burr and Durbin and Manchin and King on the  student loan law I mentioned; with Casey and Enzi on the Perkins Act;  with Harry Reid and Bill Frist, when they were leaders, on the America  COMPETES Act.   None of this could have been done without an exceptional staff. But  instead of thanking them in a rushed way now, I am going to make a  separate ``salute to the staff'' speech tomorrow. Maybe I will start a  tradition.   My favorite time in the U.S. Senate has been with the American  history teachers whom I invite to come to the Senate floor before it  opens while they are attending the academies that were created by the  legislation I introduced in my maiden address 18 years ago.   After that address, Ted Kennedy, without my knowing it, went around  and got 20 Democratic cosponsors. In the House, Roger Wicker and Marsha  Blackburn helped pass the bill there, where they were then.   The teachers who come to the floor before we open invariably go to  our desks. They try to find Daniel Webster's desk. They look for the  Kennedy brothers' desk. They ask, ``Where is Jefferson Davis's  desk?''--Jefferson Davis, who resigned the Senate to become President  of the Confederacy--because they have heard the story that there is a  chop mark on the desk that was imposed by a Union soldier when they  captured Washington. The soldier was chopping the desk until his  commander said: Stop that. We are here to save the Union, not to  destroy it.   Invariably a teacher will ask: Senator, what would you like for us to  take back to our students about being a U.S. Senator?   My reply is always the same: Please suggest to your students that  they look at Washington, DC, as if it were a split-screen television.  On one side are the confirmation hearings and the tweets, and on the  other side you have Democratic and Republican Senators working together  to strengthen national defense, National Laboratories, national parks,  and the National Institutes of Health.   Please remind them of what a remarkable country this is: the  strongest military, the best universities, producing 20 percent of all  the money in the world for just 4 percent of the people. Tell them we  are not perfect, but, as our Constitution says, we are always working  to form a more perfect union and that, as Samuel Huntington wrote, most  of our arguments are about conflicts among principles with which most  of us agree, and most of our politics is about disappointments in not  being able to reach the noble goals we set for ourselves, such as all  men are created equal.   The late NAACP President Ben Hooks used to teach his University of  Memphis students, ``America is a work in progress. We've come a long  way, and we have a long way to go.''   Please remind your students that the rest of the world wishes they  had our system of government and that the U.S. Senate has been and I  hope continues to be the single most important institution that helps  to unify our country by creating broad agreements that most of us can  vote for and that the citizens of the United States will accept.   Finally, please tell them that I wake up every day thinking I might  be able to do something good to help our country and that I go to bed  most nights thinking that I have. Please tell them that it is a great  privilege to be a U.S. Senator   I yield the floor.
