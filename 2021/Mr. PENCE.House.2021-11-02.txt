 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sergeant Major  Rick Caldwell for receiving the Silver Helmet Award presented during  the AMVETS 76th national convention.   The Silver Helmet Award is given to those for their excellent and  outstanding accomplishment in Americanism, defense, rehabilitation, and  congressional and civil service.   In 2002, Sergeant Major Caldwell helped bring back the AMVETS post to  Camp Atterbury.   After serving in the U.S. Army for 32 years, Sergeant Major Rick  Caldwell resigned as a reservist in 2008.   Sergeant Major Rick Caldwell has committed his life to serving this  country and his community in our hometown of Columbus, Indiana. I am  honored to call Rick my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Sergeant Major Rick Caldwell on this  award and thank him for his service.                  celebrating the united states marine corps     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 246 years of  service by the United States Marine Corps.   Founded on November 10, 1775, before our Nation was established, the  Marines stood ready to win our country's hardest battles and never back  down. Marines are guided by our core values of honor, courage, and  commitment.   Even when the United States has faced tremendous odds in the war to  preserve our freedom, like Iwo Jima, the Marines have answered the call  to always remain faithful.   As a marine whose greatest honor it has been to serve our Nation and  to those who have served and continue to serve: Oorah. Semper fi.            Congratulating Columbus North Girls Cross-Country Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Columbus  North girls cross-country team on winning the State championship this  past weekend.   This marks the second State title for the Bull Dogs, and I  congratulate each of these young student-athletes, head coach Rick  Sluder, and the entire team on a job well done.   Furthermore, the Columbus North boys also finished third as a team in  the State finals, while Reese Kilbarger-Stumpff claimed overall victory  in the boys' race.   Having each of my four children participate in cross-country at  Columbus North, I know these accomplishments stand as a true reflection  of their outstanding program.   It is great to see the Bull Dogs back on top again.                        Recognizing Mayor Chuck Fewell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work and  dedication of Greenfield Mayor Chuck Fewell as he has announced his  retirement.   A fellow marine, Chuck's career started in law enforcement as a  member of the Shelbyville Police Department before moving on to become  an Indiana State Trooper.   When there was a vacancy to serve as mayor, Chuck stepped up and  answered the call, serving his neighbors in the community for nearly a  decade.   Today, I congratulate Chuck on his many years of dedication to making  Greenfield such a great place. I know I speak for many when I say he  will be dearly missed at city hall.   On behalf of Indiana's Sixth District, we wish Mayor Fewell a  peaceful retirement enjoying time with his wife, Kristen, four kids,  and seven grandkids.                              Numbers Don't Lie     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note the U.S. GDP has dropped  to a disappointing 2 percent in the third quarter.   Thanksgiving 2021 is expected to be the most expensive in the history  of the holiday, a Turkey tax year.   Americans are being warned that their Christmas presents will cost  more this year and might not arrive on time.   Numbers don't lie. Democrats' out-of-control spending and far-left  socialist policies are to blame for the supply chain and economic  crisis America is facing.   It is clear: The Democrats' liberal agenda is out of touch with  Hoosier values and out of touch with America.

This week, President Biden jetted off to Glasgow to rub shoulders  with world dignitaries and to take a nap.   American energy costs are soaring while he is sleeping, and the  bottom line is this: This administration needs to worry less about  their image and more about how Hoosiers can keep their lights on, heat  their homes this winter, and afford to fill up their gas tanks.                            ____________________
