 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise  in support, not only of this rule, but on the underlying bill.   It is time to get something done around here. Both parties have  failed to address this issue for decades now; we finally have an  opportunity, for the same kids that are in your district that talk to  me in mine.   The kids are just looking for the certainty of being able to have a  job, being able to go to school, and, yes, some of them even want to  sign up for the military and show their greatest act of patriotism.   These are kids just looking for a path forward. This bill protects  them on day  [[Page H5446]]  one, the day that this bill is signed into law. It not only protects  the DACA recipients that signed up under President Obama's executive  order, but some of them didn't trust that executive order. Some of them  didn't trust that their information would be secure. This protects  them, too.   Now, there is another group of people here that did not qualify. They  were not of age at the time. This will protect them, too. If you care  about the Dreamers, 1.8 million will be protected on day one. You  should support this bill, too.
