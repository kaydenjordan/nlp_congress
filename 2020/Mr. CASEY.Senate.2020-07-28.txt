 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about long- term care and a number of related challenges that confront our country,  especially at this time.   One of the most horrific numbers in all of the horror that we have  seen in the aftermath of the onset of the virus and COVID-19 disease  and the jobs and economic crisis that have followed it is the number of  deaths in long-term care settings.   When you combine the deaths of residents in nursing homes and other  similar settings--sometimes called long-term care or even congregate  settings--with the deaths of workers, we know that the number now  exceeds 59,000 Americans. About 40 percent of all the deaths are either  a resident of a long-term care facility or a worker in those  facilities.   So we are talking about those Americans today--those families--when  we consider what we do next because no one here, I don't think--I don't  care what side of the aisle, what point of view, who you are, what  State you are from, no one in this body or in the House would want to  accept the idea that, say, 4 months from today, or 5 months or 6  months, another 59,000 or 60,000 people will have died in those  settings.   We know a lot about how to get those numbers down. It is not one of  those things where we can throw up our hands and say there is little  that we can do. There is a lot we can do because Americans are smart,  innovative, and caring, and a lot of smart people have figured out how  to get those numbers down.   So 59,000--more than 59,000--Americans is unacceptable. Also, 40  percent of all the deaths going forward is also unacceptable. About a  month ago, I came to the floor with some of my colleagues, and we  pressed for a vote on the solutions we need to save lives in nursing  homes and also protect the workforce. The majority blocked the vote.  Since then, the Senate has done nothing when it comes to this issue  that has impacted so many families and so many communities. We have a  chance now.   I realize sometimes when a bill gets blocked that that isn't the end  of the story and that the individual or the party blocking might have a  different idea, a better idea, a different solution, a better approach.  If that is the case with the majority, we need to hear it. I would hope  that a solution, a remedy, a strategy to get the 59,000-death number  down would include the resources to do it because this isn't a  circumstance where you can just wish it away. This isn't a circumstance  where you can just move a little bit of policy around. We need  resources, and I will talk more about them.   We know that yesterday Senate Republicans released their plan for the  next piece of legislation relating to COVID-19 and the economy. This  proposal is 2 months--a full 2 months--after the House passed the  Heroes Act to bring relief to the millions of Americans who are  suffering, families who are suffering, not only in the context of long- term care--having lost a loved one, a resident, or a worker in their  family--but they are suffering for other reasons as well.   We know the unemployment rate is intolerably too high. In my home  State of Pennsylvania--just imagine this--the number was 1-plus million  people out of work in April. Thankfully, that number went down in the  month of May, but it only went down to 849,000 people out of work.   I was hoping, as I know everyone was in the State, that the June  number would fall precipitously and maybe by the same percentage, so  849,000 people would go well into the 700s and maybe even into the  600,000s and would keep going down from there. Unfortunately, in the  month of June, it went from 849,000 to about 821,000 people out of  work. I don't think I have seen unemployment numbers like that in my  home State in my lifetime.    The 13.4 percent unemployment in May dropped but only went down to 13  percent. Just by way of comparison, in the great recession of just  roughly a decade ago, Pennsylvania's unemployment rate went way up, as  it did in a lot of other States. It stopped at 10 percent. Some  counties were above 10 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent or higher.  Statewide, it never really went above 10 percent.   We are now in our third month of unemployment rates well above 10  percent. It was 16 percent in April, almost 13.5 percent in May, and  now 13 percent exactly now. We have a lot of work to do.   For purposes of today's discussion, I wanted to talk about what we  can do in the long-term care context. The Republican proposal of  yesterday makes no  [[Page S4532]]  meaningful investment to save lives in nursing homes. The policies that  address long-term care in this proposal are insufficient. I think that  is an understatement, but I will let that go for now.   There is no investment in home and community-based services, and  there is no funding to reward the heroes on the frontlines. Some people  might say: What do you mean by home and community-based services? I  don't understand that. I am not sure what you mean.   We know that in the United States we have a number of settings where  care is delivered--care for older citizens, older Americans, and care  for people with disabilities. In the nursing home context, of course,  that is skilled care in a facility, in a so-called congregate setting.  Depending on which number you believe, in the United States we have  between 1.3 and 1.5 million Americans there. We also have a lot of  Americans who are getting their care--very important care for a senior  or for someone with a disability--in a home setting or in a community- based setting, but the funding doesn't flow in that direction very  often. So we are trying to change that because, obviously, if you are  an older American, you might have certain conditions that make you even  more susceptible, more vulnerable in the context of COVID-19. In many  cases, it will be preferable to have you in a home setting or  community-based setting.   But if you are in those settings, we have to invest in the workers  who do that heroic work in both nursing homes, in homes, and in  community-based settings, because the care is not going to be what it  needs to be if we are not helping the workforce. I think most people  agree with that.   Just as we cannot allow another 3 or 4 months to go by with 59,000  people dying, we also cannot allow the conflict here in the Senate to  stop us from making progress in long-term care. We have to help nursing  homes at the same time as we demand more of them. We need to invest in  what we know works.   I have a bill, S. 3768, introduced with Senator Whitehouse. The name  of the bill is the Nursing Home COVID-19 Protection and Prevention Act.  It would dedicate $20 billion in emergency funding for proven  practices. We would spend $20 billion to get that death number down and  also to get the case number down.   We are concerned, as well, about the high number of cases. We need to  invest in best practices that some long-term care settings were  investing in way back in early March, and some long-term care  facilities got much better results. They had fewer cases and lower  numbers of deaths because they were investing in these best practices.  But to invest $20 billion in emergency funding for these proven best  practices, I think, is a bargain to get the death number down and get  the case number down.   This bill will help nursing homes become a lot better and become more  proficient at a practice called cohorting. It is real simple. That just  means separating people in the nursing home. You separate the residents  with COVID-19 from the residents who don't have it. When that basic  practice is in place and when it is operative, it is something that a  lot of places need help with. There are, obviously, costs involved in  that. There may be costs because you have to do retrofitting. There may  be costs in terms of needing additional staff.   But that is only part of it. The bill also allows nursing homes to  provide for their workers, these heroes who are on the frontlines every  day. Obviously, if you are on the frontlines every day, you are an  essential worker. There are all these phrases and descriptions of these  workers. Those who are at the front of the frontline are those in  healthcare, because they are not only going out every day and providing  an essential service, but they are closest to the risk. That includes  folks who work in hospitals and other settings, of course. That is for  certain. But it also includes people who work in nursing homes and at  home and in community-based service settings.   Those are folks whom we call heroes, and it is nice to call them  heroes. It is nice to say they are doing great work. It is nice to pat  them on the back, but what we should be doing is paying them more for  the sacrifice they make for the country.   The analogy, of course, is the GI bill. I have a bill that would add  similar education benefits to those frontline workers, those heroes.   But at a minimum, they should get premium pay and overtime pay. They  should also have essential benefits, and we should help them with  childcare. You can't say: You have got to be on the frontlines; you  have got to be on the front of the front lines, and you have to go to  work every day because we need your essential skilled work to care for  the most vulnerable, but you are on your own with childcare. Good luck.   We haven't done much to help them with that.   My bill also includes strong resident protections--``resident''  meaning residents of nursing homes--to prevent evictions to homeless  shelters and to provide an extra check on nursing home quality.   All these things I just recited in the bill, the Republican proposal  doesn't have. I think the time is long overdue for Congress to take  action to deal with what can only be described as an American tragedy-- a preventable American tragedy. No one would argue--I certainly would  not argue--that the 59,000-plus number could be zero. It is not what we  are saying. What we are saying is you can bring the number down. If we  bring the number down, even a little bit, it is worth it to save lives  and to reduce the number of cases, but I think we can do a lot better  than that.   Last week, a coalition made up of representatives from the nursing  home industry, direct service professionals, AARP, the Alzheimer's  Association, Catholic Charities, The Arc, and the Service Employees  International Union came together to write to Senate leadership to  demand this action and more. Think about that group. That is not a  group that is always on the same page. They have often direct conflicts  on a lot of issues, but they have all come together to support the  residents in nursing homes and those in other settings and the workers  because that is how dire it is. Groups that are often in conflict on  legislation are together on this. Here is part of what they wrote to  the Senate leadership: ``The urgent need to save lives, prevent the  spread of the virus, and address the services and support older adults  and people with disabilities need cannot be overstated.''    In addition to nursing home supports, this coalition called for  dedicated funds for home and community-based services under Medicaid  that I described earlier. I have a bill to do that. The House-passed  Heroes Act, in fact, does that. The Heroes Act passed 2 months ago, and  here we are without a bill ready to vote on in the Senate.   I sent a letter with 28 of my colleagues yesterday to urge Leader  McConnell to move these policies forward. We know that over 2.5 million  older adults and people with disabilities depend on these services to  be able to continue living in their own homes. These 2.5 million  seniors and people with disabilities are folks who are not in a nursing  home or other congregate setting. They are, by definition, in their  homes or in a community-based setting. They are receiving their  supports and services in their homes, where they are less likely to be  exposed to the virus and often are able to see their families.   Just to give you one example, there is Michelle Mitchell of  Allentown, PA--on the eastern side of our State, almost at the New  Jersey border. Michelle is a person who benefits from the services. She  has a lifelong disability--cerebral palsy--which affects the use of her  arms and legs. She holds multiple degrees and is a full-time faculty  member at a local college.   Every single day, Michelle Mitchell has the benefit of a personal  care attendant who helps Michelle get out of bed, helps her to bathe,  helps her to dress, and helps her to eat. Without Medicaid home and  community-based services, thousands of people with similar needs to  Michelle would not be able to live at home and work and interact with  neighbors and friends. Home and community-based services keep Michelle  safe, they keep her healthy, and they keep her engaged.   But the agencies that provide these vital services are facing  barriers. A survey of home and community-based  [[Page S4533]]  services providers conducted by the group ANCOR found that 68 percent  of providers have had to close some of their services to people with  intellectual or developmental disabilities. This same survey found that  over half of the agencies had faced significant additional expenses  because of pandemic expense.   We know that life has changed for so many Americans and so many  institutions. This is one of these agencies that do such good work.  Some of the expenses they face include increased levels of overtime,  purchases of personal protective equipment, and additional training for  workers. Perhaps most unsettling is that the agencies that provide  essential services to older adults and people with disabilities don't  have sufficient funding to keep offering services for more than 1 month  if payments stop. This lack of cash on hand illustrates how fragile the  home and community-based services system is.   Yesterday morning, administrators in Pennsylvania said that if home  and community-based services were not available, thousands of  additional people would need to enter nursing homes, which again, is a  congregate setting, where the likelihood of contracting the virus is  higher than a lot of other settings. That, of course, would put them at  greater risk of contracting the virus and much greater risk of dying  because of this horrible pandemic.   When we talk about investing in home and community-based services,  that is tied to the goal of getting not just the case number down but  the death number down.   The proposal by Republicans yesterday makes clear that they are not  focused on this crisis. There is no investment in home and community- based services at all. The response to nursing homes is wholly  insufficient. The level of funding provided in the proposal, in my  judgment, is an insult to older Americans. It is an insult to people  with disabilities and their families, and it is an insult to the  workers who support them. Claiming that people with disabilities and  seniors are supported in this legislation is just not true.   On top of the lack of funding, the bill blows a hole in the  protections provided by the ADA, or the Americans with Disabilities  Act, for people with disabilities. To ensure that seniors and people  with disabilities are kept safe and healthy during this public health  crisis, we need to ensure that strong policies are in place to keep  nursing homes safe, and we need to ensure that there is dedicated  funding for home and community-based services.   I am calling for an investment in both settings--home and community- based services--for seniors and people with disabilities, as well as  investments in proven strategies that we know will help nursing homes  and also get the death numbers down. To meet our responsibilities to  those who are most at risk--the most vulnerable among us--the Senate  should include these provisions that I have described in the next  COVID-19 legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there is one more item to address before I  relinquish the microphone.   We know that yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the signing of the  Americans with Disabilities Act, to which I just referred--the so- called ADA. This is legislation that Congress should be very proud of  because of how much it has ensured that millions of Americans with  disabilities have been able to exercise their rights as Americans. We  still have some work to do on the goals of the ADA, but it is a good  anniversary to remember and to celebrate. So, in honor of the  anniversary, I offer this resolution to celebrate the 30th anniversary  of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. Res. 661, a resolution recognizing the importance  of independent living for individuals with disabilities made possible  by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and calling for further  action to strengthen home and community living for individuals with  disabilities, which was submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate.    I further ask unanimous consent that the preamble be  agreed to and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
