 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate 120 years of  continued community service by the Casper Area Chamber of Commerce of  Wyoming.   For 120 years, our city has grown and flourished, due in many ways to  the efforts of the Casper Area Chamber. The chamber aims to provide  organizational structure to build a better Natrona County and to  improve opportunities for all businesses in the community. The chamber  was founded in 1903 as the Casper Industrial Association by Alfred  James Mokler, then publisher of the Natrona County Tribune. A small  number of businesses banded together to create the association. Some of  their early goals were to pave the streets, install a water and sewer  system, and to construct public parks, a courthouse, a city hall, a  Federal building, and a railway. All of these goals were realized.  Today, the chamber has over 600 members and continues to grow each  year. The mission now is the same as it was 120 years ago, to actively  create business opportunities by ``connecting, informing, leveraging,  and collaborating with their members.''   After the first World War, the Casper Industrial Association  reorganized and became the Casper Area Chamber of Commerce. At that  time, just over 11,000 people were living in Casper and 14,000 in  Natrona County. During the 1930s, the chamber was a key player in the  construction of a north-to-south rail line from Montana to Colorado by  the Wyoming-Montana Railroad Company. The chamber also ensured that  freight rates were competitive. This allowed local industry to bring in  new services and hire competitively. During the 1960s, the chamber  worked to make Casper the convention center of Wyoming. They held over  100 conventions, attracting over 20,000 visitors.   Progress continued into the 1980s when the chamber designed the  Leadership Casper program, organized legislative luncheons, and created  professional networking opportunities. During the 2000s, the chamber  focused on developing the west side of Casper. The first ``Shop Local''  campaign was established. In 2020, the chamber was instrumental in  connecting businesses with the Federal funding they needed to stay open  through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The Casper Area Chamber of Commerce is part of a long and rich local  history. It was instrumental in moving Natrona County forward. Their  positive influence over the past 120 years can be seen today in our  thriving community.   The Casper Area Chamber of Commerce is the foundation on which the  economy of Casper is built. They work hard to maintain a prosperous  business environment. This ensures the longevity of tourism, industry,  and small businesses.   In Wyoming, we value community, leadership, and service. The Casper  Area Chamber of Commerce puts these values into practice. As board  chair, Sabrina Kemper said, ``Without commerce, our community cannot  thrive.''   Today, the Chamber Staff and Board of Directors include:         Staff        Tina Hoebelheinrich, Executive Director        Sabrina Kemper, Board Chairman        Katie Schultz, Past-Chairman        Phillip Rael, Board Member        Gena Jensen, Chairman-Elect        Amanda Disney, Treasurer        Jereca Lutz, VP of Development        Kim Coleman, VP of Marketing and Communication        Darcie Holscher, VP of Special Events        Officers        Ken White        Nikki Hawley        Robert Ratliff        Tom McCarthy        Bryant Hall        Michael Morrissey        Paul Nash        Sonya Gruner    It is an honor for me to rise in recognition of this significant  milestone for the Casper Area Chamber of Commerce of Wyoming. The  impact and opportunities the chamber has created for Casper businesses  is incredible. Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to the  Casper Area Chamber of Commerce for 120 years of community service.                            ____________________
