 Mr. Speaker, for over 50 years, the only game in town for  flood insurance has been the Federal Government through the National  Flood Insurance Program. That means that for over 50 years, if you want  flood insurance, your best bet is to go to the Federal Government,  which, by the way, especially after these two successive storms that  have just hit Texas and Florida, is going to be over $30 billion in  debt.   If we don't do something to save the taxpayers of this program that  cannot actuarially support itself, we are doing a total disservice to  our constituency and to our country. So what is part of the underlying  bill that this rule will allow is the Market Parity and Modernization  Act that will allow consumers to have a choice between the existing  Flood Insurance Program, which is significantly in debt, or to have the  private sector bring in their flood insurance programs to insure those  risks.   In Florida, back in 2004, we had successive hurricanes that came  through my district, and we had billions of dollars paid by FEMA, paid  by NFIP, but we had $39 billion paid by the private sector because we  had private windstorm insurance. The private sector does a much better  job of doing business and managing risks than the Federal Government.   What I am asking for this body to accept, what the American people  are craving for, is competition in the products they seek to have to  protect them with their valuable assets. It is kind of like the Flood  Insurance Program is a boat, and after 50 years of plugging holes, it  is taking on water more and more.   One of the suggestions is, let's just keep bailing. I submit to you  that to any logical person, the first step would be to plug that hole.  We are going to continue to bail. We need to continue to bail, but we  need to plug that hole so we don't get deeper and deeper in debt.   So the underlying bill, the FAA reauthorization, has the Ross-Castor  bill in there for a reason, so that we can invite a private market to  come to the rescue of those consumers out there who need to not only be  able to have options greater than what the National Flood Insurance  Program provides, because they don't provide business interruption.  They don't provide temporary housing, but the private sector will. More  importantly, the private sector will mitigate and will manage that  risk.   There is no mitigation program that is effective in the Federal  Government right now. It is a flowing of dollars to say: Here, do this;  or, do that.   Private risk management will help consumers mitigate, lessen their  risks, have more resilient homes.   What I am suggesting to you is that this is a paradigm shift for this  country. That if we are going to say that the business of the United  States should be left to business, and government should do what  government should do, then this is a move in that direction because  government should not be in the business of insurance. It is in the  business of relief.   There is no question about that, but relief is post-event help.  Insurance is pre-event. It is calculating that risk. It is managing  that risk. And that is what the private sector does so well. We owe it  to our consumers and we owe it to our taxpayers who are bailing out the  NFIP, that we give consumers this choice.   I would just submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that if we have a chance to  finally make a paradigm shift when we take the burden of bailouts off  the shoulders of taxpayers and allow those who do best what they do  best in managing capital and managing risk, do so for the benefit of  the consumers, that this underlying bill and the FAA reauthorization  allows for that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport  and Airway Extension Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this desperately needed legislation.   Included in this bill are two provisions that are particularly  important to my constituents in central Florida. One is tax relief for  families and small businesses recovering from the destruction of  Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma. The other is language taken from my  legislation, the Private Flood Insurance Market Development Act, which  will allow private sector insurers to compete with the National Flood  Insurance Program.   The catastrophic impact of the three major hurricanes is  heartbreaking and tragic. However, it has been inspiring to witness the  outpouring of charity and goodwill from our communities in response.   Now it is time for this Congress to rise to the occasion. The tax  relief for disaster victims in this legislation is a great first step.   This bill will help individuals in the disaster areas keep their  jobs, support retirement savers paying for recovery, encourage  charitable contributions to help victims, and put more money in the  pockets of families trying to get their lives back on track after  having lost everything.   To deny our constituents this relief because it is not enough is  simply irresponsible. To be sure, I agree that more aid will likely be  needed.   But is that really a good excuse to do nothing?   I certainly don't think so.   Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't just about providing immediate relief.  Thankfully, it also provides some measure of long-term relief to  communities vulnerable to floods--the most costly of all natural  disasters.   Thanks to the inclusion of my legislation, H.R. 1422, this bill will  provide consumers with more options and lower costs in the flood  insurance marketplace as well as help to reduce the unacceptable number  of homes not insured for flood losses.   Last Congress, this House passed nearly identical legislation by a  vote of 419-0. That is why I was so disheartened to hear some  characterize this reform as a long-time Republican priority. This isn't  a Republican priority, and it is not a Democratic priority. This is a  national priority.   The NFIP is more than $25 billion in debt and runs an annual deficit  of $1.4 billion. Folks, this is an insurance company on the brink of  being unable to pay out claims to policyholders without another  taxpayer bailout.   The NFIP desperately needs to off-load some of its risk, and we can  help by allowing the private sector to do what it does best: compete  for customers by offering better service, lower prices, and more  comprehensive coverage.   I understand some of my colleagues think competition will destabilize  the NFIP. First, we need to be clear that the NFIP in its current state  is beleaguered, it is not stable, and it is not sustainable. Reforms  must be made.   Second, I would urge my colleagues to recognize that by forcing  nearly all of the flood risk in this Nation into a single, government- run insurance program, we contribute to the NFIP's bloated and unstable  risk portfolio.                                time  1830    So the NFIP needs some help, and consumers need competition. More  coverage options will help make flood insurance an attractive  investment for everyone, thereby reducing the number of uninsured  homes.   With the NFIP alone, our constituents are severely limited. For  example, an NFIP policy only covers up to $250,000 of damages.    In addition, NFIP policies do not cover homeowners  displaced by living expenses.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has an untold number of supporters. I  include in the Record a letter from 15 major insurance, housing,  banking, and trade associations in support of the private flood  insurance provisions in H.R. 3823.                                                 September 26, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned trades       and organizations strongly support the ``Development of a       Private Flood Insurance Market'' title of H.R. 3823, the       Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of       2017. This package includes bipartisan, clarifying language,       introduced by Representative Dennis A. Ross (FL-15) and       Representative Kathy Castor (FL-14), to increase acceptance       of private flood insurance products. This will increase flood       insurance options for consumers, thereby providing more       competition and coverage options to families and businesses.        The Ross-Castor language passed the House last year by a       vote of 419-0, and it was ordered reported out of the House       Financial Services Committee in June by a vote of 58-0. The       bipartisan fix clarifies what is already in federal law       (following the passage of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance       Reform Act of 2012 and reinforced in the Homeowners Flood       Insurance Affordability Act of 2014) intended by Congress to       allow lenders to accept private flood insurance in lieu of       federal  [[Page H7566]]       coverage to satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement.        The undersigned trades and organizations strongly support       inclusion of the bipartisan Ross-Castor language in the       Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of       2017 that allows consumers the choice of government or       private flood insurance coverage. We ask for you to vote in       favor of this important legislative package when it is       considered by the House of Representatives.            Sincerely,        Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI)        Reinsurance Association of America (RAA)        National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC)        National Apartment Association (NAA)        American Bankers Association (ABA)        Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers (CIAB)        American Insurance Association (AIA)        National Association of REALTORS (NAR)        National Association of Professional Insurance Agents (PIA)        Financial Services Roundtable (FSR)        Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (Big       ``I'')        Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)        National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC)        Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA)        National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions       (NAFCU).
