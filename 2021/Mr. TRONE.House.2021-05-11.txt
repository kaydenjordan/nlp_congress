 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R.  433, the Family Support Services and Addiction Services Act.   I introduced this bill with my friend and fellow businessman,  Dan  Meuser, in order to show our support for the millions of families that  are struggling to help their loved ones suffering from addiction.                                time  1430    In 2016, my nephew Ian lost his life to an overdose after years of  struggling with addiction. But he didn't fight this battle alone. My  wife and I were with him every step of the way, working to support his  recovery efforts. Getting him the help he needed was hard for us to do,  even with the resources we had at our disposal.   Our story is not unique. For most families, it is nearly impossible  to navigate our behavioral healthcare system, and COVID-19 has made it  even harder.   While our country faced an addiction crisis prior to COVID-19, the  pandemic has made this crisis a five-alarm fire. Last year, more  Americans died from drug overdoses than ever before, nearly 90,000  Americans. That is a 29 percent increase in just one year. American  families need help, and they need it now.   This bipartisan bill provides the funding for nonprofits working with  families struggling with addiction. The bill will provide grants to  reach more families, create a more tailored approach, and save lives.   I want to thank Congressman Meuser for his support and partnership.  He has been an absolute champion on this issue.   I also want to thank Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman Eshoo, and Ranking  Member Rodgers for their laser-like focus on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
