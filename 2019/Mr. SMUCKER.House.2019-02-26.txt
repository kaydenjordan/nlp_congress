 Madam Speaker, as you know, this month is Black History  Month, and I am taking some time to remember African Americans who have  made a difference in the community where I live.   I rise today to honor one of my community's civil rights and  community leaders, Mr. Nelson Polite, Sr., of Lancaster. Mr. Polite was  one of the early leaders in the civil rights movement in Lancaster in  the 1960s. He was a fierce advocate who worked hard to change the  unjust policies of segregation.   Mr. Polite devoted his life to the ideals of fairness and justice for  everyone, regardless of their skin color. He organized protests against  Whites-only admittance at Rocky Springs pool and followed in the  footsteps of his father, who helped found the Lancaster NAACP.   Mr. Polite led by example and represented the goodness of our  community. He was active in his church and worked to ensure that  residents had job opportunities, housing, and overall quality of life.   He served as a Lancaster councilman for 12 years. This month, Black  History Month, marks 3 years since he passed away, but the evidence of  the change that he fought for is evident in our community. I was proud  to count him as a personal friend, and it is my honor to remember him  today and, this month, highlight the work that he did.                            ____________________
