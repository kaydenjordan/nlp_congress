 Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to  remind my colleagues that April is National Sexual Assault Awareness  Month. We commemorate it each year to bring public awareness to the  staggering problem of sexual violence.   Tens of thousands of people in the United States and hundreds of my  fellow Iowans annually fall victim to this heinous crime. Sexual  assault occurs at least every minute and a half, according to law  enforcement statistics. These same figures reveal an increase in rape  cases since 2011, contrary to claims by the former Obama administration  that the violent crime rate had declined in recent years. But up to  two-thirds of sexual assaults are never reported to police, say crime  victim advocates. This means that the average perpetrator strikes  multiple times before being brought to justice. Equally as troubling,  the incarceration rate is less than one percent of all sexual assaults  reported to law enforcement.   The FBI ranks rape as one of the two most violent crimes, second only  to murder in its effects. Survivors suffer not only physical  consequences, but sometimes life-shattering emotional effects as well.  According to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network, as well as the  National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, post-traumatic stress  disorder is typical. Depression or even suicide is not uncommon. The  healing process is often slow and painstaking.   Today, I introduced a bipartisan resolution to commemorate Sexual  Assault Awareness Month and honor the survivors of this heinous crime.  I thank Senators Feinstein and Ernst for joining me as cosponsors of  the resolution.   During my time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have  made crime survivors rights a top priority. Two years ago, we passed,  and the President signed, major legislation to benefit the survivors of  human trafficking. Last year, the President also signed the House  version of a survivors' bill of rights that our committee reported as  part of the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act and we approved legislation  to extend programs that support the analysis of sexual assault evidence  by the Nation's crime labs.   Supporting and protecting survivors of sexual violence will continue  to be a focus for our committee in 2017. Last month, I convened a  hearing to examine allegations that dozens of young athletes  experienced sexual abuse at the hands of coaches, instructors, and  others. I recently joined our committee's ranking member, Senator  Feinstein, in introducing the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual  Abuse Act. The bill's purpose is to ensure that sexual assault  allegations by young athletes will be reported and investigated  promptly. This year we will also make it a priority to extend and  update programs that are authorized under the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act.   Mr. President, I will close by reaffirming my support for survivors  of sexual violence and expressing my continued commitment to advocate  for them. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of the  resolution I have introduced today.                            ____________________
