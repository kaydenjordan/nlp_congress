 Madam Speaker, the right to vote free from  intimidation or obstacle is the most precious right of any American  citizen, a pillar of our democratic system. And when that right, that  pillar, is threatened for anyone, it is a threat to us all--to our  democracy and to our very way of life.   For Texans, this fight is personal. Earlier this year, Republican  lawmakers in the Texas Legislature introduced a series of new voting  laws, yet antiquated in thought, that would restrict access to the  polls for people across the state. Unfortunately, we are all too  familiar with these types of efforts to strip our right to vote here in  Texas. In fact, I remember having to pay a poll tax when I voted in my  first election in Dallas. And although these new efforts are not as  blatant as a poll tax, they are equally as confining.   These new waves of voter restriction efforts are not new--and neither  is the opposition to them. From our late colleague Congressman John  Lewis marching across the Edmund Pettis Bridge in 1965, to the  extension of the Voting Rights Act in 2006, to the Texas Democrats  breaking quorum to prevent the passage of restrictive voting laws this  month. It is incumbent upon us to keep alive that opposition to similar  efforts, and to inform and inspire the next generation to do the same.   It is in that spirit that I, once again, call on the Senate to pass  H.R. 1, the For the People Act. We can no longer afford the cost of  inaction on this issue. This fight is about the future of Texas, it's  about the future of the United States, and it's about the future of  democracy.
