 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for your incredible work and that of your committee.   A few weeks ago, my colleagues across the aisle were animated in  their support of fairness for women. So here is the moment to dispel  any doubts that that was just a disingenuous defense of bigotry and  truly help American women by supporting this transformative  legislation.   Women have been on the front lines of this crisis. Over two million  women have been pushed out of work while fighting to keep their  families fed, healthy, and housed. Because of this pandemic, women's  participation in the workforce is at a 33-year low.   A vote ``yes'' for the American Rescue Plan is a vote to say vaccines  can get into the arms of teachers and our frontline workers. That  direct checks will go to 85 percent of Americans. An expanded child tax  credit will cut child poverty in half. Unprecedented childcare funding  will directly benefit its workforce made up of 95 percent women.   Vote ``yes'' for women. Vote ``yes'' for families. Vote ``yes'' for a  more equitable future.    Mr. Speaker, in 2016, after the tragic  Pulse nightclub shooting, I, with my colleagues, sat in protest on this  very floor with our friend, the late Congressman John Lewis. On that  day, Congressman Lewis told us: ``We have turned deaf ears to the blood  of the innocent and the concern of our Nation. We are blind to a  crisis.''   Mr. Speaker, nearly 5 years later, we have endured thousands of mass  shootings. We have mourned the loss of 100 people every single day to  suicide and homicide with guns.   Today's vote will improve the safety of our schools, our communities,  and our streets. It is a vote for kids, parents, veterans, and our  neighbors. I stand here today thinking of the many survivors and  families who have been waiting for this moment, and I think of my  friend, John, who told us to always speak out for the voiceless and act  boldly for justice.   Today, with this bill, we will do just that.                                time  1500
