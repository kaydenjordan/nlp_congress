 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I am going to be reading the  email portions of Rob Goldstone to Donald Trump, Jr. On June 3, 2016,  at 10:36 a.m., Rob Goldstone wrote to Donald Trump, Jr., the following:   ``Good morning.   ``Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very  interesting.   ``The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this  morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with  some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary  and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.   ``This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is  part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump--helped along  by Aras and Emin.   ``What do you think is the best way to handle this information and  would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?   ``I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra  sensitive so wanted to send to you first.   ``Best.   ``Rob Goldstone.''    Mr. Speaker, after we finish reading  these emails into the Congressional Record, we are going to discuss why  it is a straight-up violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.   On Monday, June 6, 2016, Rob Goldstone writes back to Donald Trump,  Jr., in an email at 12:40 p.m., with a subject heading: ``Russia-- Clinton--private and confidential.''                                time  1300    ``Hi, Don.   ``Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this  Hillary info--you had mentioned early this week so wanted to try to  schedule a time and day.   ``Best to you and family.   ``Rob Goldstone.''   On June 6, 2016, at 3:03 p.m., Donald Trump, Jr., wrote back:   ``Rob, could we speak now?   ``D.''   Then Rob Goldstone replies to Donald Trump, Jr., that same day at  3:37 p.m.:   ``Let me track him down in Moscow.   ``What number he could call?''  [[Page H5877]]    By the way, any email where someone says tracking someone down in  Moscow might just raise some red flags.    Then Rob Goldstone replies: ``Okay. He is  on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 minutes so I am sure can  call.   ``Rob.''    The next day, on June 7, 2016, at 4:20  p.m., Rob Goldstone writes:   ``Don.   ``Hope all is well.   ``Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and the Russian  Government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.   ``I believe you are aware of the meeting--and so wondered if 3 p.m.  or later on Thursday works for you?   ``I assume it would be at your office.   ``Best.   ``Rob Goldstone.''    Later that same day, on June 7, 2016, Rob  Goldstone wrote back to Donald Trump, Jr.:   ``Perfect won't sit in on the meeting, but will bring them at 3 p.m.  and introduce you, et cetera?   ``I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for  security when I have them later today.   ``Best.   ``Rob.''   By the way, we now know today that one of those names just happens to  be a Soviet counterintelligence officer.    On June 8, the next day, at 10:34 a.m.,  Rob Goldstone writes back to Donald Trump, Jr.:   ``Good morning.   ``Would it be possible to move tomorrow meeting to 4 p.m. as the  Russian attorney is in court until 3, I was just informed?   ``Best.   ``Rob.''    On Wednesday, June 8, 2016, at 11:18  a.m., Rob Goldstone writes back:   ``They can't do today as she hasn't landed yet from Moscow, 4 p.m. is  great tomorrow.   ``Best.   ``Rob.''    So that completes the email chain.   Under Federal law, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, you  cannot solicit or accept any contribution from a foreign national or  foreign country. The law defines a contribution not as just a monetary  donation but anything of value, an in-kind donation, opposition  research, anything of value violates the law.   In this case, we absolutely have conspiracy to violate the Federal  Election Campaign Act.   I am a former prosecutor. I know it is very easy to prove a charge of  conspiracy. You just have to have the person take one act in  furtherance of the conspiracy. So in this case, when Donald Trump, Jr.,  replies back to the offer of this incriminating information, Hillary  Clinton, and says, ``I love it,'' that is one act. He then proceeds to  set up a meeting. That is another act. He then shows up at the meeting  with Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort. That is a third act. That more  than completes a crime conspiracy. We have in black and white right  here a violation of Federal law.    Our security clearances would have been  suspended immediately. An investigation would have been opened.   I am glad you mentioned Jared Kushner because many of us are  wondering, why does he still have a security clearance? Why is he even  in the White House?   Let's just sort of walk through a little bit of what happened with  his security clearance. On the very first security clearance form,  known as an SF-86 form, he lied on it. He did not disclose a single  meeting with the Russians.   If you read the form, it says: if you make a false statement or omit  material facts, you can be imprisoned.   He omitted all that information. He is then confronted, and what does  he do? He revises it. So then he submits a second security clearance  form.   Now, it turns out he lied on that one, too, because he did not  disclose this latest meeting that happened to be with a Russian  counterintelligence officer. So then he had to submit a third form.  When you look at his explanation, according to media reports, he said  that his staff hit the send button too soon.   Well, both Representative Gallego and I know that that is not how you  submit the security clearance form. It is a pretty involved, elaborate  process. You have to do this certification. Not only do you have to  send it electronically, then you have to sign the paper and submit that  with your signature on it--very elaborate.   So now he is lying about the process in which he lied on the three  security clearance forms. We don't know why he has a security  clearance. We don't know why he is even in the White House.    So let me follow up what Representative  Gallego said. We have a person in the White House now with a security  clearance even though he has lied on at least two of those forms. So  there actually needs to be an investigation. That security clearance  needs to be suspended immediately.   But, also, for any intelligence official watching this or reading  about this, how can you trust Jared Kushner when he lied on these  security clearance forms and makes a mockery of the process?   Keep in mind this is the same person who suggested setting up a  secret back channel with the Russians at the Russian Embassy. So the  only reason you would want to use Russian equipment at the Russian  Embassy is to hide information from U.S. intelligence. So even if his  security clearance is not suspended, I really hope that people working  for him do not trust him.    Let me conclude by saying that the  President said that most people would have taken this meeting. That is  just not true.   Again, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, if you solicit, or  conspire to solicit, or show up at a meeting where you expect to get  opposition research from a foreign national, that is a violation of the  Federal law. So, in fact, most people would not have taken this meeting  unless they were crooked.   We have an example here of what happened when the Al Gore campaign  got information. They were sent anonymously briefing notes and things  that then Bush was being briefed on and so on. They took that package,  and they turned it over to the FBI. That is what should have happened  in this case.   In conclusion, this is a pretty big deal. We have people in the White  House who believe they are above the law. The lesson in Watergate is  that no one is above the law.
