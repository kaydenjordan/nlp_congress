 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3312, the Crisis  Stabilization and Community Reentry Act of 2020. I was proud to  introduce this House companion bill, this bipartisan piece of  legislation, with Representatives Rutherford, Trone, Armstrong, Dean,  and Scanlon.   The Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act authorizes grants  for State and local correctional facilities to partner with community  mental health and behavioral health providers to provide clinical  services for people with serious mental illness and substance abuse  disorders.   When I served as a district judge in southwestern Pennsylvania, many  of those who came before my bench were suffering from untreated and  undiagnosed mental illness. In fact, according to a 2012 Bureau of  Justice Statistics survey, approximately 1 in 7 State and Federal  prisoners, and 1 in 4 jail inmates met the threshold for serious  psychological distress in the 30 days prior.   S. 3312 ensures that we provide these individuals with treatment,  suicide prevention, and tools for long-term recovery upon release from  a correctional facility. By ensuring continuity of mental healthcare,  we can facilitate successful reentry, which is critical to reducing  recidivism; in turn, improving public safety and saving taxpayer  dollars.   I want to, again, thank my fellow sponsors in the House, as well as  Senators Cornyn and Blumenthal, for prioritizing this important issue.   I am proud to support this bipartisan, bicameral bill that will give  law enforcement the tools that they need to keep our communities safe,  while also ending the revolving door between prison and the streets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3312, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, once again, I would like  to urge my colleagues to support S. 3312, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, while I support this legislation, I strongly believe in  ensuring justice for all victims and their families. I want to be  absolutely clear that the continued crisis at our border requires more  from Congress.   S. 2174 provides resources to law enforcement and related entities  tasked with processing the remains of those who tragically died while  making the dangerous journey to enter this country illegally.   But Congress should be doing more to secure our borders and to  prevent these tragic deaths in the first place. I am concerned about  the burdens this bill places on our already strained U.S. Customs and  Border Protection.   Under this bill, CBP is charged with documenting information about  individuals who died at the border, reporting on the causes of their  deaths, and mapping their final locations. I truly fear that these  reports may be used by open-border advocates to malign the men and  women of the U.S. Border Patrol when those advocates inevitably decide  to play politics and start to argue that CBP is not doing enough to  mitigate migrant deaths.   In reality, to prevent future deaths at the border, we need to make  it absolutely clear that no one should embark on this dangerous journey  because illegal entry is simply not an option. We must fix our broken  immigration system, which incentivizes people to cross our border  illegally. Strong border security and interior enforcement is the best  way to stop loss of life.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, in closing, while I support this  bill, I think Congress must do more to secure our borders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
