 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to introduce the  bipartisan Marshall ``Major'' Taylor Congressional Gold Medal Act, the  highest honor this body can bestow upon an American.   Major Taylor was the greatest athlete of his era, America's first  sports superstar, and a world champion, but he has been left out of our  history books. We need to bring him out of the shadows and recognize  his greatness both on and off the track.   Not only did Taylor set world records and dominate his sport, but he  did so while facing down racists and bigots in the Jim Crow era.   Race organizers would try to exclude him from events. Other cyclists  would viciously insult him and even did physical harm.   Despite it all, the son of a Union soldier rose above it, setting  record after record and becoming a world champion.   Even when compared to today's athletes, Major Taylor is among the  greatest cyclists of all time. It is time that Congress recognizes his  greatness and award him a Congressional Gold Medal.                            ____________________
