 Mr. Chairman, I thank the new chairman of the Budget  Committee for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the debate and I understand the  difficulty that both sides have with fixing this system.   We clearly believe the system needs to be repealed and replaced.  Moreover, the system needs to be reformed. And there is perhaps no  better prominent Democrat in this country who has made the case for  reforming this system. I quote former President Bill Clinton, who said  just last October:         So you have got this crazy system where, all of a sudden,       25 million more people have health care and then the people       who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind       up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in       half. It's the craziest thing in the world.    President Bill Clinton.   Mr. Chairman, this is just the first step in terms of fixing this  problem. The taxes, the premium increases, the loss of coverage, the  small businesses who have been priced out of the market, the  discouragement of employment in our country because of the costs that  are imposed on the business sector through the ACA have to be fixed;  they have to be addressed. Today is just the first step in addressing  that.   Later, we will have regulatory changes that come from the Department  of Health and Human Services. More importantly, we will all have to  come back here to work out a new plan to fix it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.
