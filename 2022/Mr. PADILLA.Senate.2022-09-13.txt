 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life  of Larry Petree, a beloved member of the Bakersfield community and a  pioneer in the creation of a uniquely Californian brand of country  music.   Larry Petree was born in Oklahoma in 1933 at the heart of the Great  Depression. Like so many Americans from Dust Bowl communities in the  1930s, at the age of 9, Larry's family moved out West and settled in  Bakersfield, CA. He attended Bakersfield High School before going on to  serve a tour of duty in the U.S. Army and then working for over three  decades as a mechanic with the Kern County Fire Department, where he  could overhaul truck engines with ease.   But Larry's friends and fans knew him best working with a different  instrument. From his seat behind his pedal steel guitar, he helped to  produce the ``Bakersfield Sound,'' an entirely new, rock `n roll- inspired genre of country music that introduced the sounds of  California country to a national audience in the 1960s.   For decades, Larry's masterful control of the twangy steel guitar  brought life and energy to the honky-tonks and watering holes of the  Central Valley. Playing alongside country artists Red Simpson, Tommy  Hays, and the Western Swingsters, his music joined the likes of Merle  Haggard and Buck Owens to help fuel a movement that proved California  could be home to the country music industry. And he did it all, in  large part, thanks to the support of his wife Betty, his beloved  partner for over 60 years.   California is grateful for his service to our country, his  contributions to our culture, and for the timeless music he introduced  to our communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Guaranteeing Overtime for Truckers Act, which I introduced today.   America's truckdrivers are on the frontlines of keeping goods and our  economy moving. More than 70 percent of goods across the United States  are shipped by truck.   Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting supply chain  crisis exacerbated longstanding challenges for truckers, including long  hours away from home and time spent waiting--often unpaid--to load and  unload at congested ports, warehouses, and distribution centers.   As our Nation makes historic investments in our port and supply chain  infrastructure through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we should  also improve wages and working conditions for essential workers and  ensure they are paid for all of the hours they work.   However, for more than 80 years, Federal law has denied truckers  guaranteed overtime pay benefits that are afforded to nearly all other  professions. This means that if a truckdriver experiences delays due to  congestion or weather, they are often not paid even though they are  working.   The motor carrier exemption is exacerbating trucking workforce  challenges. Additionally, research suggests that when truck labor rates  are fair, there is less driver fatigue, fewer regulatory violations,  and lower crash rates.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to repeal the overtime  exemption for motor carriers.   I want to thank Senator Markey for co-leading this bill with me, and  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill that will  ensure that trucker compensation reflects the fact that these jobs are  essential.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Daines):   S. 4826. A bill to amend the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003  to modify the definition of the term ``at-risk community'' ; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.   Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Community Wildfire Protection Act, bipartisan legislation that Senator  Daines and I are introducing today.   This bill would ensure that those communities that are deemed to be  under the greatest threat from wildfire are eligible to receive  existing Federal wildfire grants. This sounds obvious but unfortunately  is not the case under existing law.   This will help more communities in our home States of California and  Montana and others throughout the West access Federal grants to reduce  hazardous fuels around their communities and reduce the threat posed by  wildfire. In particular, it would protect areas at risk of a large- scale wildfire that would significantly threaten human life and  property.   Aligning the definition in law for at-risk communities to today's  environmental realities is more important than ever given the increased  spread, frequency, and destructiveness of wildfires, especially in the  West.   The current definition of an ``at-risk community'' was codified in  the 2003 Healthy Forest Restoration Act. That law requires that, other  than experiencing significant wildfire risk, an eligible community must  either be adjacent to Federal land or included on a list generated in  2001 consisting of voluntary input from States and Tribes.   To be clear, including a town on this list was not based on an  objective evaluation of wildfire risk or threat to life and property,  only whether an individual Governor or Tribal leader decided to add it.  There are obvious omissions from the list that show its inadequacy, and  in fact, 19 States and territories never submitted a single community.   For example, in California, big cities like Fresno, Fairfield, and  Napa are not included, all of which have experienced major wildfires in  recent years, nor are countless small towns that are at great risk of  wildfire. The town of Grizzly Flats, CA, which was devastated by the  2021 Caldor Fire, is also notably absent from the list.   The exclusion of these communities means that they are not eligible  for Federal grant funding that would help them develop and implement  wildfire resiliency plans, such as hazardous fuels reduction, nor can  they utilize critical authorities to expedite wildfire mitigation  projects on nearby Federal lands.   Our bill would simply end the practice of making Federal grants  contingent on being this outdated, incomplete list. Instead, our  legislation would allow communities to be included based on the most  up-to-date quantitative wildfire risk data for the entire United  States--data that are already maintained by the U.S. Forest Service.   Our bill would also allow communities not immediately within or  adjacent to Federal lands to qualify as ``at risk'' of wildfire. This  is important given a recent survey of more than 22,000 fires that  indicated that wildfires are more likely to start on private lands and  burn into Federal forestlands than the reverse. Federal policies must  adapt to recognize this fact, not prevent funding from going to where  it would be most effective.   Better tailoring Federal grants to the areas at greatest risk of  wildfire is particularly essential given congressional funding of  wildfire resilience projects, including $1.8 billion that passed as  part the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act.   I am proud that our bill has received the support of the National  Association of Counties, Rural County Representatives of California,  the National Association of State Foresters, the Pacific Forest Trust,  and the California Fire Safe Council.   I am pleased to work with Senator Daines on this commonsense bill  that will save lives, save communities, and ensure that Federal dollars  are spent as effectively as possible.    Mr. President, my bill is simple--just three lines long--but it  would ensure that our Federal policies enable billions in wildfire  resiliency funding to be applied where it is needed most.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 4832. A bill to temporarily prohibit the hiring of additional  Internal Revenue Service employees until a certain level of taxpayer  services have improved, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.
