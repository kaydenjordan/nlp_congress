 Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate a message from the House of Representatives.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House disagree to the amendment of the       Senate to the bill (H.R. 1) entitled ``An Act to provide for       reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent       resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018,'' and ask a       conference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the       two Houses thereon.     Mr. President, last week, Senators answered the call  of our constituents by voting to overhaul our complex and outdated  Federal Tax Code.   We seized the opportunity to spur economic growth, to help create  jobs right here at home, and to take more money out of Washington's  pocket and put more money into the pockets of hard-working American  families.   Our bill also helps to provide for the country's energy security by  further developing Alaska's oil and gas potential in an environmentally  responsible way, and it delivers relief to low- and middle-income  Americans by repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate tax.   I would like to once again thank every one of my colleagues who  supported this once-in-a-generation effort to make our Tax Code work  for the middle class and to help them get ahead.   Since the beginning of this process, we said that tax reform would be  done through regular order and an open process. That is exactly what  has happened.   Under Chairman Hatch's leadership, the Senate Finance Committee  hosted dozens of hearings over multiple years and a full committee  markup. Members on both sides of the aisle had a chance to offer  amendments both in committee and on the floor. We considered numerous  amendments and, when it came time to vote, the Senate approved the  bill. This has been a years-long process to deliver tax reform. We have  come a long way, and we still have more work ahead of us.   Earlier this week, our colleagues in the House voted to work with  Members of the Senate to produce a final bill to send to the  President's desk. Later today, the Senate will do the same. We will  vote to join our colleagues in a conference to finish our work on tax  reform. The American people deserve taxes that are lower, simpler, and  fairer. By voting for a conference, we will be one step closer to  getting it done.   I look forward to voting to send our legislation to conference later  today.                            Funding the Government    Mr. President, now on another matter, with the cooperation of our  colleagues, Congress will pass a short-term continuing resolution  before the end of the week. Once the House passes a continuing  resolution, the Senate will have a chance to consider it as well.   By sending this short-term funding provision to the President for his  signature, we will ensure that the government remains open while  bipartisan discussions continue with our colleagues in Congress and the  White House on a long-term funding solution.   In the meantime, it is important to recognize that this bill doesn't  have any contentious provisions. We should all support it. A vote for  this short-term measure will help maintain our military, it will  continue the important work of Federal agencies, and it will provide  States with certainty to continue funding the Children's Health  Insurance Program until a bipartisan CHIP reauthorization agreement is  finalized.   When the House sends us the short-term continuing resolution later  this week, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for it.  That way, we can continue the critical operations of the Federal  Government while we work to finalize a long-term solution.                          Reservation of Leader Time     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its  amendment, agree to the request of the House for a conference, and  authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  on the pending compound motion occur at 3 p.m. today; further, that if  the motion is agreed to, Senators King and Stabenow each be recognized  to offer a motion to instruct conferees, and that the Senate vote on  the motions in the order listed with no intervening action or debate;  further, that there be 2 minutes of debate between each vote, equally  divided in the usual form; finally, I ask that following disposition of  the Stabenow motion, the Senate stand in recess until 5:10 p.m. to  accommodate an all-Members briefing.
