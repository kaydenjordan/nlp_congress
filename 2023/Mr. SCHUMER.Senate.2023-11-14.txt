 Madam President, tomorrow, for the second time since  taking office, President Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi  Jinping during the APEC summit in San Francisco.   Above all, I look forward to President Biden pushing President Xi on  something I raised during the bipartisan codel I led to China: cracking  down on the sale of precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl.   When my Senate colleagues and I met with President Xi, we explained  in stark detail how destructive the fentanyl crisis was here in America  and that China had a responsibility to do its part to stop its  trafficking. One step we strongly urged President Xi to take is for  Chinese law enforcement to coordinate with the United States to enforce  laws already on the books on the sale of precursor chemicals. I believe  we have made progress on this issue, and I am very optimistic that good  news will come from tomorrow's meeting regarding fentanyl when  President Biden meets with President Xi.   If China stopped the sale of chemicals used to make fentanyl, it  would not only save countless American lives but even benefit China, as  it would go a long way to improving China's image in the minds of  Americans.   So, just as we pushed President Xi on cracking down on fentanyl last  month, I expect President Biden will urge him to do so tomorrow, and I  think we may see real results. When we met with President Xi in person,  we were pointed and specific with our questions and issues and found  him to be responsive, and I hope President Biden will have the same  sort of frank conversation tomorrow with President Xi.                            ____________________     Madam President, we have until Friday to avert another  costly, unnecessary, and avoidable government shutdown. Time is a  luxury that neither side has. If we are going to keep the lights on  beyond this Friday, our Republican colleagues will have to work with  Democrats in a bipartisan way to pass a clean extension without hard- right cuts and without poison pills.   So far, I am heartened--cautiously so--that Speaker Johnson is moving  forward with a CR that omits precisely the sort of hard-right cuts that  would have been nonstarters for Democrats. I certainly don't agree with  everything the Speaker is proposing, and I can't imagine too many  Senators would have taken the Speaker's approach in drafting this bill.  But the proposal before  [[Page S5482]]  the House does two things Democrats have pushed for: It will avert a  shutdown, and it will do so without making any terrible, hard-right  cuts that the MAGA rightwing demands. It also eliminates the poison  pills that so many MAGA Congress Members put in the bills.   We will see over the course of today how the House moves forward.  Over the past few days, a significant portion of the Speaker's hard- right flank has torched his proposal precisely because it doesn't make  cuts. I hope the Speaker does not yield to the demands of the hard  right as we try to keep the government open. Instead, I hope the  Speaker continues to recognize he will need Democratic votes in order  to avoid a shutdown.                            ____________________     Madam President, on Senator Tuberville, today, the  Senate Rules Committee will mark up a resolution allowing the Senate to  quickly confirm the military promotions currently being blocked by  Senator Tuberville. I will join the Rules Committee later today--I am a  member of the committee; it is the only committee on which I serve--and  vote in favor of this resolution. I will vote in favor of the Rules  Committee's resolution.   For 9 months, Senator Tuberville has thumbed his nose at longstanding  Senate custom and prevented the swift, bipartisan confirmations of  hundreds of generals and flag officers. Each time Members from both  sides have tried to reason with Senator Tuberville, he has only dug in  further.   As a result of Senator Tuberville's holds, America's national  security is now paying the price. Our military readiness is paying the  price, and our military spouses and kids, who can't plan the next  chapters in their lives even though they have served us for many, many  years--they pay the price too.   Patience is wearing thin with Senator Tuberville on both sides of the  aisle. I strongly support this resolution to overcome these military  holds, and if it is reported out of committee today and if our  Republican colleagues cannot soon convince Senator Tuberville to drop  his holds, I will bring it to the floor for a vote.   I thank Chair Klobuchar and Chairman Reed for their good work on  moving this important resolution.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the student debt CRA, as soon as  today, Senate Republicans will force a vote on a cruel measure to  eliminate President Biden's historic Student Loan Repayment Program and  strip away a critical lifeline for millions and millions of borrowers.  I strongly oppose this terrible Republican measure to deny American  families a critical lifeline just 1 month after the pause on student  loan payments ended.   My Republican colleagues talk a big game about helping working  families, but with this student debt congressional resolution, they are  actively trying to block relief that would immediately improve the  lives of so many working Americans. The hypocrisy is glaring.  Republicans are willing to give huge tax breaks to ultrawealthy  billionaires and large corporations, but when it comes to helping  working families, Republicans refuse to give them a break. They say  that it costs too much money. But billionaire tax cuts don't? Give me a  break.   Right now, there are over 5.5 million borrowers involved in President  Biden's SAVE Plan, including nearly 300,000 in my home State of New  York alone. So the worst thing we could do for these borrowers and  these families right now is let this Republican CRA pass and strip away  this critical lifeline.   I will strongly oppose this Republican CRA to overturn student debt  relief, and Democrats will keep working to make sure relief reaches  every borrower in need.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the Supreme Court, yesterday, for  the first time, the U.S. Supreme Court announced the adoption of an  ethical code of conduct for Justices. At a time when Americans' trust  in the High Court is deeply, deeply shaken, the Supreme Court has taken  an important step to lay down basic rules of the road for our Justices.  Frankly, this should have happened a long time ago. Lower courts have  long been required to embrace an ethical code of conduct, and there is  no reason that the Supreme Court should not have done the same.   Now, while the Supreme Court's announcement was important, its lack  of enforceability is a glaring omission. Justices, it seems, are left  to their own devices in applying this code to themselves. Frankly,  Americans could be excused if they are skeptical after everything they  have read in the paper about Justices accepting lavish gifts and  vacationing with ultrarich ideologues, some of whom bring cases before  the Court.   Sheldon Whitehouse said it well. He said: It is as if they are  agreeing to the rules of baseball but no umpires.   So, while the Justices' code of conduct is a necessary and important  step, it cannot be the final word. The public's trust in our courts is  a key feature of our democratic society, and there is a lot of work  left to do before that trust is fully restored. Congress must--must-- continue its efforts to hold the judiciary accountable.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on an FCC letter, last month, my  colleagues and I wrote the FCC, urging them to adopt a number of key  principles from our infrastructure law that fight against digital  discrimination and ensure equal access to high-speed internet. Well, I  have good news. The FCC heard us loud and clear and will vote tomorrow  to implement the provisions I pushed with my colleagues to ensure  everyone can access high-speed internet no matter what ZIP Code they  live in.   The digital divide has caused our country so much damage. It has shut  out rural, urban, and low-income Americans, including far too many  women and people of color, for whom basic internet access remains  unavailable or unaffordable.   I am proud of the great work we did to address the digital divide in  our bipartisan infrastructure law.   Now I encourage all of the FCC Commissioners to take advantage of the  provisions in our infrastructure law so that underserved communities  can access high-speed internet just like everybody else.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a circuit court judge, last night,  the Senate confirmed the 37th circuit court judge under President  Biden: Ana de Alba to serve as circuit court judge for the Ninth  Circuit.   Judge de Alba's confirmation is significant. She is the 30th Hispanic  judge confirmed by this Democratic majority under President Biden. With  the confirmation of this 30th Hispanic judge, that is the most Hispanic  judges confirmed by any President in one term--something we can all be  proud of. That is the most Hispanic judges ever confirmed by any  President in his first term--30--30 new Hispanic judges.   We are making the bench look more like America. One judge at a time,  Democrats are making our courts look more like America--greater  diversity, more women, a broader range of professional and personal  experiences. We will keep going.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I have eight requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
