 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague  from Illinois,   Danny Davis, for giving me the opportunity to speak in  support of the Joanne Smith Rehabilitation Innovation Center.   I also offer a big thank you to Senator Durbin, who was the chief  sponsor of the legislation in the United States Senate and to finally  bring this to fruition.   This bill will recognize rehabilitation research facilities in  conducting not only research but treating patients based on the  research that is found. It includes the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in  Chicago, which is also in Congressman Davis' district. This lab goes  above and beyond to treat complex medical cases across the country.  From traumatic brain injuries to third-degree burns, patients benefit  from this work.   This bill ensures that cutting-edge research and best practices are  shared across the country.   This bill honors Dr. Joanne Smith, who is the former president and  CEO of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. As Congressman Davis pointed out,  she sadly died of cancer last year, but Dr. Smith devoted her entire  career to helping patients. It is fitting that we honor her legacy with  this legislation, and I certainly appreciate the bipartisan support,  and I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
