 I really believe we need to fight.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Merkley submits a question for the  House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         If a President spins a big lie to anger Americans and       stokes the fury by repeating the lie at event after event and       invites violent groups to DC the day and hour necessary to       interrupt the electoral college count and does nothing to       stop those groups from advancing on the Capitol and fails to       summon the National Guard to protect the Capitol and then       expresses pleasure and delight that the Capitol was under       attack, is the President innocent of inciting an insurrection       because in a speech he says ``be peaceful''?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers have 5 minutes.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. You all ask a very important question,  which is, given everything that the President did leading up to the  election, after the election, and leading up to January 6, all of the  incitement of his supporters, whom he convinced with a big lie over and  over that the election had been stolen from them and from him, and then  once the mob had stormed the Capitol, the Vice President was in danger,  the Speaker was in danger, the Members of the House and the Senate and  all the staff here--the janitorial staff, the cafeteria workers,  everybody--and all of the hot rhetoric that he spoke with and then  simply a few times said ``stay peaceful''--remember, he said ``stay  peaceful'' when they had already gotten violent, when they had already  brought weapons, when they had already hurt people. What he never said  was: Stop the attack. Leave the Capitol. Leave immediately.   Let me be clear. The President's message in that January 6 speech was  incendiary. So in the entire speech, which was roughly 1,100 words, he  used the word ``peaceful'' once, and using the word ``peaceful'' was  the only suggestion of nonviolence. President Trump used the word  ``fight'' or ``fighting'' 20 times.   Now, again, consider the context. He had been telling them a big lie  over and over, getting them amped up, getting them angry because an  election had been stolen from them. There are thousands of people in  front of him. Some of them are carrying weapons and arms. They are  angry. He is telling them to fight.   President Trump's words in that speech, just like the mob's actions,  were carefully chosen. His words incited their actions. Now, how do we  know this? For months, the President had told his supporters his big  lie that the election was rigged, and he used the lie to urge his  supporters not to concede and to stop the steal.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. If you rob a bank and on the way out the door,  you yell ``respect private property,'' that is not a defense to robbing  the bank.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.
