 Madam Speaker, I rise today because violent anti- Semitism continues to threaten our country, including in my home State  of New Jersey.   Investigations are still underway, but I was devastated to learn that  the victims in a kosher market in Jersey City, New Jersey, were likely  targeted because they were Jewish.   All Americans should be outraged when fellow citizens are targeted  simply because of their religion. The Anti-Defamation League has  reported that anti-Semitism remains at near historic levels, with New  Jersey ranked third in the Nation last year.   We must stand together now to denounce hate targeted at anyone and  prevent more violence.   New Jersey stands together to honor the police officers harmed in the  attack, who were doing what they do every single day, getting our  backs, especially Detective Joseph Seals, a wonderful father of five  beautiful children and a 15-year police veteran who gave his own life  protecting his community.   We mourn with his loved ones, and our prayers are with the officers  and community members still recovering.   Together, as one New Jersey, and as Americans, I know we can combat  this hate, which has no place in our community, in the State of New  Jersey, or in our country.   May God continue to bless the people of Jersey City, the State of New  Jersey, and the United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 3, the  Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.   My amendment will ensure continued innovation and research to further  the development of lifesaving medicines for rare diseases, including  cancer, Alzheimer's, ALS, and rare disorders.   The challenge now is that, at best, only 1 out of every 20 clinical  trials result in a cure. This, of course, means that manufacturers  invest billions before they can find a medicine that can go to market  to help save lives. They don't just bet on the winners; they have to  also bet and take a lot of risks that don't turn out to succeed and get  to market.   America has the best medical innovators in the world. When our health  is on the line, we can't stop taking those risks to make sure that we  find those cures. We can't risk falling behind.   My amendment provides investment in qualified clinical testing for  drug applications that address unmet medical needs to treat rare and  life-threatening diseases, diseases that may go unaddressed without  extra incentives. My amendment requires HHS to conduct a study to  identify diseases without an FDA-approved treatment and where the  development of a treatment would fill an unmet medical need for these  rare diseases.   My amendment also requires HHS to identify appropriate incentives  that would ensure the continued investment in the development of these  treatments, treatments that will save lives of the children, adults,  and seniors of our families.   The Congressional Budget Office and other studies have shown  potential reductions in the number of drug approvals each year as a  potential risk of H.R. 3. This amendment helps address that concern.   Targeted therapies and medicines serving smaller populations stand to  lose the most from this blow to R&D. These are areas where the science  is the most difficult but also the most important, such as cancers and  other rare diseases. Cures for these horrific diseases could always be  just around the corner, but not if we are forced to abandon what might  be the next cure.   While I appreciate the intention of H.R. 3 to reinvest savings in  medical research, including at NIH and FDA, without this amendment,  there would still be no clear answer to explain what might happen to  the incredible research and development work that occurs every day in  the private sector. This amendment addresses that.   I know how critical NIH funding is and have consistently advocated  for increasing the investment in research there. However, NIH does not  manufacture medication, and neither does the FDA. The private sector,  including all the research being done every day in my home State of New  Jersey, manufactures the lifesaving medications that Americans rely on  every single day.   It is also why my Republican colleague from Michigan, Fred Upton, and  I introduced bipartisan legislation this week, the Protecting America's  Life Saving Medicines Act, to ensure that life sciences companies  continue to invest in these innovative drugs with a tax credit for  qualified clinical research, again, to ensure that this research keeps  getting done and that they keep making the bets on moonshot drugs that,  without those investments, might not save lives like they do today,  again, in the greatest country in the world where we innovate like no  one else.   It is critical that we never give up hope that the next cure is  within our reach. My amendment today will help us to reach the goal of  curing our most life-threatening diseases.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for his  thoughtful comments and his thoughts about what I think is clearly an  unmet need and one we need to continue to invest in, so I thank him for  his leadership, too, sir.   Before I finish, let me just say that I urge all my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this amendment, because we need to keep making those  investments to keep our leadership as a country when it comes to R&D  innovation. It is one of the reasons why our country is so great and  why so many lives have been saved and so many families and children  helped.   We need to make sure that we get drug prices down overall, which is  why this legislation is so important, to make sure we have competition,  more development of generics in the marketplace and, of course, overall  the best quality healthcare in the world. It is critical for our  country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
