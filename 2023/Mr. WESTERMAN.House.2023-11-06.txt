 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1607) to clarify jurisdiction with respect to certain Bureau  of Reclamation pumped storage development, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1607         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LAND WITHDRAWAL AND RESERVATION.

(2) Lead agency.--The Bureau of Reclamation shall be the       lead agency with respect to environmental compliance.        (3) Withdrawal not major federal action.--The withdrawal of       the covered land shall not constitute a major Federal action       under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42       U.S.C. 4321, et seq.).        (4) Antideficiency.--The United States shall not be liable       for failure to carry out any obligation or activity       authorized to be carried out under this title (including any       such obligation or activity under the Agreement) if adequate       appropriations are not provided by Congress expressly to       carry out the purposes of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 1607, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague, Mr. Schweikert's bill  which enables the Bureau of Reclamation and Salt River Project to move  forward with developing pumped storage hydropower facilities in the  Salt River reservoir system in Arizona.   Pumped storage is an efficient means to store energy when supply  exceeds demand and has been shown to be one of the most useful methods  for regulating intermittent renewable generation resources, such as  wind and solar.   Based on initial work done by the Bureau of Reclamation in 2014, the  Salt River Project developed two possible locations for the  construction of a pumped storage hydropower project.   H.R. 1607 would withdraw approximately 17,000 acres of Federal lands  [[Page H5411]]  from the National Forest System and transfer it to the Bureau of  Reclamation for the development of pumped storage hydropower and the  development, generation, and transmission of electrical power and  energy.   Through the transfer of this land, the proposed pumped storage  project to be developed will be entirely within the authorities and  footprint of the Federal reclamation project--streamlining development  and maximizing Federal reclamation project benefits. Without it, the  project would need to be permitted by both the Bureau of Reclamation  and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I support and urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today does streamline  the permitting process for a project that is intended to keep energy  costs low, help stabilize the electric grid during peak demand, and  boost affordable and reliable energy.   As Mr. Schweikert explained, this is one of the oldest forms of  batteries that we have to pump water uphill when we have excess energy  and then to use it to generate energy on the off-hours.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1722) to amend the Grand Ronde Reservation Act, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1722         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Grand Ronde Reservation Act       Amendment of 2023''.       SEC. 2. GRAND RONDE RESERVATION ACT AMENDMENT.         Section 1(d) of Public Law 100-425 (commonly known as the       ``Grand Ronde Reservation Act''; 102 Stat. 1594; 108 Stat.       4566) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``lands within the State       of Oregon'' and inserting ``the 84 acres known as the       Thompson Strip'';        (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:        ``(2) Gaming prohibition.--Any real property obtained by       the Tribes as part of a land claim settlement approved by the       United States, including any real property purchased with       funds granted as part of any land claim settlement, shall not       be eligible, or used, for any class II gaming or class III       gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701       et seq.) (as those terms are defined in section 4 of that Act       (25 U.S.C. 2703)).''.       SEC. 3. TREATY RIGHTS OF FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES.          Nothing in this Act, or an amendment made by this Act,       shall be construed to enlarge, confirm, adjudicate, affect,       or modify any treaty right of an Indian Tribe (as defined in       section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education       Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 1722, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1722, the Grand Ronde Reservation Act Amendment of  2023, would amend the Grand Ronde Reservation Act to reflect that the  Grand Ronde Tribe's extinguishment of land claims against the United  States only applies to an 84-acre parcel of land known as the Thompson  Strip.   Alongside many Tribes in western Oregon, the Grand Ronde Tribe  entered into treaties with the United States in the 1850s. President  James Buchanan established the Grand Ronde Reservation in 1857, which  consisted of more than 60,000 acres. This solidified the Federal  Government's treatment of the Grand Ronde as a single Tribe for Federal  services and benefits.   However, in 1954, the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act was  signed into law which severed the trust relationship between the  Federal Government and the Tribe.   In 1983, the Tribe was successful in obtaining a restoration of  Federal recognition through enactment of the Grand Ronde Reservation  Act. This legislation also reestablished a reservation for the Tribe in  Yamhill County, Oregon.   On October 31, 1988, the Bureau of Land Management discovered several  [[Page H5412]]  surveying errors on a parcel of land known as the Thompson Strip, which  was located along the southeast boundary of the Tribe's reservation.   The BLM worked toward a resolution with the Tribe, which concluded in  1994 when Congress authorized a land transfer between the BLM and the  Tribe. While that legislation corrected the survey error, the Tribe  later determined that the phrase ``extinguishment of claims'' in the  bill would include all, and potential future, land claims within the  entire State of Oregon for the Tribe.   The Grand Ronde contends that this was done in error and that there  was no intention to bar them from future land claims beyond the  Thompson Strip.   H.R. 1722 would amend current law in order to specify that the Tribe  is only barred from bringing land claims related to the 84-acre  Thompson Strip parcel, not all lands within the State of Oregon.   Additionally, H.R. 1722 would add a gaming prohibition for any future  land claims and prohibits the use of any money received as part of a  land claim settlement from being used to purchase land for gaming  purposes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Salinas for her work on the  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this legislation clarifies the  land claims of the Grand Ronde Tribe so they can pursue and ensure  certainty, and it does ensure certainty regarding gaming. I appreciate  the gentlewoman for bringing this legislation and Ranking Member  Grijalva's work to move this in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3448) to amend chapter 3081 of title 54, United States Code,  to enhance the protection and preservation of America's battlefields,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3448         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``American Battlefield       Protection Program Enhancement Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD PROTECTION PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS.         (a) Definitions.--Section 308101 of title 54, United States       Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``Sec. 308101. Definitions         ``In this chapter:        ``(1) Secretary.--The term `Secretary' means the Secretary,       acting through the American Battlefield Protection Program.        ``(2) Battlefield reports.--The term `Battlefield Reports'       means, collectively--        ``(A) the document entitled `Report on the Nation's Civil       War Battlefields', prepared by the Civil War Sites Advisory       Commission, and dated July 1993; and        ``(B) the document entitled `Report to Congress on the       Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812       Sites in the United States', prepared by the National Park       Service, and dated September 2007.''.        (b) Preservation Assistance.--Section 308102(a) of title       54, United States Code, is amended by striking ``Federal''       and all that follows through ``organizations'' and inserting       ``Federal agencies, States, Tribes, local governments, other       public entities, educational institutions, and nonprofit       organizations''.  [[Page H5413]]         (c) Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants Improvements.--      Section 308103 of title 54, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:        ``(a) Eligible Site Defined.--In this section, the term       `eligible site'--        ``(1) means a site that--        ``(A) is not within the exterior boundaries of a unit of       the National Park System; and        ``(B) is identified in the Battlefield Reports as a       battlefield; and        ``(2) excludes sites identified in the Battlefield Reports       as associated historic sites.'';        (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``State and local       governments'' and inserting ``States, Tribes, local       governments, and nonprofit organizations'';        (3) in subsection (c), by striking ``State or local       government'' and inserting ``State, Tribe, or local       government''; and        (4) in subsection (e), by striking ``under this section''       and inserting ``under this section, including by States,       Tribes, local governments, and nonprofit organizations,''.        (d) Battlefield Restoration Grants Improvements.--Section       308105 of title 54, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:        ``(a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a       battlefield restoration grant program (referred to in this       section as the `program') under which the Secretary may       provide grants to States, Tribes, local governments, and       nonprofit organizations for projects that restore day-of-      battle conditions on--        ``(1) land preserved and protected under the battlefield       acquisition grant program established under section       308103(b); or        ``(2) battlefield land that is--        ``(A) owned by a State, Tribe, local government, or       nonprofit organization; and        ``(B) referred to in the Battlefield Reports.''; and        (2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Eligible Sites.--The Secretary may make grants under       this section for Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil       War battlefield sites--        ``(1) eligible for assistance under the battlefield       acquisition grant program established under section       308103(b); or        ``(2) on battlefield land that is--        ``(A) owned by a State, Tribe, local government, or       nonprofit organization; and        ``(B) referred to in the Battlefield Reports.''.

Definitions.''.        (2) By adding at the end the following:  ``308106. Updates and improvements to Battlefield Reports.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 3448, as amended, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my colleague and friend from  New York, Congresswoman Stefanik's legislation, the American  Battlefield Protection Program Enhancement Act of 2023.   Our Nation's battlefields are hallowed sites that showcase the trials  and triumphs that shaped our great Nation. From the American Revolution  to the Civil War, battlefield sites now serve as outdoor classrooms  that ensure future generations can learn about the conflicts that  forged our great Nation.   Battlefields remind us of our storied, complex history. They also  provide a way to honor those who fought and whose lives were lost. As  we approach Veterans Day this Friday, I think it is important and  appropriate that we reflect on the best ways that we can protect our  Nation's military history for future generations.   Unfortunately, despite the rich history of these locations, many of  these hallowed grounds have been lost or destroyed throughout the past  centuries. In fact, the American Battlefield Trust estimates that 1  acre of hallowed ground is lost every hour on average. To address the  loss of sacred battlefield sites, Congress created the American  Battlefield Protection Program in 1996.   The program provides grants to protect sites related to the  Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and the Civil War. Since its  conception, the American Battlefield Protection Program has helped  protect more than 100 battlefields in 42 States and protect battlefield  lands at 110 battlefield sites in 19 States.   Unfortunately, not all battlefields are covered by this program. One  of those battlefields is Jenkins' Ferry State Park, in my home  district. Representative Stefanik's legislation would expand this  program so battlefields like Jenkins' Ferry can receive restoration and  interpretation assistance.   Jenkins' Ferry is one of three battlefields in south central Arkansas  that make up the Red River Campaign National Historic Landmark. In 1864  Confederate soldiers attacked the Union Army during the Battle of  Jenkins' Ferry. Union soldiers were able to retreat using a ferry site  that still exists within the park today. Jenkins' Ferry State Park also  features many interpretive sites and memorials to soldiers who lost  their lives during the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry.   This is an important economic driver for my community and also an  important recreation area. I am thankful this legislation will help  improve this State park for generations to come.   H.R. 3448 would also allow educational institutions, nonprofit  organizations, and Tribes to receive grants directly. The American  Battlefield Protection Program is a shining example of public-private  partnerships and expanding the eligible list of nonFederal partners is  a commonsense solution for these organizations and local communities.   Lastly, the bill directs regular updates of battlefield reports  conducted by the National Park Service and focuses resources on the  highest priority battlefield locations. As technology changes and  advances, these updates will be crucial in identifying new battlefield  areas that served as pivotal points of conflict or need additional  protections.   This bipartisan bill, which is cosponsored by 50 bipartisan Members,  will enhance conservation, promote recreation, spur economic growth,  and help protect our Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank  Representative Stefanik for her leadership, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), who is the lead sponsor  of this bill.     Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York for her excellent bipartisan work on this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of Veterans Day and in honor of the hallowed  history that we have, I urge adoption of this bill which will protect  the sites of sacrifice and struggle that allow us to be here today in  this Chamber, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 359) to establish Fort San Geronimo del Boqueron in Puerto  Rico as an affiliated area of the National Park System, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 359         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fort San Geronimo       Preservation Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Fort san geronimo del boqueron.--The term ``Fort San       Geronimo del Boqueron'' (also known as ``Fortin de San       Geronimo del Boqueron'') means the fort and grounds listed on       the National Register of Historic Places and located near Old       San Juan, Puerto Rico.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF AFFILIATED AREA.         (a) In General.--Fort San Geronimo del Boqueron in Puerto       Rico is established as an affiliated area of the National       Park System.  [[Page H5415]]         (b) Description of Affiliated Area.--The affiliated area       shall consist of the area generally depicted on the map       titled ``Fort San Geronimo Proposed Affiliated Area'',       numbered 910/176698, and dated July 2021.        (c) Administration.--The affiliated area shall be managed       in accordance with--        (1) this Act; and        (2) any law generally applicable to units of the National       Park System.        (d) Management Entity.--The Institute of Puerto Rican       Culture shall be the management entity for the affiliated       area.        (e) Cooperative Agreements.--The Secretary may provide       technical assistance and enter into cooperative agreements       with the management entity for the purpose of providing       financial assistance for the marketing, marking,       interpretation, and preservation of the affiliated area.        (f) Limited Role of the Secretary.--Nothing in this section       authorizes the Secretary to acquire property at the       affiliated area or to assume managerial or financial       responsibility for the operation, maintenance, or management       of the affiliated area.        (g) Management Plan.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the       management entity, shall develop a management plan for the       affiliated area.        (2) Transmittal.--Not later than 3 years after the date on       which funds are first made available to carry out this       section, the Secretary shall submit the management plan       developed under paragraph (1) to the Committee on Natural       Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee       on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate.        (h) Private Property Protection.--Nothing in this Act       affects the land use rights of private property owners       adjacent to Fort San Geronimo del Boqueron.        (i) No Buffer Zones.--        (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to       create buffer zones outside of Fort San Geronimo del       Boqueron.        (2) Activity or use outside fort san geronimo del       boqueron.--The fact that an activity or use can be seen,       heard, or detected from within Fort San Geronimo del Boqueron       shall not preclude, limit, control, regulate, or determine       the conduct or management of activities or uses outside of       Fort San Geronimo del Boqueron.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 359, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Resident Commissioner Gonzalez- Colon's bill, the Fort San Geronimo Preservation Act. This legislation  would establish Fort San Geronimo del Boqueron as an affiliated area of  the National Park System. I applaud Resident Commissioner Gonzalez- Colon's leadership on this effort.   Fort San Geronimo is a small, two-level, stone masonry fort located  at the easternmost point of the islet of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Part of  the massive fortification system built by Spanish military engineers  between the 16th and 19th centuries to protect San Juan from foreign  invasions, Fort San Geronimo became a centerpiece of the city's  defenses and played a crucial role in the 1797 Battle of San Juan. The  fort was rebuilt in 1799, largely to its original design, and continued  to be used as a Spanish military post in the 19th century. After Puerto  Rico became a U.S. territory in 1898, the U.S. Navy used Fort San  Geronimo as a military post until 1921. Today, Fort San Geronimo is  owned and managed by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, an agency  of the Puerto Rican Government.   Establishing Fort San Geronimo as a national affiliated area is a  cost-effective way to conserve this important historic and cultural  site without placing it under Federal ownership or management. Under  H.R. 359, the fort will continue to be managed by the Institute of  Puerto Rican Culture, although the National Park Service will be able  to provide assistance for the marketing, interpretation, and protection  of the site.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon), the lead  sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, as the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Mrs.  Gonzalez-Colon) stated, this is a commonsense bill that will improve  the conservation and protection of a key historical site. It does so  while avoiding unnecessary Federal involvement. I thank the gentlewoman  again for her leadership on this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2717) to authorize the National Medal of Honor Museum  Foundation to establish a commemorative work on the National Mall to  honor the extraordinary acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice  displayed by Medal of Honor recipients, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2717         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hershel `Woody' Williams       National Medal of Honor Monument Location Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Congress in 2021 unanimously passed, and the President       signed, Public Law 117-80 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note), which       authorized the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to       establish on Federal land in the District of Columbia a       commemorative work to honor the acts of valor, selfless       service, and sacrifice displayed by Medal of Honor       recipients.        (2) The Medal of Honor was established by President Abraham       Lincoln and first awarded 160 years ago on March 25, 1863,       and is part of Lincoln's lasting and living legacy.        (3) In 1991, during the administration of President George       H.W. Bush, this legacy was extended further when National       Medal of Honor Day was established as March 25th of each       year.        (4) The Medal of Honor is awarded to all branches of the       United States Armed Forces as our nation's highest       recognition for valor in combat.        (5) The number of living Medal of Honor recipients has been       steadily declining, making it even more crucial to honor and       recognize their heroic sacrifices and inspire future       generations.        (6) Hershel ``Woody'' Williams, the last World War II Medal       of Honor recipient, passed away in 2022 and laid in honor at       the United States Capitol.        (7) The Medal of Honor represents the very best of our       Nation--ordinary citizens, who took extraordinary action       above and beyond the call of duty and became heroes of our       Republic.        (8) These examples inspire all citizens and ignite within       us the very spirit of America.        (9) The Medal of Honor rises to the level of supreme       national and historical importance necessary to warrant       representation on the National Mall.        (10) Locating the National Medal of Honor Monument in close       proximity to the Lincoln Memorial within the Reserve would be       a respectful extension of his enduring legacy and recognition       of what ordinary people can accomplish when working for the       greater good.       SEC. 3. NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR MONUMENT LOCATION.         (a) Site.--Notwithstanding section 8908(c) of title 40,       United States Code, the commemorative work authorized by       section 1(a) of Public Law 117-80 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note) shall       be located within the Reserve (as defined in section 8902(a)       of title 40, United States Code).        (b) Applicability of Commemorative Works Act.--Except as       provided in subsection (a), chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act''), shall apply to the commemorative work.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2717, as amended, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this Saturday is Veterans Day. There is perhaps no  greater way to celebrate this day than passing H.R. 2717, which seeks  to honor the valor and sacrifice of some of our Nation's bravest  heroes, Medal of Honor recipients.   Mr. Speaker, 160 years ago, President Abraham Lincoln awarded the  first Medal of Honor in the midst of the Civil War. It is our Nation's  highest honor awarded to members of the Armed Forces and is bestowed  sparingly to only those who have demonstrated the highest acts of  valor. Less than 100 Medal of Honor recipients are alive today out of  the more than 3,500 medals that have been awarded.   As the highest and most prestigious military decoration in the United  States, it symbolizes exceptional acts of bravery, selflessness, and  sacrifice beyond the call of duty. Through the recognition of these  remarkable individuals, the Medal of Honor inspires a sense of national  pride, honors the memory of fallen heroes, and motivates future  generations to embody the values of courage and honor. Inspired by the  Victoria Cross, the Medal of Honor continues to instill a profound  sense of respect and gratitude for the sacrifices made in the defense  of freedom and justice.   Congressman Moore's bill, the Hershel ``Woody'' Williams National  Medal of Honor Monument Location Act, would ensure that the monument  honoring these brave heroes can be placed on what is known as the  Reserve but is commonly referred to as The National Mall here in  Washington, D.C.   A monument honoring our most exceptional citizens should be reflected  in the location of the memorial. Millions of Americans and visitors  from across the world travel every year to our Nation's Capital to  learn about the history of our great Nation. According to National Park  Service data, The National Mall receives upward of 25 million visitors  each year. The monuments and memorials located on The National Mall are  the centerpiece of this history, and it is appropriate to include a new  monument honoring veterans who have displayed the most courageous acts  of valor recognized by our country.   In my home State of Arkansas, our State capital also has a memorial  dedicated to Medal of Honor recipients on its grounds. I hope this  monument in D.C., like the one in Arkansas, can inspire reflection,  patriotism, and gratitude for our Nation's military heroes.   Earlier this year, the Committee on Natural Resources had the  privilege of hearing from 1 of the 65 living Medal of Honor recipients,  Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski. In  [[Page H5417]]  his inspiring testimony, he reminded us that the Medal of Honor serves  to represent those willing to go above and beyond in any circumstance,  no matter how small.   This monument will serve as an everlasting reminder of the greatness  of this country and the difference that one single person can make. The  legislation before us today, H.R. 2717, would authorize the location of  the national Medal of Honor memorial in a prominent location on The  National Mall, with the intent to keep it near the Lincoln Memorial, as  President Lincoln was the first to ever give out this special award.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to support the original legislation  authorizing this memorial, and I am proud to be supporting this  subsequent legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I note that this bill has been named after Hershel  ``Woody'' Williams, who sadly passed away last year. He was known for  his extraordinary heroism in the pivotal Battle of Iwo Jima during the  Second World War. At the young age of 21, he singlehandedly cleared a  path for American troops against Japanese forces in an act of  extraordinary bravery. This is a touching tribute in his honor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank  Congressman Moore for his leadership, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Moore), the lead sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Grijalva and all  the cosponsors of this bill and the great bipartisan work that has gone  into making this happen. What a fitting tribute to Mr. Williams to name  this bill after him.   I think back about a codel we made this past summer down to the  country of Palau. We went out to a small island called Peleliu where  one of the most bitter battles of World War II was fought. On that  small island, really in a very hard place to get to, there stands a  small monument to commemorate eight U.S. servicemembers who received  the Medal of Honor in one battle.   As we were there, I thought not many Americans are ever going to get  to see this small monument, and it made me realize how important it is  that we do this monument here in Washington, D.C., to recognize not  just Mr. Williams but all those who have served, to honor their memory,  to remember their legacy, and to stand unwavering in our commitment to  upholding the principles for which they fought so valiantly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1318) to authorize the location of a monument on the  National Mall to commemorate and honor the women's suffrage movement  and the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1318         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Suffrage National       Monument Location Act''.       SEC. 2. WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE NATIONAL MONUMENT.         (a) Site.--Notwithstanding section 8908(c) of title 40,       United States Code, the Women's Suffrage National Monument       shall be located within the Reserve.        (b) Applicability of Commemorative Works Act.--Except as       provided in subsection (a), chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act''), shall apply to the Women's Suffrage National       Monument.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Women's suffrage national monument.--The term ``Women's       Suffrage National Monument'' means the commemorative work       authorized to be established under Public Law 116-217 (40       U.S.C. 8903 note).        (2) Reserve.--The term ``Reserve'' has the meaning given       such term in section 8902(a)(3) of title 40, United States       Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1318, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 175th anniversary of the beginning  of the women's suffrage movement in 1848. For the first 144 years of  our Nation's history, women were not afforded the right to vote.   During the 19th century, the women's suffrage movement emerged with  the goal of securing this important constitutional right for women  across the Nation. It took years of hard work and dedication. Securing  this important  [[Page H5419]]  change took over 40 years to accomplish. Finally, in 1920, the 19th  amendment was formally ratified, and women were finally given the right  to vote in our Nation's elections.   Now, 175 years after this important movement began, we are coming to  the House floor to ensure that the monument honoring this movement is  placed in the most prominent location in our Nation's capital--on The  National Mall. I think it is significant to note that out of the 40  monuments and memorials on the Reserve, zero are dedicated to women's  history. The Women's Suffrage National Monument would be the first.   That is why I support H.R. 1318, the Women's Suffrage National  Monument Location Act. This is a worthy cause and will enhance the  interpretation of The National Mall, which is visited by millions of  Americans annually.   This monument, which was originally authorized by legislation signed  by President Trump in 2020, would not use any Federal funds. In fact,  the foundation supporting the monument even has plans to address the  multimillion dollar deferred maintenance backlog in Constitution  Gardens, the preferred location of the women's suffrage monument. This  is a true win-win and a great model for future commemorative works.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention my disappointment with the  Biden administration, which testified against this legislation earlier  this year. The administration argued that The National Mall is already  complete and there would be no space for this monument. I find this  hard to believe, considering that the preferred location for this  monument is currently occupied by food trucks.   This is a good, bipartisan and bicameral bill, and I thank  Representatives Lesko and Neguse for leading this effort. I support the  bill and reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I thank Representatives Lesko and Neguse and all the Members  in the House who have come together to support this bill.   I thank my colleague Ranking Member Grijalva for his support and for  working together on this and also the Senate for their bipartisan  support.   It has bipartisan support because it is a good bill that will provide  a place of prominence on our National Mall for the Women's Suffrage  Monument.   It will forever enshrine the dedication and sacrifice of countless  women who worked toward the goal of women's suffrage.   For those reasons, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
