 Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chair for his  leadership on this critically important issue.   The reckless and reprehensible Republican assault on healthcare is  un-American, unconscionable, and unacceptable.   This administration wants to take away healthcare protection from  tens of millions of Americans.   This administration wants to impose an age tax on people between 50  and 64, which will dramatically increase premiums, copays, and  deductibles.   This administration wants to take away protections for those with  preexisting conditions, adversely impacting more than 100 million  Americans.   Here is the Democratic response: Keep your hands off of the  healthcare of everyday Americans.   Our legislation will strengthen the Affordable Care Act, protect  people with preexisting conditions, lower healthcare costs, and drive  down the high costs of lifesaving prescription drugs because Democrats  believe that, in this great country, no American should ever have to  choose between putting food on the table, paying the rent, or getting  access to lifesaving medication. We believe that healthcare is a right;  it is not a privilege. We are not going backward; we are just going to  move forward.   This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Every  single American should have access to high-quality and affordable  healthcare, and we are taking a substantial step in that direction  today.   I thank the chair and the tremendous members of the relevant  committees for their great work.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
