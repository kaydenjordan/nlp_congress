 Mr. President, at the beginning of December, I said the  Senate had a lot of hard work to do in order to address several  critical priorities before the end of the year.   When the month began, America knew we had to avoid a government  shutdown; we had to approve our annual Defense bill; we had to preserve  the full faith and credit of the United States; take action on Build  Back Better before Christmas, as well as deal with voting rights.   It is now December 8, and the Senate is making very good progress on  all of these priorities. It was a big, big agenda, and we are clearly  not through with it, but we are making good progress. There is clearly  light at the end of the tunnel on the debt ceiling and the Defense bill  based on the agreement Leader McConnell and I came to and the House's  action last night. Let me go over those details.   Last night, the House of Representatives sent us two important pieces  of legislation. One of them is a compromise version of our annual  Defense bill, which I expect will earn bipartisan support in this  Chamber in the coming days.   I want to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Reed, Ranking  Member Inhofe, and all my colleagues, who worked to shape this  legislation to help us make sure we pass a bipartisan Defense bill this  year, as we have done for decades.   The second bill they sent us will enable the Chamber to swiftly  address the debt limit, sparing our country from the calamity--and a  calamity it would have been--of a first-ever default on our national  debt. This fast-tracked process was included in a bill that will also  provide critical protections for Medicare funding, preventing slashes  in that very important funding to so many seniors, and waive the pay-go  rule to avoid harmful cuts.   Last night, I took the first procedural step to advance this  legislation, setting up a cloture vote to take place as soon as  Thursday. Once our proposal is approved by the Senate, we will be able  to address the debt limit in this Chamber with a simple majority vote,  which is exactly what Democrats have been seeking for months and what I  have been asking for at this podium time after time, after time.   I want to thank the Republican leader for his help in working with us  to find a responsible path that avoids partisan brinksmanship.   Democrats have always said that the Senate should be able to raise  the debt limit without resorting to a convoluted, lengthy, and risky  reconciliation process, and under our plan, we won't have to do that.   Democrats have also said repeatedly that the responsible thing to do  is to raise the debt ceiling. Both Democrats and Republicans voted for  the spending increase. We have said repeatedly that  [[Page S9002]]  we are ready to shoulder this burden even if our Republican colleagues  are not going to be able to. It now looks like we will be able to do  that--to have 50 Democrats vote responsibly and do what is good for the  Nation, avoiding catastrophe by raising the debt ceiling to pay the  debts we have already incurred, just like any household must do.   This agreement we have secured is the responsible path forward. No  gamesmanship on the debt limit means no default on our sovereign debt  and the calamity--the calamity--that it would cause.   Again, I thank my Republican colleagues and Leader McConnell. We have  had fruitful, honest, and good discussions over the last several weeks  to come up with this proposal.   We are not over the finish line yet, but I want to thank all of my  colleagues for working in good faith to move forward on this  responsibility that must be addressed in the coming days. Soon, we will  be able to cross another major item off our December to-do list. And we  have more to roll up our sleeves and get working on. They are so  important.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Build Back Better: So, in the first few  days of December, we have successfully avoided a government shutdown.  We have cleared the path, hopefully, for addressing the debt limit;  and, as I mentioned, I am optimistic that the NDAA will soon be  settled.   None of these are easy accomplishments, but we are clearing the path  for Democrats to turn to our biggest domestic priority of the year:  passing President Biden's Build Back Better Act before Christmas.   Later today, four Senate committees will release the final texts of  their portions of Build Back Better, along with CBO scores for each, as  required by the reconciliation process. Those four committees are  Commerce, Small Business, Banking and Housing, and Veterans' Affairs.   In the meantime, I continue to hold daily conversations with my  Democratic colleagues, with the White House, with the Speaker, and  House colleagues. We continue to make good progress, and we are still  on track to vote on a final product before Christmas. The sooner we can  pass Build Back Better, the better off American families will be as we  start the new year.   This bill has always been about a simple goal: cutting costs for  working and middle-class families.   People are complaining about higher costs. They are right to do that.  This bill actually lowers costs in many different areas and will help  families who are trying to make ends meet and stretch those dollars.  Let me give you some examples.   Families are still struggling to pull themselves out of a once-in-a- century economic crisis brought about by COVID. They want to pay less  for things like healthcare, prescription drugs, childcare--some of the  biggest costs average middle-income and working families have. They  want us to find ways to make that happen, and that is exactly what  Build Back Better does.   America, if you want lower costs, tell your Senators to vote for  Build Back Better.   If we invest in American families, then we make it easier for them to  work, to be productive, to flourish in society, and that makes our  country stronger and lowers costs in the long term.   One of the great problems, we are told, is a shortage of workers. One  of the greatest reasons for the shortage of workers is the lack of good  childcare. People can't go to work if they have to look after their  kids. And in this post-COVID era, a lot of the patterns that used to  happen don't happen anymore.   Making childcare affordable will help bring people back to work, get  our economy humming along again, and deal with some of the bottlenecks  in certain areas, from certain industries, which is creating inflation.   Helping families afford childcare, of course, saves parents money,  but it goes a long way to alleviating our labor shortage. If parents  don't have to worry about how they will keep their kids safe during the  day, they will have greater flexibility to reenter the workforce and  increase the country's output. That lowers inflation.   In the long term, everyone wins--kids, parents, employers, and the  entire economy. This single investment alone is enough reason to keep  pushing Build Back Better, but there are so many.   One of the greatest costs we face is prescription drug costs. That is  what families complain about above all. This bill goes a long way to  making prescription drugs cost less.   Another great cost people are complaining about is the rising cost of  housing. This bill puts more money into housing--into both  rehabilitating housing that has deteriorated and putting them back into  the marketplace in a real way and into creating new housing. It will  reduce the dramatic increase in housing costs.   So you want to talk about inflation, you want to talk about people  having to pay more, this bill is an antidote in so many areas. I have  mentioned childcare, healthcare, and housing, just to name a few, but  there are many others as well.   So we are going to keep working in getting this bill done. It is so  important to working families and to America. To working families: less  expenses, easier to make that dollar stretch when we sit down Friday  night after dinner and say, ``How are we going to pay the bills this  week?'' To America: relieving bottlenecks and making sure that our  economy hums along at a rapid rate, where people are getting good  wages, but the bottlenecks caused often by COVID are reduced.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one more issue--the upcoming vaccine CRA.   On another matter, reports this morning indicate that getting  vaccinated and boosted offer significant protection against the Omicron  variant.   As we learn more about Omicron, it is an important moment for  national leaders to double- and triple-down on encouraging all eligible  Americans to get vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible.   But as soon as today, our Republican friends are going to come to the  floor to push an anti-science, anti-vaccine proposal to overturn the  President's vaccines requirements for businesses with more than 100  employees.   My friends, America, we are in the middle of a public health crisis.  Everyone sees the damage it causes to themselves, their friends, their  families, and their communities, and the way to solve this is to be  driven by science.   We have had hundreds of years of scientific advancement. It has  helped us live longer and live healthier. My dad just lived until 98.  That didn't happen in a vacuum, and it certainly wouldn't have happened  when there were scientific advances and people said, ``Let's not listen  to them,'' for political, ideological, or whatever reasons. We cannot  go back to the days when people were driven by wild theories.   Some of the anti-vaxxers here in this Chamber remind me of what  happened 400 years ago, when people were clinging to the fact that the  Sun revolved around the Earth--they just didn't believe science--or 300  years ago or 500 years ago, when they were sure the Earth was flat. It  is just like that.   The science is here. And what does the science show? The more people  who get vaccinated, the greater chance we have to eliminate and,  certainly, greatly reduce the virulence and ``widespreadness'' of this  disease.   People are resisting. Is it political? Is it fueled by lies on the  internet? Is it just because people fear vaccines? We never had this  outcry when we had to give our kids--my kids--mumps, measles vaccines  before they went to school. We never had this outcry as people lined up  to get flu shots.   All of a sudden, something has happened here. It is wrong, and it is  bad for the country, and it is not based on any scientific evidence  whatsoever.   I know that wild stories on the internet, lies, sometimes get in  people's heads, but we can't listen to people's lies. We are a fact- based society. We always have been.   The biggest thing standing between us and the end of the pandemic is  Americans who have refused to get vaccinated. Too many Americans  believe a wide range of conspiracy theories  [[Page S9003]]  about vaccines, and even those who seem to encourage those crazy  theories often get vaccinated themselves and don't tell anybody. We  have had so many of these hard-right leaders admitting: ``Oh, yes, I  did get vaccinated,'' even though they are telling people they  shouldn't have to take one. ``Oh, yes, I will get vaccinated, but you  shouldn't have to.''   If the only damage were to the person, him or herself, who didn't get  vaccinated, maybe some people would say that is OK. But it is not just  to them because, when there is a large pool of people unvaccinated,  even if it is not the majority, that allows the COVID virus to spread,  to mutate, to create new variants, and create new stronger variants. It  is a pool of people. If you greatly reduce that pool, you greatly  reduce the chance of a new variant, particularly a virulent one, from  afflicting us in the months ahead. It is crazy.   The internet has had a role in spreading this, and so has the far  right. The same people in the far right who want to tear down  government and hurt working people in so many other ways are here doing  the same thing--the same thing--even though, as I said, a good number  of them get vaccinated themselves--hypocrisy.   There should be one message, and one message only, coming from this  Chamber to the American people: Get vaccinated. Get boosted. Stay safe  yourself. Keep your families, your communities, and our country safe.   The worst thing we can do is tie our own hands behind our backs and  let these new variants spread and grow--new ones after Omicron and so  many others. But that is what Republican-pushed ``anti-vaccines'' would  do.   I will strongly vote against this amendment. I have strong feelings  about what is good for this country and about fighting anti-science and  theories that seem to, as I said, come from the same place that the  flat Earth theory came from, that the theory that the Sun revolves  around the Earth came from. Anti-science, nonscience, fictional belief  come from there. We ought not give it a stamp of approval in this  Chamber.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 1605.
