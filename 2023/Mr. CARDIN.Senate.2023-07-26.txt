 Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the importance of  Holocaust education and engagement that can help us push back against  the rising tide of anti-Semitism we are seeing nowadays, in our country  and across the world.   As the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism and  Intolerance for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for  Security and Cooperation in Europe, as many of my colleagues know, I  have made it a personal priority to address the rise of anti-Semitism.  As anti-Semitism is increasing at home and abroad, it is important to  come together to address anti-Semitism, and call out the hate when we  see or hear it before it becomes more ingrained in our society.   At the same time, we should celebrate those occasions when a person  with a history of making anti-Semitic statements sees the light and  realizes the error of his ways, renounces his past statements, and vows  never to repeat them. Happily, we have an example of just such a case  that I would like to bring to the attention of Senate and the American  people.   I would like to submit into the Congressional Record a noteworthy  letter from Salah el Deen Soltan, a U.S. person, who wrote last month  to his newest grandson, to be shared with other grandchildren, most of  whom he hasn't met after a decade in wrongful detention in Egypt.   As Human Rights Watch stated in a report published on May 3, 2023,  calling for Soltan to be released from his unjust imprisonment in one  of Cairo's most notorious jails:         Before moving to the United States, Soltan was a professor       of Islamic Law at Cairo University. He later founded and       served as the president of the Islamic American University in       Dearborn, Michigan from 1999 to 2004. As a legal US permanent       resident, Soltan lived and worked in the US for over a decade       before his arrest in Egypt in September 2013 for opposing the       military's ousting of elected president Mohamed Morsi. A       court sentenced Soltan to life in prison in September 2017 in       a mass trial marred by extensive due process and fair trial       violations. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary       Detention determined in 2018 that his arrest was arbitrary,       as the authorities failed to provide credible evidence of       wrongdoing, and that his prosecution violated the right to       political participation and freedoms of peaceful assembly and       expression.    In the coming weeks, Soltan will have served a full decade in  Egyptian jails. During this time, he had time to reflect on his  personal history of making crude and cruel anti-Semitic statements to  his students and followers over the years. So he wrote a letter, that  has been smuggled out of prison and delivered to his family.   In this letter, Soltan addresses his previously held anti-Semitic  positions and remarks, apologizes for them and disavows them. In  solitary confinement, Soltan reflects on his past, corrects the record  for his grandson, and lays out how would like to be remembered in case  he never gets the opportunity to meet his grandchildren.   As he writes:         My previous statements and stances are wrong and the best       of us are those who reflect, hold oneself accountable and       repent. Here I am, reflecting and seeking forgiveness from       God for the harm that may have been inflicted upon anyone. I       apologize to everyone harmed by what I said and called for. I       leave behind these prison walls all forms of anger, hate and       coarseness. I bear the burden of upholding the sanctity of       human life, speaking truth and defending it wherever it may       be. I had only intended to stand up for justice but what I       did resulted in the exact opposite of the intent; and became       a reason for further oppression, suffering and       marginalization of the innocent. In fact, my oppressors used       my decade-old stances to justify and fend off pressure from       concerned western parties about my release.    It is never too late for remorse and redemption.   In 2020, we saw several Muslim-majority Middle Eastern governments  normalize diplomatic relations with Israel with the historic  announcement of the Abraham Accords. And in the years since, there has  been a real thawing of the hostility toward the Jewish state in some of  the neighboring countries. Overcoming decades of official hostility  toward the government and people of Israel, broadcast through official  media outlets, and often imbued with blatant anti-Semitism, will take  time. But a journey begins with a single step. And the reconciliation  of the peoples of the region begins with one person.   Together, we can choose peace and forgiveness, rather than be  prisoners of past differences. In that spirit and consistent with the  Jewish tradition of Teshuva, in which people can see the error of their  ways and vow never to repeat that which has offended the Creator, I  welcome and embrace Salah Soltan's change of heart. Especially given  his difficult circumstances, I find it refreshing and notable that he  has taken the time and the trouble to send a heartfelt message to his  grandchildren. He has accepted responsibility for his previous hateful  words and is seeking forgiveness from those harmed by it.   This September, Soltan will have been imprisoned for a decade in  Egyptian prisons where human rights organizations have estimated there  to be over 60,000 political prisoners. Last May, more than 50 human  rights organizations released a joint statement noting that Soltan is  at serious risk of death due to deteriorating health conditions.   In recent weeks, Egypt has started to correct course with the release  of two high-profile detainees. I urge President Sisi to extend his  Presidential pardon to Soltan, so that he may leave Egypt and be  reunited with his family.   I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the letter written  by Salah el Deen Soltan to his grandchildren be printed in full at this  point in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         My Dearest Beloved Grandson, Salah Binyameen: Ever since I       learned of your birth and that you will bear my name, I have       been praying for you and constantly thinking about you. I       fervently pray to God Almighty that you become a positive       force in our community and the world at large. It is no       secret that you were born during one of the most challenging       periods of my imprisonment, yet news of your birth brought me       immense solace and joy. Your coming is a reminder of the time       that has passed, my fifth grandson, the fourth of whom I have       not met or spent time with because of my decade-long wrongful       imprisonment in solitary confinement. The passing years have       been arduous, and I feel as though time slips away from me       without anyone to share my happiness or alleviate my       solitude.        Dearest grandson, Salah, enduring a decade of imprisonment       and torture, I found solace only in God. The darkness of my       solitude has revealed many certainties and has granted me       clarity about my past with all of its good and bad,       particularly as I witness death so frequently around me. I       feel as if I stared death in the eyes while lying on the       ground, paralyzed and denied help and medicine for days.       During those helpless moments, all I could do was ponder:       Will I ever have the opportunity to see you? What will you       come to know of me? If you never meet me, who will be your       source of information about me? So, I've decided to write you       a series of letters, this being the first, so that you may       come to know me as I am. I want you to understand who I am,       what my values are, and what I stand for.        My dearest Salah, I have always believed, and will continue       to believe, that justice is the bedrock of faith. Freedom and       justice are the imperatives of our religious beliefs. I have       always prayed for divine guidance towards truth, and for       inspiration to stand up for the distressed and most       marginalized. In the depths of my suffering, I question       whether I have consistently lived up to those ideals. I am       grateful to God for the guidance on the things I got right       and for forgiveness on those that I got wrong. Allah Himself       swore by the sanctity of the questioning soul: ``And I swear       by the reproaching soul'' (Quran 75:2). None of us is immune,       not even from the gravest of errors, and repentance is a       virtue of a sound heart.        The first of these revisions occurred in the immediate       aftermath of the 2013 coup and  [[Page S3612]]       the gruesome Rabaa Massacre. I penned an Op-Ed to the       Egyptian people apologizing for the Islamist Political       movements' political mistakes. My decade in solitude that       followed compelled me to delve further inwards, to think and       rethink. When your father and I shared a prison cell, I       engaged in deep contemplations and introspections. Those were       both bitter and sweet days, I miss him so much. We engaged in       endless debates as I contemplated the meaning of justice,       injustice, and advocating for the most disenfranchised. I       pondered anger, violence, righteousness, the common good, and       reform. I held myself accountable, questioning whether I       adhered to my intellectual commitments for the benefit of all       or only for certain groups. I reflected on my intellectual       journey from Egypt to the United States, Bahrain, and beyond.       I have learned and grown and want to acknowledge my regrets       and mistakes, as acknowledging what is right and wrong is the       beginning of wisdom.        The Palestinian cause shaped my generation's worldview and       awakened my political consciousness and activism. It laid the       foundations for my understanding of justice, starting from my       elementary school days until I obtained my Ph.D. in Islamic       jurisprudence. For many years, I allowed my anger to inform       my reactions to the senseless bloodshed, and the desecration       of sacred sites and to drive my approach to the Palestinian       issue privately and publicly. I focused on the losses and       struggles of the Palestinian people and their powerlessness       and while then as now, many more Palestinians have been       injured and killed. My impassioned defense of the oppressed       in the Muslim world in those days relied on the common       rhetoric that was fueled by anger which turned to hate. As       the death toll mounted, my statements sometimes veered toward       antisemitism. In doing so, I displayed a blind rage that       contradicted the fundamental principles of our beautiful       religion. We are a religion of tolerance and compassion       toward all religions and such rhetoric has no place in our       community or our pursuit of justice. I deeply regret times       when I engaged in that kind of rhetoric that I shudder to       recall and condemn all rhetoric that is discriminatory,       hateful and violent. The ends can never justify the means and       noble objectives can only be attained through noble methods.       Let me be clear, my commitment to justice for the Palestinian       people remains steadfast, as is my belief that the many paths       towards justice and peace do not require demonization of the       other. Salah, justice and solidarity must extend to those       with whom we disagree. In fact, our true commitment to these       ideals is measured by how we apply them to those who differ       from us.        Look at me now, Salah; I find myself in a country with a       Muslim ruler, where the judge, warden, officer, and guards       who wrongfully imprison, torture and deny me basic medical       needs are all Muslim. While those who stand up for me (and       others) are individuals who share little in common with me,       except for our shared belief in justice and freedom. I recall       how Eric Lewis, a Jewish lawyer and now a dear friend of the       family, was the sole international lawyer permitted to visit       a political prisoner in Egyptian prisons. I remember how       Andrea Prasow, a Jewish human rights lawyer, assumed your       father's position as the Executive Director of a rights       organization advocating on behalf of Arab political       prisoners. Senators Patrick Leahy (liberal Christian), and       the late John McCain (Conservative Christian) also come to       mind. These individuals, spanning the political spectrum,       have dedicated their professional careers to advocating for       the oppressed despite their respective political and       ideological differences. All of these contradictions and       ironies have compelled me to see the error in some of my       previous beliefs, statements and positions.        My previous statements and stances are wrong and the best       of us are those who reflect, hold oneself accountable and       repent. Here I am, reflecting and seeking forgiveness from       God for the harm that may have been inflicted upon anyone. I       apologize to everyone harmed by what I said and called for. I       leave behind these prison walls all forms of anger, hate and       coarseness. I bear the burden of upholding the sanctity of       human life, speaking truth and defending it wherever it may       be.        I had only intended to stand up for justice, but what I did       resulted in the exact opposite of the intent; and became a       reason for further oppression, suffering and marginalization       of the innocent. In fact, my oppressors used my decade-old       stances to justify and fend off pressure from concerned       western parties about my release.        Lastly, my dearest grandson, I am writing to you in pursuit       of a world that leads with love and eschews hatred. Life is       far too short and precious to allow it to be dominated by       anger. I urge you to set your moral compass towards justice       and truth. Defend those with every peaceful means at your       disposal. I hope you grow up to build a world where       tolerance, peace and coexistence despite differences is the       norm. My beloved, I pray that you grow up knowing and being       proud of your grandfather and everything he stood for. I love       you, and I long for the opportunity to meet you, whether it       is in this life or in the corridors of Paradise in the one       after. Oh God, please make me better than they think, and       forgive me for what they do not know.            Your loving grandfather,                                              Salah el Deen Soltan,                                                         16/6/2023,      27/11/1444.                            ____________________
