 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support life.   Mr. Speaker, 46 years ago when I was a senior in high school, it was  decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, or the U.S. Supreme Court felt, that  the United States Constitution required abortion be legal in this  country, despite the fact that, for much of the past century, every  State in the Union felt that abortion should be made illegal. This  decision directly led to the deaths of over 40 million children who  should have been living a full life.   John Adams said that our Constitution was meant for moral and  religious people. How can a country built for a moral, religious people  living under our Constitution allow this to happen?   We know how it happened. About 10 years ago, Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg let the cat out of the bag. This decision was meant to prevent  the growth in populations we don't want to have too many of, the  progressives' dream.   But how did the progressives get their dream? Some politicians  sometimes talk about science and say we don't take into account science  enough around here.   It is interesting that, in 1973 when this decision was reached, we  didn't have ultrasounds. Now, with ultrasounds, it is more apparent  than ever that every new baby in that womb is a unique individual, with  its heart beating, with its feeling pain. Nevertheless, we continue to  ignore that science and continue to allow this horrible stain on our  culture.   Indeed, right now, the United States is one of only seven countries  to allow late-term abortions. There we are, in the same list as North  Korea, China, and Vietnam. I guess you can kind of look back and see  why, in the sixties, the progressives would talk about Ho, Ho, Ho Chi  Minh and why they wanted the Communists to win in Vietnam. This is  probably one of the reasons, the type of country that they like.   Our forefathers wanted this country to be a country that would shed a  light on the world. Nevertheless, we appear to be going backwards. The  new majority recently brought a bill to the floor to allow the United  States to pay for abortions abroad again.   Is this what we want America to be known for: the United States  telling  [[Page H614]]  countries all around the world that abortion should be legal and the  government should be paying for abortion? What a stain on the moral  record of the United States of America.   This is the week of the March for Life. I would like to thank all the  people from the State of Wisconsin who are there and come here  diligently every year, hoping the people in this city, both the  justices and the politicians, realize that this murder of almost a  million people a year must end.   I would like to thank them and hope that this is the last year that  we have to continue this debate and that, finally, by this year, this  time, we one more time think that life is precious and our government  will not continue to allow the premature snuffing out of life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I know we have had a lot of people  talking today on the issue of the shutdown. I thought I would like to  give a little different talk, or a little bit of explanation, as far as  what is going on here, to the American people.   The first thing that offends me is when people imply that the  position of the President is that he is anti-immigrant. Every year, in  this country, we swear in 700,000 new people to become citizens of this  country--700,000. On a per capita basis, that is, for example, twice  what Germany swears in and over 50 times the number of people who  become new Mexicans each year.   We should not apologize for swearing in 700,000 new people, and  President Trump has made no effort to reduce that amount. He is just  saying people who want to come here illegally should get in line and be  one of those 700,000.   I also want to point out, in addition to that, we let in another  million people every year, primarily because they are relatives of  other people who are already here. We let in over 180 million people  for other reasons, including about 70 million people, every year, who  want to work here.   There is no reason why anybody should, under any circumstances, as  President Trump let's these things go on, say that he is anti- immigrant, or anybody who wants to build a wall is anti-immigrant,  because that will not affect these very generous numbers.   Now, let's look where America is compared to historically. We, right  now, have a higher percentage of people born in other countries in  America than any time since World War I, and those are people who we  can confirm. It is very difficult to get accurate numbers on the people  who are here illegally, for obvious reasons.   We have had an increase in the number of people who speak a foreign  language at home, and that is wonderful. I am sure all of our  ancestors, or most of our ancestors, at one point spoke a foreign  language. But it is nice if, over time, we accept enough immigrants  that, at any given time, most of us are speaking a common language.   The number of people who spoke a foreign language at home in 1980 was  about 11 percent. It is now 21 percent.   Again, these numbers have not caused Donald Trump to ask for a cut in  legal immigration. The American people should realize Donald Trump and  the people who want a wall are pro-immigration.   But the next question is: Do we have a crisis?   First of all, about 80 percent of the heroin in this country comes  across our southern border. Now, some of it can be prevented by a wall,  some can't. But the huge number of people who are dying around the  country, to me, makes this a crisis.   We are getting more and more children at the border. Why are we  getting more children? Because, I think, the word is out, particularly  in Central America, that if you come to America with children, you are  going to be able to find a way to get in. We need a border wall, not  only to prevent people from coming in, but to send the message that  America is treating its immigration laws seriously.   People who sneak across the border, who are, after all, breaking one  law, while very few are horrible criminals, of course, are going to  bring a given number of people who break the law. We believe, in the  last 10 years, illegal immigrants coming across the border have, during  their lifetime, been charged with over 1,000 homicides. We have enough  high crime areas in America as it is without letting people come  through here without being appropriately vetted.  [[Page H672]]                                     time  1930    There is a huge healthcare cost to allowing our borders to be open  because, of course, people come here without health insurance. Now we  have the Governor of California openly saying that he wants to give  free healthcare to all illegal immigrants.   People disagree on the cost of illegal immigration to our country,  but when you add up the healthcare and the welfare and the cost to the  criminal justice system, organizations easily come up with costs of  over $50 billion a year.   Donald Trump is asking for under $6 billion for the wall, and that is  one-time funding to build the wall. The cost of illegal immigrants is  over $50 billion year after year after year. This is a country that  already is over $22 trillion in debt. Can we really afford to be the  healthcare provider for the entire Western Hemisphere?   There are people who feel that Donald Trump has to compromise more,  that he is being hard here. Donald Trump is not a perfect person. I  have talked to him about some of his tweets, but Donald Trump has been  very patient here.   I don't think the American public knows or understands exactly why we  have a shutdown. If we are going to fund a border wall, it is going to  have to be part of an appropriation bill, which I think people back  home would refer to as a budget bill. We don't refer to it as a budget  bill, but I think people back home would say it is part of a budget  bill.   President Trump has been President now for 2 years. He has signed  many appropriation bills, and, obviously, he wants a wall. But because  he does not want to shut down the government, for 2 years, he has been  signing appropriation bills without funding for the wall.   Finally, in his third year, he has had to say: I am tired of signing  appropriation bills which include much spending that he doesn't want,  all sorts of provisions that are higher spending than President Trump  wanted, but, finally, he had to say: I am tired of signing  appropriation bills without getting my wall.   I think that is a reasonable position.   When we talk about the wall and the inability--I want to say we have  good news here. About an hour ago, I noticed that eight Democrats left  the door open. They were bipartisan toward building a wall, and I would  like to thank those eight people for reaching across the aisle. But I  have to wonder why we can only get eight Democrats to appear to say  that it is okay to fund the wall.   We have to remember that there is a very effective wall in the San  Diego area that was built when President Clinton was President. It is  well known that when President Bush was President, the second Bush, we  built still more of the wall, and at that time prominent Democrats like  Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer voted for the wall. Why  is the wall now immoral?   And, by the way, some of that wall funded during George Bush was  built during President Obama's term.   Why was it okay for Bill Clinton or George Bush or Barack Obama to  build a wall, and all of a sudden we hear it is immoral for President  Trump to want to add to that wall?   I am not sure. I think part of it is a sad and unfortunate move to  the left by not all, but by many Democrats who more and more are,  whatever they say, for open borders. I think some of it is just pure  party politics. They want to go ahead and let more people in here for 2  years just to embarrass President Trump.   But again, the American people should remember that for 2 years  Donald Trump signed appropriation bill after appropriation bill. He  wanted the wall. He didn't get the wall.   Finally, he is saying: I am sorry. I desperately want to open the  government, but I am going to ask members of the Democratic Party to do  what they did under President Clinton or President Bush or President  Obama and let me build more of the wall as well.   Now, some people will claim that this is an expensive wall, and I  agree that $5.7 billion is a large amount of money. But then we have to  look at it in comparison to other things that this body funds without  objecting.   The amount of money we are spending on this wall is about one-seventh  of what we spend every year in foreign aid. A few people complain about  that, but the vast majority of people in this body have no problem with  voting for over $35 billion a year in foreign aid.   All of a sudden, we are told that when it comes to building the wall  for one-seventh of that amount, one time, and they spend this amount on  foreign aid year after year after year, all of a sudden we are told  this is too much money.   And something I thought was a little excessive, there was a large  increase in the defense budget last year, a little larger than I would  have liked. The wall would cost about one-twelfth of the increase in  defense spending since President Trump became President.   It is about one-ninth of the increase--not the total, one-ninth of  the increase--in nondefense discretionary spending, and it is less than  one seven-hundredths of our overall budget. Is that really too much to  spend that amount of money when we are spending so much money in other  places?   The next thing I would like to address is this idea that the wall  won't work.   Under President Clinton, we built a wall between San Diego and  Tijuana, and the border crossings at that time dropped 92 percent. It  would be a great victory if we got the number of people coming here  illegally every year to drop 92 percent. I would not say that is  nothing.   I look at the border wall that Israel built when they were having a  huge problem of people coming up into Africa and breaking the law by  coming into Israel. Israel was getting about 1,800 new people a year  coming into their country that they didn't think should be coming into  their country. How many people came into their country in the last  year? None. That border wall caused the number of people coming into  Israel to drop from 1,800 a year to nothing.   There are other walls around the world. There is a wall between  Jordan and Syria and Iraq that has been somewhat successful in keeping  ISIS out of Jordan. The interesting thing about that wall, it was, to a  certain extent, paid for by the U.S. taxpayer. It baffles me that  people around here have no problem paying for a wall for Jordan to  protect itself, but all of a sudden if Donald Trump wants to build a  wall for the United States of America, we can't get it done.   Seventy countries around the world have walls. Ten countries in the  EU states have walls. These countries are not building walls because  they don't work. They build walls because they do.   The next thing I will address, frequently people get up here and they  preface their talk by saying everybody wants security. That is not  true. There are, sadly, a lot of people around here who are for open  borders. We just heard a speaker prior to me imply that building a wall  was racist, which certainly implies that preventing people from coming  into this country is racist, and they do not want to have this sort of  security.   Keith Ellison, the new attorney general for Minnesota who used to be  part of this body, recently said: I don't believe in borders.   And this kind of thinking that maybe we don't need borders, maybe we  just need one big country around the whole world, is more well known  than one would think.   There are sanctuary States, counties, and cities all around the  United States. If people believe in border security, why, if you were a  mayor, why if you were a county executive, why, if you were a Governor,  would you say: We want a sanctuary State or sanctuary city where we  can't ask people whether they are here legally or not?   And that would include people in charge of doling out welfare  benefits. It would include law enforcement. Obviously, people who run  these cities and States do not think border security is an important  thing, which is kind of scary.   In the last session, we took up bills trying to sanction cities and  counties that are sanctuary cities or sanctuary counties so they don't  open themselves up and, in essence, beg people from other countries to  come here.   By the way, this includes the three largest cities of the United  States: New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.   When Republicans tried to prevent this, I believe there were only  three or  [[Page H673]]  four Democrats--and I love my Democrats, but there were only three or  four of them who would stand up against sanctuary cities. That sure  sounds to me like they don't consider border security that important.   We have a new wave of people coming in saying that we don't need ICE.  We don't need immigration enforcement. They are on record with this.  Several people have signed on.   Maybe I am wrong, but to me, if you are saying we want to get rid of  the agency that enforces immigration, I think we can say there are a  lot of people in this body who really don't want any immigration  enforcement.   In summary, I would ask the American people to look beyond some of  the main talking points in the mainstream media. We are letting 700,000  people here legally. We are not anti-immigrant. And that is before you  talk about the tens of millions of people who are let in this country  every year to work.   This is a crisis. It is a crisis with regard to cost.   It is a crisis with regard to the change in our fabric as we let  people in here who commit crimes up to and including murder.   It is a crisis insofar as we let people in here who wind up, some of  them, adopting a welfare lifestyle, which will further erode the morals  of America.   Donald Trump has been very patient, waiting 2 years and signing bills  with much more spending than he wants because he didn't want to shut  down the government. I would now like to ask, in this third year, more  than just the eight brave Democrats to stand up. If you want to, you  can close your eyes and pretend that Bill Clinton or George Bush or  Barack Obama was President, because we know then you wouldn't have a  problem voting for it and open our government.   I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for the Federal employees who  thought their jobs were secure and that every month they would be  getting a constant paycheck. But because of playing hardball, treating  Donald Trump differently than you would treat President Clinton or  President Bush, we have a problem; and that is we do not have an  appropriation bill that is an appropriate compromise like funding the  wall would.   And let me point out, even President Trump's request of $5.7 billion  is a huge compromise. Several months ago, we were told we needed $20  billion or $25 billion to fund the wall. Now we are dropping to $5.7  billion. That is a huge compromise.   Please give Americans the protection that Israel or dozens of other  countries around the world have. Please allow us to build the wall.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 42 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 17, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
