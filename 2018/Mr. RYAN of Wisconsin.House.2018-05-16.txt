 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to welcome all the  law enforcement officers and their families who have come here to  Washington in honor of National Police Week. You know, there is a  saying in the law enforcement community: ``In this family, nobody  fights alone.''   When an officer goes down, the whole force feels the loss and carries  that burden. It is so moving to see that spirit of solidarity right  here in Washington on display this week. This year, the names of 360  fallen officers have been added to our National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial, including four from the State of Wisconsin.   One of them is Detective Jason Weiland of the Everest Metropolitan  Police Department. He was shot and killed in the line of duty last  March. His daughter Anna, 10 years old, spoke at his memorial service.  She said: ``All of the amazing people in the world will always  outnumber the criminals.''   Those words resonated so much that Anna's teacher helped her start a  group called Be Amazing. They honor her dad's memory by doing community  service projects. Now, how inspiring is that?   Another Wisconsin story I want to share is that of Officer Brian  Murphy of the Ashwaubenon Police Department. Last July, Officer Murphy  was hit by a drunk driver on Interstate 41. He sustained a number of  life-threatening injuries. Yet, just weeks later, he left the hospital  able to stand on his own, surrounded by his family and fellow officers.  It probably comes as no surprise to you to hear that he is back on the  job. This week, Officer Murphy said that the decision to return to work  was not difficult at all. It is about a ``good sense of purpose,'' he  said.   We have seen this resilience and this devotion of duty right here in  the United States Capitol. I don't think I will ever tire of seeing  Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner back at their posts.   As Speaker, I have had the chance to work very closely with the  dedicated professionals at the U.S. Capitol Police. It has been an  incredible honor--it truly has.   Mr. Speaker, I know this is a very challenging time for law  enforcement. If there is one thing that we have come to recognize, it  is that we must not take any of this for granted--whether it is the  dangers of the men and women who wear the uniform and wear the badge  face, or the sacrifices that their families make, all the long nights,  all the holidays that they do not get to spend together. We must not  take any of it for granted. It is where our safety comes from each and  every single day.   We should consider it a privilege to serve those who serve and  protect us. To all the cops on the beat and to all your loved ones: You  do not fight alone. We are with you. We are behind you always, every  day. Thank you, and God bless you.                            ____________________
