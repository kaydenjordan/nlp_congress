 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Rodgers  for yielding. I rise today in support of the Restoring Hope for Mental  Health and Well-Being Act of 2022.   The pandemic and shutdowns left many Americans, especially women and  children, feeling isolated, anxious, and alone. Depression, self-harm,  substance abuse, and suicide have reached crisis levels.   I am glad we can help provide meaningful, targeted hope and healing  to communities who need it. I am proud that two bills that I worked on,  the Into the Light for Maternal Mental Health Act and the Garrett Lee  Smith Memorial Act, were included in this package to prevent student  suicide and support women facing mental health and substance abuse  disorders during pregnancy.   We must keep working to turn despair into hope.   As a mom of four and a new grandma, I will always fight for the  health and well-being of communities in southern California and across  our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this commonsense,  bipartisan H.R. 7666.
