 Mr. Speaker, U.N. Resolution 2334 was an anti-Israel  resolution that sought to erase the history of the Jewish people and  their connection to their historic homeland.   Under U.N. Resolution 2334, the Western Wall, which is the holiest  site in Judaism and the last remnant of the Second Temple, is  considered occupied territory. You can't even make this up. I think it  is important to point out that the territory at issue, which we are  talking about, including the West Bank, which is historic Judea and  Samaria--some of the oldest Jewish lands dating back thousands of  years--is disputed. It is not occupied territory.   When you use that term for things like the Western Wall, you show  that all you are trying to do is to harm and attack the State of Israel  but not do this in an intellectually honest way. If you look at the  Balfour Declaration, that entire mandate was originally for a Jewish  state, including what is now Jordan.   As we got into the 1920s, Britain thought that giving what was called  Transjordan--what is considered to be the eastern part of Palestine-- would be a reward for the help of some of the Arabs during the First  World War. That had been under Turkish control for hundreds of years  before World War I. It was then under British control. You have this  British mandate, and they eventually give Jordan everything east of the  river; but then Jewish Palestine--this is a Jewish state, which is all  of Israel proper: Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, you name it--was what  Britain wanted to do. The League of Nations in 1922, which is the last  legally binding document, recognized that as well.   Fast-forward past World War II and we get into the late forties. The  Arabs always rejected having a state shared with Israel in that  respect. Then we get to 1948 and the U.N. Partition Plan. How much  measly less territory for Israel? It is really an indefensible country.  There is a massive Arab state there; yet Israel accepted even these  little crumbs of territory. What did the Arabs do? They rejected having  a state. You had invasions against Israel from all sides, and the goal  was the annihilation of the Jewish state in 1948.   Between '48 and '67--we always heard about these 1967 lines. Those  are not political lines. Those are armistice lines. Israel won the war  for their independence. They beat back the Arab armies. You had Egypt  controlling the Gaza Strip and you had Jordan controlling Judea and  Samaria, what we know as the West Bank.                                time  1100    So those were armistice lines, never internationally recognized.  Jordan's occupation of the West Bank was not recognized  internationally.   When Arafat founded the PLO, it was in 1964, '65, when you still had  these armistice lines. So the Palestine Liberation Organization, what  are they trying to liberate Palestine from? He is not talking about the  West Bank. He is talking about Israel proper. He wanted to push the  Jews to the sea.   So why would we be rewarding? Palestinian Arabs rejected a state in  '48. They rejected a generous offer in 2000, 2007. Every time, they  have chosen to go to war with Israel, and they are more opposed to a  Jewish state than they are interested in their own state.   We do have an example, though. What happens? You talk about Israel  occupation. They don't occupy the Gaza Strip. What is the Gaza Strip?  Is this like a nice la-la land on the Mediterranean? No. It is a terror  state controlled by Hamas, and they launch incessant rocket attacks  against Israel.   So a Palestinian state in this area, Judea-Samaria--West Bank--would  be what they call judenrein. It would be free of Jews. They would  ethnically cleanse every Jew who was in anything considered earmarked  for Palestinian Arabs. It is an interesting contrast, because in  Israel, Arab Israelis live and prosper, and they are treated as equal  citizens.   So we have to get this straight. What the U.N. did was totally  unacceptable. This body needs to remove funding for the U.N. until they  repeal that offending resolution, and the new administration needs to  move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in a show of solidarity  with our friends in Israel.                            ____________________
