 Madam Speaker, the House is honored today to welcome  a great theologian and humanitarian, my friend and constituent, the  distinguished William J. Barber, II.   I have known Bishop Barber since he was a college student. A native  of Roper, North Carolina, Bishop Barber has dedicated his life to  preaching God's word of salvation and embracing the least of these in  civil society.   Bishop Barber's trajectory to national prominence began when he  organized a multiracial, multigenerational social justice movement in  Raleigh, North Carolina, to expose the racial and economic inequities  facing our Nation.   The Moral Monday protests catapulted Bishop Barber to a place where  he is now a nationally recognized voice for the poor. As the founder of  Repairers of the Breach, Bishop Barber leads a movement that challenges  systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, and what he  calls the distorted narrative of religious nationalism. Bishop Barber  seeks to build an agenda rooted in love, justice, and morality.    Bishop Barber is the senior pastor of the Greenleaf Christian Church  in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He and his wife, Rebecca, have five very  accomplished children who have distinguished themselves in their  respective fields.   We are honored today, Madam Speaker, to have Bishop Barber with us  today to pray over this sacred institution that we call the House of  Representatives.                            ____________________
