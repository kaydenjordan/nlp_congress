 Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of Mrs.  Walorski for the Walorski-Sewell amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this  amendment.   It has been over 4 months since the Department of Commerce submitted  its auto 232 report to the White House, and neither Congress nor the  public has seen that report.   Congress gave the executive section 232 authority to combat  legitimate national security threats, not to keep secrets from Congress  and the American people.   Unfortunately, I think I know why this administration has not  submitted this report. It is because the products hardworking Americans  in the auto sector design, build, sell, and service are not a threat to  our national security.   The autoworkers in my district in Alabama are terrified that, any  day, President Trump will announce tariffs,  [[Page H4892]]  threatening up to 624,000 jobs in the auto sector.   That is why over 160 Democratic and Republican Members of the House  of Representatives have joined Congresswoman Walorski and me in signing  a letter to the administration, urging them to abandon their auto 232  tariff threat.   Auto tariffs remain a threat, and the public deserves to see the  report.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make  sure that we are calling upon this administration to be transparent,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
