 Mr. Speaker, more than 900,000 people in  the United States have lost their lives due to COVID. Of those more  than 900,000, 660,000 people over age 65 have been lost because of  COVID. This is the same population that was not only worried and  concerned about COVID, but they are the ones on a fixed income. They  are the ones that rely on Social Security.  [[Page H1218]]    More than 5 million of our fellow Americans get a below-poverty-level  check from Social Security after having paid in all their lives to the  number one insurance program in the country, the number one anti- poverty program for the elderly, and the number one anti-poverty  program for children. Help is on the way.   Social Security 2100, a sacred trust, as the President called it, is  a bill that will uplift and raise people out of the depths of poverty  and provide them with the sustenance they need in their daily lives, as  Roosevelt intended.                            ____________________
