 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I want to thank my friend from New York for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I am not going to have the opportunity very often, so I  want to make sure I do it while the gentleman and I are together today  to tell him I agree with absolutely everything Mr. Morelle had to say.  It doesn't happen very often on the Rules Committee.   If you are ever having a good day and you need to bring some discord  into your life, I want you to head upstairs to the third floor, where  there is a 9-to-4 majority-minority distribution, and you can find  discord up there every day of the week. It doesn't matter whether it is  Republicans leading the institution or Democrats leading the  institution.    Last night, we had a chance to come together and talk about something  that unites us all; but I oppose the rule today, Mr. Speaker, because  this is a bill that passed the Congress last year, and when we passed  it last year, we passed it unanimously through the Veterans' Affairs  Committee. All the Republicans and all the Democrats voted ``yes.''  Then we brought it to the House floor, and we passed it unanimously  here on a voice vote.   But the difference between the bill we have before us today and the  bill we had before us last year is that, when we made new promises to  our veterans for much-needed benefits last year, we went and we found  ways to pay for those promises--not controversial ways, not divisive  ways, but ways that we agreed to unanimously at the committee and the  full House level. When the bill reappeared this year, those pay-fors  were miraculously absent.   I am concerned about that for two reasons, Mr. Speaker, and I think  this body should reject this rule and give us a chance to improve this  bill. We tried to improve it with an amendment last night, and the  amendment was nongermane.   For folks who are new to the institution, understand that, if the  committee that sends the bill to the House floor decides they are not  going to pay for it, then any effort to try to pay for it is  nongermane. So, once a committee sends a bill that is flawed to the  Rules Committee, unless there is a waiver of the House rules to allow a  pay-for amendment, pay-for amendments are not in order.                                time  1230    So what happens is we are making a new commitment of about $120  million to our veterans, a wonderful commitment.   Again, I agree with absolutely everything the gentleman from New York  had to say. His heart for veterans is pure, and his words were true.   But that $120 million commitment we are making, Mr. Speaker, gets  folded into the Veterans' Affairs budget that we don't increase by one  penny, which means we now have to go cut $120 million worth of other  veterans' benefits in order to pay for this veterans' benefit.   That is not what anybody on this floor wants to do. In the Budget  Committee today, we were talking about the caps, talking about how to  deal with caps. Nobody wants to dip into the already promised benefits  that we have made to American veterans.   But the mystery to me is that, in this Chamber that America perceives  as being so divided, in this town that America perceives as being so  broken, we came together last year, unanimously, to do it the right  way; and with new House leadership this year, Mr. Speaker, we have  instead chosen to do it the easy way.   I think our veterans deserve better, but, more importantly, I know  the Members of this institution can do better. We have, and we can  again.   I hope my friends will reject this rule and give us a chance to go  back, pay for this, make sure there are not unintended consequences of  cutting other veterans' benefits that every man and woman in this  Chamber supports.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is not like me to correct the Chair because he serves the entire  House, but, I will tell you, it is entirely possible that Mr. Morelle  and I could yield each other time back and forth today. That is the  nature of this institution's support for veterans.   And, I have to tell you, that is what hurts me the most about the way  this bill has come to the floor. My friend is exactly right, Mr.  Speaker, when he says that the CBO says this: There is no direct  spending in this bill at all.   I just want you to think through that with me. We are promising  veterans new benefits that cost money, and the scorekeeping institution  of the United States House of Representatives says this bill will cost  nothing.   Now, why is that true? It is true because there are other laws on the  books, the budget caps that are on the books that say: If you add one  penny of veterans funding in this category, you have got to cut a penny  from this category.   When we did this bill last year, we all recognized that. I am not  telling anybody anything they don't already know, and it pains me to  see the defense of this bill as ``we didn't have to,'' ``they didn't  make us,'' ``it is not required.'' All of those arguments were true  last year, too. They didn't make us. We don't have to. It is not  required.   It is just the right thing to do. And we came together, and we did  it.   You have a different vantage point of this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, than  I do. From your chair, it may look like that bipartisanship breaks out  across this Chamber in mass quantities every day of the week, but, from  my position behind this podium, we don't find that many things that  both spend money and save money, those things that make new promises  while revising old promises that weren't working as well, those things  that make promises today but pay for them today instead of passing the  bill on to our children and grandchildren.    And we did that together last year. We did it together. How can folks  forget? Yes, we have lots of new freshmen in this Chamber, but we came  together last year, unanimously, to do this bill right, to tell  veterans: We do want to serve you better; we are going to create a new  benefit; and we are not going to force cuts to other benefits as a  result.   I am not going to give up on bipartisanship breaking out in this  Chamber again and again and again, and I am certainly not going to give  up on the bipartisan commitment that we have to serving our veterans.  There are only so many days in a year. There are only so many weeks in  a Congress. We cannot waste them doing a halfway job when we could have  done the job right.   In this case, it is not as if we don't have a roadmap of how to do  the job right. We did it. It is not as if we thought about doing it; we  voted unanimously together to do it.   Yet, in this new day, we have chosen a different path, an inferior  path. I just challenge my colleagues, as Paul Ryan used to say: Raise  your gaze. This is a good idea. This is a good programmatic policy. But  we need to pay for it, not cut veterans' benefits in order to squeeze  it in.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would welcome my friend to close, but, in  the spirit of bipartisanship, I will be happy to begin that process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is a different job in the minority. The power that Mr. Morelle has  to open this debate and close this debate, it lends credence to his  words. As I stipulated at the beginning, everything he said was true.  It is what he didn't say that we can do better on.   I will say this one more time because, again, for new Members of this  Chamber, you may not understand how the Rules Committee works. If a  committee does not pay for legislation, if a committee just makes  promises and does not find a way to pay for it, it is not appropriate,  under House rules, to then try to add a pay-for. It requires a waiver  from the Rules Committee of House rules in order to include a pay-for  in a bill that is not already paid for. We offered that amendment last  night. It was rejected on a party-line vote in the Rules Committee. Mr.  Speaker, if we defeat the previous question today, we will offer a  solution.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, the amendment that we will offer if the  previous question is defeated would add the language that, by  collecting fees on housing loans that would pay for this new childcare  benefit so that we don't have to go deep into the Veterans' Affairs  budget, cutting other benefits in order to pay for this, so we don't  have to violate budget caps and borrow from our children and from our  grandchildren, so that we can make promises to men and women who  deserve and need this benefit and know that we have come together and  done the heavy lifting to pay for it today.   I hope my friends will unite, as we did last year, in approving this  funding language, unite in defeating the previous question, so that I  can bring this amendment up and we can do this in the same honorable,  bipartisan, collaborative way that we unanimously passed this very same  language just a few short months ago.   I urge my friends: Know that we can do better.   Mr. Speaker, while I contemplated yielding back, I am going to  reserve my time just in case there are any more speakers who have been  affected by my words and want to come and join this effort that we have  today. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is troubling to me that we have those things that  divide us, that permeate these conversations that could be uniting.  Again, I don't think we have that many opportunities where we are able  to come together as an entire institution unanimously to support  legislation, so I deeply regret we have missed that opportunity.   I want to encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle not to  fall under the same trap that I think Republicans fell into just 8  short years ago. Every single conversation we have now in the Rules  Committee, the tax cuts come into it.   The fact that so many of my Democratic friends didn't want tax cuts  for the American people isn't a mystery to me. I got not one Democratic  vote on the entire bill. I get it. One team thought it was a good idea,  one team didn't, but we cannot use that disagreement as an excuse not  to do the very best that we can on each and every bill going forward.   I will give you that example from the Republicans experience. I was  categorically opposed to the Federal takeover of healthcare that was  the Affordable Care Act. I was categorically opposed to the way that  small businesses lost options. And my friends that were promised they  could keep their doctor and they could keep their plan, those promises  were broken.   But I still came together with my Democratic friends on the floor to  find additional dollars for veterans healthcare and plus-up those  accounts, to find additional ways to serve veterans who had not been  served through healthcare and plus-up those accounts. The fact that we  disagree on really big important issues does not mean we cannot come  together and do the very best that we can.   And with that in mind, I want to give credit where credit is due. I  have talked a lot about how we unanimously passed this bill last  Congress. It is true. We unanimously passed it out of committee, and we  unanimously passed it on the floor of the House. But what that means  is, it came to the floor of the House on the suspension calendar, which  meant no amendments were made in order.   The way that my friends on the other side of the aisle have brought  the bill up, amendments are made in order, and the Rules Committee made  21 different amendments in order. We passed the bill unanimously under  our leadership, but there was not an opportunity to improve it.   My friends on the other side have chosen a different path that does  allow an opportunity to improve it, but doesn't allow the opportunities  that I am seeking to pay for it.   I don't have to demean my friends or their intentions because their  intentions are pure, and they are thoughtful, honorable Members of this  institution. The fact that we disagree about policy does not mean we  have to disagree about the motives of one another. And when we have  these opportunities to do not just good but better; not just good, but  good in a way that we don't pass the bill on to our children and our  grandchildren, we take care of that bill today.   I will close with this, Mr. Speaker. Again, I can't disagree with any  of the words my friend from New York tells because the half of the  story that he tells is absolutely true. This is an authorizing bill  where we make a new promise to veterans.   If this bill passes the floor of the House today, it then goes to the  Appropriations Committee to fulfill this promise that we all celebrate  today, and the Appropriations Committee will have not one new penny to  pay for this new promise.   We have all been in this business long enough to know what happens to  promises that folks don't put any money behind and what happens to  promises that don't get paid for. The law prevents the Appropriations  Committee from funding this new promise, unless they cut dollars from  existing veterans promises today.   This bill is doing all the right things for all the right reasons.  Let's not make another veteran have to pay in a cut for what we are  promising to one of his brothers or sisters in a new benefit.   Defeat the previous question; allow us to pay for this bill; and  let's put our money where our hearts and our mouths are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
