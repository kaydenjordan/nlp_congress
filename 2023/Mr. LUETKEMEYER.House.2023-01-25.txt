 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 399,  the Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2023.   America's regulatory environment plays a huge role in the way small  businesses operate. They don't have access to the teams of lawyers  needed to navigate the maze of government red tape that currently  exists, and they certainly don't have the resources to make their  voices heard on the international stage. This bill, which is identical  to the bill that passed the House in the 117th Congress, gives small  businesses that voice.   Specifically, H.R. 399 gives the Small Business Administration's  Office of Advocacy the authority to represent small business interests  before foreign governments and international entities. That  representation is critical as the government renews and negotiates  trade agreements and international commerce.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Troy Carter from Louisiana, for  working with me in a bipartisan manner to improve the SBA's Office of  Advocacy.   I thank Chairman Williams for helping bring this legislation forward  and congratulate him on his new role as chairman of the Small Business  Committee. As a proven champion for Main Street America, small  businesses are in good hands with Chairman Williams at the helm.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ``yes'' vote on this bill that puts  America's small businesses first.
