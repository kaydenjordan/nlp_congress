 Mr. Speaker, I find it humorous, for those watching on TV  and for those in the balcony, that they keep talking about President  Trump. They won't talk about the current President, Joe Biden.   I am going to start off with a compliment. He has been able to  accomplish being the worst President and has replaced Jimmy Carter as  the worst President this country has ever had of all time, and it is  because of his policies.   I support this going to the Committee on Homeland Security because,  as has been said, the border is wide open. The gates are open.   How many more deaths do we have to have? How many more of our young  people have to die? Mr. Speaker, there were 100,000 last year of  record. As a Border Patrol agent said, there are no drug treatments in  a morgue.   How long are we going to have an administration that is going to take  the handcuffs and put them on the police?   How long are we going to have an administration that is going to  deplete our oil supplies and buy it from countries that don't like us?   How long are we going to have an administration that is going to  support abortion regardless of the term? How long?   Ask the average businessowner in this country if he is having a good  year or a bad year. Are prices coming up or going down? We have the  worst inflation that we have had in a long time, and it simply cannot  go on.   The election cannot come quick enough. This man has sold out. This  man has to be replaced.   Homeland Security is the right way for this resolution to go because  we will get the facts. I fully support it. I thank Mrs. Boebert for  taking the lead on this.
