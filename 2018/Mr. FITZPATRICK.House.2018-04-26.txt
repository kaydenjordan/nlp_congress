 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Small Business  Committee, I am proud to stand with owners and entrepreneurs in Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, who embody the spirit of American enterprise.   As such, and in honor of National Small Business Week, beginning  Sunday, I am proud to recognize two small businesses in my district  that have recently achieved significant milestones in their respective  industries.   Crossing Vineyards and Winery of Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania,  was named a top 50 Irish-owned small business and will be honored at  the Irish Small Business 50 Awards in Philadelphia.   Additionally, Sabre Systems of Warrington was recently contracted by  the United States Air Force to develop a cutting-edge antenna that  would be more difficult to detect, further strengthening our military  at home and abroad.   I am proud of these local small businesses and so many others in my  district, Mr. Speaker. We must do our part as elected officials to  enable them to thrive and succeed in our diverse and global economy.                            ____________________
