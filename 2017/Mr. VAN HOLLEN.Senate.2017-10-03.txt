 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the people and  leaders of Taiwan on their National Day to take place on October 10.  The United States and Taiwan have a long history of mutual trade and  friendship that has promoted prosperity and security on both sides of  the Pacific. The United States-Taiwan bilateral relationship continues  to grow based on our shared democratic values and common strategic  interests.   I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the people of  Taiwan on their success and thanking them for their continued efforts  to work with the United States on economic growth and security  cooperation. The people of both the United States and Taiwan have much  to celebrate.                            ____________________
