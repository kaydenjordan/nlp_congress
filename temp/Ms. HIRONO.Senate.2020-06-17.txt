 Mr. President, in 2019, 21 people died in Hawaii in three  tragic air recreation accidents involving helicopters or planes.   On December 26, 2019, while many of us were enjoying the holidays  with our loved ones and friends, seven people lost their lives when an  air tour helicopter crashed into a mountain on the Island of Kauai. All  aboard the helicopter were killed, a mother and daughter from  Wisconsin, a family of four from Switzerland, and the pilot. We still  do not know the cause of the crash. In April 2019, an air tour  helicopter crashed on a street in the residential neighborhood of  Kailua on the island of Oahu, killing all aboard: two passengers and  the pilot. We were fortunate that no one on the ground was injured. On  June 22, 2019, 11 people died when a small plane crashed during take- off on a skydiving trip from Dillingham Airfield on Oahu. In the first  accident of 2020, on March 5, six people walked away after a hard  landing of an air tour helicopter on the Big Island of Hawaii. No one  on the helicopter was seriously injured.   Since 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, has  investigated 10 air tour accidents in Hawaii and more than 46  nationwide.   Senator Schatz and I are introducing the Air Tour and Skydiving  Safety Improvement Act of 2020. The bill takes the outstanding safety  issues and recommendations identified by the NTSB to improve the safety  and accountability of air sightseeing tours and parachute tours. The  Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, has not implemented the NTSB's  recommendations.   In most years, Hawaii welcomes nearly 10 million visitors annually to  enjoy everything Hawaii has to offer, from our Aloha spirit displayed  by our resident, to the scenic beauty of the State. It is critical that  the helicopters and planes taking both visitors and residents  sightseeing or parachuting operate as safely as possible.   The NTSB has recommended multiple improvements to the standards  covering air tour and parachute operations by the FAA. In the aftermath  of the helicopter crash in Kailua and the crash of two chartered  floatplanes in Alaska, NTSB Chairman Robert L. Sumwalt said in May  2019: ``While these tragic accidents are still under investigation, and  no findings or causes have been determined, each crash underscores the  urgency of improving the safety of charter flights by implementing  existing NTSB safety recommendations.'' To highlight this urgency, the  NTSB put improvements to air tour aircraft on its 2019-2020 Most Wanted  List of transportation safety improvements.   Let me describe the provisions of the legislation. First, the bill  requires parachute and air tour companies to operate under the same  standards as other commercial air operations, such as commuter airlines  under Part 135, which has certification standards. Currently,  commercial companies can operate like private civil aircraft if they  operate within 25 miles of their airport, under regulations found in  Part 91. The NTSB recommends that all commercial air operations meet  the same standards for training, certification, operations, and crew  rest under part 135.   The bill requires that the FAA establish a standard for terrain  awareness and warning systems and minimum standards for training pilots  to avoid flying into mountains and other terrain. This may have  prevented the helicopter crash on Kauai in December 2019, which crashed  into the side of a mountain.   Following another NTSB recommendation, the bill requires operators  install crash-resistant flight data recording equipment, we can learn  more from accidents and to help identify flaws in equipment and improve  pilot performance.   The helicopter involved in the December 2019 crash in Kauai lacked  flight data monitoring, so inspectors were uncertain of its flight path  and performance. The bill requires the FAA to establish and implement a  standard for remote monitoring of flight data. It also requires  operators to establish a flight data monitoring program to identify  changes from normal procedures and other potential safety issues.   The bill includes provisions to make sure that the current and future  recommendations of the NTSB are given full consideration by the FAA. It  requires the FAA to indicate how their response to NTSB safety  recommendations will meet or exceed safety outcomes of the NTSB 's  recommendations, if the FAA declines to adopt the NTSB recommendations.  The bill also directs the U.S. Department of Transportation to include  NTSB recommendations on air tours and parachute operations in its  annual report on aviation safety.   The safety of parachute operations would be improved by the standards  that I have described, but the bill also addresses the unique safety  needs of parachute operations. The bill would require the FAA to  develop new or revised regulations for parachute operations, including  enhanced maintenance and inspection for aircraft and training and  recurrent testing requirements for pilots.   The bill we are introducing today would make great improvements to  increase the safety of air tours. This is a first step. But this  legislation does not address all the issues with air tour helicopters.  The issues of noise, frequency, and safety associated with air tour  operations in the State of Hawaii have been going on for decades.   In September 2016, at the request of State Representative Onishi, my  office requested a meeting for Big Island State legislators with the  FAA Honolulu Flight Standards District Office, or FSDO, to address the  issue of the helicopter noise for residents in East Hawaii. We learned  at this meeting that FAA-FSDO and Hawaii Department of Transportation  do not have the authority to address the noise issue raised by the  community.   In March 2017, FAA and the National Park Service representatives  traveled to Hawaii from their DC headquarters to convene public  listening sessions in Honolulu and Hilo, respectively, ``to better  identify specific concerns with helicopter operations within and  outside of national parks.'' Community members were looking for relief  from noise issues associated with air tour overflights over residential  areas.   We were hopeful that these meetings were a signal of FAA's engagement  so we could address community concerns with the air tour operators.  Individuals from the community came prepared and raised questions about  how other communities across the country have dealt with this issue  including the New York North Shore Helicopter Route and the adjustments  to routes over Los Angeles County.   State and local governments, air tour companies, and the community  were interested in engaging. Unfortunately, while the FAA initiated the  meetings, they disappointed many in our community when they announced  that their agency could only offer technical advice and the effort did  not result in an air tour safety plan.  [[Page S3060]]    In another example of FAA inaction, Congress required the FAA and the  National Park Service to develop air tour management plans for our  national parks under the Air Tour Management Act of 2000. For two  decades, interagency fighting prevented any progress from being made.  In 2018, the Hawaii Island Malama Pono Coalition and Public Employees  for Environmental Responsibility, groups representing national park  employees and visitors, filed a petition in Federal court to compel the  agencies to regulate air tours at seven parks.   On May 1, 2020, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia ordered the FAA and the National Park Service to develop air  tour management plans for 23 national parks, including Haleakala  National Park and Volcanoes National Park in Hawaii. The court found  that the agencies' efforts were ``underwhelming,'' ``ultimately  unsuccessful,'' and failed to develop the plans in a reasonable amount  of time.   The court expects the agencies to develop the air tour management  plans for all 23 parks within 2 years, and the court will retain  jurisdiction to continue oversight until the agencies have completed  the plans.   Volcanoes National Park was the subject of 8,333 air tour flights in  2018, over 22 flights per day, the highest number of air tour flights  of any national park. Haleakala had the fourth most air tour flights in  2018, with 4,757 flights. The residents in the surrounding communities  in the flight path and visitors trying to enjoy the quiet of nature are  all too aware of the visual and the noise from air tour flights.   With the decision by the Court, many in Hawaii now expect action in  the development of air tour management plans for Hawaii's two national  parks.   Of course, air tours affect residents and communities in Hawaii  throughout the State. On January 9 of this year, members of the Hawaii  Helicopter Association, Hawaii Department of Transportation's Airports  Division, appointees from the State legislature, and other stakeholders  formed the Hawaii Air Noise and Safety Task Force with representatives  from the FAA as technical advisers. The task force was created to  ``fund public meetings, produce a study and make recommendations  concerning the helicopter and fixed wing tour industry.''   It remains clear to me that the FAA needs to address its failure to  oversee the air tour industry. On January 31, Senator Schatz and I  joined in the Senate Commerce Committee's request for an investigation  by the inspector general of the Department of Transportation into  allegations that the FAA's Honolulu Flight Standards District Office  ignored serious concerns about the safety of helicopter air tours in  Hawaii. We requested an investigation into the oversight lapses raised  by the whistleblowers. The ongoing investigation by the inspector  general will show whether FAA is able to enforce its own rules in  Hawaii.   What remains clear is that the NTSB has recommended additional  standards to the FAA to improve safety throughout the country, but the  FAA has not addressed these safety issues. We have waited long enough  for action.   The legislation we are introducing will strengthen the rules to  ensure accountability and safety for Hawaii's aviation operators and  travelers.                            ____________________
