 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman also for  bringing up this important issue today.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1370, the Department of  Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act. A few years ago, law  enforcement officers in South Dakota placed undercover ads on the  internet, and they weren't pretending to sell illegal drugs. What they  were pretending to sell was young girls.   In less than 2 days, over 100 individuals responded to that ad. Many  of them were hoping to buy children for sex. Similar operations were  conducted across the State in following months, and they had similar  results. Many times, when folks think of human trafficking, they often  picture a place far away overseas, but the fact is that it is happening  right here--in our backyards many times.   Those being targeted are often children, 12 or 14 years old,  sometimes even younger. They are forced to turn tricks up to 50 times a  day while their pimps work hard to get them addicted to alcohol and  drugs so that they can further control them and their lives. It also  deepens their dependence on their trafficker.   Last Congress, we passed significant antitrafficking legislation,  which I am incredibly proud of, but there is still more that needs to  be done. Time and again, South Dakota advocates tell me that awareness  remains a challenge, but a challenge that we can work together to  overcome. That is ultimately the purpose of this legislation that we  are considering today.   Through the enhanced Blue Campaign, we can offer Americans from all  walks of life the information that they need to spot trafficking in  their backyards. If more people are aware of distress signals and how  to respond, we can move faster towards ending human trafficking  together.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1370.
