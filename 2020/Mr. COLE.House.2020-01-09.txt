 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Dr. Burgess,  for yielding.   I rise, Madam Speaker, in reluctant opposition, quite frankly, to  both the rule and the underlying legislation.   As my good friend, Chairman McGovern knows, we have actually worked  together to try and expand and reclaim war-making authority for the  Congress of the United States, and I would offer and continue to work  with him in that partnership. I think that is something that needs to  be continued.   I also think we have no difference that if we were to engage in a war  with Iraq, it would require congressional authorization. And frankly,  last night, in the Rules Committee, I offered a process whereby we  could work together in a bipartisan fashion; that is, let's just follow  the War Powers Resolution. Let's submit something to the committee of  jurisdiction, which is actually the Foreign Affairs Committee. We have  a deadline or a timeline laid out in the War Powers Act; they could  operate within that. Within a matter of a few weeks we would then, in a  very bipartisan manner, bring something to the floor.   Let's contrast that with how this particular resolution came to the  floor. We got it about 45 minutes before the Rules Committee meeting.  It is written in the Speaker's Office; rewritten in the Speaker's  Office, and it is sent down here to make a political point, not to  actually do something that would substantively restore congressional  war-making power. This is all politics; that is all it is.                                time  1300    The political aim here is for our friends to suggest that the  President either wants war with Iran or has acted hastily,  precipitously, and recklessly. Neither of those things is true.   Frankly, our latest dispute with Iran begins with the decision by  this administration appropriately to withdraw from the very ill-advised  Iranian nuclear deal, a deal, by the way, that the majority of this  House and the majority of the United States Senate opposed, but  President Obama went ahead with it anyway.   What has been the Iranian response to our withdrawal? A series of  provocations to which, as my good friend Mr. Burgess pointed out, the  President, by and large, has acted with remarkable restraint. Let's  just go through some of those provocations.   First, it was attacks on ships in the Strait of Hormuz in the gulf.  What was the President's response? Well, let's organize an  international flotilla to defend these ships. He did not attack Iran.   Next, as my good friend from Texas pointed out, we see strikes into  Iraq itself. Particularly, we see an attack on Saudi Arabian oil  refineries. What is the President's response? Well, let's not attack  Iran. Let's send defensive capabilities from our country there and  protect those sites.   Then, we see attacks on American forces in Iraq. What is the  President's response? As my friend pointed out, let's go after the Shia  militias. Let's not attack Iran.   Finally, after that, when the President responds, we see another  attack. In that attack, as my friend pointed out, an American  contractor died, and four American servicemembers were wounded. Again,  the President responds by attacking Shia militia.   Then, the next response, our embassy is assaulted. Thank goodness, no  loss of life, but I think the President had had enough.   By the way, just after that assault happens, who magically shows up  in violation of a U.N. resolution in Iraq? Our good friend General  Soleimani, a designated terrorist for 13 years, a person who has killed  hundreds of Americans, wounded thousands more, not to  [[Page H81]]  mention the tens of thousands across the region. What does the  President do? The President takes out a legitimate terrorist target. In  Iran? No, the President doesn't want to do that. He does it in Iraq.   Now, how anybody could have any doubt about the President's desire  to, number one, strike at a terrorist, and, number two, avoid war, I  will never know.    Madam Speaker, passing this resolution, as my good friend  Dr. Burgess suggested, sends the wrong message to the wrong people at  precisely the wrong time.   The President did the right thing here. He has acted in a restrained  manner. He has endured, and our country has endured, endless  provocations.   We should reject this rule. Frankly, we should have a regular process  where we actually go back to the committee of jurisdiction. We should  absolutely reject the underlying resolution.   Before I conclude, I want to mention I know my friend is very sincere  in his opinions on expanding congressional war power. There is no doubt  in my mind about it. We have worked on that before. I look forward to  working with my friend on that issue again. This is the wrong vehicle,  the wrong place, the wrong time, the wrong consequences for our own  country to pass this kind of legislation.
