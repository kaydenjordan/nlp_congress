 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1, after line 16 insert the following new subsection       (and redesignate the subsequent subsection accordingly):        (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be       construed as precluding the application of any of the       exemptions described in section 552 of title 5, United States       Code, to subsection (n) of such section, as added by       subsection (a).    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 280, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to first commend  Chairman Chaffetz for introducing H.R. 1694, the Fannie and Freddie  Open Records Act of 2017. I would also like to thank the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and members of the committee for all of their  hard work on this legislation.   H.R. 1694 would amend the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, to make  its provisions apply to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when the two  entities are in Federal conservatorship or receivership. My amendment  makes commonsense improvements to the underlying bill to ensure that  all nine FOIA exemptions apply to government-sponsored entities in  conservatorship.   By passing this amendment, we will ensure that personal privacy and  sensitive information is appropriately protected, while ensuring the  highest level of transparency for the American taxpayers.   I am pleased to have the support of Chairman Chaffetz on this  amendment, and I urge all of the Members to support this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
