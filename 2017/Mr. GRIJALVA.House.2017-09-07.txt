 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $12,000,000)''.        Page 66, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $12,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment will restore $12 million in  cuts to the already underfunded Superfund Enforcement program, with an  equivalent cut to Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas leasing  program.  [[Page H7138]]    Superfund Enforcement is the epitome of Federal fiscal  responsibility. It ensures that polluters pay for the cleanup and the  mess they have caused.   For over 35 years, EPA's Superfund Enforcement program has enabled  thousands of site investigations at cleanups and has required viable  responsible parties to either conduct the work or pay for the cleanups  of these Superfund sites, in other words, hold parties accountable for  the action and correction of their activities.                                time  1730    Any cuts to these funds clearly places corporate interests over that  of the health and financial well-being of the American people.   According to the EPA, the Superfund Enforcement program's efforts to  negotiate settlement agreements and issue order for cleanup work  accounts for approximately 69 percent of all the cleanup work currently  underway at Superfund sites around this country.   For every dollar the Superfund Enforcement program spends, private  parties commit $8 toward cleanup work. The enforcement funding is  essential in saving taxpayer dollars and the scarce resources of the  Superfund trust fund to address truly abandoned and orphaned sites.   As of August 1, 2017, there were 1,845 Superfund sites in the  country. These sites include dangerous and toxic substances not just in  my backyard but in everybody's backyard.   Perhaps not surprisingly, Superfund sites tend to be located near  lower income communities and around communities of color. Approximately  53 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund site in this  country, and 46 percent of them live in poorer communities and  communities of color. Fifteen percent of those residents live below the  poverty level.   According to a National Association of Clean Air Agencies report:  ``Without EPA's enforcement, companies could avoid reporting, or  minimize the reported amount of toxic materials released to the  environment.''   Following one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to hit Texas, the  EPA found that 13 Superfund sites have been flooded or could face  damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey.   Administrator Pruitt has repeatedly tried to justify his cuts to the  agency by claiming that he wants the agency to go ``back to the  basics.'' I can't think of anything more fundamental than cleaning up  the most toxic sites in the Nation to protect the health of the people  who live nearby in those communities.   Restoring the ability of the EPA to self-sustain its core mission  should be a no-brainer for those on both sides of the aisle. In order  to restore the funding, my amendment will make a modest cut to the  BLM's oil and gas program. This program is a massive giveaway to the  very polluters that have made the existence of the Superfund program a  necessity.   Currently, 7,950 drilling permits are approved and not being used.  There are 14.4 million acres of public land under lease and not  producing. There is no justification to dole out more taxpayer money in  order to expedite and speed up the permitting or leasing practices when  we have that amount not being used and over close to 15 million acres  under lease, as we speak.   A report by Oil Change International recently found that the U.S.  Government provided about $6 billion annually in financial support to  the oil, gas, and coal industries between 2013 and 2015. Meanwhile, oil  giant ExxonMobil's profits more than doubled in the first quarter of  this year, which equaled $4.1 billion in profits for just that one  quarter. They certainly did not need more taxpayer money while  communities across the United States continue to be exposed to toxic  and hazardous pollution.   My amendment restores, in part, EPA's core mission to protect the  public health of the American people and to hold all polluters  responsible and liable for the environmental and health risks they  cause.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is a prudent, necessary protection  of public health and the environment. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.   The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in House Report 115-297.                     Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Bacon    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 39, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $1,011,000)''.        Page 64, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1,011,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment will restore $1 million in  cuts to the Environmental Justice program within the EPA, with an  equivalent cut to leadership and administration within the DOI Office  of the Secretary.   In 1992, the program was created and originally called the  Environmental Equity Office. It was created after a series of releases  of reports that revealed polluter sites were disproportionately located  in low-income communities and communities of color.                                time  1815    With minimal support, the program has provided communities with  leveraged resources to do things like revitalize neighborhoods, build  health centers, expand affordable housing, create green space and  recreation areas, and, more importantly, raise the awareness of the  disproportionate treatment in both affected communities and  decisionmakers.   Despite this success within the EPA for decades, we are not even  close to dealing with the issue of environmental justice.   In 2016, the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that  racial minorities and low-income communities are still  disproportionately affected by the siting of waste disposal facilities,  permitted emissions facilities, and that they often lack the political  and financial clout to properly bargain with polluters when fighting a  decision or seeking redress.   A report by the staff of the House Committee on Natural Resources  found that clean water access and sanitation infrastructure on numerous  reservations across the Nation more closely resemble developing  countries than they do the rest of the Nation. Nearly half of all homes  on Tribal land lack access to adequate drinking water, sewage, or solid  waste disposal facilities. As a result, Native families often end up  drinking unclean water that increases disease risks and impairs Tribal  economic development.   Additionally, low-income communities of color have been on the  frontline of Houston's petrochemical industry for decades, and when  Harvey struck, they were some of the first to feel the effects as  chemical plants caught fire, refineries began flaring toxins, and  polluted floodwater went into their neighborhoods.   The EPA Office of Environmental Justice helps integrate concerns of  these communities within the general activities of the agencies. This  is not a program that can afford to be scaled back, especially as  concerns of environmental justice continue to arise around Hurricane  Harvey and now in Irma's path. It is critical that we protect frontline  communities and communities of color from disparate impacts caused by  environmental pollution. One million dollars is not a lot of  [[Page H7144]]  money for this task, but it reaffirms the significance of the office  and our sense of equality.   Today I ask my colleagues to join in defense of these communities and  show them that Congress cares about their public health, their housing,  and their importance as people.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McEachin), a member of the  Natural Resources Committee, and ranking member of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of this amendment to  restore funding to the Environmental Justice program within the EPA.  This program enables the agency to better assist frontline communities  that are disproportionately impacted by pollution.   Low-income and minority communities face disproportionate levels of  hazardous pollution and environmental contaminants due to where their  members live and where they work.   The harms are real. For instance, higher levels of air pollution  result in members of minority groups having higher death rates and  higher numbers of emergency room visits and hospital stays.   As the cofounder and co-chair of the United for Climate and  Environmental Justice Task Force, it is my mission to combat these  environmental injustices and ensure frontline communities no longer  bear the unequal burden of environmental, economic, and health harms.   That is why, Mr. Chairman, this amendment is so important.   The Environmental Justice program leverages Federal funds to greatly  improve health and quality of life in our most vulnerable communities.  Since the establishment of the program, communities have been better  able to revitalize neighborhoods, build health centers, expand  affordable housing, and create new green spaces and recreational areas.   I urge my colleagues to show low-income and minority communities that  we care about their health, housing, and overall well-being by  supporting the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.           Amendment No. 21 Offered by Mr. Price of North Carolina    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 21  printed in House Report 115-297.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 63, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $104,235,000) (increased by $104,235,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Price) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would restore  the EPA's Science and Technology account to 2017 levels.   I offer this amendment to underscore the importance of environmental  research to the health and safety of the American people, as well as  thousands of jobs in my district and across the country.   This amendment is framed in increase-decrease terms for the simple  reason that, given the subcommittee's inadequate allocation, there is  simply no place to turn for an offset.   The EPA's Science and Technology account funds research and  development activities within the agency, supporting the work of the  world's leading environmental research enterprise and informing the  environmental policies that Congress enacts.   The bill on the floor today would cut this account by $105 million, a  15 percent reduction. About the only good thing I can say about that is  that it isn't as bad as the Trump budget, but it is still a deep and  devastating cut. Mr. Chairman, we have to restore these funds as this  bill moves through the remaining stages of the process.   The EPA's Office of Research and Development funded by this account  not only supports EPA programs in air, water, toxicology, and energy  research, but it also facilitates innovative partnerships with some of  the premier higher education and research institutions in the country.   EPA research facilities employ more than 2,000 people, supports some  700 affiliated jobs in my district alone. This includes advanced  laboratory scientists, administrative personnel, also blue-collar jobs  in maintenance, custodial, and security positions.   The EPA research that this agency conducts, world class research, it  allows us to remain proactive in protecting the air we breathe, the  water we drink, resources, whose safety we must never, ever take for  granted.   Now, I know the EPA is continually a scapegoat when it comes to  spending cuts. In times of crisis, however, we don't hesitate to call  on them to respond quickly to events that could pose a threat to the  environment and public safety.   Just last week in the devastating wake of Hurricane Harvey, sites  containing dangerous chemicals and contaminants were severely flooded  and damaged. Research from this office, the office being cut in this  bill, proved invaluable in putting together a safe and effective  response.   In other words, the EPA is part of the first line of defense to  respond to events that pose threats to public health and safety. It  follows that if we gut the EPA's research budget, we are putting  ultimately the American public at risk.   The EPA research cuts underscore, I think, how fraudulent the claim  is that this is a bill that would make America secure and prosperous.  Really? In reality, it would cripple investments that Americans count  on each and every day to keep them safe and healthy.   Mr. Chairman, I remain hopeful that a bipartisan budget agreement  will be reached that will allow us to restore this research funding and  do right by the people we represent.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
