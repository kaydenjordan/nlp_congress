 Mr. President, last night, millions of Americans tuned  into one of the most shameful hours we have ever seen on cable  television. With contempt for the facts, disregard of the risks, and  knowing full well he was lying--lying--to his audience, FOX News host  Tucker Carlson ran a lengthy segment last night arguing the January 6  Capitol attack was not a violent insurrection.   By diving deep into the waters of conspiracy and cherry-picking from  thousands of hours of security footage, Mr. Carlson told the bald-faced  lie that the Capitol attack--which we all saw with our own eyes--was  somehow not an attack at all. He tried to argue it was nothing more  than a peaceful sightseeing tour--can you imagine--a nonviolent  demonstration, a perfectly fine and appropriate instance of people  expressing their opinion.   I and so many others who were here in the Capitol and millions and  millions of Americans are just furious with Tucker Carlson and Kevin  McCarthy today.   Many of my staff were here at the Capitol on January 6. Their lives  were put in danger, as were the lives of many of my colleagues, as well  as police, maintenance staff, reporters, countless others.   At one point, I was within 30 feet of the rioters. One of them, I was  told, shouted out ``let's get him'' before my detail pulled me away and  we ran in the other direction.   To say January 6 was not violent is a lie--a lie, pure and simple. I  don't think I have ever seen a prime time cable news anchor manipulate  his viewers the way Mr. Carlson did last night. I don't think I have  ever seen an anchor treat the American people and American democracy  with such disdain.   And he is going to come back tonight with another segment. FOX News  should tell him not to.   FOX News, Rupert Murdoch, tell Carlson not to run a second segment of  lies. You know it is a lie. He has admitted it is a lie.   And Speaker McCarthy is every bit as culpable as Mr. Carlson. Speaker  McCarthy's decision to share security footage with FOX looked like a  mistake from the very beginning. But after last night, it looks like a  disaster. Speaker McCarthy has played a treacherous game by catering to  the  [[Page S660]]  hard right. He has enabled the Big Lie and has further eroded away at  our precious democracy. When people don't believe elections are on the  level, that is the beginning of the end of this bold experiment in  democracy that has gone on for more than 200 years.   It is all the more shameful because Speaker McCarthy knows precisely  what kind of customer Mr. Carlson is. He is not surprised by this  outcome. What a low point for Speaker McCarthy. What a low point for  FOX News.   As reporting on the Dominion lawsuit shows, Mr. Carlson had no  problem admitting behind the scenes that the Big Lie is pure garbage.  When Sydney Powell went on the air to push the stolen election  narrative, Mr. Carlson told fellow anchor Laura Ingraham that ``Sydney  Powell is lying''--his words by the deposition. Mr. Carlson's own  producer texted him that ``I don't think there is evidence of voter  fraud that swung the election.''   They know. They know full well they have been lying, and they are  doing it anyway. We all, Americans of all types and stripes and corners  of this country--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--need to take a  stand and call out Mr. Carlson's conduct for what it is: a dangerous,  unforgivable attempt to destabilize our democracy and rewrite the  history of the worst attack on our Constitution since the Civil War.   It is an insult to every police officer who was on the scene that  terrible, fearful day. It is an insult to the memory of every single  person who perished in connection with the attack, especially to the  memory of Brian Sicknick.   Nonviolent? Ask the Sicknick family. It makes me sick just thinking  about what his family must be going through this morning.   And it is an insult to everyone who cares about our democracy and  wishes to preserve the dream of our Founders in our day, in our age. I  hope every Member of this Chamber will call out FOX and Mr. Carlson for  defending the insurrectionists.   And, again, I am disappointed and angered in Speaker McCarthy's  decision to share sensitive security footage with Mr. Carlson. Speaker  McCarthy was here that day. He knows what actually happened. His staff  and members suffered like everyone else, but he chose cheap political  expediency over truth and preservation of democracy.   I condemn Mr. Carlson for siding with the enemies of democracy. I  strongly condemn Speaker McCarthy's actions and fiercely oppose his  decision to share this footage with Carlson. I urge FOX News to order  Carlson to cease propagating the Big Lie on his network and to level  with their viewers about the truth--the truth--behind the efforts to  mislead the public. Conduct like theirs is just asking for another  January 6 to happen.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, the Senate confirms a first-rate  legal mind, someone I was proud to champion to the President for a  lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, Arun Subramanian of New  York.   Mr. Subramanian is the epitome of the American dream and a  historymaker: The child of hard-working immigrants from India, he will  become the first South Asian to preside in the Southern District, which  has one of the largest South Asian populations in the country.   Mr. Subramanian's resume tells a very clear story. He is excellent.  He is accomplished. He has dedicated his entire career fighting for  average Americans. He served as a law clerk to Judge Dennis Jacobs on  the Second Circuit, Judge Gerard Lynch in the Southern District of New  York, and the late, great Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   He is an expert in consumer protection, with years of experience  defending those injured by unfair, illegal practices. He also defended  victims of child trafficking and pornography.   Our courts need more people like Arun Subramanian. I am proud to  support his confirmation. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for supporting him today.   Once we confirm Mr. Subramanian, this U.S. Senate majority will have  confirmed 114 judges to the bench: 30 circuit court judges, 83 district  court judges, and 1 incredible Supreme Court Justice in Ketanji Brown  Jackson. Of those 114 nominations, 82 are women, 78 are people of  color, and, again, Mr. Subramanian is the first South Asian judge  confirmed to the Southern District of New York.   Because of the work done by this majority, our Federal judiciary is  far more balanced, far more diverse, far more experienced than the one  we just had 2 years ago. It is something every American can be proud  of.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 58 and 59;  that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening  action or debate, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table, and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have six requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S673, March 7, 2023, in the third column, the following  appears: AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET  Madam President, I have six  requests for committees to . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet in open and  closed session during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, March 7,  2023, at 9:30 a.m.               COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS    The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, March 7, 2023, at 10  a.m., to conduct a hearing.
