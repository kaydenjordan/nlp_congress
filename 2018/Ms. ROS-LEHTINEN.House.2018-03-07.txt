 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to bring attention  to the sad and tragic truth of what is going on in Venezuela today  under a cynical socialist thug, the Maduro regime.   Even though this administration has stepped up and has taken a strong  stance against Maduro--we have sanctioned a lot of individuals--there  is still much more that needs to be done.   And the first step is getting more action by making sure that my  fellow colleagues are aware of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and  helping those who refuse to believe that Maduro can be that bad. Yes,  he really can be that bad. And we need to understand the suffering and  the frustration of the Venezuelan people.   The second step is urging the administration to increase the  pressure, to use the tools that are available to us, to hold Maduro and  his evil cronies accountable. We have already seen how some of these  tools are working, Mr. Speaker.   Our sanctions are working, so much so that Maduro is actively looking  at ways to circumvent our sanctions, like this crazy idea of launching  his own cryptocurrency. We are hitting him where it hurts, and we need  to build on that momentum.   But we must also not forget to advocate on behalf of the people of  Venezuela who are suffering, who are malnourished, and who are sick and  poor. They lack the most basic medical and food supplies that they  need--again, all as a result of Maduro's policies. Who would have ever  thought 30 years ago that Venezuela, that was a breadbasket for South  America, is now having food shortages throughout the country.   So I call on the international community to try to see what we can do  to ease this humanitarian crisis that Venezuelans are going through,  because this situation is terrible, but I fear that it will get worse.   Maduro and his thugs are taking advantage of the worsening  humanitarian situation, defrauding organizations that are looking to  bring much-needed food and medicine into the country, and making it  much harder to deliver aid to those who desperately need it.   This is why my dear friend, Ranking Member Eliot Engel of our Foreign  Affairs Committee, and I have introduced the Venezuela Humanitarian  Assistance Act. This bill calls attention to the food shortages, to the  water shortages, to the severe lack of medicine, to the severe lack of  medical supplies, and to the lack of other vital goods and services.  But, more importantly, it directs our great agencies--the USAID,  especially, and the Department of State--to develop a plan to determine  how the U.S. can help send in some humanitarian assistance through  credible and independent nongovernmental organizations that are  operating in Venezuela or in neighboring countries. It is very  difficult to get that aid to the people who need it because Maduro does  not want to help the suffering Venezuelan people.   This bill passed the House last year, and it sends a strong message  that we see the millions of people of Venezuela who are suffering and  that we want to  [[Page H1447]]  help. As the political situation continues to deteriorate because  socialism does not work, communism does not work, with Maduro  announcing his sham of elections, another round of elections that only  the opposition is shut out and only the cronies can win, political  leaders are still in prison, and protestors continue to be met with  violence, we must do what we can until this grave humanitarian crisis  is resolved.                                time  1015    That is why I urge the international community to take notice of what  is going on in Venezuela, see how we can come together and pass these  important measures so that we can help the Venezuelan people. We must  not stop working until we see once again a free and open, democratic  Venezuela, free from this socialist and communist regime.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Women's History Month  and the resilient women who have challenged the status quo, I am  honored to recognize my congressional colleague and dear friend,  Representative Marcy Kaptur.   In 1981, Marcy defeated the incumbent in an upset that gained  national attention, leading her to become the longest-serving woman in  the U.S. House of Representatives and a senior member of the powerful  and highly coveted Appropriations Committee.   I met Marcy during my first tenure in the House back in 1989, and at  that time there were only 31 women serving in all of Congress. Marcy  welcomed me with open arms, and I quickly realized that Marcy embodies  what any legislator should be: principled, truthful, and a fierce  fighter for her constituents.   It was because of Marcy's vision and tireless advocacy that Americans  from all over the country are now able to visit the World War II  Memorial here in D.C. and honor the dedication and sacrifice of the  brave men and women who defended our country.   Marcy, you are an inspiration to women everywhere, and I want to  thank you for your commitment to advocate for so many important issues  that matter to all Americans. Congratulations on this honor, the  longest-serving woman in U.S. history.                            ____________________
