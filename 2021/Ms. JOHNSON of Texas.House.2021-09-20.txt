 Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank Chairwoman  Beatty and the Congressional Black Caucus for hosting this Special  Order Hour on our priorities in the budget reconciliation and  infrastructure negotiation processes, and thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee and Congressman Torres for facilitating it.   First, let me be very clear: I am certainly no fan of the  partisanship and complexity associated with the reconciliation process.  In an ideal world, in a perfect situation, this process would be  defined by bipartisan agreements and give-and-take, and would be  negotiated in a gradual, more transparent manner. But we do not live in  an ideal world, nor is this a perfect situation. Right now, as we stand  here today, millions of Americans are suffering, our infrastructure is  crumbling, and our planet is quite literally on fire.   Now, Madam Speaker, I have served in this body for nearly 30 years-- but I find myself struggling to recall a time when the cost of inaction  was as high and as dangerous as it is in this moment. That's why the  Black Caucus, under the leadership of Chairwoman Beatty, has fought to  include vital provisions in the Build Back Better Act that would  transform our economy and infrastructure, provide relief from Americans  still reeling from the effects of COVID-19, and form a blueprint for a  more equitable, just society.   It's why I, as a Senior Member of the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, voted to pass the portion of the Build Back  Better Act dealing with investments in our nation's transportation and  infrastructure systems. The most salient, underlying themes contained  in the bill include investments in a race equitable transportation  system, climate resiliency, transit programs targeted to residents in  disadvantaged communities, resources for railroads, port infrastructure  and supply chain resilience, and our water infrastructure, to name a  few.   It's why I, as Chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, presided  [[Page H4550]]  over a markup of the portion of the Build Back Better Act dealing with  the issues and agencies under our jurisdiction. We targeted giving our  nation's scientists and engineers 21st century facilities to conduct  research by investing billions of dollars into research infrastructure  at the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Institute  of Standards and Technology, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration. These vital investments will also lead to good, high- paying jobs. We also invested billions of dollars into our innovation  pipeline at our premier research agencies to power our research and  development and our advanced manufacturing programs. This includes  significant investments in minority-serving institutions and diversity  programs at NSF and DOE. Finally, we funded billions of dollars to  better understand and respond to the climate crisis. Included in this  is vital funding to improve our understanding of climate-associated  natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires.   Madam Speaker, I would urge all of my colleagues--Republican and  Democrat, progressive and conservative, and everyone in between--to  support these critical, much-needed investments in our constituents, in  our districts, and in our country as a whole.                            ____________________
