 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent and dear  friend, Alfredo Acosta Figueroa, for his lifelong dedication to social  justice and his relentless advocacy for civil rights during the Chicano  Movement with Cesar Chavez and Bert Corona.   Alfredo Acosta Figueroa was born in Blythe, California, to a fifth- generation indigenous-Chicano family from the Colorado River Indian  Reservation, which encompasses the Palo Verde Valley in California and  all through Parker Valley in Arizona.   From a young age, Alfredo learned the values of social justice from  his family. As a young kid working in the mines, his parents taught him  the values of standing up for himself, caring for his neighbors, and  standing by his coworkers.   Because of his family's lessons, he has dedicated his entire life to  safeguarding the civil, voting, working, and environmental rights of  disenfranchised and indigenous communities.   In the late 1950s, Alfredo and his brothers, known as the Figueroa  Brothers, became actively involved in the civil rights movement.  Together, they fought against injustices in Blythe, the Coachella  Valley, and throughout the American Southwest.   Through it all, Alfredo was mentored by two highly respected Chicano  leaders: Humberto ``Bert'' Corona, an immigration rights activist with  the Mexican American Political Association; and Cesar Chavez, the civil  rights leader of the United Farm Workers.   Corona and Chavez's mentorship only deepened Alfredo's passion for  human rights, encouraging him to further pursue equity and social  justice for his community.   Over the years, Figueroa has worn many hats and has undertaken  monumental roles, including that of lifetime ``gambusino'' or miner,  civil rights activist, humanitarian, farm labor organizer, staunch  environmentalist, antinuclear activist, historian, political  coordinator, boxing coordinator, folkloric singer and guitarist,  indigenous traditionalist, and author, just to name a few.   So now, he leads the protection of sacred indigenous sites within the  Lower Colorado River Basin and Palo Verde and Parker Valleys.   Thanks to Alfredo's leadership, many historical indigenous sacred  sites and bodies of water have been protected. This includes the Sacred  Mule Mountains, the Lower Colorado River, the world-renowned Blythe  Giant Intaglios, and over 300 other sacred sites. Alfredo has achieved  all this and more by following his guiding principle to never give up.   One of his famous sayings, ``La Lucha Indeterminable,'' or ``The  Never-Ending Struggle,'' has kept him motivated in his lifelong mission  to share, educate, organize, and regain indigenous cosmic traditional  culture.   Alfredo's compelling force to provoke change has found inspiration in  two indigenous philosophies: First, the Neltiliztli, or ``the birth of  the new knowledge,'' meaning that we must always seek the truth;   Second, the ancient Nahuatl teachings of Tloque Nahuaque, or the  saying, ``among all, we do all, for the betterment of all.'' Both have  allowed him to persist in this long journey and inspire many others.   So, to my dear friend, Alfredo Acosta Figueroa, you personify the  dedication, resiliency, and carino of so many of our communities. Your  life of service will forever be an inspiration for all people, and we  are in great debt to you.   On behalf of California's 36th Congressional District, I thank you  for your continued dedication and challenging work in the protection of  our ancestral sacred lands.   ``Mexica Tiahui,'' ``Move Forward.''                            ____________________
