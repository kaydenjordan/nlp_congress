 Mr. Speaker, Republicans are planning to vote tomorrow  to pass TrumpCare.   This bill is a great deal for the superrich, it is a great deal for  insurance companies, and it is a great deal for drug companies. But it  is a bad deal for working men and women across our country.   TrumpCare will raise premiums, increase deductibles and out-of-pocket  expenses.   TrumpCare ends coverage for 24 million people.   TrumpCare destroys 2 million jobs.   TrumpCare imposes an age tax on older Americans.   And TrumpCare cuts Medicaid by $880 billion to give corporations and  the wealthiest Americans a $600 billion tax cut--the single largest  transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in history. This is  wrong.   The American people do not want this bill. They don't want to pay  more for less.   Donald Trump promised that he would be a great champion for the  middle class. It only took him 2 months in office to break that promise  and sell out to the wealthy and the special interests. Shame on him and  shame on anyone who votes to take away health coverage from working men  and women to fund a big tax cut for folks who don't need it. The  working people of this country deserve better.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   In a very short number of weeks here in Congress, she has already  made her mark as a passionate advocate not only for her State, but in  this important fight to protect access to affordable, quality health  care, and she has been an extraordinary member of the Judiciary  Committee. It has been an honor to serve with her, and I thank her for  yielding and thank her for her great leadership.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to continue our fight to protect access to  quality, affordable health care and to defeat TrumpCare.   TrumpCare will produce higher costs for our constituents, forcing  families to pay higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher out-of- pocket expenses.   It also will provide less Americans coverage. According to the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 24 million Americans will lose  their health insurance when TrumpCare becomes law.   Thirdly, it imposes a crushing age tax. TrumpCare allows individuals  age 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than others pay for  health care, no matter how healthy they are.   It is higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher out-of-pocket  expenses, 24 million people will lose insurance, older people will pay  an age tax. And TrumpCare, in addition to all of those terrible things,  shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and ransacks  the funds that seniors depend on, particularly, to get their long-term  care. And finally, the best estimates are that it will destroy nearly 2  million jobs in this country if passed.   So why is this happening? Why would someone construct a bill that  does this?   Well, in large part, it is to finance an extraordinarily big tax cut,  a tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country. The richest 400  families will receive a tax cut, each, of about $7 million. Then there  are tax cuts for drug companies, insurance company CEOs.   And to finance this tax cut, which totals $600 billion over the  decade, in order to finance that, this bill robs 24 million Americans  of health insurance, cheats seniors out of the care that they deserve  in nursing homes, imposes higher premiums and higher deductibles on  working families, and imposes a crushing age tax on older Americans.  This is wrong.   And, you know, the President ran on a campaign of helping working  people and being for the middle class. This piece of legislation is a  gift to the richest people in this country and the most powerful  special interests and a betrayal of the promise to work for middle  class and working families.   I want to end, with the indulgence of the gentlewoman from  Washington, you know, we talk about these numbers, and they are  staggering: 24 million, $600 billion. Behind each of those numbers are  real people whose lives will be affected by TrumpCare and by the repeal  of the Affordable Care Act, individuals whose lives will be devastated,  families who will be ruined because they no longer have access to the  care that they need. In the richest, most powerful country in the  world, this does not have to be the case, and I want to give you two  examples.   Just this week I heard from Sara from, Woonsocket, Rhode Island. She  wrote to me:   [[Page H2335]]              I am writing to you to encourage you to vote against the       American Health Care Act proposed by Paul Ryan and the       Republican Party. My brother has developmental disabilities       and relies on Medicaid for insurance.        Experts who have reviewed this bill have determined that it       will ultimately cut funding for people like my brother, but       the working class in this country cannot afford the burden       that this bill would impose. And the wealthiest among us do       not need any more handouts from the Federal Government.        Please vote against this bill.    I had correspondence, again, with another constituent, who talks  about the important services that the ACA provided to her family. She  was heartbroken at the death of her son Anthony who passed away on  August 9 due to an overdose, and she describes Anthony as a  compassionate and deep person who, unfortunately, like many Americans,  suffered from severe anxiety and depression. To deal with his  condition, he started self-medicating with prescription drugs. After  returning home from a sober house, he, unfortunately, relapsed and took  some designer drugs that he had ordered online, causing him to  overdoes.   She called me just this week. Anthony's sister Cara also suffers from  anxiety and depression, in part because of the post-traumatic stress  disorder that she suffered after discovering her brother who had died.  Thanks to the ACA, she is able to receive coverage for critical mental  health services since her mother doesn't have coverage through her  employer.    Like many of my constituents, Cara relies on the coverage she has  gained, and she writes:         I am worried for my future without my support system. The       discontinuation of coverage would be detrimental to our       efforts to combat mental health disorders and the opioid       epidemic which continues to plague families and has been such       a support to my family.    These are just two examples. We have millions of examples all across  this country of people whose lives have been protected and saved and  helped because of access to quality, affordable health care. This will  undo all of that progress. We have to do everything we can to stop it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for leading  this Special Order hour tonight so we can continue to make sure the  voices of the American people are heard and we defeat TrumpCare and  protect access to affordable, quality health care in this country.
