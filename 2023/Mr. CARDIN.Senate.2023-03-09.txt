 Madam President, so many cities and towns across America  have the story of a segment of highway or a railroad track that cuts  ruthlessly through neighborhoods. These neighborhoods may not have been  affluent, but they supported vibrant, tight-knit, supportive  communities with cherished homes, schools, and small businesses.   Backed with Federal funding, these highways and other massive  infrastructure projects tore these neighborhoods apart and left them an  enduring legacy of exclusion and diminished opportunity. To be sure,  these infrastructure projects were intended to serve a purpose, and  they did serve a purpose--transportation, of a particular sort. For  families who could afford a car and a house in the suburbs, highways  were built to whisk people in and out of our urban downtowns, without  regard for the people and the communities remaining in those downtowns.   In the most benign cases, these projects were designed without care  or sensitivity to the people they left behind and excluded. In the  worst cases, the outcome of suppression and exclusion of people of  color was, in fact, deliberate.   It is time to confront our legacy of racism and exclusion in  infrastructure development and promote the next generation of  infrastructure that heals, unifies, and reconnects--an infrastructure  of inclusion, not division.   Thankfully, under President Biden's leadership and the direction of  Congress, we are doing just that. President Biden has affirmed and  reaffirmed his commitment to advancing equity and combating systemic  racism through two Executive orders.   The first Executive order, which was signed on the first day in his  office, said:         The Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive       approach to advancing equity for all, including people of       color and others who have been historically underserved,       marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty       and inequality. Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights,       racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility       of the whole of our Government.    The Executive order he signed just last month acknowledges that we  have so much work to do. It says:         [M]embers of underserved communities--many of whom have       endured generations of discrimination and disinvestment--      still confront significant barriers to realizing the full       promise of our great Nation, and the Federal Government has a       responsibility to remove these barriers.    How to remove these barriers.   These barriers exist in a metaphoric sense, but sometimes they are  concrete--literally. Baltimore City has dealt with the enduring legacy  of its own ``highway to nowhere.'' This project is on the Franklin- Mulberry corridor in West Baltimore. It started as a way to get drivers  out of the city quickly. Although the city never completed the project,  a 1.4-mile stretch of highway contained within a concrete canyon was  built and did irreparable harm to the surrounding communities: 971  homes and 61 businesses were destroyed. The project displaced  approximately 1,500 people, most of them Black. And for decades, the  city has lived with this eyesore and barrier to growth, opportunity,  and connection.   Let me be clear. Removing barriers like highways is not simply about  demolishing or removing infrastructure; it is about building the kind  of infrastructure our cities and communities need--the infrastructure  of connectivity and inclusion.   This means that instead of a highway for fast moving cars--or worse,  an unused highway--in the case of Baltimore's ``highway to nowhere,''  we need to restore neighborhood street grids, parks, sidewalks, and  bike trails--the infrastructure we need to reconnect people with  opportunities, with businesses, with education, and with healthcare.   I am proud that under President Biden's leadership on equity and the  surface transportation title of the bipartisan infrastructure law that  the Committee on Environment and Public Works negotiated, we now have a  Federal program specifically aimed at addressing the legacy of division  and exclusion from past infrastructure projects and supporting a new  and better future for hurt and marginalized communities. The Surface  Transportation Reauthorization Act, which the Environment and Public  Works Committee reported unanimously in May of 2021, includes the  Reconnecting Communities Program, later included in the final  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   I might say I am proud of the role that our Presiding Officer played  in the development of that law, the infrastructure law, as well as  Reconnecting Communities. I was proud to serve on the committee with  our Presiding Officer, and we are pleased to be an integral part in  making sure that legislation got to the President's desk.  [[Page S752]]    When we were negotiating the surface transportation reauthorization  bill, it was not easy to convince everyone that this would be a worthy  program. But just look at the overwhelming need across the country and  the expressions of interest in the first round of grant awards--more  than 350 applications nationwide--that far outpaced the amount of  funding available.   There are so many worthy projects across the country. They never  received enough planning and consideration through the Federal policy  framework that existed prior to President Biden's focus on equity, the  bipartisan infrastructure bill, and Reconnecting Communities.   I think the overwhelming need we are seeing across the country will  strongly support the program's continuation and expansion into one of  the U.S. Department of Transportation's signature initiatives.   Last month, after all the work of developing legislation and enacting  it into law and standing up the program, the Department of  Transportation awarded the very first round of Reconnecting Communities  grants.   I am proud that after all the work on the bipartisan infrastructure  law, Baltimore City was one of the first recipients of the Federal  funding under the Reconnecting Communities Program. Baltimore will  receive a $2 million grant for planning, to which the State of  Maryland, under Governor Moore, is adding $400,000.   This funding is going to start an important process of planning and  engagement with the people of Baltimore to develop a proposal, one that  I hope will move forward in the coming years with Federal support for  the construction of a project of great significance to Baltimore and  its future.   This award for Baltimore and the establishment of the Reconnecting  Communities Program is an important milestone in the history of our  Nation's approach to infrastructure. For far too long, our national  infrastructure policies contributed to tearing down communities while  we built our transportation networks. With the Reconnecting Communities  Program, our Federal infrastructure policy will no longer tear  communities apart. Rather, it must build up, reconnect, and support  them.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
