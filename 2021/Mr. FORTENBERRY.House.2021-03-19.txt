 Madam Speaker, my district in Nebraska is home to  many Native American Tribes, including the Winnebago in the northeast  corner of the State. And it is nestled, Madam Speaker, along the  Missouri River Bottoms at the beginning of the great plains in a  beautiful setting of rolling hills. This Tribal land has been an  integral part of Nebraska's history and culture.   But several decades ago, land belonging to the Winnebago was  appropriated by the Army Corps of Engineers for development. In 1976, a  Federal court found that the United States and the Corps lacked the  authority to take this land through eminent domain.   It is time to make this right. So the Winnebago Land Transfer Act is  an important bill to return to the Winnebago this piece of land.   Hunters will be able to continue to enjoy this prime spot along the  Missouri River through the Winnebago Tribe, Wildlife, and Parks  program.   I am appreciative of the bipartisan effort here of our colleagues,  Darren Soto of Florida, Sharice Davids of Kansas, as well as Randy  Feenstra of Iowa, to once again make this right.                            ____________________
