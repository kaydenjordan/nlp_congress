Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       5933) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require       additional information in disclosures of foreign gifts and       contracts from foreign sources, restrict contracts with       certain foreign entities and foreign countries of concern,       require certain staff and faculty to report foreign gifts and       contracts, and require disclosure of certain foreign       investments within endowments. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or       their respective designees. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.

The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 88) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Department of Education relating to       ``Improving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford       Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family Education       Loan (FFEL) Program''. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce or their respective designees; and (2) one motion       to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Last night, the Rules Committee met and produced a rule, House  Resolution 906, providing for the House's consideration of several  pieces of legislation.   The rule provides for H.R. 4468, the Choice in Automobile Retail  Sales Act, or the CARS Act of 2023, to be considered under a structured  rule. It provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce or their designees and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for two measures related to education: H.R.  5933, the Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes  Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act, or the DETERRENT Act, and H.J.  Res. 88 related to income-driven repayments for educational loans.   H.R. 5933 would be considered under a structured rule with eight  amendments made in order. It provides for 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce or their designees and  provides for one motion to recommit.   Finally, the second education measure to be considered under a closed  rule is H.J. Res. 88, a joint resolution nullifying the final rule  submitted by the Department of Education on income-driven repayment  published on July 10, 2023. It also provides for 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their designees and  provides for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying pieces of legislation, beginning with H.R. 4468, the CARS  Act.   Mr. Speaker, it seems like every week we are here talking about  another bureaucracy under the Biden administration overstepping their  bounds. Again and again, these out-of-control agencies under this  administration are chipping away at our personal freedom.   This time, it is the EPA. Specifically, their proposed new standard  is for two-thirds of all new vehicles to be electric by 2032.   Last night, at the Rules Committee hearing, the bill's sponsor,  Representative Walberg, laid out why this legislation is very clearly  necessary. This misguided EPA rule takes away consumer choice.  Americans should be able to have every option available to them in what  vehicle they choose to drive, specifically because automobiles vary  greatly in both reliability and cost, and consumers have different  wants and needs.   Market demand, not government mandates, should drive this industry.  If nothing else, our colleagues should support this legislation because  it is also not ready for prime time.   Electric vehicles are more expensive. Until the cost comes down, we  shouldn't be forcing these purchases on consumers.   While Americans are experiencing crushing inflation, the  infrastructure needed to support EVs does not exist. This rule  disadvantages rural communities like mine and so many others across the  country.   Mr. Speaker, we all know it is a Biden administration priority to  pour billions into green energy and clean cars. The President even  recently invoked the Defense Production Act, spending $169 million in  green energy handouts for electric heat pumps for water heaters. That  doesn't seem like a top priority to meet the needs of our national  defense.   This EPA rule simply ignores the practicality, cost, and choice for  Americans, and it is wrong.   One doesn't need to look further than Secretary Granholm's recent  failed and taxpayer-funded EV road trip. This PR stunt was ridiculed  for highlighting the shortcomings of EVs rather than their potential  and also resulted in a probe by the House Oversight and Energy and  Commerce Committees.   Most egregiously during this trip, the police were called when  Secretary Granholm's staff blocked a charging station from use by a  Georgia family with an infant in the middle of summer.   It is unbelievable, really, but under President Biden's EPA, this  would be reality for everyone everywhere in America.   In addition, with the forced and accelerated transition to EVs, this  EPA standard prioritizes benefits to China over the needs of the  American people. As we all know, China controls many of the raw  materials necessary for batteries and other components for EVs. By  rushing to meet arbitrary green and climate agendas, the United States  is more likely to solidify China's control of the energy future rather  than save the planet.   Mr. Speaker, we must be measured, trust market forces and American  consumers, and not push top-down and expensive mandates. I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 4468.   Moving on to education, as a member of the Education and the  Workforce Committee, I am glad to see floor consideration of H.R. 5933,  the Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging  in Nefarious Transactions Act, also known as the DETERRENT Act.   This legislation would bring much-needed transparency,  accountability, and clarity to foreign gift reporting requirements for       colleges and universities across the Nation.   I know many of our colleagues share our concerns over foreign  adversaries infiltrating college campuses. Foreign adversaries like the  Chinese Communist Party have been leveraging ties with institutions of  higher education in order to further soft power goals for many years,  including by shaping public narratives, influencing academic curricula,  sowing social divisions, and undermining faith in our public  institutions and our very system of government. It must stop.   While it is clear that global partnerships and academic collaboration  can be beneficial for U.S. students at our universities, it is our  responsibility to carefully monitor foreign partnerships, particularly  with countries of concern, and we must be steadfast in doing so. We  must ensure our adversaries are not given a platform in our classrooms  to work against the United States' values and interests.   The Biden administration doesn't seem to take this responsibility  seriously, though. They have not opened a single new investigation  since taking office.   Just this week, the Department of Education updated their section 117  FAQs. This was their first update to these FAQs since taking office 3  years ago, and it was undoubtedly a result of pressure from our work on  the Education and the Workforce Committee in passing the DETERRENT Act.   Because of the Biden administration's failure on section 117, the  University of Pennsylvania alone took $14 million from unnamed  contributors in China and Hong Kong and $2.4 million from unnamed  contributors in Saudi Arabia since 2021. These amounts are well over  the threshold of concern and are reasons alone to pass the DETERRENT  Act.   Back home in Indiana, our own Valparaiso University was home to a  Confucius Institute. These institutes are funded and arranged by the  People's Republic of China and have raised concerns about improper  influence over teaching, espionage, and undermining Taiwan and its  relationship with the United States. Indiana Attorney General Todd  Rokita investigated this Confucius Institute, and though it has now  been closed, the need for oversight remains.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original supporter of this  legislation, and I urge its passage.   Finally, H.J. Res. 88 is a joint resolution nullifying President  Biden's reckless income-driven repayment plans that would effectively  forgive nearly  [[Page H6122]]  half of the student loan debt and cost taxpayers at least $138 billion  over the next 10 years.   It would be a direct cost to taxpayers because this proposed student  loan debt plan simply transfers the burden of paying these loans away  from student loan borrowers and onto those taxpayers who have chosen  not to go to college.   A 2019 Government Accountability Office report found that 95,100  income-driven repayment plans were held by borrowers who reported zero  income yet earned enough wages to make monthly student loan payments.  Borrowers with these 95,100 income-driven repayment plans owed nearly  $4 billion in outstanding direct loans.   As to their family size, about 40,900 income-driven repayment plans  were approved based on large family sizes of nine or more, which are  atypical for income-driven repayment plans. GAO also found two income- driven repayment plans that were approved in which the borrower  reported a family size of 93. Borrowers with atypical family sizes of  nine or more owed almost $2.1 billion in outstanding direct loans.   Given all of this reported fraud, I have significant concerns with  the Biden administration's income-driven repayment plans.                                time  1230    Since I went to college, tuition and fees have increased almost three  times more than the rate of inflation, many due to subsidized tuition  in the form of grants and loans that are already largely paid by  taxpayers. Student debt in the U.S. is now over $1.6 trillion, with the  average borrower owing over $37,000.   Since 1980, the average cost of college attendance has risen 180  percent. We can't keep writing blank checks to universities,  particularly when many are failing our students and graduation rates  are poor.   We need solutions that will drive down the cost of college. The  income-driven repayment plan doesn't address the root cause of this  issue, and it places an unfair burden on the taxpayer.   I look forward to the consideration of this legislation that will  actually address the underlying issue here, and I urge the passage of  this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to note that Congress has provided $7.5  billion for electric vehicle chargers, and they have built zero so far.   According to this article recently published by Politico, the United  States has around 180,000 chargers today according to the Energy  Department, including 41,000 of the type of chargers that can alleviate  what they are calling range anxiety. They expect that the U.S. will  need 1.2 million public chargers by 2030 to meet the demand, including  182,000 fast chargers.   Again, I would say this rule is not ready for prime time. We don't  even have the vehicle charging stations available, and we don't expect  that if zero have been built, we will meet that demand.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include this article in the  Record.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Moran).    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to note that the  criticism that this bill does nothing to address the spiraling cost of  education is just not true. The cost of higher education always rises  in connection with the availability of student loans.  [[Page H6126]]    Making student loans widely available with government backing has  caused this wild cost increase in higher education, which has increased  4.6 times the rate of inflation since 1971.   Canceling student loan debt will not lead to reductions in the cost  of higher education. It will, instead, likely have the opposite effect,  encouraging colleges and universities to raise tuition and other fees,  knowing full well that the cost of these items will ultimately be borne  by the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, if the  gentleman is prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have before us the opportunity to move legislation  that could have a positive effect on the everyday lives of Americans.  This is not nothing.   Whether it is the overreach of the bureaucratic state or protecting  our colleges and universities from bad actors, the choice before us in  this rule is clear: We must take action.   H.R. 4468, the CARS Act, protects American consumers, protects their  freedom of choice, and does not give China the upper hand in the energy  economy of the future.   We must let market forces work and American ingenuity lead the way,  not pursue mandates and unrealistic green agendas that drive us off a  fiscal cliff and pick winners and losers.   H.R. 5933, the Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue  Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act, or the DETERRENT Act,  takes seriously our responsibility to carefully evaluate foreign  partnerships, particularly with countries of concern.   We must ensure our adversaries are not given a platform within our  classrooms to work against the United States, our values, and our  interests.   H.J. Res. 88, the joint resolution nullifying President Biden's  reckless income-driven repayment plans, will increase rather than  decrease the cost of college. This Biden rule will effectively forgive  nearly half of the student loan debt and cost taxpayers at least $138  billion over the next 10 years. Therefore, it is the responsibility of  Congress to reject this rule as we continue our work to address the  cost of higher education in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to moving these bills out of the House  this week. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the  previous question and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 906 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178:     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  move the previous question on the resolution.
