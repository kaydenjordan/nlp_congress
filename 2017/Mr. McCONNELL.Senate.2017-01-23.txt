 Mr. President, last week, President Trump gave his  first major address to the Nation. The week before, President Obama  gave his last. These are different men. They come from different  parties, but their speeches were more similar than you might think, and  there were some common themes: The world is dangerous, our economy  isn't living up to its potential, Americans are divided, worried about  their futures and don't feel like Washington is listening.   Here is one quote:         Too many families, in inner cities and in rural counties,       have been left behind--the laid-off factory worker; the       waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by       and struggling to pay the bills--convinced that the game is       fixed against them, that their government only serves the       interest of the powerful--that's a recipe for more cynicism       and polarization in our politics.    That was former President Obama at the end of his term. It is obvious  the situation today for many families simply isn't sustainable. As my  friend the Democratic leader said in his speech on inauguration day,  ``We live in a challenging and tumultuous time.'' Our economy, he  cautioned, leaves ``too many behind.'' Our politics, he warned, is  ``consumed by rancor,'' and we face threats ``foreign and domestic.''   Americans are reeling after 8 years of grand promises and diminished  dreams, leftwing experiments and heavy-handed overreach. Small  businesses are literally drowning in regulations, bigger employers, as  well. College graduates are struggling to make it and too often simply  move back in with their parents. The middle class feels under assault,  as kitchen tables pile ever higher with health care bills, energy  bills, and paychecks that fail to keep pace. Americans feel like they  don't have a say in what is happening either.   So let us not underestimate the challenges President Trump is  inheriting. They are indeed formidable. There is a lot to fix, but we  can move forward if we work together. The first thing we have to do is  move beyond this us-and-them mentality that has so often characterized  the last 8 years. Our goal should be to give confidence to everyone,  regardless of race, religion or income, regardless of where someone  lives or whom they voted for. We are all in this together. We rise and  fall as one.   When I applied for the job of majority leader, I vowed to open up the  Senate for a reason. I thought it would give more Americans a voice  again. I thought it would give both sides skin in the game again. I  thought it would bring us closer to durable solutions, and it has--on  education, on transportation, on the fight against cancer, on so many  other issues we passed meaningful legislation that can positively  impact millions. The way we did it was simple--really simple, actually.  We set the slogans aside. We listened to each other. We listened in  good faith. We kept our focus where it truly belonged, on areas where  both sides can agree. Wouldn't you know it, it turns out we actually  agreed on a lot. It turns out we all want to give our kids a better  future, turns out we all want better roads and infrastructure, turns  out we all want a country that is healthy. It seems obvious, but we can  forget these things in the midst of a divisive campaign. We can get  lost in the politics and lose sight of our common humanity.   The campaign is over. The time for governing is upon us, and we face  huge challenges. Many of these issues President Obama sought to solve.  Sometimes his policies moved us forward. More often, they moved us  backward or created new problems altogether. This is not an attack on  the sincerity of his aims. It is a critique of the efficacy of his  means.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we have seen quite clearly over the  last 8 years which policies do not work. We now have the opportunity to  try policies that can work. ObamaCare offers a great example. Democrats  came into office in 2009 with a promise to unify the country and big  majorities that allowed them to ignore half of it. They  [[Page S368]]  made their choice with partisan, highly ideological laws like ObamaCare  that divided us further--and often made things worse. We have seen how  ObamaCare, in particular, has hurt the middle class. Choices are  dwindling, costs are skyrocketing, and too many middle-class families  don't know how much more they can sustain.   This is why we promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and this is  why we will meet our responsibility to do so. ObamaCare came into this  world on a party-line vote and a flurry of Executive actions, and it  can leave the same way. What repeal presents is a fresh canvas where we  can start over with durable, lasting reforms that both parties--if they  choose to engage--can take credit for.   I hope our Democratic friends choose to engage. I hope they join in  the hard work of improving health care for the American people because,  let us remember, this should not be about winning or losing. It isn't  about scoring points. It is about replacing a law that doesn't work  with reforms that can. It is as simple as that. You can hardly accuse  President Trump of being a rigid ideologue. He is interested in health  care that actually works. Americans are interested in health care that  actually works. All of us are.   So we can work together to finally solve big problems like ObamaCare  or we can continue to bludgeon each other election after election. Our  Democratic friends can crank the faux outrage machine up to 10, claim  Republicans are motivated by some desire to make America sick, and get  right back to the Hatfield-and-McCoy routine, but that will not solve  the problem or move us forward. The moment calls for something more.   The question now is whether we have the courage to begin binding our  national wounds. We can fight about the things that divide us forever  or we can take a moment to finally move forward as one country.                            ____________________     One way to begin moving forward is by proceeding with  confirmations without delay, especially when it comes to key national  and economic security nominees.   Tonight we will vote on the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Director  of the CIA. He enjoys overwhelming support to be confirmed, just as we  know that many other Cabinet nominees command sufficient support as  well. So let us confirm them now and never forget the way Republicans  worked with the administration of former President Obama to confirm  seven members of his Cabinet the day he took office and nearly his  entire Cabinet within 2 weeks.   Both parties appear to agree that our economy, our health care, and  our politics need fixing so let us get down to fixing them. Let us join  hands and move forward. The American people are ready for solutions,  and after 8 long years, they are ready for Democrats to work with  Republicans to deliver them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of  James H. ``Jim'' Skaggs, a Louisville resident, who passed away in  December at the age of 94. To his family, his church community, and to  those who knew him, Jim was a man known for his kindness, patience, and  compassion. As a member of this Nation's Greatest Generation, he was an  example of commitment and devotion.   Like so many other brave men and women, Jim answered his country's  call in the Second World War. Kentucky has a proud history of military  service, and Jim is a fine model of that tradition. As a staff sergeant  in the 755th Railway Battalion, U.S. Army Transportation Corps in  England, France, and Belgium, Jim showed the deep passion he held for  his country.   Jim leaves behind a legacy of love and family. His daughter Debbie is  my personal friend and archivist. If it is possible to measure a father  by his daughter, Jim will surpass all standards. She is impressive in  her own right, and she is surely a reflection of him. He will be  remembered fondly. Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to Jim's  family and friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a good  friend and a true Kentucky hero, Robert L. ``Bob'' Williams. Bob, a  northern Kentucky native, passed away in December at the age of 94. He  left behind many loved ones, including his wife, Barbara, but he also  left his mark on our Nation and the Commonwealth.   As a member of the Greatest Generation, Bob answered the call of duty  and bravely served in World War II. On June 6, 1944, he was one of the  first Allied paratroopers to land during the D-day invasion. With his  fellow soldiers, Bob fought well behind enemy lines before the beach  battle began. His mission to secure roads and bridges was vital to the  success of the entire operation.   With uncommon courage, Bob and his comrades completed their dangerous  mission, overcoming enemy fire and capturing the crucial junctures.  Once the invasion began, they continued their fight joining the largest  amphibious assault in world history. Without faltering, Bob heroically  battled for 10 more days, before suffering a serious injury on June 16,  1944.   It is without question that Bob's actions during the war displayed  the highest possible valor. But his actions after the war proved his  dedication to those who lost their lives on the battlefield. He spent  his life after the War commemorating those who served in any way  possible. If there was a parade to march in, you can be sure that Bob  marched in it. To remember the 50th anniversary of the D-day invasion,  Bob joined other veterans and parachuted into Normandy again. In an  interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader, Bob remembered ``[t]he  government said, `There's no way we're going to let you do that, you're  all too old.' [. . .] We did it anyway.''   The following week, TIME magazine published a double-page, full color  picture of Bob. Triumphantly walking away from his 1994 jump with  dozens of parachutes still gliding behind him, Bob looked overjoyed. He  was paying tribute to his comrades, those with him on that day and  those who were not.   To further honor those with whom he served, Bob wrote a book to share  veterans' stories of the war for future generations. He has impacted  countless lives and is someone I very much respect and admire.   In 2013, it was my privilege to recommend Bob for admission to the  Kentucky Veterans Hall of Fame. This honor was a recognition of  something I already knew well: Bob exemplifies the highest American  values of service, self-sacrifice, and heroism.   Bob's family represents the greatest of Kentucky values with  kindness, compassion, and charity. It was easy to see the love between  Bob and his wife, Barbara, and they raised wonderful children in  Barbara, Diane, Jeffrey, Kim, and Kevin. Although they endure the pain  of loss, I know they are comforted in the memory of Bob's deep love for  all of them.   My wife, Elaine, and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of Bob's  [[Page S387]]  passing. He lived an admirable life with courage and devotion, and I am  proud to say he was my friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I join many Kentuckians who were deeply  saddened to hear of the passing of Parker Beam, the master distiller  emeritus of Heaven Hill Distillery in Bardstown, KY. Parker was a giant  of the industry, and he helped promote ``the new Golden Age'' of  bourbon in the United States.   The Beam family is no stranger to bourbon. Tracing its distilling  roots in Kentucky back to 1795, Parker Beam continued the tradition of  his lineage. When he succeeded his father as master distiller, Parker  grew Heaven Hill Distillery with its first premium small batch and  single barrel bourbons. During his long career, Parker won numerous  awards and accolades for his craft and became a charter member in the  Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame.   Parker was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, or Lou  Gehrig's Disease in 2010. Since then, he dedicated himself to finding a  cure and established the Parker Beam Promise of Hope Fund. After 50  years of bourbon and a courageous battle with this disease, Parker  passed away at the age of 75.   Kentucky's bourbon heritage has brought pride, culture, and economic  development to the Commonwealth. Parker Beam helped cultivate that  tradition and pass it on to the next generation. He was a man of skill,  authenticity, and passion, and his legacy will surely live on. Elaine  and I send our condolences to his friends and family.   Mr. President, The Herald-Leader in Lexington, Kentucky published an  article on Parker Beam's career. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Herald-Leader, Jan. 9, 2016]          Parker Beam, Master Distiller of Kentucky Bourbon, Dies                            (By Bruce Schreiner)         Parker Beam, who carried on his family's historic bourbon-      making tradition as longtime master distiller for Kentucky-      based Heaven Hill Distilleries, died Monday after battling       amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's       disease. He was 75.        Beam's career as a whiskey maker spanned more than a half       century at Bardstown, Kentucky-based Heaven Hill, a family       owned and operated distilled spirits company and maker of the       popular Evan Williams brand. Beam was responsible for       distilling and aging Evan Williams--the world's No. 2-selling       bourbon--and other Heaven Hill whiskeys.        ``He was a true industry giant long before the current       bourbon renaissance,'' said Max L. Shapira, president of       Heaven Hill Brands. ``Without question, he was committed to       our industry and possessed a real passion for the craft of       distilling.''        Beam's pedigree as a bourbon maker was impeccable. As a       grandnephew of Jim Beam, Parker Beam was born into a family       that traces its whiskey-making roots in Kentucky to 1795,       when Jacob Beam set up his first still. Park Beam, Parker's       grandfather and namesake, was Jim Beam's brother.        ``If you were a Beam, you sort of were destined to follow       in the footsteps of either your father, grandfathers, cousins       or uncles,'' Parker Beam said in a 2007 interview with The       Associated Press.        Another industry patriarch, Bill Samuels Jr., on Monday       called his longtime friend ``one of the good guys.'' For some       people, living up to a legendary family name can be a burden,       but not so for Parker, Samuels said.        ``In his case, he lived up to and exceeded the burden of       having the most famous name in bourbon,'' said Samuels, who       retired after a long career as the top executive at Maker's       Mark.        During his years-long battle with the disorder, Parker Beam       raised funds in hopes of helping find a cure.        Parker Beam was among a small fraternity of master       distillers who oversaw production at various Kentucky       distilleries during bourbon's revival.        According to a 2014 report by the University of       Louisville's Urban Studies Institute, distilling contributes       $3 billion in gross state product to Kentucky's economy every       year, up from $1.8 billion two years ago. Kentucky bourbon       and Tennessee whiskey exports shot past $1 billion for the       first time in 2013, according to the Distilled Spirits       Council. By 2015, combined U.S. revenues for bourbon,       Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey rose 7.8 percent to $2.9       billion, while bourbon and Tennessee whiskey exports topped       $1 billion for the third straight year, the group said.        Parker Beam began his career at Heaven Hill in 1960 and       learned the craft by working alongside his father, Earl. The       job of master distiller shifted from father to son in 1975       when Parker Beam assumed the role. He developed the company's       first premium small batch and single barrel bourbons.        That father-son partnership extended into another       generation when Parker Beam's son, Craig, started working at       Heaven Hill in the early 1980s. For years, the Beams shared       duties as co-master distillers. Parker Beam had the title of       master distiller emeritus at Heaven Hill at the time of this       death.        ``Parker Beam wasn't just a name on a bottle--he was the       living embodiment of the whiskey inside--authentic, classic,       well-seasoned and distilled from old-fashioned hard work and       gentleman integrity,'' said Eric Gregory, president of the       Kentucky Distillers' Association.        Craig Beam had his own humble start. On one summer break       from school, he cleaned pigeon droppings in a vacant       warehouse purchased by Heaven Hill. He later drove a truck       for the distillery and worked in the bottling operation.        ``I've got a whole lot to live up to with my father and       grandfather,'' Craig Beam told the AP in 2007. ``I've got a       lot of weight on my shoulders.''                            ____________________
