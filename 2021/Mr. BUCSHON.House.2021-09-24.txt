 Madam Speaker, the archbishop of San Francisco said,  ``This proposed legislation is nothing short of child sacrifice.''   The inappropriately named Women's Health Protection Act of 2021 would  codify the ability to obtain abortions for any reason at any point in  pregnancy. This bill would also preempt and repeal State laws that  require informed consent, ultrasounds, or other testing and counseling  before undertaking an elective abortion.   As a practicing heart surgeon for 15 years prior to coming to  Congress, I operated on children as young as 23 weeks gestation, late  second trimester. In fact, the smallest baby I operated on weighed only  650 grams, which is about 1.4 pounds.   I spent my career in medicine caring for patients regardless of their  situation, so I take access to healthcare very seriously. I can assure  you that my tiny patients were people.   I find it troubling that those on the other side, most of whom have  never spent a day taking care of patients, continue to mislead the  American people about what constitutes healthcare.   The archbishop also said, ``A child is not an object to be thrown  away.'' Vote against this bill.
