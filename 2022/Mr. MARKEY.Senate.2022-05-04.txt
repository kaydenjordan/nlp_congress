 Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote no  on this motion to instruct from Senator Barrasso.   If we want to talk solutions to the energy price crisis, if we want  to talk solutions to the climate crisis, we have bills to do that.   Our Federal oil and gas leasing programs include critical State and  public involvement that this amendment is attempting to undercut and  sabotage and to try to weaponize this bill in order to have the hope of  prompting yet another giveaway for oil and gas companies, which is not  going to do a thing to help the American people or the American  economy.   Oil and gas companies already have more than 1,500 offshore leases  that they are not currently using, encompassing a swath of ocean larger  than the entire State of Maryland. The top 25 oil and gas companies  posted $237 billion in record profits last year, which they should be  using, if they want, to drill there, but they are not doing it.   So we need to focus on delivering clean energy, efficient solutions  to communities, not undercutting Federal processes and giving more  handouts to Big Oil.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.                                Vote on Motion
