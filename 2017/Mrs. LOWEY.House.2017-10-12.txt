 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, since Hurricane Harvey wrought historic flooding in  Texas, 12 major disasters have been declared. From a hurricane that  damaged large swaths of Florida, storms that annihilated Puerto Rico  and the Virgin Islands, and wildfires burning in the West, Americans  deserve certainty the Federal Government will stand by them in their  time of need. This is particularly important after the President  threatened to abandon Puerto Rico in his latest Twitter this morning.   Congress cannot turn its back on recovery, no matter how reckless the  President's outburst may be, as Americans are suffering and simply  trying to survive. This package provides critical disaster relief,  flood insurance aid, and help for communities devastated by wildfires.    Puerto Rico would be aided by provisions to address its liquidity  crisis by facilitating recovery, not paying creditors, and providing  additional nutrition assistance. Additionally, the bill would continue  aid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from the Department of  Defense.   However, more must be done to provide medium- and long-term  investments, including rebuilding ports, coastlines, airports, roads,  bridges, repairing the electrical grid and other infrastructure, and  ensuring the health needs of American citizens are met.   I urge your support for this bill and your continued focus on  ensuring the full recovery of American communities devastated by  natural disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), the distinguished ranking member of the Commerce,  Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee.   (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the ranking member of  the Homeland Security Subcommittee.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, the past few months have witnessed  one of the most devastating natural disasters ever endured by our  country. They include hurricanes, voracious wildfires in my home State  of California that have killed at least 23 people, required mass  evacuations, and burned more than 170,000 acres and thousands of homes  and businesses.   By acting quickly on this emergency supplemental, we are sending a  strong message that we are here for disaster victims, including our  fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But this is  just a downpayment. We still don't have the final damage estimates for  many of the affected areas.   In the coming weeks and months, we will need to once again support  FEMA's continued recovery efforts, including in Puerto Rico, despite  the President's threats to abandon the people there. There will be more  to do to address unmet needs through the Community Development Block  Grant program and other disaster relief programs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this funding package.  This bill is a downpayment on the recovery from the recent fires and  hurricanes.   I am pleased that it contains $576.5 million to fully repay the funds  that the U.S. Forest Service borrowed last fiscal year to pay for  wildfire suppression. We have all seen the devastation and the tragic  loss of life from large fires burning across our country.   Fiscal year 2017 was the most expensive year on record for wildfire  suppression, costing $2.4 billion. As the duration and severity of  wildfires grows, costs will continue to rise.   Unfortunately, once again we have missed the opportunity to fix the  way the Federal Government funds wildfire suppression.   Let me be clear: the next supplemental must include a legislative fix  for wildfire spending, and it must adequately support the Department of  the Interior and its vital efforts to help our country rebuild from the  recent fires and hurricanes.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking  member of the Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, let me just start by saying to  the people of Puerto Rico: Despite President Trump's indifference and  soft bigotry, we will be there for the people of Puerto Rico until the  last American's life returns to normal.   While I rise to support this critical emergency appropriations bill,  this supplemental leaves much to be desired. This legislation provides  vital recovery funds to my home State of Florida, as well as Texas; the  U.S. Virgin Islands; Puerto Rico; and California, where wildfires  remain ablaze. However, it neglects to include SBA loans for small  businesses and homeowners, as well as making smart investments in our  ports, coastlines, water systems, and electrical grids.   This bill also neglects to address the devastating agricultural  losses, especially to Florida's $10 billion citrus industry. It is also  important to note that, in Florida, this vital funding will not be able  to address the public health hazard of debris strewn across our  [[Page H7995]]  lawns and streets as Governor Scott shamefully refuses to allow our  cities to fully access FEMA funds.   While the majority has said these and other issues can be part of  future omnibus negotiations, this delay will leave constituents waiting  months longer to receive the services they so desperately need. They  should not have to wait.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico has no power. The U.S.  Virgin Islands has no power. St. Johns is completely collapsed in the  U.S. Virgin Islands. The people are dying from contaminated water.   Mr. President, how can you abandon the American people?   This bill is going to provide FEMA assistance to keep giving so they  can have it. It is going to give $16 billion to the senior citizens in  my district, who have paid their flood insurance, who are desperate to  get their houses repaired, to get the mold out after being impacted by  Hurricane Harvey.   Yes, I woke up this morning to the outrage of the fires and people  dying in California. That is what is in this bill.   I can't imagine that a President would make this comment of walking  away, but I am here to fight for those who have been impacted by  Hurricane Harvey. We are still suffering. Senior citizens are out of  their homes. We have been evicting people in public housing. We need  community development block grants. The Army Corps of Engineers is  greatly needed.   The funding that we ask for is not in here, block grants is not in  here, and as well the restoration that we need. We will fight. I will  not turn my back on Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands and vote ``no''.  I will vote ``yes''----   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is out of order.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. And help Americans, but Hurricane Harvey has to be  in the next bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer recognized.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. * * *   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to heed the gavel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who I believe just returned.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Committee on  Financial Services.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the  destruction that this historic hurricane season has wrought on Texas,  Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf Coast, I am very  pleased that, in addition to the emergency relief funds for wildfires  that are burning on both ends of California, the bill also includes  liquidity and emergency nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico, where  they are facing particularly difficult challenges in their recovery  efforts. This bill also provides for partial debt forgiveness of $16  billion for the National Flood Insurance Program.   I am encouraged to see that the administration finally understands  what we have been saying for a long time: we need to forgive the debt  of the NFIP, which FEMA has repeatedly stated it will never be able to  repay.   Following the losses that will be incurred as a result of the recent  hurricanes, the NFIP needs debt forgiveness more than ever. But let's  be clear. The partial debt forgiveness will leave the NFIP with a  crushing level of debt. Although this is a step in the right direction,  we should forgive all of the debt that the NFIP has accrued from  catastrophic storms like Katrina and Sandy instead of burdening the  NFIP policyholders with hundreds of millions of dollars in interest  payments every year.  [[Page H7997]]    Before this hurricane season, NFIP policyholders were already paying  more in interest than the entire NFIP spends on salaries and expenses  or funding mitigation or paying for flood maps.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my partner, our  chairman, Mr. Frelinghuysen. I know that he understands, as we all do,  this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This is our  responsibility, to face the tremendous challenge that we see: people  are suffering, schools are closed, more than three-quarters of the  island does not have any energy, no clean water, need for food, need  for basic services.   I am very pleased to work with the chairman of the committee, Mr.  Frelinghuysen, and I know that we will both be going to the island of  Puerto Rico to actually see firsthand what has to be done, and it is  clear it has to be done now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
