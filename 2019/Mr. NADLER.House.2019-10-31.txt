 Madam Speaker, I support this resolution because it is  the solemn duty of the Congress to investigate the serious allegations  against the President.  [[Page H8693]]    I support this resolution because it is indefensible for any official  to demand an ally--one depending on our support in an existential  struggle with Russia--investigate his or her political adversaries.   I support this resolution because no person, Republican or Democrat,  should be permitted to jeopardize America's security and reputation for  self-serving political purposes.   I support this resolution because if, after a fair and thorough  inquiry, the allegations against President Trump are found to be true,  they would represent a profound offense against the Constitution and  the people of this country.   I support this resolution because I believe it is the duty of this  House to vindicate the Constitution and to make it crystal clear to  future Presidents that such conduct, if proven, is an affront to the  great public trust placed in him or her.   I support this resolution, not because I want the allegations to be  true--they sadden me deeply--but because, if they are true, the  Constitution demands that we take action.   I support this resolution because it lays the groundwork for open  hearings. The House and the American public must see all of the  evidence for themselves.   I support this resolution because I know we must overcome this  difficult moment for the Nation. This resolution is necessary to ensure  that our constitutional order remains intact for future generations.   I support this resolution because we have no choice.
