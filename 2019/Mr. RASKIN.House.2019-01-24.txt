 Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Pingree and Mr. Perlmutter for  their leadership.   I welcome all questions from you guys and any other colleagues here,  and from any Republicans present. Anybody who wants to pose a question  to me, I am all for it.   Madam Speaker, Lara Trump, who is President Trump's daughter-in-law  and  [[Page H1200]]  re-election campaign adviser, recently had a message for the furloughed  workers and people working without pay. It will all be worth it, she  assures us. ``Listen, it's not fair to you, and we all get that; but  this is so much bigger than any one person,'' she said in an interview  with ``Bold TV''. ``It is a little bit of pain, but it's going to be  for the future of our country.''   No, this is not a little bit of pain. A little bit of pain is losing  your earring at the White House Christmas party. That is a little bit  of pain.   This is a lot of pain that the American people are experiencing right  now. It is day 34, and tens of thousands of my constituents are  suffering because of the shutdown. Military veteran air traffic  controllers in Frederick County are being forced to work with no pay,  and having to borrow money from their kids' 529 college accounts, with  a 10 percent penalty, in order to put food on the table and to pay  their mortgage.   FDA workers living in Bethesda sent home from the job with no pay,  when they are supposed to be keeping our food supply safe from E. coli,  salmonella and insect infestation.   Dozens of scientists, researchers, secretaries, technicians, park  rangers, IT workers, all thrust into a nightmare of closed offices,  closed daycare, no gross pay, no net pay, and a suffering economy.   There are thousands of private contract employees in my district,  Madam Speaker, who have not earned a dollar in a month, and they are  never going to get repaid for it.   There are Uber drivers telling me they are making one-third of what  they usually make because our regional economy is depressed in  Maryland, Virginia, and D.C., because of the government shutdown. And  we know that that is symptomatic of what is going on across the  country, because more than 80 percent of Federal workers don't live in  the national capital region.   One of my constituents has been a Federal employee for 27 years,  first in the Interior Department, and then in the National Park  Service, who says: ``This is the first time that I've had to question  whether I made the right choice in public service, and the first time  I've had to reach into my retirement funds to make sure that my wife  and I can pay our bills as they come due this week and next.''   He describes fellow Park Service employees living lives of quiet  desperation. And of course they would be, because they are being  maligned and typecast by the President of the United States, who  derides all of the Federal workers as Democrats. He says they're all  Democrats.   Well, first of all, it is not true. But what difference does it make?  They are Americans.   We used to have Presidents of the United States who stood with all  Americans, not with those from a particular political party, not just  with those who agreed with the President or showed blind loyalty to the  President. We used to have Presidents who were loyal to the American  people and to our Constitution.   ``All are suffering,'' my constituent writes, ``mostly silently, not  looking for pity, but just for Congress and the White House to do their  job.''   Now, we might think this shutdown is some kind of freak outburst by  an admittedly erratic and impetuous President. But, Madam Speaker, I  represent tens of thousands of Federal workers, and I am afraid that  there is a method to this madness, and I know what it is; because I was  there in January 2017 when the President issued an executive order  freezing all Federal hiring, demoralizing, and even crippling agencies  throughout our government.   I was there when they adopted, in January of 2017, the Holman Rule,  giving Congress the power to reduce Federal workers' salaries, and even  abolish their positions, simply by slipping riders into appropriations  bills.   I watched them try to ban the use of the words ``climate change'' by  Federal scientists in official documents. And I saw them propose  hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Federal workers' wages and  health benefits.   I saw the President, in September of last year, announce his decision  to rescind modest, across-the-board, statutory pay increases and  locality pay increases of 1.9 percent for the Federal workforce. And I  have watched them try to bust the Federal worker unions by making it  easier to fire Federal employees and trying to undo the existing  collective bargaining contracts, a series of moves that were fought by  the AFGE and NTEU and were finally reversed in court.   Madam Speaker, the original political philosopher of this  administration, Steve Bannon, told us very clearly what was the  principal and overriding political aim of this administration when he  essentially declared war on our government and its workforce.   He stated at the outset of the administration that the new  administration is in an unending battle for a deconstruction of the  administrative state. ``Every day it is going to be a fight,'' he said.  And by the administrative state, he means my constituents, who are  working to protect our air, protect our water, protect our planet and  the climate at the EPA, at NOAA, and throughout the Federal Government.   He means the civil servants at the Department of Justice who are  prosecuting mobsters and white collar criminals; the IRS agents who are  trying to catch tax scofflaws and collect money so we have a  government.   He means the people at NOAA who are trying to save us from the  horrors of ocean acidification, the collapse of the glaciers, and the  cataclysmic weather events that have overtaken us in the age of global  warming.   He means the hardworking scientists and researchers at the NIH who  are working to cure colon cancer and breast cancer, cystic fibrosis,  and multiple sclerosis, and even malignant narcissistic personality  disorder.   Madam Speaker, does America recognize what is happening to us? We  have a President who has essentially declared war on our own  government, on our own civil servants. This is a complete betrayal of  the oath of office. He is sworn to uphold and defend the law, not to  frustrate and thwart it.   The first paragraph of the Constitution creates a covenant to form a  more perfect union, but the President has given us the longest shutdown  in American history. He is driving a wedge through the union.   To establish justice. But they have defunded the Department of  Justice.   To ensure domestic tranquility, but the Department of Homeland  Security is not being funded and our Border Patrol agents are being  forced to work with no pay.   To provide for the common defense, but our Coast Guard officers have  been held hostage, along with the rest of the Federal workforce.   To promote the general welfare, but 800,000 Federal workers are being  forced to work with no pay, or sent home from jobs that the American  people desperately want them to do.   And to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our  posterity, but, instead, we are now threatening to bequeath to our  children a dysfunctional government, degraded regulatory capacity to  clean our air and water, a chaotic and unequal economy, and a  comprehensive climate disaster.   And who wins? Who benefits? Who profits from it?   Well, we know it is not the American people. The overwhelming number  of American people in every poll says open up the government right now.  Put the Federal workers back to work.   And it is not the Federal workforce, which has been put through hell  over the last month. It is not the business community, which is  suffering. It is none of us who are benefiting, because the whole  economy is hurting.   But Donald Trump has a profound admiration for autocrats and  kleptocrats, tyrants and dictators all over the world. Putin in Russia,  Orban in Hungary, Duterte in the Philippines, the homicidal Crown  Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. All of these are the  heroes of the President, and it must be a delicious sight for them to  see as the President dismantles the government of our own country.   They don't shut down the government in Russia. They are not shutting  down the government in Hungary. They are not shutting down the  government in the Philippines, but he has shut down our own government.   Who wins? Who benefits from this outrageous and scandalous offense  against America?  [[Page H1201]]    Well, it is not a partisan issue. I think the American people are  increasingly unified every day against this horror.   And now we had the first great Republican President, Abraham Lincoln,  who unified America by working to save the Union and defend the  government.   And now we have got a Republican President who is driving a wedge  through the Union, and has closed the government down. Will that be his  legacy? Will this disgraceful offense against our Constitution and  government be the legacy of this President? Or will, somehow, someone  get to the President and tell him that our people are hurting? It is  not a little bit of pain.                                time  1745    And I know they can't understand why Federal workers are going to  food banks. Then they should come on out to the food banks. I invite  them to come join me at the food banks in my district where I have been  going. You will meet lots of Federal workers and their families there,  because in this economy there are a lot of people who are living from  paycheck to paycheck, and tomorrow, that is two paychecks that people  have missed, and they have missed them in the course of not doing the  jobs that America needs them to do.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Pingree for yielding this time,  and I just urge all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and  the President to please let America get back to work, and to open the  government immediately.
