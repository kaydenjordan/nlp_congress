 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 1-year  anniversary of President Biden's inauguration and 1 year under one- party rule.   And I ask: Is America better off? The answer is no.   Since President Biden took office, we have seen crisis after crisis.   We are facing an economic crisis. President Biden and the Democrats  had the tools to bring our economy back to the prepandemic records of  2019. But instead, we have massive supply shortages, labor shortages,  and an inflation rate that has reached a 40-year high.   Our country faces an energy crisis. We went from being energy  independent to begging OPEC+ to produce more oil to offset the rising  costs. This is because of anti-American energy policies enacted over  the past year.   Mr. Speaker, the list goes on: an education crisis as our youth  continue to face uncertainty in the classroom; a national security  crisis as our presence on the world stage has been weakened and our  southern border remains vulnerable; and a crime crisis following  dangerous defund the police rhetoric.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the leadership America needs right now. In  fact, it is far from it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today during this  Special Order to reaffirm my commitment to protect and defend the  sanctity of life.   From the moment I stepped foot into this Chamber in 2009, I submitted  my promise to protect our most vulnerable, the unborn. In this Congress  I have cosponsored 11 bills and signed on to eight letters relating to  pro-life policies.   Our Founders enshrined in the Declaration of Independence three  unalienable rights. The first is the right to life. Sadly, from the  moment of the Roe v. Wade decision, the basic  [[Page H283]]  right to life has been denied to more than 60 million unborn children.  We don't know what those children would have grown up to do. Perhaps  they would have cured cancer, found a solution to Alzheimer's. The  possibilities are endless with the loss of those lives.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with so many of my colleagues. We  know that there is hope on the horizon. The life movement is strong,  and I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of pro-life  policies. It is my hope that one day those unalienable rights will  extend to all Americans born and unborn. It is my prayer that this will  be the last march for life with Roe v. Wade being the law of the land.  When we march next year, it will be in celebration for what we have  accomplished for the protection of the unborn.
