 The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims  commemorates the millions of people killed and injured on the world's  roads. It is also a day to thank emergency services for their role in  saving lives; to reflect on the impact of road deaths on families and  communities; and to draw attention to the need for improved  legislation, awareness, infrastructure, technology, and post-crash  responses to save more families from the tragedy of losing a loved one.   The theme of this year's World Day of Remembrance is ``2020 Target:  Reduce Road Fatalities and Serious Injuries by 50%.'' It refers to the  UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 which calls on governments and  their stakeholders, including NGOs and private citizens, to address the  personal, medical, and financial burden that road deaths and injuries  cause; 1.25 million people die from road crashes every year, and tens  of millions are seriously injured. Road traffic crashes are the No. 1  killer of young people aged 15 to 29 and the eighth leading cause of  death among all people worldwide.   Rochelle Sobel, president of the Association for Safe International  Road Travel, said, ``The World Day of Remembrance is an important  opportunity to stand together with the global community to commemorate  road victims and call for an end to the crisis on our roads. No one  should have to go through the needless, preventable loss of a child, a  brother, a mother, a friend, killed in a road traffic crash. This  year's theme to reduce the number of deaths by 50% by 2020, reminds us  of the need to drive responsibly, educate our children, and advocate  with our governments to implement and enforce policies that will  protect road users and prevent more families from suffering the pain of  losing a loved one on the road.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Chesapeake  Bay Farm Bill Enhancements Act of 2017 to accelerate our efforts to  restore the health of one of America's greatest natural treasures--the  Chesapeake Bay. This legislation will strengthen our Bay clean-up  program by increasing and better targeting resources under the Regional  Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), which is administered by the  Department of Agriculture (USDA).   I have long advocated for more effective protection, preservation,  and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. During the development of the  Farm Bill of 2008, I worked with my colleagues to adopt the Chesapeake  Bay Watershed Initiative, which provided assistance to farmers to help  them prevent the excessive runoff of nutrients and sediments into the  Bay and its tributaries. As a result of that initiative, about $50  million was invested annually in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.   In the 2014 Farm Bill, the RCPP was established to expand the  successful concept of the Chesapeake Bay Initiative to our vital  watersheds in the country. The goal of RCPP is to encourage  stakeholders to partner with agricultural producers to increase the  restoration and sustainable use of soil, water, wildlife and related  natural resources on regional or watershed scales.   Mr. President, while very successful nationally, the overall  investment in Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts through the RCPP has  been reduced relative to investments that were made under the stand- alone Chesapeake Bay Watershed Initiative. That is why today I am  introducing the Chesapeake Bay Farm Bill Enhancements Act to make  refinements to the RCPP in order to improve conservation efforts in the  Chesapeake Bay--and other vital watersheds--through providing  additional funding, bolstering the role of critical conservation areas,  and improving technical assistance.   On funding, this bill will triple the amount of mandatory funding for  RCPP available per fiscal year from $100 million to $300 million. The  bill also allows in-kind support to count towards a partner's matching  contribution to a project.   The Chesapeake Bay has already been designated as a Critical  Conservation Area under the RCPP. However, my bill will make  refinements to the requirements for partnership agreements awarded  within Critical Conservation Areas that recognize key  [[Page S7299]]  strengths of the Chesapeake Bay region. For example, the bill will  strengthen the definitions of a critical conservation area to include  critical conservation conditions that would improve water quality and  water quantity. Furthermore, the bill adds a prioritization for  partnership agreement applications that implement the project  consistent with multi-State watershed restoration plans and bring  together a diverse array of stakeholders into a project.   I have heard from many organizations in my state and others states in  the Bay watershed that there is a significant need for better technical  assistance to better implement the RCPP. Therefore, my bill authorizes  the USDA to advance reasonable amounts of funding to eligible partners  for technical assistance. Also, the bill allows the USDA to provide  written feedback to applicants throughout the application process on  how the proposals can be improved.   Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in introducing the bill by  Senator Cardin, a long-time supporter of the Chesapeake Bay. My other  Bay state colleagues, Senators Capito, Kaine, Casey, Manchin, Warner,  Carper, Coons and Gillibrand are also original cosponsors of the  Chesapeake Bay Farm Bill Enhancements Act. My former colleague  Congressman Bobby Scott is introducing a companion measure in the House  of Representatives. Furthermore, I am grateful that this bill has the  support of Maryland Governor Hogan, 4 other Governors within the  Chesapeake Bay Watershed, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and  the Chesapeake Bay Commission. This bill is also supported by over 70  organizations such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and Choose Clean  Water. Together, I look forward to working together to see the  inclusion of this important legislation in the next Farm Bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. RISCH:   S. 2140. A bill to provide for an exchange of Federal land and non- Federal land in the State of Idaho, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
