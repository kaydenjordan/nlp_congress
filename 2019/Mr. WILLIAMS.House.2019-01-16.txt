 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  crisis on the southern border. I stand with the President and my  colleagues in the House and Senate in their calls for securing our  southern border.   As the former secretary of state of Texas, I was the chief liaison  for the Texas Border and Mexican Affairs. My experience in that role  taught me that our border was vulnerable, and, sadly, that remains true  today.   While I was Texas' secretary of state and now as the representative  for Texas' 25th District, I am encouraged by all that our Border Patrol  and Federal law enforcement agents do to protect this great Nation.  However, I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have abandoned reason and asked these patriots to do more with  less.  [[Page H615]]    The Federal Government should provide all resources necessary to  secure our border, not make it more vulnerable. Our agents need more  boots on the ground, more advanced technology, and, ultimately, a  barrier to keep those who may not want to do the right thing out.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  come back to the table, negotiate in good faith, reopen our government,  and protect the sovereignty of the United States of America.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
