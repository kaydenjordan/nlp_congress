 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's erratic trade policies,  including abrupt tweets on new tariffs or exemptions, are hurting  American workers and making it harder for American businesses to  compete.   Last week, I had the opportunity to visit eight businesses in my  district to better understand the impact of these tariffs. While each  business was distinct, all shared a common message: Tariffs are  creating uncertainty, raising the cost of doing business, and making it  harder to hire and expand.   These concerns were true across the businesses I visited, from a  large manufacturer in Wheeling that saw a 30 percent to 40 percent  increase in the price of domestic steel, to an educational toy and game  company in Vernon Hills that had to redesign upcoming products.   We certainly must hold bad actors who take advantage of trade rules  to account, but President Trump's tariffs on our allies are not working  for the American people. It is time, instead, to strategically engage  with our trade partners; end the misguided trade wars; and, instead,  enact sensible, enforceable trade agreements that support American  workers, American businesses, American intellectual property, and our  environment.                            ____________________
