 I thank the Presiding Officer for covering the presiding  Chair for a little longer than usual to allow me to make an address to  the Senate.   Madam President, I rise because it is time for the Senate to stand on  the side of protecting our very democracy and the freedom to vote.   You know, this used to be a bipartisan issue, and I was proud to  know, in the history of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it passed the  Senate 77 to 19. Then, in 1982, when it was reauthorized, when we  extended it, President Reagan said:         I've pledged that, as long as I'm in a position to uphold       the Constitution, no barrier will come between our citizens       and the voting booth. And this bill is a vital part of       fulfilling that pledge.    When I served in the House of Representatives, the dean of the  Wisconsin delegation, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican,  led the bipartisan effort for the Voting Rights Act  [[Page S307]]  Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. You know, today, we can't  even get a vote in the Senate on the Voting Rights Act.   Why have today's Republicans walked so far from those who came before  them?   There is a simple answer: Too many of my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle refuse to stand up for democracy and, instead, choose to  stand on the side of Donald Trump and his Big Lie about the 2020  election being stolen from him.   It wasn't. Trump lost fair and square, and President Biden won, and  that is simply a fact. To suggest otherwise is a fraud that undermines  people's faith in our very elections. Enough is enough. We must act. We  have the responsibility to do so. The threat posed by this Big Lie is  all too real, and in my home State of Wisconsin, we have a stark  example of it.   I come from a purple swing State. We have had many, many closely  decided elections in recent history. In 2000, then-Vice President Gore  won the State by less than 6,000 votes--a mere .22-percent margin of  victory. Four years later, John Kerry carried the State by about 11,000  votes--a .38-percent margin. In both cases, despite these narrow  margins, those elections went smoothly and were fair. Their outcomes  were not disputed. George W. Bush declined to request a recount. No  credible person, let alone the leader of a political party or an  elected official, claimed the election in Wisconsin wasn't fair, free,  and properly decided by the voters. Once again, in 2016, we had a  pretty close Presidential election in Wisconsin and another equally as  close one in 2020. President Biden won Wisconsin by about 20,000  votes--a margin of victory of .63 percent.   In 2020, Wisconsinites exercised their right to vote in record  numbers. More than 75 percent of eligible Wisconsinites voted.  Wisconsin voters broke the record for the highest turnout ever measured  in the State--with every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties producing an  increase in turnout, benefiting both Presidential candidates. Wisconsin  State and local officials and citizens who volunteered from both  political parties did heroic work to ensure our election was smooth,  safe, and fair. They took important steps to make our election system  worked safely and securely for all voters while the COVID-19 pandemic  raged in my home State.   Wisconsinites cast their ballots for Democrats and Republicans, up  and down the ballot, and after Wisconsin county clerks in all 72  counties canvassed the results, Joe Biden won with a margin of over  20,000 votes. The voters of Wisconsin chose Joe Biden and Kamala Harris  to receive our State's 10 certified electoral votes, but the scrutiny  of those election results, through the channels provided by law,  continue.   After an official vote count showed Trump lost, his campaign  requested a recount and targeted Wisconsin's two most diverse  counties--Milwaukee and Dane. When the recount was completed, it came  to nobody's surprise that it didn't change the outcome. Trump lost, and  President Biden won. The votes had been counted and recounted, but that  did not stop President Trump from filing a lawsuit, trying to throw out  220,000 legal votes in Wisconsin.   Fortunately, our State's highest court rejected this attempt to  disenfranchise Wisconsin voters and find more votes for himself. As two  Wisconsin Supreme Court justices wrote, in concurring with the majority  decision of dismissing Trump's campaign case, ``The evidence does show  that, despite a global pandemic, more than 3.2 million Wisconsinites  performed their civic duty. More importantly, as it relates to this  lawsuit, these voters followed the rules that were in place at the  time.''   To borrow Justice Hagedorn's metaphor, ``Wisconsin voters complied  with the election rule book. No penalties were committed, and the final  score was the result of a free and fair election.''   But that wasn't the end of the road for Republican efforts to sow  distrust in the 2020 results in Wisconsin.    In February 2021, a committee of the Republican-controlled Wisconsin  State legislature, by a party-line vote, directed the nonpartisan  Legislative Audit Bureau to review the administration of the 2020  election. The bureau, according to its report, spoke with the staff of  the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission and surveyed all 1,835  municipal clerks and 72 county clerks in the State. They also reviewed  a host of records regarding the election, including a total of 45 sworn  complaints, pertaining to the election, that had been filed with the  elections commission. In October, the bureau issued its report, which  did not find any evidence of widespread voter fraud or wrongdoing in  the election.   Separately, a conservative think tank, the Wisconsin Institute for  Law and Liberty, conducted its own review of the election. Their  report, released in December 2021, also concluded that there was no  evidence of widespread voter fraud in Wisconsin.   The fact is that our bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission  conducted a free, fair, safe, and secure election, just as local  elections clerks did across our State.   Trump has still not provided any credible evidence of voter fraud or  election irregularities. In fact, Federal judges appointed by Trump  rejected on the merits his false claims about the Wisconsin election.  Despite all of this, the Republican leadership of the Wisconsin  legislature authorized yet another sham process to question the  integrity of the 2020 election, with a budget of at least 680,000 of  Wisconsin taxpayer dollars to boot.   I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this unnecessary  partisan charade came shortly after the former President called out  these Republican leaders by name for trying to prevent a forensic audit  of the election results. This was no mere coincidence. A Wisconsin  State Republican named Michael Gableman led this effort after he  famously said--and without evidence--right after the November election,  that it was somehow stolen. He is who is leading this probe.   In August, Gableman traveled to Arizona, on Wisconsin taxpayers'  dime, to learn about that State's widely discredited audit, supported  by the cyber ninjas.   Then he was off to South Dakota to attend a symposium on voter fraud,  led by My Pillow's chief executive and infamous conspiracy theorist,  Mike Lindell. In no effort to show nonpartisanship or to be a neutral  arbiter, Gableman hired partisan actors like a former Trump  administration official and the head of a group that asked the Supreme  Court to throw out the results of Wisconsin's election and force the  Wisconsin legislature to certify electors instead.   Gableman has issued wide-ranging subpoenas to local officials in  Wisconsin's largest cities and has even threatened to jail them if they  fail to comply with this taxpayer-funded promotion of Trump's Big Lie.   Separately, the Republican leader of the Wisconsin Assembly's  elections committee began her own set of investigations, issuing  subpoenas to clerks in Milwaukee and Brown Counties, the latter being  home to Green Bay. She had also traveled to Arizona and, in a press  release, when announcing her inquiries, stated that Wisconsin similarly  needs a ``transparent, full, cyber-forensic audit.''   To put it simply, there has been a constant drumbeat undermining the  integrity of our elections in Wisconsin since President Biden was duly  elected. Casting doubt and undermining confidence in our elections has  real consequences. It has led to harassment and threats of the hard- working State and local elections officials who worked tirelessly  during an unprecedented public health crisis to make sure Wisconsinites  could safely and securely exercise their right to vote. Elections  officials across the State have received dangerous threats and  harassment for simply doing their jobs.   The executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission reported  being told she deserved to be hung in the public square. She received a  threatening letter at her home, calling her a traitor and a profane  insult that I will not repeat on the floor of the Senate. She also  received a profanity-laced voice mail, telling her she should be  convicted and hanged.   Another Wisconsin clerk reported being called every name you can  imagine and received threats that led to a local police department's  having to conduct a security review of the clerk's office and having  the clerk feeling the  [[Page S308]]  need to install a camera at her house for security.   In Rock County, WI, the county clerk's office asked the local sheriff  for protection in the wake of angry calls after a news report had  misstated the county's votes. One of the members of the Wisconsin  Elections Commission had pictures of her home posted on social media,  and she received threatening messages about her children.   Even elected officials are attacking the role of these individuals in  administering our elections. A Republican sheriff has called for the  five members of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to face  criminal charges for guidance they provided during the pandemic about  collecting absentee ballots from nursing homes.   Let's be clear. On January 6, 2021, Donald Trump not only incited a  violent insurrection against our democracy, he also incited an ongoing  attack on voting rights across America. Across the country, we have  seen more than 400 bills that restrict access to voting that have been  introduced in 49 States.   In Wisconsin, the Republican-controlled State legislature has  advanced legislation curtailing voting rights and has put up barriers  to make it harder to vote. Last year, they passed measures that would  make it harder for voters to turn in their absentee ballots. They have  passed legislation that threaten election officials with felonies for  assisting voters with minor issues on their ballots, and they want to  make it harder for people with disabilities and who cannot make it into  the polls to exercise their right to vote. Thankfully, our Wisconsin  Governor has vetoed these measures.   Despite drop boxes being a safe, secure, and effective way for voters  to turn in their ballots and have their votes counted and despite  previous support for their use from Republicans in the State  legislature, Trump's Big Lie has pushed them to now oppose the use of  drop boxes statewide. In fact, there is now a push to override guidance  from the Wisconsin Elections Commission to make drop boxes for legal  ballots illegal in Wisconsin.    At the same time, the Republicans in the State legislature are  advancing a redistricting proposal that will double down on Wisconsin's  unprecedented level of hyperpartisan gerrymandering, where politicians  pick their voters instead of people choosing their elected officials.   Not to be outdone, the New York Times has reported that my fellow  Senator from Wisconsin--and this is a quote--``believes Democrats  cheat.''   This false accusation was accompanied by a proposal from this U.S.  Senator to change the rules in Wisconsin and have the Republican- controlled State legislature seize control over the administration of  our elections, taking this nonpartisan process out of the hands of our  bipartisan, independent Wisconsin State Elections Commission.   As was reported, ``Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, said that  G.O.P. state lawmakers should unilaterally assert control [over]  federal elections, claiming that they had the authority to do so even  if Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, stood in their way--an extraordinary  legal argument debunked by a 1932 Supreme Court decision and a 1964  ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court.''   That is from the New York Times.   For my part, I believe voting rights are fundamental to our  democracy, and that is why I will keep on working to pass the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, so we  stop voter suppression efforts and protect the right to vote. We must  ensure that, regardless of where you live in this country, you have the  same access to the ballot box and faith that our elections are fair and  safe.   I yield the floor.
