 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with immense  pride to recognize the extraordinary achievement of the Bald Eagle Area  High School baseball team.   On June 17 at Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, this team  ascended to the PIAA AA throne after defeating Mount Union 11-0. BEA  completed a 3-game sweep of Mount Union  [[Page H3220]]  this season, finishing with a 22-4 record.   Senior Tyler Serb threw a 2-hit shutout and went 3-for-3, while the  Eagles pounded out 10 hits in 4 at-bats.   Mr. Speaker, as an alum of Bald Eagle, I congratulate my alma mater  team and the coaching staff on their hard work and impressive season.  The team showed true grit and determination throughout the season as  they worked their way to the State championship.   Congratulations again on this very impressive victory. Go Eagles.                            ____________________
