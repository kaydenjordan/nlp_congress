 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak about the crisis at the  border, what is happening now, and what we can expect if we don't  resolve this issue.   I can't help but comment on a few things that my good friend, the  gentleman from California, said. And just in case he wasn't paying  attention, we are talking about 234 miles of border security fencing or  wall or barrier of some sort as enumerated by the Secretary of Homeland  Security--not the President; the Secretary of Homeland Security.   So when he says it is unspecified where it will be and what it will  be, it is very closely and very particularly specified by the  Secretary, not by the President, and it is the 10 worst sites along the  border where there is no barrier now.  [[Page H588]]    Let's get on with the other business of the afternoon.   Madam Speaker, I am here this afternoon with nearly a dozen of my  colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus who will lay out the case, with  specifics, for the President's policies on border security, which are  aimed at keeping America safe and enforcing our laws. These are for  America's policies.   The government has been shut down for the longest period in modern  history. It is shut down over the topic of border security and whether  to fund the construction of a border wall on points along our southern  border.   Right now, our immigration is our single greatest policy failure, a  failure that is a manufactured one. It was created from political  cowardice, short-termism, and self-interest, but it is a moral, legal,  and human catastrophe of epic proportions.   The President is fighting to fix it, and the Freedom Caucus is  fighting to fix it right alongside him. Squarely in our way is a party  gripped by denial, their political equivalent of hear no evil and see  no evil.   We learned as children that putting your head in the sand doesn't  change the reality of the situation, the facts are facts. They don't  have a political position. It is not about how we feel or what we wish  the facts are. They are what they are.   Let me quote a recent Vox article, a publication, mind you, that is  no friend to conservatives or the Trump Administration:         Hundreds, or even thousands, of migrant families are set to       be released from government detention along the U.S.-Mexico       border over the next several days. But while the mass release       of families may cheer critics of the Trump administration's       treatment of immigrant families, the government's new plan       will probably lead to hundreds of families getting dropped       off en masse at bus stations--literally out in the cold.    Now the U.S. Border Patrol is so jammed that it had to release these  illegal aliens at a Greyhound station on Christmas Eve. And that is not  the Border Patrol's fault; it is an activist judge in California who  said that Customs and Border Protection must release these individuals.  But there is nowhere for these families to go. Charities at the border  are full. Detention facilities at the border are full.   Some more quotes from the same article:         But over the summer and fall of 2018, it has become clear       that there really is a crisis at the border--because more       families are coming to more places than U.S. officials have       ever been capable of dealing with.        During the peak of unauthorized migration into the U.S.       circa 2000, the overwhelming majority of migrants were single       men; only 10 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions were       families or unaccompanied children.        In November 2018, 57 percent were families or children.       More families crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without       documentation in November of 2018 than in many months since       Department of Homeland Security started tracking family       apprehension separately. More children and families crossed       in November 2018 than crossed during the peak of the ``border       crisis'' in June of 2014.    This is Vox, mind you. This is analysis from a liberal publication.  Let me repeat the line.         But over the summer and fall of 2018, it has become clear       that there really is a crisis at the border.    Again, this is from Vox.   Now, let me quote the Washington Post, as you know, another great fan  of our President. This is an article from January 5:         In recent weeks, so many parents with children have been       among the 2,000 unauthorized migrants who are being taken       into Federal custody each day that authorities have resorted       to mass releases of families onto the streets of El Paso and       other border cities. U.S. agents are bringing dozens of       migrants, coughing and feverish, each day to clinics and       hospitals after stays in jam-packed holding cells where       children sleep on concrete floors and huddle in plastic       sheets for warmth.    If this isn't a crisis, can someone tell me what is?   To all reporters hyperventilating in TV studios who fact-check the  Freedom Caucus and the President, I am sure it is not a crisis; but to  these print reporters at Vox and The Washington Post who did their jobs  and reported the news, this is a crisis.   The agency tasked with basic Federal responsibility in this  situation, Customs and Border Protection, lacks the resources to do its  job humanely and effectively. They lack the legal resources. They lack  the financial resources.   This is the current status quo. This is why we are here. This is why  nothing is happening in Washington, D.C., about ending this shutdown,  because some folks on the other side of the aisle, in both this body  and the one across the Capitol, refuse to deal with the lack of  resources.   I ask my Democratic colleagues: Is this what you support, this status  quo? Do you support leaving illegal foreign nationals, human beings, on  the streets of the United States at bus stations and by the side of the  road?                                time  1700    Do you support incentivizing them to journey through one of the  highest intensity drug trafficking zones in the world, where all manner  of horrific things occur? Do you believe this is moral? I don't.  Neither does the President, who requested another $5 billion for  detention beds so we can protect our borders and the illegal aliens who  violate them. It is in writing in this letter from Director Vought at  OMB, which I will include in the Record.           Executive Office of the President, Office of Management             and Budget,                                   Washington, DC, January 6, 2019.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The President continues to stress the       need to pass legislation that will both reopen the Federal       Government and address the security and humanitarian crisis       at our Nation's Southwest border. The Administration has       previously transmitted budget proposals that would support       his ongoing commitment to dramatically reduce the entry of       illegal immigrants, criminals, and drugs; keep out       terrorists, public safety threats, and those otherwise       inadmissible under U.S. law; and ensure that those who do       enter without legal permission can be promptly and safely       returned home.        Appropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2019 that have       already been considered by the current and previous       Congresses are inadequate to fully address these critical       issues. Any agreement for the current year should satisfy the       following priorities:        Border Wall, Customs and Border Protection (CBP): The       President requests $5.7 billion for construction of a steel       barrier for the Southwest border. Central to any strategy to       achieve operational control along the southern border is       physical infrastructure to provide requisite impedance and       denial. In short, a physical barrier--wall--creates an       enduring capability that helps field personnel stop, slow       down and/or contain illegal entries. In concert with the U.S.       Army Corps of Engineers, CBP has increased its capacity to       execute these funds. The Administration's full request would       fund construction of a total of approximately 234 miles of       new physical barrier and fully fund the top 10 priorities in       CBP's Border Security Improvement Plan. This would require an       increase of $4.1 billion over the FY 2019 funding level in       the Senate version of the bill.        Immigration Judge Teams--Executive Office for Immigration       Review (EOIR): The President requests at least $563 million       for 75 additional Immigration Judges and support staff to       reduce the backlog of pending immigration cases. The       Administration appreciates that the Senate's FY 2019 bill       provides this level of funding, and looks forward to working       with the Congress on further increases in this area to       facilitate an expansion of in-country processing of asylum       claims.        Law Enforcement Personnel, Border Patrol Agent Hiring, CBP:       The President requests $211 million to hire 750 additional       Border Patrol Agents in support of his promise to keep our       borders safe and secure. While the Senate's FY 2019 bill       supports some Border Patrol Agent hiring, fulfilling this       request requires an increase of $100 million over the FY 2019       funding level in the Senate version of the bill.        Law Enforcement Personnel, Immigration and Customs       Enforcement (ICE): The President requests $571 million for       2,000 additional law enforcement personnel, as well as       support staff, who enforce our U.S. immigration laws and help       address gang violence, smuggling and trafficking, and the       spread of drugs in our communities. This would require an       increase of $571 million over the FY 2019 funding level in       the Senate version of the bill.        Detention Beds, ICE: The President requests $4.2 billion to       support 52,000 detention beds. Given that in recent months,       the number of people attempting to cross the border illegally       has risen to 2,000 per day, providing additional resources       for detention and transportation is essential. This would       require an increase of $798 million over the FY 2019 funding       level in the Senate version of the bill.        Humanitarian Needs: The President requests an additional       $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs. This       includes additional funding for enhanced medical support,       transportation, consumable supplies appropriate for the       population, and additional temporary facilities for       processing and short-term custody of this vulnerable  [[Page H589]]       population, which are necessary to ensure the well-being of       those taken into custody.        Counter-narcotics/weapons Technology: Beyond these specific       budgetary requests, the Administration looks forward to       working with Congress to provide resources in other areas to       address the unprecedented challenges we face along the       Southwest border. Specifically, $675 million would provide       Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology at inbound lanes at       U.S. Southwest Border Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) would allow       CBP to deter and detect more contraband, including narcotics,       weapons, and other materials that pose nuclear and       radiological threats. This would require an increase of $631       million over the FY 2019 funding level in the Senate version       of the bill.        In addition, to address the humanitarian crisis of       unaccompanied alien children (UACs), Democrats have proposed       in-country asylum processing for Central American Minors.       This would require a statutory change, along with       reallocation of State Department funds to establish in-      country processing capacities at Northern Triangle consulates       and embassies. Furthermore, for the new procedure to achieve       the desired humanitarian result, a further corresponding       statutory change would be required to ensure that those who       circumvent the process and come to the United States without       authorization can be promptly returned home. Without the       latter change, in-country processing will not reduce the       unauthorized flow or successfully mitigate the humanitarian       crisis.''        These upfront investments in physical barriers and       technology, as well as legislation to close loopholes in our       immigration system, will reduce illegal immigration, the flow       of illicit drugs entering our country and reduce the long       term costs for border and immigration enforcement activities.        The Administration looks forward to advancing these       critical priorities as part of legislation to reopen the       Government.            Sincerely,                                                 Russell T. Vought,                                                   Acting Director.     The President has asked for $800 million for things like  medical care for these migrants, for transportation, for meals, and for  short-term custody facilities to deal with the inflow of illegal aliens  our laws have caused.   He has asked for 57 new immigration judge teams to process these  people, hear claims with merit, and deal with claims that do not.   And, yes, he asked for the wall to cover the 10 worst sites, as  described by the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent entrants  from pouring across the border, especially in the dead of winter and  the extreme heat of summer.   These are rational measures, and they are humanitarian measures.   The cheap and disingenuous moralism of the Democrats in Congress has  brought us to this point. They have opposed every one of these  proposals to improve this system, not only in this Congress, but in  every Congress before. This is the same posturing that is worsening  this crisis, and I will say it again: This is a crisis.   Now, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a clear  choice to make. They can bow to the demands of their radical base that  believes there is no difference or distinction between citizen and  noncitizen, or they can come to the table to work with the President,  which is our job; to protect the vulnerable, including the 30 percent  of women who are sexually assaulted on the trek to the U.S.-Mexican  border, the children who are preyed upon by human trafficking rings,  and the innocent who are trying to make a better life for themselves  but live in fear of the drug cartels and many others; to protect our  borders; and to protect American citizens.   They can provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement the tools, legal  and financial, to do its job.   What is not up for debate is whether the children shivering on the  floor because we can't house them is a crisis. That is the bottom line  here.   Even worse, American families are losing loved ones at the hands of  illegal foreign nationals under preventable circumstances--preventable,  completely preventable.   Earlier today, we heard from Angel Moms, a sister and a brother,  American citizens who lost loved ones because we aren't enforcing our  immigration laws. This is completely and wholly unacceptable.   We are a compassionate nation and a nation of laws, but the same laws  apply to all of us. It is not this law for some and this law for  others. We cannot allow ideology to prevent us from addressing the  crisis. The situation is too dire for these people at risk, and the  situation for America is critical.   Tonight, the House Freedom Caucus stands with the President, and I am  proud to stand with my colleagues to make the case to the American  people.   Madam Speaker, we will next hear from Mr. Chip Roy on the  effectiveness of walls, and then we will hear from Mr. Brooks from  Alabama on the danger of these uncontrolled border policies to  Americans, followed by Mr. Biggs from Arizona on what it is like to  live in an unsecured border because he lives in Arizona.   We will hear from Mr. Hice on opioids and the way our porous borders  contribute to that crisis that is affecting every single town in the  country.   We will hear from Mr. Griffith. We will also hear from Mr. Yoho; Mr.  Meadows, our great chairman, the gentleman from North Carolina; as well  as Mr. Cloud from Texas.   This evening, we are going to get beyond the talking points and  specifically lay out our case.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Meadows), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Brooks).                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama and  yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I yield to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Griffith).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and I  now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for being  part of this discussion   Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert) for sharing his thoughts on this topic.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
