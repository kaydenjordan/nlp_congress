 Madam Speaker, the situation in Afghanistan left behind by  the President's hasty withdrawal has been horrific. It has been  unconscionable and unacceptable.   We have thousands of American citizens unable to get to the airport  in Kabul because this administration botched the withdrawal, sent mixed  messages, and undercut our allied partners.   Let me be clear: We should not leave Afghanistan until every single  American citizen has been safely evacuated, period.   For the last 20 years, our brave servicemen and -women have served in  Afghanistan with honor, with valor, and with distinction. They have  done everything that our country has asked of them and more. They  deserve our gratitude and our respect.   It is time for this President and this administration to do right by  them, to rescue every single American, and to demonstrate the  leadership that our country needs. At this point, Madam Speaker, that  leadership is severely lacking.                            ____________________
