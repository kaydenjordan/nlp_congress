 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  681, I call up the bill (H.R. 1435) to amend the Clean Air Act to  prevent the elimination of the sale of internal combustion engines, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1435         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Choice in Vehicle       Purchases Act''.       SEC. 2. STATE STANDARDS.         (a) Amendments.--Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act (42       U.S.C. 7543(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking the ``or'' at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``part.'' and       inserting ``part, or''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(D) such State standards directly or indirectly limit the       sale or use of new motor vehicles with internal combustion       engines, as such term is defined in section 63.9375 of title       40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect January 1,       2023.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) The Administrator may not determine that any State       standards amended after the date of enactment of this       paragraph are within the scope of a waiver granted under       paragraph (1) before the date of enactment of this       paragraph.''.        (b) Effect on Certain Existing Waivers.--The Administrator       of the Environmental Protection Agency shall revoke a waiver       granted under section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.       7543(b)) during the period that begins on January 1, 2022,       and ends on the date of enactment of this Act if the       Administrator finds that such waiver does not comply with       subparagraph (D) of section 209(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act       (42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)), as added by this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks on the legislation and to insert extraneous material on  H.R. 1435.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1435 from my colleague and an  Energy and Commerce Committee member, Dr.   John Joyce.   For more than a century, the internal combustion engine has allowed  people to increase their mobility and raise their standard of living.  Restrictive government mandates aren't how we are going to lead the  next 100 years, yet that is what EPA and California are trying to do by  mandating that new vehicles sold in the State be electric. Seventeen  other States are ready to follow suit if the EPA approves the recent  waiver request from California.   The reality is that gas-powered cars are much less expensive than EVs  and continue to outperform them in range, towing capacity, and their  ability to operate in severe weather conditions. Studies have also  warned that a rushed EV expansion could overwhelm our electric grid.   In California, Governor Newsom has resorted to asking people not to  charge their EVs during blackouts. EVs currently make up just 4 percent  of the vehicles in his State.   The decision to choose should apply across the board, whether that is  for gas powered, EVs, or hybrid.   H.R. 1435 prevents EPA from granting California a waiver to limit the  sale or use of new gas-powered cars. It is vital that we stop this  effort to force an electricity transition on Americans, especially when  you consider how China dominates the industry and supply chains and has  even taken steps to build its own electric vehicle foothold in Mexico,  specifically so it can access the U.S. market.   We need to focus on ensuring access to affordable, reliable  transportation and ensuring our electric grid is dependable so people  can keep their lights on, keep going to the store to get their  groceries, stay warm, and live their lives.   Protecting people's way of life and their ability to provide for  their families is the fundamental goal of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15  seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, just to clarify, States are  not free under the Clean Air Act to regulate cars any way they want.  Section 209 has conditions.   Also, the bill does not repeal or weaken any of the Clean Air Act  levels. We have the strictest clean air regulations of any place in the  world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a leader on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), a leader and subcommittee chairman  on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, just noting for the record,  in a 2017 midterm review, the California Air Resources Board confessed  this law could lead to long-term job losses in industries tied to  manufacturing, supplying, and servicing of conventional vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, and Grid Security.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson), the gentleman who  is all about winning the future.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan, the car capital of the world, (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15  seconds to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Self).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
