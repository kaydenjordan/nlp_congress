 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with our law  enforcement officers and in support of the rule and passage of the Thin  Blue Line Act. This bill makes sure that anyone who targets and attacks  a State or local law enforcement officer is held accountable.   The men and women who serve in our local police forces put their  lives on the line to keep us safe. They are our everyday heroes, Mr.  Speaker.   In 2014, Tarpon Springs Police Officer Charles Kondek was shot and  killed by a fugitive while on duty. Officer Kondek represented Tarpon  Springs. He worked there for 17 years and did a wonderful job keeping  us safe.   These ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers have  increased across the country by 167 percent. This is unacceptable.   The Thin Blue Line Act brings us one step closer to justice for these  horrific crimes, so let's pass this bill. Of course, we have to pass  the rule first so that we can pass this good bill.
