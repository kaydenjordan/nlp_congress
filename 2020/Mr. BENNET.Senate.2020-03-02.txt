 Mr. President, I rise to celebrate Robert S. Fraser's  retirement from the Federal Government after 50 years of faithful  service to our country.   Mr. Fraser traveled for over 40 years with the U.S. Air Force, both  as a dependent and serving on active duty. He attended the U.S. Air  Force Academy, where he graduated in 1973 and received the Outstanding  Cadet in Engineering Sciences. In 1993, he retired as a major in the  U.S. Air Force and began a distinguished career at the National  Security Agency, where he received multiple achievements and awards.  Throughout his career, Mr. Fraser has had a selfless dedication to duty  and professionalism.                            ____________________
