 Madam Speaker, I rise today as chair of the Subcommittee  on Workforce Protection; co-founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal  Health Caucus; as one of the original cosponsors of the bipartisan PUMP  for Nursing Mothers Act; and as the mother of Jeanelle and Billy.   The issue before us today is one of equity and fairness. In our  country, mothers often have to choose between providing for their  families or nursing their babies.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act ensures that millions of working  mothers have the access and protections they need to nurse for as long  as they choose to do so.   So, why is this Bill so important? As the co-chair of the Black  Maternal Health Caucus, I know how important it is to break down the  barriers that hold nursing mothers and their children back from the  best possible health outcomes.   Every major medical authority strongly encourages nursing for at  least the first year of life, as it provides significant health and  nutritional benefits to both the mother and infant.   By closing an unintended loophole, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act  provides protection and support to an additional 9 million working  mothers who have been forced to choose between nursing and earning a  paycheck.   Fundamentally, this bill says that nursing mothers should not be  punished for making the best choices for their health, and the health  of their children.   Especially during this pandemic and America's maternal health crisis,  I urge each of my colleagues to cast a vote for this critical  legislation, and I urge the Senate to send it to President Biden's  desk.
