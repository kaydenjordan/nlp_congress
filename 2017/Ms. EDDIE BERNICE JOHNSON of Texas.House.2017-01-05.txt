Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition  of the GOP agenda which will repeal the Affordable Care Act and cause  30 million Americans to lose healthcare coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the Republicans to please examine the harm that  this will do. Because of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in  Texas has fallen by 28 percent and still has the largest number of  uninsured Americans, allowing 1.7 million Texans to gain coverage.   While Texas did not expand Medicaid, the State still benefits from  many other reforms brought by the Affordable Care Act. For instance,  Sean, a Ph.D. candidate in economic development at the University of  Texas at Dallas and his wife, Jamie, relied on the Affordable Care Act  when their son was born prematurely and with a heart defect that  required surgery and a transfer to another Dallas hospital. Sean was  reassured that, with his family's ACA marketplace plan, his newborn son  would not be denied coverage for lifesaving treatment.   It is unconscionable to me that the GOP refuses to look at what works  and what needs improvement in this law instead of a full repeal as the  only option. This will deeply harm American families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition  to H. Res. 11, Objecting to United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace. On December 23, 2016,  the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2334 which  describes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as  illegal, with the United States abstaining from the vote.   Now, U.S. Congress has chosen to disapprove of President Obama's  leadership and longstanding U.S. foreign policy on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. UNSC Resolution 2334 merely reiterates the  international community consensus and bipartisan U.S. policy that  building settlements impedes the path to a lasting peaceful two-state  solution. H. Res. 11 asserts that the UNSCR is ``anti-Israel'' and  ``one-sided,'' but it does not break new ground or create any new  policy. For example, in 1987, the Reagan administration abstained and  allowed the passage of UNSCR 605, reaffirming the application of the  Geneva Convention which included Jerusalem in the ``Palestinian and  Arab Territories, occupied by Israel since 1967.''   Instead, I am urging support of an alternative resolution introduced  and led by Congressman David Price. Instead of disapproving of a  resolution that reaffirms longstanding U.S. policy, Congress would work  towards the progress of a two-state solution. H. Res. 11 would  undermine our decades-long efforts towards a peaceful situation between  Israelis and Palestinians and it is not the best way to show our  support for Israel, our strong ally. Our goal must be to reaffirm U.S.  policy in the Middle East and to find solutions with the international  community.   We must be steadfast in our commitment to a two-state solution and to  longstanding U.S. policy. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose H.  Res. 11 and to support the alternative resolution introduced by  Congressman Price.
