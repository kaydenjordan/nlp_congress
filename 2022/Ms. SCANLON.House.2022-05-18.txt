 Mr. Speaker, I will start by acknowledging the sorrow  and terror inflicted upon the families and loved ones of the victims of  the hateful attack in Buffalo last weekend.   The brutal murders that occurred in Buffalo were yet another  heartbreaking landmark in the growing storm of domestic terrorism  impacting communities across America.   Whether in Buffalo, Charleston, El Paso, or Pittsburgh, domestic  terrorists are being radicalized online, fueled by elected officials  and media pundits who either embrace or wink at twisted white  supremacist ideology spawned in the darkest corners of the internet and  infecting our Nation.   Communities across America are terrified, scared to go to their  supermarkets, schools, churches, mosques, and synagogues because of the  fear that the combination of lax gun laws and unchecked white  supremacist conspiracies will have deadly consequences.   But with this bill, we are here to say that we are one American  community, and we will remain united in the face of these attacks.  Where domestic terrorists aim to scare and divide our communities  against each other, we must come together and condemn this hateful  ideology and give law enforcement the tools to fight its most violent  consequences.   We are Americans; we are proud of our diversity; and we must choose  community over chaos. That is why I am proud to support the Domestic  Terrorism Prevention Act.                                time  1500
