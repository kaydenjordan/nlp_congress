 Mr. President, in 2015, the Federal Communications  Commission, FCC, did something that can be all too rare Washington: It  listened to the American people. After a record number of Americans  spoke in favor of clear rules to protect a free and open Internet, the  FCC voted to adopt strong net neutrality protections that accomplished  this goal. These protections, which ensure that innovation and free  speech can flourish online, are currently under threat as the FCC now  moves to repeal them. On net neutrality and on many other key  telecommunications policy issues, Chairman Pai has stood against  consumers, startups, and small businesses. Today I choose to stand with  them and with millions of Americans who support net neutrality by  opposing his reappointment.   Vermonters have been clear that they want strong FCC rules in place  to ensure that the Internet remains the ultimate platform for economic  opportunity and free expression. These protections are particularly  important for small businesses, which compete on the internet's global  stage against the largest companies in the world. The Vermont Country  Store is a great example of a small company that has taken advantage of  the promise of an open Internet. Family-owned with a rich history  dating back to 1897, the internet offered new opportunities to extend  the company's reach. As fifth generation storekeeper Cabot Orton said  when he testified in Vermont about the FCC's effort to craft net  neutrality protections in 2014:         We don't want to imagine an America with two Internets: a       fast one for giant corporations and a slow one for everybody       else. We don't want to imagine being held for ransom by       telecom behemoths and cable monopolies just to reach our       customers with the same speed and convenience that global       conglomerates enjoy . . . A small business website that is no       longer protected from giant Internet toll-keepers would have       one choice: pay to play. Failing that, a company becomes the       proverbial tree falling in the forest with no one there to       hear it.    Chairman Pai has shown total disregard for the concerns of businesses  like the Vermont Country Store. In proposing to repeal the existing net  neutrality protections, he makes no mention of their importance to the  small business community. Instead of recognizing the very real impact  on small businesses of stripping away these protections, Chairman Pai  claims that there are no possible harms these protections could be  designed to prevent.   This is particularly clear when he discusses the current rule banning  harmful paid prioritization agreements that would create the type of  two-tiered internet small businesses fear. Chairman Pai claims that  there was no need for this rule because some large internet service  providers, ISPs, said they ``had no plans'' to engage in this kind of  behavior. This is despite the fact that at least one major ISP said  outright in its 2014 FCC filing that it wanted the ``flexibility'' to  charge websites for priority access and that, even though it had no  plans for these arrangements, they ``should be permissible and should  be tested.''   I introduced legislation to ban pay-to-play deals online before the  FCC adopted its rule because of the harm they would cause small  businesses like the Vermont Country Store. I find Chairman Pai's  failure to understand the importance of a level playing field for small  businesses extremely disconcerting.   Not only is Chairman Pai ignoring the small business community by  barreling ahead to repeal net neutrality protections, he is also  ignoring the clear will of the American people. Over 22 million  Americans have submitted comments in the proceeding he started to  repeal these critical protections, shattering records at the FCC. Poll  after poll has found overwhelming bipartisan support for net  neutrality. In Washington, Chairman Pai calls net neutrality  protections burdensome and unnecessary. In Vermont, we just call them  common sense.   Vermonters also value their privacy rights and want basic protections  in place to protect their personal data. In 2016, over Chairman Pai's  objections, the FCC put in place important privacy protections to  prevent ISPs from selling their sensitive information, including their  web browsing history, without their consent. These rules also included  basic data security and data breach notification requirements. We have  seen how important it is to hold companies to basic data security and  breach notification standards in the wake of the total disregard  Equifax showed for protecting sensitive consumer information.   Unfortunately, Chairman Pai was a strong supporter of the resolution  of disapproval passed by this Congress that permanently repealed the  FCC's privacy and data security protections. At a time when the  personal information of every single American is under constant threat,  Chairman Pai thought it was simply too much to ask for ISPs to take  reasonable steps to secure their subscribers data and notify them if a  breach occurs.   Chairman Pai's approach to rural broadband, which is one of the most  pressing issues for Vermonters, also raises cause for concern. Just  recently, he has proposed to effectively lower the speed standard used  to measure whether Americans have access to adequate broadband service.  As someone who represents a rural State, ensuring that we accurately  measure how many Americans lack this essential service is critical.  Under the current standard set by the previous FCC, 39 percent of rural  Americans lack access to true high-speed broadband service. In  contrast, only 4 percent of urban Americans lack access.   I supported the FCC's decision to set a high minimum broadband speed  to use as the baseline for comparing rural and urban areas. All  Americans deserve the same quality of broadband service, whether they  live in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont or the heart of Kansas City.  Rural Americans should not be held to a lower standard simply so that  Chairman Pai can rig the numbers to falsely claim that he has closed  the digital divide once and for all.   Chairman Pai has shown far too often in his time at the FCC that he  will side with Goliath over David and that he will ignore the  overwhelming sentiment of the American people. With the fate of the  open internet and many other critical telecommunications issues at  stake, I must oppose Chairman Pai's nomination.
