 Madam Speaker, I ask, where are they? Where did they go?   Where are they?   Did they leave us for a recession, allowing revenues to fall and  borrowing costs to skyrocket?   Where are they?   Capital markets alone will be out of reach, and many small businesses  won't make their payroll at the end of the month.   Where are they?   The world is looking at us and questioning our leadership and where  we are going to move and how we are going to save our own people and  our values.   Where are they in this time of need?   I know where the Democrats are. They are right here talking about how  we will stand for them and not allow this Republican-made default on  America last.   Where are they?   They need to get back here and get back here now for the sake of the  American people. The world is watching us. They are looking.   They are saying that we may not have to worry about our competitors.   We don't have to worry about them. We have to worry about our MAGA  Republicans who have decided to leave and not address the issues that  are most important to America today.   Where are they?   Come on back here and get to work.                            ____________________
