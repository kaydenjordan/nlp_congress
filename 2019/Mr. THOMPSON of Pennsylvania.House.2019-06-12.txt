 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  America's hardworking, dedicated, and passionate teachers.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure every Member of this House can think of a  teacher who had a positive influence not only on their education, but  on their life.   Teachers push students to achieve their best, and they show students  how to realize their full potential. Sometimes, it is the interest of  just one teacher that can transform the life of a young person.   Teachers are often the most underrated, yet powerful, professionals  in the entire world. They truly do shape young minds.   That is why, last week, I was proud to introduce H.R. 3108, the  Teachers Are Leaders Act. This bipartisan legislation, led by  Congressman Brad Schneider, seeks to expand professional development  and leadership growth opportunities for teachers.   Under the current law, the Federal Teacher Quality Partnership grant  connects local schools with nearby colleges and universities to create  professional development programs for new teachers. However, there are  not enough opportunities for established teachers to develop leadership  and peer mentoring skills that can help retain teachers and boost  student achievement.   The Teachers Are Leaders Act would expand the Teacher Quality  Partnership grants by making teacher leader programs focused on  professional development for established teachers eligible for funding.  These programs would focus on peer coaching, family and community  engagement, curriculum development, and other ways to make full use of  their experience as educators and leaders within their communities.   If schools want to recruit and retain high-quality teachers, then  they must treat them like the professionals that they are. That means  we must allow them to grow both inside and outside the classroom.   Mr. Speaker, professional development is essential in all positions,  especially for those who are educating the next generation. Now I am  pleased that this bipartisan legislation devotes the resources  necessary to give teachers the tools to become even stronger leaders  for our youth.   Teachers lend a caring hand and extend a loving heart. They make  differences in the lives of our students academically, emotionally, and  physically. This legislation strengthens the teaching profession and  lets them take their experience to the next level. I encourage my  colleagues to support the Teachers Are Leaders Act today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this Friday is Flag Day  and the U.S. Army's 244th birthday.   Each year, on June 14, we celebrate the Stars and Stripes, which the  Second Continental Congress designated as the symbol of our Nation on  June 14, 1777.   Since our founding, our flag has flown across the country and the  world. It has flown during both our most tragic moments and our  greatest triumphs. It has also been a glorious symbol of hope for our  brave servicemen and -women who salute it, defend it, serve it, and, in  some cases, die for it to protect our freedom and liberty.   Later today, the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the  Army, and the Sergeant Major of the Army will be on Capitol Hill to  celebrate the rich history of our Army.   Without the Army 244 years ago, we would not be the great Nation that  we are today. On Friday, our Nation will celebrate our Army and our  flag, which both symbolize America being the land of the free and the  home of the brave.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend  from California for being such a tremendous champion for this important  program and a great partner to work with.   Mr. Chairman, the Statewide Family Engagement Center Program provides  much-needed technical assistance and partnership development to States  and school districts to foster meaningful engagement with families to  further their children's academic and developmental progress.   Research has shown that family engagement in a child's education  increases student achievement, improves attendance, reduces the dropout  rate, and advances the emotional and physical well-being of children.   Unfortunately, due to our Department of Education grant reviewer  error, a $1 million shortfall for fiscal year 2019 has been created in  this program. If this shortfall, this error, is not filled, corrected,  a 9 percent cut in the grants of 11 centers serving 11 States will take  effect. This means that 11 centers will have to cut staff or reduce  services, including those who work closely with parents.   While I was extremely pleased to see an increase in funding in this  program in fiscal year 2020, we must ensure these centers receive the  funding they deserve.   Our amendment would resolve this shortfall by designating $1 million  of the $5 million increase under this bill to ensure the current  grantees are made whole and can continue to provide the needed services  and supports to families in their States.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my fellow colleagues to vote in support of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630
