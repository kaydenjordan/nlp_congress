 Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to honor some  outstanding members of south Jersey. The Mainland Regional High School  Girls Basketball team has recently won the New Jersey Group 3 State  championship. This is the first time the Mainland Regional High School  girls basketball team has achieved this amazing accomplishment.   These girls are the embodiment of teamwork. This win, and the hard  work that they have put in to achieve it, is about all of them, not any  one individual. I have been told that some of  [[Page H2735]]  them have been best friends since they were 7 years old.   This friendship and teamwork have led them to reach an amazing goal.  We could all learn a little bit about teamwork, especially in this  great House of ours, and we could learn it from these amazing young  ladies.   Congratulations to the Mainland Regional High School girls basketball  team. Keep up the good work. We are really proud of you.                            ____________________
