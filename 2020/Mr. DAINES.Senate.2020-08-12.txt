 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing the women of the TreasureBelles out of Treasure County for  their efforts to promote Montana ag in their community.   The TreasureBelles are made up of over 20 women who have made it  their goal to promote and highlight the importance of beef through  various efforts to integrate agriculture into different community  organizations and events.   The TreasureBelles enjoy hosting Ag Day at the school in Hysham each  Spring, feeding Lions Club members each month, serving food at the  annual StreetFest, and rallying community members together to donate  beef for student lunches.   The TreasureBelles are also proud members of the Montana Cattlewomen  Association and the American National Cattlewomen Association.   It is my honor to recognize the TreasureBelles for their commitment  to Montana ag, and I applaud their efforts to serve their fellow  Montanans in the Treasure County community.                            ____________________
