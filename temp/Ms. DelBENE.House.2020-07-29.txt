 Madam Speaker, I was born in Selma, Alabama, and I was 3  years old when John Lewis crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge.   My family moved away when I was young, but I still carried my  birthplace. We moved quite frequently, and every new town we would go  to, I would go to a school, and a teacher would ask where I was born. I  would say Selma, and that started a whole conversation about what  happened in Selma.   It is on my passport: Selma, Alabama. So many people who have seen  that have started a conversation about what John Lewis and so many  people did, crossing that bridge in Selma.   The story has become part of me, part of my life.   And I never, ever imagined, first, that I would be a Member of  Congress, let alone have the opportunity to serve on the Ways and Means  Committee with my hero, John Lewis.   One of the first trips I ever took as a Member of Congress was to go  to Selma, to go back to my birthplace with Terri Sewell, with John  Lewis. We were the Selma caucus, the three of us, on the Ways and Means  Committee.   Just to be able to experience that, to talk to John--I had the chance  to go to South Africa with John when he gave a talk at the 50th  anniversary of Bobby Kennedy's ``Ripples of Hope'' speech and talk to  John and hear his stories.   He lifted all of us up. He was an icon, yet when you were with him, I  think we all became better people. He lifted us up, and he reminded all  of us--in fact, he showed all of us what is possible, what each of us  can do, how we can create change if we stand up, if we speak up for  what is right and for what is just and what is fair.                                time  2030    So we will continue to honor John, each of us, by doing that, by  speaking out, by getting into ``good trouble,'' necessary trouble.   And, John, we will always remember your words, your kindness, your  leadership. Thank you for passing a little bit of that on to each of  us. Rest in peace. We will miss you terribly.
