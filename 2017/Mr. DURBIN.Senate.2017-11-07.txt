On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are  47.   The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Steven Engel to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.   On many occasions, President Donald Trump has made clear that he does  not appropriately respect the rule of law in America. We have seen this  many times over the last few years, from his bigoted and disdainful  comments about Federal judges, to his firing of FBI Director Comey  because of what the President called ``this Russia thing,'' to his  shameful pardon of Joe Arpaio, a man convicted of criminal contempt for  refusing to stop violating the Constitution, to his efforts last week  to badger the FBI and Federal prosecutors into doing his bidding.   As Republican Senator Bob Corker said last Friday:         President Trump's pressuring of the Justice Department and       FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for       punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate       and not only undermine our justice system but erode the       American people's confidence in our institutions.    If my Republican colleagues want to restore confidence in our  institutions of justice, they can start by making sure that only  someone truly independent of Donald Trump serves in the vital position  of Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel.   The Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, is not well known, but it is a  critical part of the Federal government. OLC exercises statutory  authority to provide legal advice that is binding on the executive  branch. In addition to giving legal advice to the President and  executive branch officials, OLC reviews all proposed Executive orders  and Attorney General orders for form and legality. Essentially, OLC  serves as a check to make sure that the President and his  administration are faithfully executing the laws.   There have been shameful moments in our history when OLC's leaders  have lacked the independence and judgment to stand up for the rule of  law. For example, in 2002, under Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee,  OLC produced the infamous torture memo that approved the CIA's use of  torture techniques like waterboarding. When this memo became public in  2004, the Justice Department was forced to withdraw it. Jack Goldsmith,  a prominent conservative legal scholar who was acting head of OLC at  the time said he was ``astonished'' by the memo's ``deeply flawed'' and  ``sloppily reasoned'' legal analysis.   Then, in May 2005, OLC had a new leader--Steven Bradbury--and he  secretly issued three new torture memos approving the use of  waterboarding and other abusive interrogation techniques. Then-Deputy  Attorney General Jim Comey strongly objected, saying the United States  would be ashamed when the memos came to light, but Attorney General  Alberto Gonzales overruled him.   Already, we have seen troubling signs at OLC under President Trump.  In January, OLC signed off on President Trump's travel ban Executive  order, a decision that was kept secret from then-acting Attorney  General Sally Yates. According to Ms. Yates, this was the first time  ever that OLC hid its actions from the Attorney General, which it did  even though OLC reports to the Attorney General. This Executive order  was blocked by multiple Federal courts before it was withdrawn. OLC  issued an opinion on Inauguration Day to allow President Trump to  employ family members in the White House. This was a reversal of OLC's  longstanding position on antinepotism laws.   OLC is likely to face many critical legal issues in the coming months  and years. We need OLC to serve as an independent check on this  administration, especially since President Trump has shown an eagerness  to denigrate the justice system and to criticize those whose views on  the law differ from his own. Unfortunately, Steven Engel, the  President's nominee to head OLC, has not demonstrated the independence  and judgment that our country needs for this vital position.   Mr. Engel has been a law firm partner since 2009. Previously, he  worked at OLC under President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009, rising  to the level of Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Mr. Engel admitted  that, while he was at OLC, he ``reviewed and commented upon'' a July  2007 memo to the CIA Acting General Counsel which concluded that six  CIA enhanced interrogation techniques were legal. These techniques  included, for example, extended sleep deprivation by shackling  detainees in a standing position while wearing a diaper for days at a  time. The OLC opinion said that these techniques did not constitute  cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Justice Department's Office  of Professional Responsibility concluded that this 2007 memo was  inconsistent with the plain meaning and commonly held understandings of  Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The OLC opinion was  withdrawn in 2009.   While at OLC, Mr. Engel also helped draft legislation that would  become the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This law included a  provision that suspended habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo Bay  detainees, a provision that the Supreme Court struck down as  unconstitutional in the Boumediene case.  [[Page S7041]]    Additionally, Mr. Engel worked on President Trump's transition and  Justice Department landing team, but, he would not tell the Judiciary  Committee what matters he worked on, which is troubling.   I asked Mr. Engel to provide reassurance that, if he is confirmed,  OLC will operate independently from President Trump. His response? He  said he was deeply committed to the independence of OLC and said, ``I  demonstrated that commitment in my prior service in the Office, as well  as in my activities in private practice and my volunteer work for the  Trump transition team.'' It is hard for me to understand how Mr.  Engel's work for the Trump transition--work that he would not even  discuss with the committee--is supposed to reassure us about his  independence from President Trump. To the contrary, I fear that by  refusing to discuss his transition work, Mr. Engel has already started  covering for Mr. Trump.   Perhaps the most telling response Mr. Engel provided when it comes to  demonstrating independence from President Trump is this. I asked him  this question in writing:         According to news reports, in a January 27th dinner,       President Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey if Comey       would pledge his loyalty to President Trump. Do you believe       it is appropriate for a President to ask a Director of the       FBI to pledge loyalty to the President?    His response? ``I do not have any knowledge concerning the  communications between President Trump and former FBI Director Comey.''  This is not a hard question. I wasn't asking Mr. Engel about the  specific conversation between President Trump and the FBI Director.  Here is the easy answer that he should have given: It is wrong and  unethical for a President to ask an FBI Director--or any Justice  Department or FBI official--to make a personal loyalty pledge. If Mr.  Engel can't get the easy questions right, what will he say when  challenging questions come before OLC?   For example, what if President Trump asks OLC to revise the 1974 OLC  memo concluding that a President cannot pardon himself? Would Mr. Engel  cave to the President's whims? Or what if President Trump asks OLC to  justify some pretext for the firing of Special Counsel Mueller? Are my  Republican colleagues confident that Mr. Engel would stand strong?   Here is the bottom line. Many of my Republican colleagues talk and  tweet about their concerns when President Trump disrespects the rule of  law, but talk and tweets are cheap. If they are truly concerned about  President Trump's actions, they need to vote in a way that serves as a  meaningful check on President Trump. Our Nation needs the Office of  Legal Counsel to serve as a check on the President's worst impulses. We  need them to stand strong when the President berates the Justice  Department and urges it to ignore legal norms and processes.   I am concerned that Mr. Engel has not demonstrated the independence  and judgment we need from the head of this critical office. Therefore,  I cannot support his nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
