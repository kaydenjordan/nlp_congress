 Madam Speaker, America's economic independence is based  in energy independence.   Today, I voted for H.R. 22, a bill that prohibits selling oil from  our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. However, this bill does not  go far enough.   I was one of the Members that saved the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  with my vote several years ago. We have to do more to prohibit the sale  of oil to other tyrants who wage war on peaceful people and nations.   In 2015, it was the Republican-controlled Congress that voted to  begin exporting oil to all of our biggest adversaries: Iran, North  Korea, Russia, and China included.   Well, how about that?   Americans cannot be dependent on any foreign adversaries for our way  of life. Now more than ever is the time to ensure American energy  independence in perpetuity. We protect our workers and our companies  when we stand up to predatory adversaries.   We must continue to keep advancing new energy technologies here at  home, and I look forward to Republican support in doing so. That is the  recipe for American strength and liberty.                            ____________________
