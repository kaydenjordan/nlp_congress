 Mr. Speaker, as long as drugs have been  used, they have been abused, destroying families. Availability is  skyrocketing due to the Biden failures at the southern border.   It is shocking that nearly 140 million Americans have illicitly used  drugs at some point in their life. Sadly, South Carolina has not  escaped this scourge. In the last 2 years, South Carolina drug overdose  deaths involving fentanyl have increased by more than 35 percent.  Sadly, 1,500 deaths are recorded.   The Republican majority is focused on the needs of families. In  January, I cosponsored the Stop Fentanyl Act. This important  legislation is a deterrence for fentanyl-related offenses, which are  aggravated by the Biden failures at the southern border, putting all  families at risk.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Best wishes on International Day of Families, coordinated by OIF  president Brian Brown.                            ____________________
