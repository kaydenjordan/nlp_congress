 Madam President, I rise today to address the saddest and  one of the most depressing issues of the moment, and that is the drug  epidemic that faces America.   The reality of this drug epidemic is felt in every corner of this  country. There is no suburb too wealthy, no town too small, no place in  this country that hasn't been touched by the opioid and heroin  epidemic.   The Centers for Disease Control put out a statement this morning that  is important for us to truly understand this drug epidemic. What the  Centers for Disease Control said is that fentanyl has become the  deadliest drug in the United States. On Wednesday, they reported that  fentanyl was involved in more deadly drug overdoses in 2016 than any  other drug. There was a total of 63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016,  with fentanyl found to be involved in nearly 29 percent of those cases.  By comparison, fentanyl was involved in only 4 percent of drug  fatalities just 7 years ago--in 2011. That year, oxycodone ranked  first; it was involved in 13 percent.   Lawmakers are struggling to deal with the sweeping opioid epidemic,  and the CDC data shows that the problem goes further than the  overprescription of opioid drugs.   From 2011 to 2016, cocaine consistently ranked second or third.  During the study period, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths  involving heroin more than tripled, as did the rate of drug overdose  deaths involving methamphetamine.   Why do I bring up this issue of fentanyl? Because if you are  discussing border security in America, you are talking about a number  of things. You are talking about those who would assault our borders  for a variety of reasons. You are talking about people who present  themselves at our borders for a variety of reasons.   Let me try to make several concessions here that I think both parties  agree with.   First, America needs border security. We cannot allow every person in  the  [[Page S7555]]  world who wishes to come to this country entry into this country.   Second, we know people are trying to ship into this country things  that are deadly and items that are contraband, that should not be part  of America.   Third, we don't want anyone who is dangerous outside of our country  to knowingly come into this country. Those who are here undocumented,  if they are dangerous to our country, should be removed.   I hope that you would agree there is unanimous consensus on those  three points.   The third point I am going to make and not dwell on at this moment is  the fact that our immigration legal system is in shambles. It is awful.  We currently are placing in tent camps on the border with Mexico  hundreds and hundreds of children because of a circumstance created by  this administration, which is almost impossible to understand or to  explain.   But I want to focus specifically on fentanyl--on this drug fentanyl,  which the CDC has told us is the deadliest drug in America today,  overwhelmingly the deadliest drug in America today.   Where does it come from? Much of the production is in China, but it  is produced in other places. Much of it transits into the United States  across that Mexican border. So when we talk about border security and  stopping the drug epidemic in America, let's be honest about it.  Building a wall from one side of the United States to the other does  not stop the flow of fentanyl into our country. Fentanyl is coming in  through ports of entry--openings, legal openings--in the wall.   We heard yesterday from the experts that some 80 percent of the drugs  that flow into the United States from Mexico come through our ports of  entry. They are not putting them in backpacks and storming across the  desert at night, trying to come across the Rio Grande. That may be a  part of some effort, but when it comes to the deadliest of drugs coming  into the United States, they are coming through our ports of entry.   What can we do about it? Well, the interesting thing we can do about  it is to look at the obvious. I asked one of the experts, a Mr.  McAleenan, who is with the Customs and Border Protection system--he  does this for a living.   I asked him last year: If I gave you a blank check and said ``Make  our borders safer with Mexico,'' what would you spend it on?   He said two things immediately: technology and personnel. That makes  sense.   I said: Give me an idea of the kind of technology you think would  make America safer.   He said: There is something called a Z-Portal.   I had never heard the term before. A Z-Portal is a scanning device;  if you drive a car or a truck across our border, it scans it, x rays  it, and can tell basically what is inside. If you are trying to smuggle  people in the back of a semitruck, it will show it. If you have  firearms, it will show it. It will show contraband that is not supposed  to be part of the declared shipment that is coming into the United  States.   Doesn't it sound like a good idea to try to make sure that anything  entering this country has been scanned?   Well, it turns out that 98 percent of the railroad cars that come  into the United States are scanned. That is good news. I wish it were  100 percent, but 98 percent is good. What percentage of other vehicles  coming into the United States are scanned currently? Eighteen percent.  Fewer than one out of five vehicles are scanned.   I asked Mr. McAleenan, when he appeared before our Judiciary  Committee this week: Why not more?   He said: Well, we need to buy more technology. We need to buy more  scanners so that we can spot those who are trying to ship people or  contraband or drugs into the United States.   I said: Well, I looked at President Trump's request for your Agency,  and he asked for $44 million for scanners.   What would it take, Mr. McAleenan, to have scanners to make sure that  all of the vehicles coming into the United States are scanned?   He gave me the number: $300 million.   That is a lot of money. But when you consider the cost of our drug  epidemic and the deadly results of that drug epidemic, it is not a lot  of money. And when you put it to the idea of a $5 billion wall, it is  laughable that this administration is insisting on a medieval wall as  opposed to the technology that lets us look inside the vehicles that  are shipping these deadly drugs into the United States and killing  people in our country. That is the reality of what we face today.   I would say to this President: Don't shut this government down over  border security; make smart border security choices. Listen to your  professionals. Put aside your campaign speeches about ``a wall from sea  to shining sea'' and listen to the professionals who will tell you, Mr.  President, as they educated me, that there are better ways to keep  America safe than to build a god-awful wall.   Walls can be overcome by ladders and tunnels underneath, but this  technology we are talking about is inescapable. When you bring your  vehicle through these scanning devices, we know a lot more about what  you are trying to do.   And while we are on the subject, the hearing yesterday was about  Mexican drug cartels. Some of the things that were told to us in that  Judiciary Committee hearing were stunning. They estimate that the  current economic activity of the Mexican drug cartels is part of a  transnational network whose global revenue exceeds the gross domestic  product of Mexico. What they are doing in creating this narcotic trade  and exporting is now surpassing the entire Mexican economy's production  of goods and services. Breathtaking, isn't it? And it turns out that 10  years ago, we identified Mexican drug cartels as our greatest criminal  threat at that time, and it still is today.   How do they do it? How do they produce so much narcotics in Mexico at  our expense? Well, certainly the answer is obvious: We pay for the  drugs. American dollars flow back into Mexico so that the cartels can  keep in business, and something else flows back into Mexico: guns from  America. Seventy percent of the crime guns that were seized in Mexico-- 70 percent of them had come from the United States. How did they get  across the border? Well, first, it is not legal to export guns across  that border. Secondly, it turns out they buy them the same way they buy  them in the Midwest and come to Chicago to shoot up our streets. They  go to gun shows where there are no background checks, and they buy  these guns in volume, and they surreptitiously ship them across the  border to the Mexican drug cartels. So it is a circle. The narcotics  come here; the money and the weapons go from here back to Mexico. That  circle is growing in size and in intensity.   So I asked an obvious question: Do we check on the vehicles that are  southbound out of the United States, headed down to Mexico? The answer  is almost not at all.   How are we going to deal with this drug epidemic and how are we going  to deal with border security if, instead of addressing these very real  issues that directly impact the drug epidemic in America, we are  sitting here talking about $5 billion for a wall?   All of us have voted for the Department of Homeland Security to build  barriers where needed, to build fences--and they tell us they don't  need a wall; they need a fence they can see through. We put money on  the table for that year after year, and I will continue to because I  think it is a smart thing to do, to have a border that is actually  secured. But this President is prepared to shut down the Government of  the United States not for the technology that I have described to you-- the successful technology that can reduce the flow of fentanyl, this  deadliest of chemicals into the United States, not for the technology  that could detect in these vehicles if they had a trailer full of  people who are being smuggled in for whatever reason--no. This  President is fixed on one issue: a $5 billion wall.    I hope someone close to the President will sit down with him and  explain the reality of border security. It goes way beyond a campaign  speech. There are plenty of votes, Democrats and Republicans, for  border security that is smart and border security that will work.   The hearings this week in the Senate Judiciary Committee really told  the story. I am sure the President didn't follow those hearings, but I  hope someone at the White House can and did  [[Page S7556]]  convince him: Don't shut down this government to build a wall. Appeal  to Congress on a bipartisan basis to give our government the resources  to make America safe.   If we could stop the deadly flow of fentanyl across that border, we  will save American lives. We can do it. We know the technology that  will accomplish it. Now, all we lack is the political will to get it  done.                            Tribute to Jeff Flake    Madam President, I am sorry I wasn't here earlier when he was on the  floor, but I know that my friend and colleague, Senator Jeff Flake,  gave his farewell address to the Senate, and he will be leaving soon. I  wanted to honor him for his service in the Senate and thank him for all  the things we have worked on together.   When the political history of our time is written, I think one of the  most interesting chapters will be about my friend, Senator Jeff Flake,  of Arizona. I hope that history will be able to explain to me how one  of the ideological sons of Barry Goldwater, who was, in fact, the  father of modern American conservatism--how this ideological son named  Jeff Flake came to be viewed as a suspect conservative in Senator  Goldwater's home State of Arizona.   I have always found Jeff Flake to be a conservative with a  conscience, and I have been privileged to work closely with him on some  of the most important questions of our time.   Most people, in observing Washington, think all we do is fight like  cats and dogs, and Democrats and Republicans won't work together. That  is not true. Jeff Flake and I were members of something called the Gang  of 8. We produced a comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform bill  that passed on this Senate floor overwhelmingly 15\1/2\ years ago.  Other members of the Gang of 8 included our current Democratic leader,  Chuck Schumer; Mike Bennet, the Senator from Colorado; Lindsey Graham,  the Senator from South Carolina; Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Senator  Marco Rubio of Florida; and that old iconoclast himself, Senator John  McCain.   We met day after day and night after night to write an immigration  reform bill. We fought like cats and dogs over some of the provisions,  but in the end we agreed. We came up with a compromise bill, and it  passed overwhelmingly. We spent hundreds of hours together because we  knew that America needed immigration reform.   Senator Flake was a voice of conservatism in those discussions, but  he was also a voice of conscience, compassion, and reason. I had to  laugh at the description of my friend, Senator Flake, in an article in  the Atlantic magazine last year. The reporter wrote:         Flake doesn't relish criticizing other people, but when he       does, it is usually in a fatherly tone of disappointment. . .       . He sometimes seems as if he just crash-landed here in a       time machine from some bygone era of seersucker suits and       polite disagreements.    Country before party--that is the North Star of Jeff Flake's  political life. Adhering to that principle may have made him a one-term  Senator from Arizona, but it also made him an extraordinarily good  Senator and public servant.   The problems Jeff Flake tried honorably to solve haven't gone away.  They still demand our attention. If we can approach these challenges  with the same principles and openmindedness of Senator Jeff Flake,  America will be a winner.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, we recently heard a farewell speech from  my colleague and friend, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. I grew  up across the river from St. Louis in the town of East St. Louis, IL,  and feel a familiarity with Missouri and St. Louis probably more than  most residents of my State. We have had many great reminisces about the  city and her life, and I wanted to say a few words on the floor today  as she ends her service in the U.S. Senate.   My boyhood hero was Stan Musial--``Stan the Man''--St. Louis  Cardinals Hall of Famer and one of greatest ball players who ever  lived. He retired in 1963 holding National League career marks for  games played, at-bats, and hits. Asked to describe the habits that kept  him in baseball for so long, Musial once said: ``Get eight hours of  sleep regularly. Keep your weight down, run a mile a day. If you must  smoke, try light cigars. Then cut down on inhaling.''   ``One last thing,'' he added: ``Make it a point to bat .300.''   Claire McCaskill has always brought the same sort of natural-born  talent and relentless work ethic to public service that Stan Musial-- ``Stan the Man''--brought to baseball in St. Louis. She has stood for  office 24 times--lost twice. That makes her batting average  considerably better than .300.   Five years ago, Senator McCaskill and I teamed up to suggest a name  for a beautiful new bridge that spanned the mighty Mississippi River  between her State of Missouri and mine of Illinois, near St. Louis.  Thanks to Claire's leadership, it is called the Stan Musial Veterans  Memorial Bridge. Locals all call it the Stan Span for short. It is a  well-deserved, fitting tribute to my boyhood hero and a fitting tribute  to Claire McCaskill's tenacity.   In an age of hyperpartisanship, Claire McCaskill is a bridge builder.  She doesn't ask whether ideas come from the left or the right; she asks  whether they will work. Like her own political hero, Harry Truman, she  is a straight talker, and she can be a bulldog when it comes to  demanding accountability for the people who pay for this government and  those who rely on it. She has cast historic and heroic votes on the  Senate floor. She voted for an economic stimulus package that helped  prevent a second Great Depression. She voted to create the Affordable  Care Act--one of the most important social and economic justice laws of  our lifetime.   One story about Claire McCaskill seems especially telling. Nearly 2  years ago, she was ready to vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch, a Trump  appointee, to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Missouri, a red State, that  was a pretty good vote for her politically. But when she met privately  with then-Judge Gorsuch, she asked him about a case in which he had  ruled that a trucking company was within its rights when it fired a  driver who left his broken-down truck briefly on a sub-zero night to  find help.   Senator McCaskill asked Judge Gorsuch: Did you ever think about what  you would do if you had been that truckdriver?   The judge said: No.   Senator McCaskill changed her vote to no. It cost her politically,  but that is the kind of Senator Claire McCaskill is. Her idea of  governing is to spend money wisely, punish misbehavior, and give people  what they need in order to get through their daily lives. She has been  a voice for truckdrivers and farmers and factory workers and a lot of  ordinary people who work hard and still struggle to pay their bills.  She has been a fearless champion of my Dreamers, and for that I will  forever be grateful. Her votes to help these young people always were  risky politically, but she never ever flinched. I will forever be in  her debt for her show of courage on that one issue.   Incidentally, she showed the same courage and compassion when calling  for an end to this administration's cruel policy of separating  immigrant families at our border.   This past year, she used her influence as ranking member of the  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to  investigate the causes of the opioid epidemic devastating America. That  investigation showed how pharmaceutical companies knowingly sold  dangerous and addictive pain killers in order to maximize profit. She  worked diligently on a bipartisan basis to ensure passage of a law that  will help combat the opioid epidemic and provide treatment for those  who are addicted. And she has never ever wavered in her efforts to  protect Americans with preexisting medical conditions.   Results, not just rhetoric--that is Claire McCaskill.   As Stan Musial approached the plate for the last time before he  retired, legendary sportscaster Harry Caray said: ``Take a look, fans.  Take a good long look. Remember the swing and the stance. We won't see  his like again.''   As Senator McCaskill leaves the Senate, take a look. Remember Claire  McCaskill and her personal brand of Missouri courage. May we all try to  be bridge builders, as she has been.   I yield the floor.
