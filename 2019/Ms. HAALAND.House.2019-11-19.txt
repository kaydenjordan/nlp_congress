 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Native American  Heritage Month. And as part of this acknowledgment, I wish to state  that we are on Indian land. The Nacotchtanks, known for trading right  here throughout the Chesapeake area, were the original inhabitants of  the land we are standing on right now.   I am a proud member of the Pueblo of Laguna in the great State of New  Mexico. My mother raised me to be a Pueblo woman, and as such, I have  an obligation to my people and the quest of all Native American  communities to safeguard our cultures and traditions and do all I can  to ensure that our people have a government that lives up to its trust  obligations.   Trust obligations were promises made to all of our Tribes in exchange  for the tens of millions of acres of land that became the United States  of America. As a child, I was taught to value our open space, our land,  our water, and animals.   In spite of the tremendous hardships my grandparents faced through  their experiences in living through the Indian boarding school era, the  assimilation era, and being at the forefront of moving our people into  the modern era, I am here to advocate for the issues and policies that  will offer a clean planet and opportunities now and for future  generations.   I am the product of generations of people who planted and harvested  since time immemorial. My ancestors cared for the land, respected our  air and our water, and passed down those responsibilities to their  future generations.   It is because of my people and the first people on this continent  that we stand here today on this floor. In fact, our Constitution was  largely influenced by the Iroquois Confederacy. Tribes here on the East  Coast had official relationships with the crowned heads of Europe.   When we talk about Native American history, we must recognize that  Native American history is American history, and throughout this  history, our ancestors held fast to a belief that our people would  endure.   We are reminded of our resilience by people like: Joy Harjo, from the  Muscogee Creek Nation, the first Native American poet laureate in our  country's history, named just this year.   Our colleague, Sharice Davids, my sister, as one of the first Native  American women elected to Congress in our country's history.   Ruth Anna Buffalo, is a citizen of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara  Nation from North Dakota, a State legislator who is fighting to end the  crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and to make her State  more equitable for its indigenous citizens.   Tommy Orange, a Cheyenne and Arapaho award-winning writer from  Oakland.   Tatanka Means, a Navajo actor and activist, and so many more.   This month is set aside to celebrate the contributions that Native  Americans have made to our country and to recognize that there is so  much more that the Federal Government must do to ensure that Native  nations have every opportunity afforded to every American, which  includes healthcare, education, public safety, housing, and economic  development.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin  (Ms. Moore), my friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr.  Case).   (Mr. CASE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, this Native American Heritage Month, let  us pay honor and respect to those who came before us. Let us never  forget the genocide and racism that is so much of our history. Let us  all work together to ensure that the future for the Native Americans  and Native Hawaiians in our country is as promising as it is for any  American living here currently.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H9052]]                                ____________________
