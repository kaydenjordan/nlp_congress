 Mr. Speaker, 70 years ago this week, Secretary of State  George Marshall proposed an ambitious plan to rebuild Europe following  the devastation of World War II.   Out of the Marshall Plan's transatlantic spirit of shared interests  and economic cooperation, stronger military integration arose in the  form of NATO. NATO, alongside the European Union, have formed the  pillars of a safe, secure, and strong Europe while promoting the U.S.  security and economic interests, our interests.   We must be firm in our commitment to article 5 of the NATO treaty. If  America's commitment to the alliance is doubted, either by other NATO  countries or adversaries of NATO, the peace secured by the United  States and its allies will be threatened, make no mistake about it.   This is the longest peacetime period in Europe in over 1,000 years,  which is really remarkable, and we should not take it for granted. It  is our responsibility in Congress and in the White House to ensure that  global order secured by NATO is strengthened, not damaged.   So it is important that we recognize this 70th anniversary of the  Marshall Plan.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unable to be present for rollcall votes  taken on the House floor on June 8, 2017 as I had to return to  California for medical reasons.
