 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, today, I ask for my colleagues'  support for my amendment to cut $10 million from this appropriations  bill and contribute those funds instead toward deficit reduction.   This particular $10 million is set aside to increase diversity in  biomedical research.   The Federal Government has an addiction to growth and expansion. Find  a problem? Just create a new program and assign a few bureaucrats to  handle it, and that will somehow allegedly fix the problem.   Under this administration, you don't have to set aside special money  to support diversity. President Biden has made it very clear through  nearly every executive action that he takes that every agency should  look at every issue through a diversity lens.   The Biden administration makes everything about race anyway. We  should not believe they need a few more million in taxpayer dollars  just to make a difference in this aspect.   At some point, the Biden administration needs to stop dividing  everyone based on the way they look and instead focus on actual health  solutions for all Americans in need.   Americans are tired of everything being about race. When it comes to  the future of biomedical research, we want to know that the best of the  best are researching ways to cure cancer, fight heart disease, and help  us lead longer and healthier lives. None of those are racial problems.  They are human problems.   Throughout our history, American innovation has been at the top of  the charts for finding breakthrough cures and therapeutics.   This year, through this bill, we are already set to invest in that  research, and we can spare the $10 million that focuses on diversity  and instead spend it on something that helps every American-- contributing to the spending reduction account that would actually  decrease our deficit.   Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will join me in this simple cost- saving amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we have made progress today. I am  glad to hear the gentlewoman from the other side of the aisle  recognizes there are differences between men and women. We may next  actually be able to define what a woman is and what a man is. I am glad  to hear that recognition from my friends on the other side of the  aisle.   If President Biden were serious about helping people, he would cut  our spending. He would renew American energy. He would secure the  southern border. In fact, there are millions of illegals pouring across  our border, costing taxpayers $150 billion a year.   While every issue is not a racial issue, as the administration would  have you think, and every issue is not a climate issue, as the  administration  [[Page H5778]]  would have you think, today, every issue is a border issue and a  spending issue. Yet, President Biden focused on woke initiatives like  the Justice40 Initiative that promotes equity across the Federal  Government.                                time  1330    Certainly today we would not criticize biomedical research. As a  matter of fact, we recognize the value that it brings to our country,  and I am thankful for those in the field who are doing their best to  help all Americans.   We want the research done by the best researchers for all Americans,  regardless of what any of them look like.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, today I ask for my colleagues'  support for my amendment to transfer $524.4 million from the National  Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to the spending  reduction account that would reduce our national debt and our current  deficit.   The way we throw around trillions of dollars and billions of dollars,  I guess $524 million doesn't seem like a lot here in Washington, but to  average Americans, that is real money.   Well, this office--formerly created by ObamaCare--brags about being a  leader in the scientific community's focus on socioeconomics, politics,  discrimination, of course, culture, and environment in relation to  health disparities.   I have heard enough there. Americans don't want politicized science.  We want scientific science. We don't want health research that divides  by race. We want health research that unleashes American ingenuity on a  horrific disease.   Let's talk about some of the studies that are associated with this  particular office: A report on how various racial groups have faced  COVID-19 discrimination; a program to address how--COVID-19  discriminates, of course. Didn't you know that?   Another program is a program to address how access to safe spaces-- safe spaces--impacts health, and of course, a program on how climate  change in and of itself is somehow racist.   I submit to my colleagues today that any actual scientific health  innovations that come out of this office could develop in one of the  other offices or projects that the $43 billion--with a b--NIH budget  supports.   We don't need to set aside $524 million to focus on race once again  and publish more politically charged studies that do nothing to  contribute to meaningful health outcomes.   I hope my colleagues will join me to reduce spending, reduce the size  of government, and support the best possible health research that is  not done on a racist basis.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it continues to be clear that our  friends on the other side just cannot tolerate or abide by the absence  of racist initiatives or disparate treatment based on race, but  Americans are done with the politicization of science, especially after  the tyrannical government mandates that shut down the economy during  the coronavirus.   President Biden promised a few years ago a return to normalcy, but  his administration has only weaponized the government against the  American people even more.   I wish the Biden administration would focus as much on cutting the  reckless spending, securing our border, and putting Americans first as  they do on dividing people along racial lines.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, today, I ask for my colleagues'  support for my amendment to cut $28 million from this bill and  contribute that money to paying down our deficit.   My amendment takes the funds from the allocation to minority AIDS  prevention. The targeted $28 million is actually a small fraction of  what Americans pay in research and prevention of AIDS.   According to HIV.gov, we spent $28 billion--1,000 times this targeted  amount--on the domestic response to HIV/AIDS this year.   The government approach to tackling HIV/AIDS encompasses five  agencies and countless offices within those agencies. Our Housing and  Urban Development Department, our Justice Department, our Defense  Department, all of them spent money to combat AIDS last year. In fact,  there are at least a dozen programs focused on AIDS, and the more you  look into it, the more it represents the typical, bloated, ineffective  government spending.   My amendment targets, again, one-tenth of a percent of those funds  that are racially focused because, once again, we are dividing people  and our research based on race, which does nothing to help all  Americans. Race can be a contributing factor in health outcomes, but  that doesn't mean it needs special funding.   If a disease disproportionately impacts a certain group, that will  come out in the research and that group will benefit more from the  program. The funds themselves should not be allocated based on race but  allocated based on need.   I hope my colleagues will join me in reducing a small amount of  spending for an issue that our government already spends billions upon.   If Members are bold enough to cut spending, we can contribute to  reducing our deficit, and that is an issue that actually helps all  Americans regardless of race.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reiterate, there are over a dozen  agencies that focus on this issue, and this amendment reduces by one- tenth of 1 percent the amount that is allocated toward AIDS research  and prevention in our country today. This is the portion which is race  based, which of course my friends across the aisle cannot tolerate any  reduction or elimination of any program that is race based because  their policies seek to divide the country.   This $28 million may seem like a drop in the bucket of what does need  to be cut from our Federal spending, but this is a start.   I urge my colleagues to support ensuring funding allocation that is  based on need and not based on race and to vote in favor of this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we have the opportunity today to  stop treating people differently based on race and to cut our spending  together in one amendment. I support it, and I urge passage of it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this evening, I rise in support  of my amendment to ensure that no funds will be used to require  universities to enforce COVID-19 vaccine requirements for students and  faculty.   My amendment is important for two reasons. The first is because many  universities, unbelievably so, are still actively mandating COVID-19  vaccines for their students. Their students, mind you, Mr. Chairman,  were never at any serious risk of the virus.   At the start of the 2023-2024 school year, there were still nearly  100 universities in this country that required a COVID-19 vaccine to  attend their universities. Mr. Chairman, think of that. It has been  about 4 years since the China virus first came to the United States,  and the Federal Government finally, in May of this year, declared the  pandemic was over. For many of us, the remediation efforts were over as  soon as we realized what we suspected, that the masking up and the  vaccine requirements were exploited by a bureaucracy that was trying to  impose their will on normal Americans.   Yet, so many universities are still forcing students, who have likely  already contracted COVID at this point--everybody has had it by now.  Many of them were never sick with symptoms and all have recovered. In  the event that there were any serious risks, to begin with, it didn't  matter. They were required to take a vaccine that they didn't need and  didn't want.   The second reason it is important that my amendment is supported is  to  [[Page H5820]]  preemptively check the government authority, a government that has,  sadly, broken the trust of the American people on this and many other  issues. Over the last 3 years, we have seen this government push so  many unconstitutional vaccine mandates for healthcare workers who  treated us during the height of the virus, government employees,  members of the military and Armed Forces who were discharged for not  getting a vaccine, law enforcement officers, first responders, and lots  of other regular Americans and workers across the country.   In fact, the Biden administration is still spending money to promote  the COVID vaccine, and they have a program to pay for the vaccine for  uninsured Americans through the end of next year, the end of 2024.   We cannot assume that because the pandemic is officially over, the  anti-freedom vaccine agenda will stop. Students should be free to  pursue an education without the government violating their most basic  personal freedoms.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it should be chilling to Americans  as they watch the resistance to efforts to prevent the Federal  Government from funding and enforcing a vaccine requirement.   My friend on the other side said there is no vaccine requirement.  Then why would she not support an amendment that says the Federal  Government cannot enforce or require a vaccine mandate on a college  campus?   For that matter, the Federal Government doesn't require it, so how  about we say the Federal Government cannot require it? They cannot  require it, not that they don't require it but that they cannot require  it. We don't permit the Federal Government to require a vaccine  mandate.   Why would we even allow that to be an option?   Over the last few years, Americans watched their most basic,  fundamental freedom trampled on by this Federal Government: their right  to worship. There is a reason why the beginning of the Bill of Rights  starts with the freedom of religion. That is the first one. The right  to assemble was trampled upon, and the right to travel, freedom of  movement; the right to earn a living, to operate your business; and the  right to make basic medical decisions for yourself or even disclose  your own medical information, Mr. Chair.   America is done with tyrannical China virus mandates. Our economy is  still reeling from how the government crushed it during the COVID virus  and the disastrous policies of this administration.   I am sure if they could, the other side would reinstate mask mandates  right here in this Chamber and vaccine mandates all around the country  if given the opportunity.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support freedom and to vote in  favor of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, virtually all the universities in  this country are subsidized by Federal tax dollars. I encourage my  colleagues to join us in ensuring that there will be no vaccine  mandate.   Mr. Chairman, I ask all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
