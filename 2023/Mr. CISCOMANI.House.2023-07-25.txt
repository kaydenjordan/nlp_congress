 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the monumental  effort happening in my district of the Tucson Passport Center and  Western Passport Center.   The employees here are working around the clock--sometimes 7 days a  week--to help Americans across our country receive their passports  during an unprecedented surge in demand and clear the backlog of  applications.   These men and women are not only helping Americans in a timely  manner, but they are also coming up with creative and innovative  solutions so travelers' plans are not disrupted.   A record one-half million passport applications are being submitted  every week--every single week--by our friends and our neighbors.  Families going on vacation, students studying abroad, business  travelers seeking trade opportunities, whatever the reason, Americans  are traveling abroad like never before, and they aren't going to get  very far without a passport.   The Western Passport Center is seeing upwards of 200 in-person  emergency and urgent traveler counter appointments per day.   The Tucson Passport Center has ramped up organizations to print  80,000 passports per day, working in tandem with their colleagues in  Arkansas to supply the 29 passport agencies and centers across the  country.   Last month alone, Tucson printed 1.1 million passports--eclipsing the  million they printed the month before.   I am honored to have these passport centers in Arizona's Sixth  Congressional District. These individuals are really stepping up on  behalf of myself, my constituents, and all the people they have helped.  I thank them for a job well done.                            ____________________
