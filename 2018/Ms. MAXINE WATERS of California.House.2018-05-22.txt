 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I get into the remarks that I prepared, I think I  had better share this information with my colleagues. The FDIC released  its quarterly banking profile today for the first quarter of 2018, and  reported that banks made more money than they ever have. $56 billion in  profits in a single quarter represents a 27.5 percent surge compared to  2017. Some of these profits came from that so-called tax bill that we  passed, which we know was the Republican tax scam law.  [[Page H4341]]    Democrats passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act to prevent another financial crisis and protect  consumers, investors, and our economy. The 2008 financial crisis  resulted in 9 million people losing their jobs, 11 million people  losing their homes to foreclosure, and the loss of $13 trillion in  wealth. It was an economic catastrophe that must never be repeated. Now  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are determined to help  this President dismantle reforms that are designed to protect us from  that kind of devastation to communities.   Republicans are trying to pass this bill off as an effort solely  designed to benefit small community banks. But the truth is, the bill  is packed with poisonous provisions that benefit the megabanks like  Wells Fargo and companies like Equifax. It also weakens critical  mortgage protections to ensure borrowers can afford their loans, and  prevent discrimination and fraud.   One of the most harmful elements of this bill is its weakening of the  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, referred to as HMDA, which is a key tool  to detect and prevent discriminatory practices in the mortgage market.  S. 2155 would allow 85 percent of depository institutions to avoid ever  having to report new HMDA data required by Dodd-Frank, even though they  are already collecting the data, badly undermining efforts to ensure  fair lending.   But that is not all. This bill guts many of the protections Democrats  put in place to reduce the risk of bank failures and bailouts and  ensure that bank failures don't bring down the economy. It weakens  stress tests and capital requirements for big banks, and undermines  supervision of large foreign banks like Deutsche Bank.   There is more. Despite Equifax's carelessness in exposing the  personal data of 148 million Americans, S. 2155 rewards Equifax and the  other two national credit bureaus by funneling more business their way.  It also takes away Active Duty servicemembers' rights to sue the credit  bureaus, even if the bureaus fail to provide required free credit  monitoring, or notify them of scams involving their personal  information.   Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the many ways the bill would be  harmful. Republicans have stacked the bill with provisions that have  nothing to do with benefiting hardworking Americans and everything to  do with helping out Wall Street.   Donald Trump and the Republicans already gave a huge gift to big  corporations with the tax scam, which came at the expense of  hardworking Americans. Now they are pushing this rotten giveaway to  Wall Street and big banks that harms consumers and increases the risk  of another financial crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me repeat: The FDIC released its quarterly banking  profile today for the first quarter of 2018, and reported that banks  made more money than they ever have. I have to say this over and over  again: $56 billion in profits in a single quarter represents a 27.5  percent surge compared to 2017. Some of these profits came from the tax  scam bill that was passed.   These banks are just greedy. They will never get enough. They want to  do away with Dodd-Frank because Dodd-Frank is protecting consumers from  their fraud. Look how much money they are making. All they will tell  you is this is all about community banks.   But let me just tell you that community banks, credit unions, and the  economy are doing great with Dodd-Frank reforms in place. The banking  industry keeps making record profits, an average of $167 billion in  annual profits in the last 3 years. Banks have increased lending to  businesses by 80 percent since 2010. Community banks are outperforming  larger banks in increased lending. Credit unions are growing and have  increased lending by more than 10 percent in 2014, 2015, 2016, and  2017.   Mr. Speaker, what more do they want? How much more money do they want  from consumers? What is it they would have us do? What is it they would  have us get rid of in Dodd-Frank that is protecting the average  consumer, everyday working people? What would they have us do so that  they can make more money?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, some of the Senators  are saying they wish that they had never voted for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of  the Small Business Committee and a senior member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  20 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished Democratic  whip.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), the senior member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investment of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York.    May I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), a valued member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a very hardworking  progressive leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), co-chair of the  House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    I continue to reserve the balance of  my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of Mr.  Hensarling how many speakers he has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me again share with you what should be breaking news  tonight: the FDIC released its quarterly banking profile today for the  first quarter of 2018 and reported that banks made more money than they  ever have.   Mr. Speaker, $56 billion in profits in a single quarter represents a  27.5 percent surge compared to 2017. Some of these profits came from  the Republican tax reform bill that we have called a tax scam law.   The community banks, credit unions, and the economy are doing great  with Dodd-Frank reforms in place. The banking industry keeps making  record profits--an average of $167 billion in annual profits the last 3  years.   Banks have increased lending to businesses by 80 percent since 2010.  Community banks are outperforming larger banks in increased lending,  and the credit unions are growing and have increased lending by more  than 10 percent in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.   Despite all of that, we have this pay of CEOs of banks that  represents so many times more than the median salary in their banks.  Specifically, Wells Fargo's CEO made $17.4 million in 2017, 291 times  the company's median salary. This is in spite of the fact that Wells  Fargo has a track record of consumer abuses while demonstrating that  the numerous fines imposed upon the bank have not been a sufficient  deterrent to stop its pattern of appalling practices.   Let me just identify some of those practices: opening 3.5 million  fraudulent credit card and deposit accounts, for which they were fined  $185 million. It was so bad that former Chair Yellen capped the bank's  size until it cleans up its act.   In addition to that, they were found to have illegal student loan  servicing practices; inappropriate checking account overdraft fees;  unlawful mortgage lending practices, such as overcharging veterans for  refinance loans; and charging customers for automobile insurance  policies they did not need, which resulted in some customers losing  their vehicles.    They were fined $1 billion, but it really doesn't make them any  different. It is just a cost of doing business.   Yet we have my friends on the opposite side of the aisle who come and  ask us to be lenient on the banks, to do away with the Dodd-Frank  reforms, and to forget about what happened in 2008. Somehow it is all  right for these greedy banks to continue the practices that they have.  Despite the fact that Dodd-Frank reined them in, they are doing very  well.   S. 2155, again, is not a community bank bill, and it certainly does  not help consumers, so we should not pretend that that is the case.  Instead of considering improvements to this Senate bill or advancing  narrowly tailored relief, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are rubberstamping S. 2155 and advancing a Wall Street wish list that  could jeopardize the stability of our country's financial system.   So, instead of considering a bill to address concerns raised by  community banks, one that I am sure could easily pass both bodies with  overwhelming bipartisan support, House Republicans have instead decided  to take up a bill that is largely designed to fulfill the agenda of  Wall Street's megabanks. Passing this bill with broad support would  send the wrong message to regulators to accelerate their deregulatory  efforts for Wall Street.   It is unfortunate that megabanks have once again piggybacked onto the  substantial goodwill and support that exists to help ease the  regulatory burden for community banks.   S. 2155 is a dangerous measure that weakens key consumer protections  and will make it harder, not easier, to combat unfair mortgage lending  practices. The bill takes advantage of people just trying to make ends  meet for the benefit of the largest banks that are making record  profits.   Make no mistake: I support our Nation's community banks and credit  unions, and I support tailored regulatory relief for those  institutions. That is a fact that I have made clear through my support  of numerous individual measures which have advanced through this  Congress, as well as through my community bank regulatory relief bill  from last Congress.                                time  1515    I will continue to oppose any efforts to use regulatory relief for  community banks as a vehicle to ram through deregulation for bad actors  and megabanks.   If my words and the words of my colleagues here today are not enough  of a warning, then I would urge Members to listen to the pleas of  hundreds of consumer, civil rights, veteran, religious, and labor  groups that strongly oppose S. 2155.   Though some of my colleagues in Congress may have short memories, the  millions of Americans who lost their homes, their jobs, and their  wealth during the 2008 financial crisis did not.   So I oppose this bill. I want the Members of Congress to stand up on  this very important legislation and say to the greedy banks and the  megabanks: No, you are not going to get away with these kinds of  actions anymore.   Everything that you have done to try to undermine the Dodd-Frank  reforms have resulted in more groups coming out to say: Congress, when  are you going to stop these banks? They are making plenty of money.  They are increasing their profits. Their CEOs are making high salaries.  What more do you want from them?  [[Page H4349]]    I think that our consumers deserve better than any attempt to try and  relieve them of those regulatory actions that would support our  consumers. I would ask for a resounding ``no'' vote on this bill that  would only feed into the greediness of the major banks of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
