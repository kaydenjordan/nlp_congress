 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of this legislation carrying the  Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act  to the Senate for immediate consideration to safeguard our most  fundamental constitutional right, the right to vote.   We took an oath to protect this country from all threats, foreign and  domestic. Today, we face a domestic threat from those seeking to gain  and hold power by suppressing votes and nullifying election results.  Congress must combat this threat by ensuring equal and unencumbered  access to the ballot box and ensuring an accurate vote count.   It is time to choose. Will we uphold our oath and protect this  fragile democracy, or will we subvert the Constitution and fetter the  franchise?   I want to remind the previous speaker that we did not have Jim Crow  before there was Jim Crow, and we had it until 1954. I used to teach  this stuff called history, and I will say to my colleagues: Anything  that has happened before can happen again.   It was the lack of the vote that had 95 years between George  Washington Murray, who was the last African American to represent South  Carolina here in this body, until I came along in 1992--95 years.   Why?   Because the right to vote was taken away and election results were  nullified. We are not going back.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I first got interested in and started  studying history as an 8-year-old. I grew up in a parsonage where my  brothers and I were required, every morning before breakfast, to recite  a Bible verse and, every evening before retiring to bed, we had to  share with our parents a current event.   We didn't have television. Therefore, in order to carry out that  rule, we had to read the newspapers. It was delivered to our home every  afternoon. Today, those who are living down in my hometown of Sumter,  you get the Sumter Daily Item in the morning. Back then it was an  afternoon paper.   It was my interest in the Presidential campaign of Harry Truman that  attracted me to politics. Harry Truman ascended to the Presidency from  the Vice Presidency. Of course, no one gave him a chance to get elected  on his own. He did not have, according to conventional wisdom, what it  took, and he was going to be up against this scion, this big-time  prosecutor from New York, Thomas Dewey.   In fact, one Chicago newspaper was so assured of the outcome, they  didn't bother to wait on the results to write the headlines for their  newspapers the day after the election. All of us remember that  headline: ``Dewey Wins.'' When the votes were counted, all the votes  were counted, Truman had been elected President.   That always intrigued me, this man of limited educational background,  a disability, without any of all of the trappings of what would make  one a big-time leader. Of course, when Truman left office, he was not  very popular with a lot of people. In fact, his popularity was pretty  low.   But as we look back on history, and people continue to write about  history, they keep upgrading Truman. Most places I see now, he is in  the top ten. In my opinion, he is in the top five. I consider myself,  to this day, a Truman Democrat.   After studying history, I went on to teach it. I became a firm  believer in George Santayana's admonition that those who cannot  remember history--of course, he said ``the past''--are condemned to  repeat it. That is what brings me to this floor today.   It has been a long, long time since I have stayed here on what we  call getaway day to address this body during what we call Special  Orders.   I listened intently today as we debated the legislation that was a  vehicle by which we would send two pieces of legislation: The Freedom  to Vote Act, a bill that was proposed by Senator Joe Manchin, and the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill that this body  approved and sent over to the Senate as H.R. 4. Upon John Lewis' death,  I came to this floor and asked and received unanimous consent to change  the name of H.R. 4, to rename it in honor of John Lewis, and this body  granted unanimous consent for that to happen.   Now, John Lewis and I first met as 19-year-old college students. I  was in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He was down in Nashville, Tennessee.  We met on the campus of Morehouse College, where the Vice President was  on the day before yesterday, I think it was. It was also the weekend  when I first met Martin Luther King, Jr.   Now, as is often the case--and we saw quite a bit of it today--a  disagreement cropped up between us so-called Young Turks, those of us  who were in SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee--in  fact, this was the second organizational meeting of SNCC--and SCLC,  which was being run by Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and  others.   We asked Dr. King to come and meet with us so we could try to  reconcile our differences. Dr. King came and agreed to a 1-hour  meeting. That meeting convened at 10 p.m. in the evening. It was not  over until 4 a.m. the next morning. I always refer to that evening and  that meeting as my Saul-to-Paul transformation. I came out of that  meeting a changed man--well, I guess, boy. I have never been the same.   I started reading everything I could about Dr. King. I went back to  my campus, and I got his book, his first book, ``Stride Toward  Freedom,'' and, of course, all the way down through his last book,  ``Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community.''   I interacted with him several times over the years. After the 1965  Voting Rights Act, one of Dr. King's first trips was to the little town  of Kingstree, South Carolina, a rural town in Williamsburg County that  is currently in my district. When he came that day, he came to talk to  us about all the marches we were having. I was living in Charleston at  the time. My late wife and I got in our little Falcon and drove to  Kingstree to be a part of that meeting.   Dr. King talked that day about marching. We had marched to integrate  lunch counters. We had marched to get off the back of the bus. We had  marched for a lot of social things. But he said to us on that day: It  is time to march to the ballot boxes. He put a new definition on what  marching was all about. I remember that day as if it were yesterday.   In fact, not long ago, the local community decided to have a 50th  anniversary celebration of that event and called me and asked would I  attend. I told them I would be glad to attend.                                time  1300    Of course, I later got a phone call from a reporter who asked me what  I was going to say at this 50th anniversary. I told the reporter, I  said: Well, I think I will reminisce a little bit about that day and  the speech he gave.   And he says: Well, did you see it on television? How do you know  about the speech?   I said: I was there.  [[Page H185]]    The reporter didn't quite believe that I was there, and of course, he  questioned me, wanting to know what I remembered most about that day.   I said to him: The thing I remember most about that day was that  there was a very big storm. In fact, the storm was so bad that, on our  way there, we had to stop and wait it out. When I got there, I was sure  that we were not going to have a celebration, but the sun came out, and  Dr. King came. But there was so much rain in that cow pasture, I told  him, that we were in, it was not very conducive for the convention.   The reporter was kind of quiet, and he hung up. A few days later, the  reporter called me back. The reporter had gone to the Weather Bureau to  check out my story about that day and sheepishly reported to me that he  had checked it out and that my description of that day was pretty  accurate.   I said: Well, I lived through it. The things you live through are the  kinds of things you remember most, and you remember them best.   I have lived through a lot, growing up in South Carolina. I remember  the conversations I had with my parents. My mother was a beautician. As  you can imagine, a lot of conversations go on in the beauty shop.   So when my mother would sit down with me, we would often have  discussions about information that flowed throughout the beauty shop.  In fact, I wrote about one day, coming home from school. One of the  rules we had was that we had to stop by the beauty shop to report in  after school every day to make sure that things had gone okay.   On this particular day, when I went into the beauty shop to make my  report, there was a lady there that had grown up with my mother in the  cotton field adjacent to the one that she grew up in over in Lee  County, South Carolina.   When I walked in, I spoke, and this lady turned to me and says: My,  my, how much you have grown since I last saw you. My goodness, she  said, your voice is beginning to change.   Then she asked me a question, what it is that you want to be when you  grow up. That question was asked of us very often back then. I began to  tell her how proud I was of that background that I had developed since  1948 studying Harry Truman and how I had developed this interest in  politics and government. I told her I wanted to grow up to be a Member  of the United States Congress.   That lady looked at me and very sternly said: Son, don't you let  anybody else hear you say that again.   That lady was not throwing cold water on my dreams. She just felt  that a little Black boy in Sumter, South Carolina, should not have  those kinds of dreams and aspirations. It was not safe for a little  Black boy to have those kinds of dreams.   My mother never said anything that day, but that night, when she  closed the beauty shop, she came into the house and called me to the  kitchen table, and she sat me down.   She said: Now, James, don't you let what that lady said to you today  ruin your dreams. You stay in school, you study hard, you stay out of  trouble, and you will be able to live out your dreams and your  aspirations.   My mom did not live to see me get elected to Congress. She died in  1971. I didn't get here until 1992. But I think about her almost every  time I come into this Chamber, how right she was.   So, today, looking back on that history, I recall from my studies  that the first civil rights bill passed by this Congress was passed in  1866, giving the former slaves the right of citizenship. Of course,  following that 1866 law, South Carolina held a constitutional  convention in 1868. That was a very interesting constitutional  convention.   I would like to share with you some of what took place in that  convention. There are two things kind of interesting about the  convention to me.   Number one is the majority of the attendees at that convention were  Black. It is kind of interesting.   The second one is there was an attendee at that convention, Robert  Smalls, who was there in 1868. Robert Smalls had been a slave until  1862. Just think about that. He was a delegate to the South Carolina  Constitutional Convention and would go on to serve 10 years in the  South Carolina legislature and another 10 years here in the United  States Congress--a former slave.   Now, I don't know how Robert Smalls felt about slavery. He didn't  like it. If he did, he would not have engineered the escape. He would  not have stolen the Planter and taken his whole family and friends and  delivered the Planter to the Union Army and got his freedom and $1,500  for having done so. And he turned that $1,500 into great wealth and had  become a great soldier in the Union Army.   Now, back then, Robert Smalls, a former slave, had not gone to  school. He didn't have a high school education, and therefore, though  he wanted to be, they would not have taken him into the Navy. He was  actually inducted into the Army and assigned to a Navy ship. That is  why you see some ships now named for Robert Smalls.   It was my great honor to be in Baltimore, Maryland, at the Baltimore  harbor to speak for the christening of the USS Robert Smalls.   Now, however Robert Smalls may have felt, after Robert Smalls gained  wealth, he went back to Beaufort, South Carolina, where he was born and  raised and where he had been a slave. He bought the house that he had  been a slave in. The McKee family that owned him legally, when they got  back, Mr. McKee, John McKee--I think John was his first name--had  passed away, and his wife was living in poor health and no wealth.   Robert Smalls went and got her and brought her to that house that she  had been the head of and he had been a slave in, and he nursed her,  kept her there until her death. He forgave, but Robert Smalls never  forgot.   He died in 1915, basically of a broken heart. Why? Because Robert  Smalls, who had been in that 1868 convention as a delegate, was also a  delegate in the 1895 South Carolina Constitutional Convention.   Now, in 1868, January 14, 1868, is when he got his State rights as a  full-fledged American citizen, and then in 1895, Robert Smalls was in  that convention. It was in that convention, September 10, 1895, that  Robert Smalls got all of his rights taken away.   As I said earlier today on this floor, any rights given by the State,  in this instance the United States, can be taken away by the States, in  this instance the United States. That is why I am fearful of what is  taking place, most especially in the other body.   What we did here today, sending those two bills to protect the voting  rights of people of color, is being threatened by the other body with a  filibuster. I have been saying for some time now that I believe very  strongly that constitutional rights ought not be subjected to the  filibustering whims of any one person.   We don't allow that for our budget matters. We call it reconciliation  when it comes to doing the budget so that you can pass it. If  everything in this bill applies to the budget, we can have a simple  majority to pass it. When the full faith and credit of the United  States was put at risk a couple of weeks ago, we worked around the  filibuster in order to raise the debt limit so as not to ruin the full  faith and credit of the United States of America. And you are telling  me that the same should not apply to basic constitutional rights?   As I said here on the floor today, as a result of that 1895  convention that took all of those rights away, in 1897, George  Washington Murray left the United States House of Representatives,  being the last Black person. At one point, of the four Black  Representatives in this House, three were from South Carolina.                                time  1315    The very first Black person ever elected to the United States  Congress--I want to clean that up because a lot of times I say that and  people start sending me pictures of Hiram Revels, and what's his name  down there in Louisiana. Look, they were Senators, and they were sent  to this Congress by their legislative bodies.   It was not until, what, 1913 when we changed the Constitution in 1913  to allow for the popular election of Senators. So the first person of  color, the first Black person to be elected to the United States  Congress was Joseph Rainey. We just named a room on the first floor of  this Capitol in his honor. It just so happens it was on the 150th  anniversary of his election, which I  [[Page H186]]  think was December 12, I believe, in a special election, December 12,  1870. And it just so happened that on that day, none of us knew it, but  when we got to the room that we named in his honor and we looked, guess  what number was on the room? Room 150. It is now named for Joseph  Rainey from Georgetown, South Carolina. He was the first one in 1870.   In 1897 George Washington Murray left this Congress. And because of  the Constitutional Convention, what they did in 1895, taking all the  rights of Black people away, not another Black person got elected to  this Congress from South Carolina until yours truly was elected in  1992: 95 years.   And for most of that time, well, I hadn't really counted all the days  and the years, but let me say this: For a major portion of that time,  if not most of it, Black people were in the majority in the State of  South Carolina. They were in the majority but had zero representation  here in this Congress, zero representation in the legislature, and zero  representation in governing bodies all over the State.   I remember the first Black in South Carolina that got elected to the  county council down in Beaufort, South Carolina. All of these things  happened in my lifetime.   And so what I am saying to this body today and what I am saying to  this great country of ours is that what we are doing here today in  allowing States to pass laws that take away voting rights and  privileges, just think about this, a State, one of my neighboring  States, Georgia, just passed a law that says not only are we going to  suppress, throw up all these barriers to voting, we aren't just going  to do that, but now if this line gets long and you are standing out  here in the hot weather trying to cast a vote and someone decides to  give you a bottle of water to quench your thirst, they just committed a  criminal act. You can give a bottle of water to anybody walking out on  the streets if they are thirsty, but if you give a bottle of water  while someone is standing to vote in line, you have just committed a  criminal act. I want the people of this country to think about that. I  want my friends in the other body to think about that.   And then it went even further. They have put into the law a mechanism  and a little entity, about I think three people, and sent them up to be  referees over whether or not the voting was to their liking, the  results. And if they do not like the results of the vote, they can  nullify the vote. That is what they just did.   You got 19 States--and I want to hasten to add here all of them are  not southern States--19 States, two of them up in the Northeast have  passed 34 laws and have introduced over 400 to make it difficult for  people to vote and to nullify the efforts of voters. That is Third  World stuff. That is banana republic stuff. That is not the stuff of  which America is made. And we are going to sit idly by and just watch  this happen?   Earlier today, one of my colleagues on the other side was upset  because someone has compared--I think maybe upset with the President.  In fact, one of my colleagues said as a southerner he was insulted by  President Biden's speech. And the basis I understand of the insult is  the fact that he called what these States are doing with these new laws  Jim Crow 2.0. I am not into all of this IT stuff, so I don't know what  that really means, but I know this: It sounds like I agree with him. I  am not insulted by that. Because Jim Crow was not Jim Crow until it  became Jim Crow.   Reconstruction--one of the reasons I sort of correct some of my  friends sometimes when they say it is because I don't want them to get  things muddled. I hear people talk all the time about me being the  first Black Congressman from South Carolina since Reconstruction. That  is not true. All nine of us, the eight before me and me, we are all  since Reconstruction.   Reconstruction didn't last but about 12 to 13 years based upon which  date you want to use, it didn't last. Reconstruction was over in 1876,  so Robert Smalls did not get elected until the 1880s. Robert Smalls got  elected since Reconstruction. No.   Reconstruction ended in 1876, and at the end of Reconstruction is  when all these so-called Jim Crow laws went into place. The Black Codes  went into place. Those things, those laws starting with the Supreme  Court decision in 1872, the Crescent decision coming out of Louisiana,  which is kind of interesting.   But Plessy v. Ferguson came out of Louisiana. And I want to thank the  Governor of Louisiana for having--after all these years--issued a  pardon to Homer Plessy, who is a man who was arrested and fined $25 for  riding in a forbidden car on the train that he had paid a first-class  ticket for and he was arrested putting in place separate but equal,  which was never equal.   And so I want to read to you something that was said in the 1895  convention by Robert Smalls. It is real interesting. These are the  words of a former slave: ``Since Reconstruction times'' and I am  quoting Robert Smalls, ``53,000 Negroes have been killed in the  South.'' Since Reconstruction. Remember now, Reconstruction ended in  1876. So somewhere between 1876 and 1895 when Robert Smalls made this  speech he says: `` . . . 53,000 Negroes have been killed in the South,  and not more than three White men have been convicted and''--he said  ``hung'' here, though I want everybody to know that I am educated  enough to know that should have been hanged--``for these crimes. I want  you to be mindful of the fact that the good people of the north are  watching this convention upon this subject. I hope you will make a  Constitution that will stand the test. I hope that we may be able to  say when our work is done that we have made as good a Constitution as  the one we are doing away with.''    Just think about that. They were doing away with the Constitution of  1868 that gave Robert Smalls and other Blacks the right to vote, gave  citizens those rights, and in 1895 he is saying, I'm hoping that when  we finish here today we will have made a new Constitution that is as  good as the one that we are getting rid of. I think Robert Smalls knew  very well what was in the making.   There is another gentleman in that Constitutional Convention with him  who also served in the Congress, Thomas E. Miller, he had served in the  Congress. And in order to get him to serve him in Congress, they made  it attractive for him to be the first president of South Carolina State  University where Joe Biden was a couple weeks ago and from which I  graduated. Thomas Miller spoke on this issue, as well.   But here is what I want you to understand. One of the things they  were putting in this Constitution was in order to get the right to vote  you had to be able to interpret sections of the Constitution of the  United States. You can't get the right to vote until you interpret the  Constitution. And now some of the sections are a little worse than  that.   In Alabama--we have all seen the stories--in order to get the right  to vote you had to be able to tell whoever was standing there--somebody  who probably couldn't even count, let alone understand the  Constitution--how many jelly beans were in a jar. These were laws  passed by States. And anybody who may think that that is silly to have  to be able to count or guess how many jelly beans are in a jar in order  to get the right to vote, that is no more silly than arresting somebody  for giving a bottle of water to somebody standing in line in the hot  sun.   That is how stupid some of these laws they are passing are. And we in  this body and my friends across the other side of this building are  condoning that, saying that we can't change this process to get rid of  that kind of silliness. But this is serious stuff.                                time  1330    ``How can you expect an ordinary man to understand and explain any  section of the Constitution, to correspond to the interpretation put  upon it by the manager of an election.''   And I guarantee you, some of these people--I knew some of them--who  were running these elections could not read the Constitution, much less  interpret it.   I want everybody to listen to this:   When by a recent decision of the Supreme Court, composed of the most  learned men in the State, two of them put one construction upon a  section of the Constitution and the other justice put an entirely  different construction upon it.  [[Page H187]]    How did we get 5-4 decisions in the United States Supreme Court?  Because five people think one way; four people think the other. Which  one of them would get the right to vote, interpreting the Constitution?  This is the kind of silliness here.   To embody such a provision in the election law would be, to me, that  every White man would interpret it all right and every Negro would  interpret it wrong.   And then Robert Smalls said, I appeal to the gentleman from Edgefield  to realize that he is not making the law for one set of men.   Robert Smalls said, ``Some morning, you may wake up to find that the  bone and sinew of your country is gone . . . I tell you that the Negro  is the bone and sinew of your country and you cannot do without him. I  do not believe you want to get rid of the Negro, else why did you  impose a high tax on immigration agents who might come here to get him  to leave?'' That is very insightful, very insightful.   Now, Thomas Miller, who had also served in Congress, and as I just  said, became the first President of South Carolina State, Thomas Miller  was a free-born attorney. He was a college graduate. And as I said, he,  too, had served in the Congress. As I told you earlier, in 1868, the  majority of the delegates were Black. In the 1895 convention, six  Blacks, only six. Thomas Miller was one of the six.   Tillman, Miller told the convention, condemned Reconstruction-era  political corruption but had ``not found voice eloquent enough, nor pen  exact enough to mention those imperishable gifts bestowed upon South  Carolina . . . by Negro legislators.'' That is what he said.   He said that ``We were 8 years in power. We had built schoolhouses,  established charitable institutions, built and maintained the  penitentiary system, provided for the education of the deaf and''--that  is a colloquial term that is no longer used--to the deaf and mute--you  can imagine what the other word is--and ``rebuilt the jails and  courthouses . . . In short,'' he says, ``we had reconstructed the  State.''   Now, the reason I point this out to you is because he was a majority  Black legislator in South Carolina that passed a law that provided for  free public education for everybody. Little old State of South Carolina  was the first State in the Union to provide for free public education  for everybody. Until that time throughout the South, only the elite  were provided education.   And as I said here, the school, the penitentiary system, the most  modern penal system had been created in South Carolina by a majority of  Black legislators; the school to educate the deaf and mute done by a  majority of the Black legislators. And that is what Thomas Miller was  talking about.   Now, I want to say something about what Robert Smalls had to say  about waking up and finding that the law you passed that was meant for  me may one day apply to you. We just saw that last year in January when  Georgia elected Senator Ossoff. Senator Ossoff ended up defeating an  incumbent Senator. Now, that incumbent Senator was David Perdue.   Now, let me tell you something interesting about that, and I think  that people better start thinking. Georgia decided several years ago--I  remember when it happened--that because there were so many Black people  voting, they decided to set up--and you can go back, I won't go through  it today, and read the debate that took place in the legislature.   When Georgia decided in order to win a general election in Georgia,  you had to have 50 percent plus 1. And man who proposed it argued on  the floor that he was doing that in order to dilute, to nullify the  effect of the Black vote, to make sure that you get to a 1-on-1 Black  versus White runoff requirement. He felt that if there were three or  four people in the general election and then the Black people voted in  unison, they could get a Black person elected to the Senate. And that  is not what he wanted to happen.   So he wanted to make sure that if there were more than two people  running and nobody gets 50 percent, then you have to have a runoff in  the general election between those two. And if one was Black and the  other was White, the White person was sure to win.   Well, that tells you how shortsighted he was, because that is exactly  what happened in that other election between Warnock and the incumbent  Senator. Now, Warnock got a smaller vote than the person he was in the  runoff with, but he didn't get 50 percent so they had to have a runoff.  David Perdue got 49.8 percent of the vote, but it was not 50 percent.   If they had not changed that law, David Perdue would have been  reelected to the United States Senate on that day back in November. He  never would have been in the runoff because he had 49.8 percent, but  they put in the law that you got to get 50 percent. So now he has got  to runoff. And he runs off against Ossoff and gets beat. He would have  been elected if Georgia had not changed.   Just like Robert Smalls told the people of South Carolina: You are  not making this law just for me. You are going to wake up one day and  this law is going to apply to you. Just ask David Perdue.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    On the other side, the gentleman was shortsighted in his  debate in the legislature simply because Warnock was in this runoff. It  was Black against White. But the people of Georgia decided they would  elect a Black guy. So the Georgia legislature was wrong on both fronts  when they put that law in place. The law that would have reelected  Perdue was taken away and they put in place a law that was supposed to  ensure his election, and he lost. And they lost on both fronts.    So I say to my friends in the Senate, and I have been talking to  them, and I am, quite frankly, very disappointed in my conversations  and that is why I decided to come to this floor today. I want to say to  them, they should be careful. They should be very, very careful because  what may look like a good thing to do today, may not be such a good  thing after it is operated for some time.   Madam Speaker, I will give you back a few of these minutes. I could  go on for some more. I have got some other things I probably should  have said and I may have already said some things that I should not  have said. But I did say I would say something interesting about that  first Constitutional Convention in 1895.   I just told you about free public schools, when in that  Constitutional Convention, the guy that put up the resolution calling  for free public schools was Robert Smalls. The penal system that they  put in place, that was the envy of the world, done by the majority of  Black legislators. I have talked about all that.   But there was something else that they proposed that they couldn't  get done. They had proposed in 1868 at that convention, the majority of  Black people tried to give the vote to women--in 1868. Something that  did not happen until the 19th amendment in the 1900s--whenever that  was--1920-something. Just to let you know that skin color has nothing  to do with the extent of progressive ideas or, what we might call,  enlightened thought.   Madam Speaker, I want to close with--I call it a poem. I used to  quote it pretty often. A German theologian, Lutheran theologian named  Martin--and I think I am pronouncing his last name right--Niemoller. It  isn't quite spelled that way, but I am not that equipped in the German  language but I think that is the way it is pronounced. And I close with  his words:         First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out       because I was not a socialist.
