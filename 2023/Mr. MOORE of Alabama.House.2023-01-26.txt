 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Evelyn Holmes-Smith from Enterprise High School's wrestling team for  winning the Alabama State Championship, making her a three-time State  champion. Only a sophomore, Evelyn posted a 36-0 record on the season.   Evelyn's perfect season helped the Wildcat girl's wrestling team  finish fourth out of 59 teams across the State of Alabama. She hopes to  continue wrestling in college and represent the United States in the  Olympic Games one day.   Evelyn is known for her quick takedowns on the mat. When she came to  my office last year, she demonstrated a few of her signature wrestling  moves, as you can see here in the photo.   On behalf of Alabama's Second District, I congratulate Evelyn Holmes- Smith and the Enterprise High School wrestling team on an impressive  year.   Go Wildcats.                            ____________________
