 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my dear  friend, Emily Stover DeRocco, a generous spirit and dedicated public  servant who inspired others to discover their purpose and to follow  their dreams.   Known for getting things done, Emily headed to Washington after  graduating from Penn State University, determined to find a role  working in the Federal Government, hoping to make a difference in the  lives of everyday Americans.   As the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training in  the George W. Bush administration, Emily was instrumental in  redesigning our country's workforce development programs, particularly  in strategically realigning education and economic development  initiatives with the needs of  [[Page H5099]]  the business community, workforce development coming together with our  manufacturing sector and, in particular, for emerging technologies.   After leaving the Bush administration, Emily became a leader in the  manufacturing sector when she joined the Manufacturing Institute as  their president. Under her innovative leadership, the institute  researched and confirmed the changing workforce needs and, in response,  implemented national strategy on education and workforce reform.   Emily founded E3, an aptly named consulting firm--educate, engage,  employ--focused on helping others by linking education, workforce, and  economic development, yet again harnessing her creativity and her  special, keen ability to connect people and bring them together.   In addition to her incredible career, Emily was a loving mother and  wife. She met the love of her life while working full-time at the  Department of the Interior and taking classes at Georgetown Law School,  tenaciously walking across the stage while 8 months pregnant with her  incredible daughter, Lauren.   Emily spent her life coaching and mentoring others and impacted my  life and work tremendously. She was, in fact, on everyone's speed dial.   Her work led her to Detroit, Michigan, where she collaborated and led  the workforce development efforts for the Lightweight Innovations for  Tomorrow Institute, a public-private partnership intent on harnessing  new technologies for our automotive sector and other industries of  scale. She was the workforce leader.   I had the privilege of speaking on numerous panels with her all over  the country, with our friends at the NATC, ASME, in the defense sector,  at NIMS, at NAM, and of course, yet again, the Manufacturing Institute.    The need for workforce talent is the conversation of today. I met  Emily in the middle of the Great Recession, when unemployment was  through the roof, yet there were open jobs in our manufacturing firms  all across the country. It is not a simple formula.   What Emily sought to change and address in this country by training  not only the next generation of workers but an existing workforce in  the 21st century begat many new challenges: the advent of the digital  age and the combination of computer technologies with our old-school  manufacturing devices and pieces of equipment. She led the way.   While she left us suddenly, she also left a legacy of work. We thank  her so much for her service and her inspiration and the mark that she  made on this country.                            ____________________
