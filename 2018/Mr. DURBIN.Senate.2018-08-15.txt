 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for vote  No. 182 on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of A. Marvin  Quattlebaum, Jr., to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit.  Had I been present, I would have voted aye on the motion to invoke  cloture.                            ____________________
