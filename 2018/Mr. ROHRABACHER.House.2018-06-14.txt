 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a simple but crucial  amendment to the THRIVE Act to ensure that local governments have a say  in which sober living homes are able to participate in this  demonstration program.   My amendment would require the nonprofits who apply for funding under  this bill to prove that the Federal dollars they receive are  distributed only to facilities that have permission from the relevant  local government to operate in that location.   The proliferation of unlicensed sober living homes in residential  communities in my district and throughout our country has had a  deleterious impact on local residents and has not well-served the drug  and alcohol addicts the program is supposed to help.                                time  1430    Many--not all, but many--of these facilities are owned and operated  by unscrupulous actors. These bad actors totally disregard the impact  on local residents of the neighborhoods as well as those who reside in  the sober living homes themselves. The Federal Government must not  subsidize this.   It is not only the surrounding neighborhood that suffers in these  circumstances, but also recovering addicts whose treatment facility has  no oversight and sometimes no actual personal program for recovery.  This bill with my amendment produces a balanced first step toward  helping the victims of the opioid epidemic while safeguarding the  rights of families, homeowners, and local communities.   I am grateful for the support of my friend and colleague Congressman  Barr, and I am grateful for his support through this amendment. I urge  the rest of my colleagues to join with us and vote in favor of this  amendment.   I would also note that it is the Federal Fair Housing Act that  shields the bad actors and prevents local governments from doing  anything meaningful about the problems associated with sober living  homes. Municipalities face costly litigation for trying to address  their transient nature, and local residents often experience an  increase in crime in their neighborhoods, not to mention other threats  to their quality of life.   The THRIVE Act does not address the Fair Housing Act, but I have  authored a bill that would do this. I encourage a serious consideration  of H.R. 5724, the Restoring Community Oversight of Sober Living Homes  Act.   My bill would narrowly amend the Fair Housing Act to return to local  governments their proper zoning authority to manage sober living homes  in a manner acceptable to the local people and something that will help  those drug addicts as well as the local community. So I gladly offer  this amendment and ask my colleagues to consider both this amendment as  well as the bill that I will submit on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time
