 Madam President, today, I rise to honor Maj. Stephen Del  Bagno, a U.S. Thunderbird pilot who was killed on April 4, 2018, when  his F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed at the Nevada Test and Training Range,  which is north of Nellis Air Face Base. At just 34, Major Del Bagno's  life was cut too short, but his legacy of leadership, commitment to  excellence, and service to our country will be preserved by all those  who had the privilege of knowing him.   I wish to begin by saying that my wife Lynne and I offer our deepest  condolences to Major Del Bagno's family and loved ones. We join the  Thunderbirds, Nellis Air Force Base, and the Nevada community in  mourning this heavy loss.   Major Del Bagno grew up in Valencia, CA, and he graduated from Utah  Valley State University. He received his commission when he graduated  from Officer Training School at Maxwell Air Force Base in 2007.   Called ``Cajun'' by his team, he was in his first season with the  Thunderbirds. The Thunderbirds are also known as America's Ambassadors  in Blue. They are an elite team of highly experienced fighter pilots.  In fact, only 325 officers have had the honor of wearing the  distinguished Thunderbird patch. They are the best of the best.   In June of 2017, Nellis Air Force Base announced that Major Del Bagno  was the first F-35 pilot to serve with the Thunderbirds. He served as  the team's slot pilot and flew Thunderbird 4. Brigadier General  Leavitt, commander of the 57th Nellis Air Force Base, called Major Del  Bagno an integral part of that team.  [[Page S2301]]    Prior to joining the Thunderbirds, Major Del Bagno was a civilian  flight instructor, he was a corporate pilot, he was a skywriter, and he  was a banner tow pilot. According to the Thunderbirds, he logged more  than 3,500 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. That  included 1,400 hours as an Air Force pilot.   In his free time, he enjoyed snowboarding, he enjoyed water sports,  and he enjoyed spending time with his family.   Major Del Bagno was laid to rest on April 15, 2018, at a memorial  service at his alma mater, Saugus High School, in Santa Clarita, CA.  More than 1,000 people attended the memorial and joined together to  commemorate his life--a true testament to his impact on the community.  During the service, his friends, his family, and fellow wingmen offered  loving tributes about his skill, his passion for aviation, and pride in  being a member of the Air Force.   Ilene Block, a former guidance counselor for the school, told a local  television affiliate that Stephen was ``always giving back'' and said  that he often visited the high school to talk to students about his  love for flying. His name will soon be added to a wall of heroes at  Saugus High School.   Lt. Col. Kevin Walsh, the Thunderbirds' commander, said that Major  Del Bagno ``lived to fly and inspire the next generation.'' He also  said that he will be remembered ``as a talented fighter pilot and a  great friend.''   Selfless, driven, caring, mentor, an inspiration, a big dude with an  even bigger heart, brother--those are the words that Major Del Bagno's  fellow Thunderbirds used to describe him.   In a video tribute from the Thunderbirds, one said:         Cajun--you had this way of immediately making people feel       special, interesting, and included. The world needs more of       that. And now, your memory is going to inspire all of us to       be a little bit more like you. And hopefully we'll make you       proud. We miss you and love you.    The loss of Major Del Bagno is an enormous tragedy that has struck  the heart of the Thunderbirds, Nellis Air Force Base, and every life  that he touched.   Major Del Bagno's death is a reminder that we are all forever  indebted to the men and women who answer the call to serve this country  and stand guard, training and preparing each day for when duty calls.   It is a reminder of what they give up and what they risk when they  bravely step up to the plate so that we can remain an extraordinary and  free nation.   It is also a reminder of the families, like the Del Bagnos, who have  lost a loved one and paid a price beyond measure. They deserve our  lasting support.   I urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the life of  Major Del Bagno and his unbounded determination that set him apart.  These are the people whose characters embody the American spirit, the  people who truly humble us and inspire us through their unwavering  commitment, the people who represent the very best that this country  has to offer.   I close with this. In a video honoring Major Del Bagno's memory, the  Thunderbirds talked about how he would spend time teaching kids about  flying as a Thunderbird. They said he chose to share his passion with  kids. In that same video, there was footage of Major Del Bagno  responding to a question about advice for kids who want to be pilots in  the Air Force. He talked about the five P's of success. This is what he  said:         Find your passion. Find your purpose. Be persistent in your       pursuit. Be personable . . . so humble, credible, and       approachable. And then it'll pay off. People are going to       tell you ``no'' along the way--it's just a test of your       resolve. If you really want it, go out and make that known.    I am confident that Major Del Bagno's legacy will inspire the next  generation of fighter pilots, as well as Nevadans and Americans around  the country, for decades to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 95th  birthday of Mr. David Fulstone, a friend, neighbor, and a beloved  member of our northern Nevada community. It was an honor to have the  opportunity to celebrate this momentous occasion with him earlier this  month.   Mr. Fulstone was born on April 1, 1923, in San Francisco, CA. He was  raised in Smith Valley, NV--a place I am proud to call home--on his  family's ranch that sat in the heart of the valley and was the center  of his father's sheep ranching operation. Growing up, he enjoyed  working on the ranch, attending sheep camp, and playing basketball. In  fact, he was Smith Valley High School's star basketball player.   In 1942, Mr. Fulstone was one of just 13 students to graduate from  Smith Valley High School. Later that year, he married Angelina  Margaroli, and together, they had two children, DeeAnn Fulstone and  David Hill Fulstone II. They are the proud grandparents of Mathew  Rotchy, KimberLee Rotchy, Josh Fulstone, and Jeffrey Fulstone.   The Fulstones bought their ranch in 1949 and, for more than six  decades, grew hay, garlic, and onions. Although he retired in 2010, Mr.  Fulstone continues to enjoy gardening and sharing his vegetables with  neighbors and friends and still pursues his passion for agriculture by  staying informed on policy issues affecting the industry. Mr. Fulstone  is the recipient of many awards in our community, including the Farmer  of the Year award.   Whether it is serving as grand marshall of the Lyon County Parade, a  member of the Nevada Farm Bureau, or on various local boards, Mr.  Fulstone has made many contributions to northern Nevada and continues  to be an integral part of Lyon County. Even at 95, he remains active as  a member of the Yerington Episcopal Church and is the oldest and  longest serving member of the Yerington Rotary Club, which recognized  him with the Paul Harris award.   As the senior Senator from Nevada, I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating David Fulstone on his accomplished 95 years and  recognizing his decades of leadership and service to our community.  Lynne and I send Mr. Fulstone and his family our best wishes, and I  offer my appreciation for all that he has done to make our northern  Nevada community an even better place to live.                            ____________________
