 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the first  person born in Guatemala to serve in the United States House of  Representatives.   I know the Guatemalan people have lived through many difficult times,  and I know this because I was born there during the civil war. My  parents made the heartbreaking decision to send me to live with my  uncle in the United States when I was a little girl.   But through it all, the people of Guatemala have not given up. They  have continued to work to make a better life for their children and for  their children's children. They have worked for justice, for democracy,  and they have won important victories.   In 1996, the efforts of the Guatemalan people ended the civil war;  and in 2007, their search for justice led to the creation of the  International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, an innovative  institution whose mission was to help rid the country of corruption and  organized crime. Working with brave Guatemalan judges and prosecutors,  CICIG made real progress in improving Guatemala's justice system.   Then, in 2015, Guatemalans of all ages and political stripes took to  the streets to call for the resignation of massively corrupt President  Otto Perez Molina, and they won.   The long struggle of the Guatemalan people has led to a country that  is safer and more just. The country's problems are far from resolved,  but progress has been made.   Today Guatemala is at a crossroads. CICIG has, unfortunately, been  forced out, and the country is in the middle of an election season, but  many Guatemalans fear that the current government will be replaced by a  new government that is just as corrupt as the current and the previous  ones.   So many Guatemalans feel like they are alone, and some are losing  hope,  [[Page H7386]]  but to the Guatemalan people I say this:   You are not alone, and you cannot give up. Many of us here in the  United States Congress understand your challenges. We understand what  you are facing, and many of us refuse to believe the lies peddled by  the corrupt political class and their lobbyists. And many of us will  continue to stand with you, and we will keep on fighting for your cause  because we know that it is our cause, too. We know that a more just and  democratic Guatemala is only in the best interests of ours, as well,  and we know that you want for your children the same thing that we want  for our American children.    I am confident that one day Guatemala will have a government that is  worthy of its people, a government that works to advance justice, not  to undermine and eliminate it; and one day, the United States  Government will once again support the fight against corruption in  Guatemala, and together, as partners, we will work toward a brighter  and more prosperous and more democratic future.   So in closing I say to my colleagues, we cannot give up on the  Guatemalan people. And to the Guatemalan people I say:   Do not give up on your future. Even in the darkness, we must look for  signs of hope.   And in 1990, a brave anthropologist named Myrna Mack was killed by a  military death squad for speaking out about the abuses against  indigenous Guatemalans, but her sister Helen worked to bring justice in  her case and helped lead the effort to create CICIG. And now Myrna  Mack's daughter Lucrecia is going to be a member of the Guatemalan  Congress.   So we must remember Pablo Neruda's words: ``They can cut all the  flowers, but they can't stop the spring.''                            ____________________
