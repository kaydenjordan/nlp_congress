 Mr. Speaker, I get to say once again from the House  floor, ``Go Tigers,'' as I rise to celebrate the 2023 NCAA men's soccer  national champions, the Clemson Tigers.   On Monday night, the Clemson men's soccer team took to the pitch to  beat Notre Dame and close out the season. This is Clemson's fourth  national championship in soccer. They claimed victory in 1984, 1987,  2021, and 2023. With this victory, the soccer program has surpassed  football with the most national championships. I am proud to say that  Clemson is one of just seven schools with four or more men's soccer  national championships.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Head Coach Mike Noonan and each of the  players on the team for representing my alma mater and the State of  South Carolina so well.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the 2023 NCAA men's soccer  national champions, and I congratulate President Clements on the  success of this team and the program there at Clemson.   Merry Christmas to all. May God bless America.   And once again, go Tigers.                            ____________________
