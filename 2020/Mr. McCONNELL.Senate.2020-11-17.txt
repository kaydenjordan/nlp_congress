 Madam President, there is significant outstanding  business that Congress needs to complete before the end of the year.   My Republican colleagues and I have stated over and over that we  still want to pass more coronavirus relief for the American people.  Senate Republicans have voted multiple times to send hundreds of  billions of dollars to schools, small businesses, healthcare, and laid- off workers.   If Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer had not made the calculation to  block it, that money could have been out the door many weeks ago.   Instead, our Democratic colleagues have spent months--literally  months--holding all of that urgent help hostage over unrelated,  leftwing wish list items.   Their so-called ``Heroes'' proposal is so unrealistic and poorly  targeted that Speaker Pelosi's own moderate Democrats ridiculed the  bill the instant she put it out and said it will never become law.   It includes things like a massive tax cut for wealthy people in blue  States and huge sums of money for State and city governments with no  linkage to demonstrated COVID needs.   Some blue States, including New York and California, have actually  seen higher State income tax revenues this autumn than they saw during  the same months last year, in part, because they are taxing a chunk out  of vulnerable people's unemployment benefits. They are receiving more  tax revenue now than they did in 2019. Some of these blue States are  receiving more revenue now than they did in 2019.   But, alas, Democrats still want coronavirus relief for the entire  country held hostage over a massive slush fund for their own use.   Well, even if our Democratic colleagues continue to block any  bipartisan pandemic relief from becoming law, there are other  responsibilities we still need to tackle together.   The Federal Government is currently funded through December 11. The  next few days will tell us a lot about whether Congress can pull off  the bipartisan, bicameral appropriations process that I believe both  sides would like to deliver.   Last week, our colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee  released all 12 bills for fiscal year 2021. The bills would fully fund  all kinds of crucial priorities, from securing our border to caring for  our veterans, to supporting public health at this particularly critical  time.   What needs to happen now is quite simple. Our colleagues on the  committee and their counterparts in the House need to continue their  bicameral discussions and settle on topline dollar amounts for each  separate bill.   I hope they will be able to reach this broad agreement by the end of  this very week. That would help keep us on course to deliver full-year  funding legislation, which helps our Armed Forces and all Federal  agencies plan and get ahead of the curve by the December deadline.   For nearly 2 years now, we have avoided the drama that has become a  [[Page S7020]]  Washington routine and funded our government on a bipartisan basis.  Last August, we passed a 2-year bipartisan funding agreement that let  our committees do their work even amid this divided government.   When both sides have honored the agreement and kept bills clean of  poison pills, Chairman Shelby has been able to deliver full-year bills  without drama. I hope we can replicate that successful pattern this  year.   Congress should also reach a bipartisan, bicameral compromise on the  National Defense Authorization Act and pass a conference report before  the end of the year.   Our men and women in uniform need every tool and resource to confront  the great-power competitors, rogue states, and terrorists who wish us  harm. Congress should be an asset to our own servicemembers, not a  liability   This year would make the 60th consecutive year Congress will have  passed an NDAA. This is no time to break that streak and leave our  forces in the lurch. Let's get this done and pass a conference report  through both Chambers this year.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, while our  committees are working, the full Senate is keeping busy with one of the  core constitutional responsibilities we have: continuing to confirm  well-qualified men and women to lifetime appointments to the Federal  judiciary.   Yesterday, we voted to advance the nomination of Kristi Haskins  Johnson, the current solicitor general of Mississippi, with multiple  impressive clerkships under her belt, to serve as a district judge for  the Southern District of Mississippi. She will make history as the  first woman to join the bench in that district.   This is just the first of several nominations we will consider this  week. We will also vote on Benjamin Beaton, a Kentuckian who has been  nominated to be a district judge for the Western District of Kentucky.  This Paducah native is yet another outstanding choice by President  Trump.   Mr. Beaton received a first-rate education from Kentucky's Centre  College and then Columbia Law School, where he edited the law review.  He clerked on the DC Circuit and on the Supreme Court for the late  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Since then, Mr. Beaton has excelled at some of the country's top law  firms. He has also undertaken a substantial pro bono caseload and shown  a dedication to community service.   At each step, the nominee has demonstrated a firm commitment to the  Constitution and the rule of law. The American Bar Association has  confirmed what Kentuckians already knew--Mr. Beaton is well qualified  to serve as a district judge.   Last month, our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee advanced this  brilliant nominee with no Members voting in opposition. I urge all my  colleagues to join me in voting to confirm him later today and our  other impressive nominees this week.   Now, this week's nominees are only the latest example of the  incredible qualifications that have characterized President Trump's  nominees.   Take the metric that our Democratic colleagues have called the ``gold  standard,'' the ratings of the left-leaning American Bar Association.  As of a few months ago, across all the people that President Trump had  nominated to the Federal District Courts, 68.8 percent had earned the  ABA's top rating--top rating--of ``well qualified.''   If you look back over the last seven Presidential administrations,  only one--Bush 43--has managed to post a higher average rating for  judicial nominations. Even then, it was only higher by just a hair-- just a hair.   Even the Democrats' own supposed ``gold standard'' destroys the  talking point that President Trump's nominees have been less thoroughly  qualified. It is just not factual. It is not true.   Earlier this year, looking at clerkships and professional experience,  one liberal commentator admitted that ``the average Trump appointee has  a far more impressive resume than any past president's nominees.''   Let me say that again. This is a liberal commentator who follows  these things and admitted that ``the average Trump appointee has a far  more impressive resume than any past president's nominees.''   So it is pretty hard to argue that these haven't been extraordinary  additions to our Federal courts. This is a tremendous accomplishment.  These are judges who will serve our Nation honorably for generations to  come.   Our colleagues here in the Senate should be rightly proud to have  confirmed them, and we are going to continue doing just that.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  call with respect to the Beaton nomination be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the Crouse nomination be waived.
