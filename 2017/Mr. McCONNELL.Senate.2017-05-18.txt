 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the cloture vote on the Branstad nomination, the Senate proceed to the  en bloc consideration of the following nominations: Executive Calendar  Nos. 56 and 57.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the nominations en  bloc with no intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en  bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I don't have to tell colleagues how  important the internet and other wireless technologies have been in our  modern society. From the way students learn to the way we do business  and even the way we as Senators keep in touch with our constituents,  these advancements have in many ways fundamentally changed how we  operate. It is important to remember that these groundbreaking  technological advances didn't just come about because of government  mandates or heavy-handed bureaucracy; they grew out of an environment  that allowed for, and actually encouraged, innovation.   From the Clinton years onward, there was a bipartisan consensus that  we should maintain the kind of light regulatory touch that allows this  innovation to thrive in the first place in order to open the door to  further advancements.   Unfortunately, that changed under the Obama administration, which  used the FCC to force through antiquated regulations designed for an  age of rotary phones and switchboards. Today, however, we finally have  an FCC chairman who recognizes that we live in an entirely new era--an  era of smartphones and laptops and other mobile devices. We have a  chairman who believes that innovation, ingenuity, growth, and job  creation aren't dirty words to be stifled with unnecessary redtape.   Today, it is expected that Chairman Pai and Commissioner O'Rielly  will take the first necessary step to address a deeply flawed Obama-era  diktat that empowered bureaucrats with vast new powers to control the  internet through archaic rotary telephone regulations from nearly a  century ago. No matter how well intended, this overreach threatened the  very innovation that brought us the internet and other technological  advancements in the first place.   I want to commend Chairman Pai for taking this preliminary step to  address the issue, which will also open the door for bipartisan  congressional action to keep the internet open for consumers  permanently. Later today, Senator Thune and others will come to the  floor to talk more about this issue. I look forward to hearing what  they have to say and thank them for continuing this important  conversation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, too many Americans  woke up this morning worried about the rising costs and limited options  they are experiencing under ObamaCare. As they went to work, too many  struggled with the reality that their ObamaCare premiums could take an  even larger bite out of their paycheck next year.   This afternoon, as they pick up their kids, too many will worry that  they may have a hard time finding an ObamaCare plan at all for next  year, with many counties having only one option left on the exchanges.  Unfortunately, these are the realities for far too many Americans under  ObamaCare, and they are miles away from what Democrats promised.   In my home State, we endured large premium hikes this year of up to  47 percent. For many working families, a spike in premiums like that  can make it nearly impossible to afford health  [[Page S3024]]  insurance at all. To make matters worse, under ObamaCare, many  Kentuckians don't have the option to select the best provider for  themselves and their families.   Let's take a look at the chart behind me. In Kentucky, under  ObamaCare, 49 percent of our counties--49 percent--have one insurer,  one. For Kentuckians in half of our counties, half have one choice.  Really, when you have one choice, you have no choice at all.   It is not as though this situation is unique to my State either. This  year, there are 26 States with at least one county where residents have  only a single insurance option under ObamaCare. That means millions of  Americans living in more than 1,000 counties across the country really  have no choice at all--no choice at all--when it comes to ObamaCare.   Those families didn't get the increased choices they were promised  under that law. They have been left to shoulder the burden nonetheless,  and things have only gotten worse over time.   In fact, just this week, people on the ObamaCare exchanges in three  more States--Vermont, Virginia, and Oregon--learned they could face  double-digit premium increases as high as 20 percent next year. I would  ask our Democratic friends, are they really OK--are you really OK with  ObamaCare's continuing attacks on the middle class?   One constituent from Lexington in my State wrote me about her  frustration with the status quo under ObamaCare. Here is what she had  to say:         My insurance is way more than what I can afford. I can't       imagine many others who can pay more for health insurance       than their mortgage.    She and her husband had shopped on the exchanges for healthcare, but  the lowest premium options were around $1,000 a month--listen to this-- $1,000 a month, and that got them a $10,000 deductible; $1,000 a month  would only get a policy with a $10,000 deductible. So they decided to  go uninsured and pay the penalty. She said:         The cost will be minor compared to the useless premium       cost.    The last part of this Kentucky woman's message is something I think  we should all remember throughout this debate. She said:         Please remember that there are many people depending on       Congress to set this . . . right.    Americans like her are counting on all of us to leave ObamaCare's  failures where they belong--in the past. For years, they have suffered  under a collapsing system. Yet our friends across the aisle continued  to defend the broken law regardless of its significant problems-- problems that even many of them have, by the way, started to  acknowledge.   Last week, Senate Democrats sent me a letter effectively admitting  that the ObamaCare status quo is unsustainable. I hope that means they  are prepared to join us in moving beyond their failed law. Otherwise,  Senate Democrats are essentially telling the American people that they  are OK with the status quo and that ObamaCare's collapsing markets,  double-digit premium increases, and counties with only one insurer  represent the new normal for healthcare in our country. Surely, they  are not comfortable with that.   My constituents refuse to accept the status quo. The only question  that really remains is this: Will Senate Democrats work with us to move  beyond the status quo?   The entire Senate Republican Conference has been at work debating  ideas and making progress. We are pursuing smarter healthcare policies  for Kentuckians like the couple in Lexington and the millions more like  them across the Nation who know that ObamaCare just isn't working. I  hope our friends on the other side of the aisle will agree to join us  in bringing some relief to all of these families who desperately need  it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the nomination of John Sullivan to be Deputy Secretary of  State.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  May 22; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that following leader remarks,  the Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the  Branstad nomination; further, that the time until 5:30 p.m. be equally  divided in the usual form; finally, that notwithstanding the provisions  of rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Branstad nomination expire at  5:30 p.m. Monday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:24 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, May 22, 2017, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
