I would like to thank the original anchors of tonight's and every CBC  Special Order hour, the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee) and the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr.  Torres). I thank them for relinquishing to me, just for tonight's  Special Order hour, the opportunity to be a guest anchor.   Yesterday, we commemorated the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, an  event in American history where ordinary Americans in my hometown of  Selma, Alabama, brought about extraordinary social change as they  peacefully demonstrated for the equal right to vote.   Each year, those foot soldiers would return to the Edmund Pettus  Bridge to seek renewal, rededication, recommitment to the cause for  which they fought, the cause of justice and equality. These heroes,  known and unknown, risked their very lives for the opportunity of all  Americans to vote.                                time  2030    So many people got to read about it in their history books. I got to  live it, being a native of Selma, Alabama, a daughter of Selma, but  also a lifetime member of the historic Brown Chapel AME Church, where  those marchers gathered peacefully before they walked across the Edmund  Pettus Bridge.   Yesterday was a solemn day. I did so walking across that bridge  without John Lewis. Congressman Lewis is known to so many as an icon.  But when you grow up in Selma, Alabama, he is more than just that. He  was our hero. Only in America could a little, Black girl grow up and  watch her hero, year after year after year, always during Bloody  Sunday, come back to Selma to remind the world that his cause, their  cause, was not over yet.   We know that progress is elusive. We know that every generation must  fight and fight again for the progress that was made by the previous  generation, and they must advance it as well.   When I look at John Lewis on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I can't help  but be reminded of the very young John Lewis who, 56 years ago, carried  a backpack.   Now, you know, madam co-anchor, that in that backpack, he had an  apple, he had a toothbrush, and he had a Bible. He said that he wanted  to be prepared to spend the night in jail.   He and Hosea Williams and 600 marchers peacefully marched for the  right to vote. But they were met on that bridge by a sea of Alabama  State Troopers who told them that they had 5 minutes to disperse--5  minutes to disperse. They wanted to gather and pray. They almost  started to kneel, but they didn't have time to do that, because the  very people whose job it was to protect and serve the people were the  ones who beat them with billy clubs while riding horseback and gassed  them.   When I think about John Lewis, it is this iconic picture of John  being beaten at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge.   He wasn't alone. So many people that people don't know about, like  Amelia Boynton Robinson, who I had the great fortune, during the 215th  State of the Union, on the 100th anniversary, to be my special guest.  Ms. Boynton, not quite as known as John Lewis, but nevertheless a foot  soldier for justice, beaten and battered on a bridge. As John would  say, he shed and they shed a little blood on a bridge for America to  live up to its promise, its promise of equality and justice for all.   Old battles have become new again, and John knew that that progress  was elusive. He started a pilgrimage, congressional bipartisan  pilgrimage. He wanted his colleagues in Congress to experience walking  in his footsteps through Birmingham, Montgomery, and Selma. Year after  year we would march; year after year we would march.   Faith in politics. I know so many people who will be speaking tonight  will be pictured right here on this amazing photo. People like Steny  Hoyer, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, so many would come year after  year with John.   Why was it important for us to come? It was important, because as  John said, we must never forget.   When I got the news that John passed--you know, we knew that  pancreatic cancer, stage 4, was a kiss of death, but we also knew if  anyone could fight it, it would be John. I can remember sitting in my  bedroom, as I heard about John's death, having spoken to him only 2  weeks prior, my heart was heavy. But at the same time, my spirit  soared, because I knew that we had an opportunity to walk among an  angel right here on Earth, that he gave us the roadmap, he told us that  we must never give up, that we must never give in, that we have to keep  the faith.   He believed, more than anything, that America's best days were ahead  of it. It is now incumbent upon us to pick up that baton and to carry  it to the next leg.   Who would have ever thought when I was a child sitting in Brown  Chapel, singing in the choir, singing in the choir on those  commemorative Bloody Sundays, with Coretta Scott King there, Juanita  Abernathy there, C. T. Vivian there, Joseph Lowery there, and John  Lewis there--but one, by one, by one, they are now gone. And we, who  are their beneficiaries, must pick up their cause. Their cause must  become our cause, too.   I never would have thought that 56 years would pass, and I, as  Alabama's first Black Congresswoman, would have to seek congressional  action in order to enforce the very bill that John Lewis and so many  unknown Americans bludgeoned on a bridge in Selma--that we, Congress  Members, must stand up to the task.   The Shelby v. Holder decision struck down section 4. But H.R. 4, the  John  [[Page H1099]]  Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would fully restore the  protections of the Voting Rights Act.   What a befitting tribute to John Robert Lewis, the Boy from Troy,  that we not only walk the walk and talk the talk, but that we pick up  that mantle and we pass H.R. 4.    Now, I know we are going to get it through the House. I know that. I  know that my colleagues are committed. I also know that the Biden- Harris administration wants to sign a bill that will put section 4 back  into the Voting Rights Act.   What I am not sure is if we can get enough of our Republican  colleagues--so many of whom came on those pilgrimages with John Lewis,  walked side by side in a bipartisan effort to show the world that what  happened on those sacred places in my district, Birmingham--to visit  the 16th Street Baptist Church where the four little girls were killed,  to see in Montgomery the very spot where Rosa Parks could not sit on a  bus, to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It was not just a photo  op, I pray, but rather a call to action that now they, too, can pay it  forward.   When we file H.R. 4, it will be after we have prepared, had an  evidentiary hearing and all the evidence. We will be informed. That  formula will be informed by the most egregious of actors, because we  know it has to be narrowly tailored. We know that we can't just submit  the same formula, and we won't. Because here is what is important: What  is important is Federal oversight, as we have seen State after State  recently impose more egregious, restrictive photo I.D. laws and  restrictive barriers to voting.   I am honored today to be a part of this tribute to John Lewis. I know  so many want to speak. I am just going to say in closing, John is  always in our midst, because John's call to action was very familiar to  all of us. He told us that ours was not a struggle of one day, not even  one lifetime. He told us that ours was a struggle for a cause greater  than us and that that beloved community was possible if people of  goodwill, Black and White, Republican and Democrat, Christian and all  the religions, if we would just do the right thing, that when we see  such injustice, we have to stand up and fight it out.   Can't you hear him? I can. Never give up. Never give in. Get into  some good trouble, necessary trouble, and we look forward to doing that  for John Robert Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I'm Congresswoman Terri Sewell and I proudly represent  Alabama's Seventh District--the Civil Rights District--which includes  the historic cities of Birmingham, Montgomery and my hometown of Selma.   It's an honor for me to guest anchor with Sheila Jackson Lee tonight.  I am honored to participate in the First Annual John Lewis Good Trouble  Special Order Hour on the heels of the 56th Anniversary of the Bloody  Sunday March.   In 2020 we mourned the loss of a giant: the late, great Congressman  John Lewis; my dear friend and mentor.   Though I am reminded daily of the sacrifices made by John and the  known and unknown foot soldiers on that bridge 56 years ago, this  commemoration feels unmistakably different.   Each year, John would lead a congressional delegation onto the bridge  in my hometown where he was bludgeoned for the sacred right to vote.  Every time, you felt like you were there with him, overwhelmed with  emotion and grounded by courage as he stood before the brigade of  police officers telling him and the rest to turn back.   In March 2020, John, battling cancer, surprised everyone, arriving at  the 55th anniversary of the march to speak at the apex of the bridge.   That was John--relentless in the fight for what he believed in and  willing to risk his life for the betterment of humanity.   The horrific events of Bloody Sunday brought the reality of the fight  for voting rights to living rooms across our country. It was there, in  my hometown of Selma, where ordinary Americans dared to follow through  on their extraordinary commitment to justice and equality for all, that  led to the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   For me, growing up in Selma, under the shadow of the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, the history of the voting rights movement was not something I  had to learn in school.   The foot soldiers of the movement were not pictures or names in a  history book, they were a vital and vibrant part of the community in  Selma--they were my teachers, my church members, my piano teacher, our  firefighters and even my babysitter.   Their valiant, collective efforts put Selma on the map in a way that  no one could have imagined, so much so that we still celebrate and  commemorate those efforts today.   The movement continues, because it must--because the fight for equity  is as important now as it was in 1965. Selma is still now.   Old battles have become new again. Since the Supreme Court in Shelby  v. Holder gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in 2013, state  legislatures all across the Nation have passed restrictive voter laws  making it harder for certain people to vote.   As a result of November's historic electoral victories, many  Republican state legislators, Members of Congress, and far-right  interest groups are working overtime to keep voters from the ballot box  by introducing hundreds of new voting restrictions across the country.   Without federal protections against discrimination, States across the  country have enacted new voter suppression tactics that subject voters  to: longer lines; inaccessible polling places; strict voter ID  requirements; broken voting machines; and more.   Twenty-eight states have enacted and implemented voter ID laws since  2010 and, in just two months, 250 restrictions have been introduced in  43 states.   Indeed, voter suppression is still alive and well.   Never did I think the cause for which John Lewis marched for 56 years  ago--the VOTING RIGHTS ACT would require congressional action to  restore its full protection.   It reminds us that progress is elusive and every generation must  fight and fight again.   The legacy of my district requires that I pick up this baton of voter  equality and continue the next leg--their cause is my cause too.   I look forward to introducing H.R. 4, The John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Act, because the reality is--we have not yet achieved the America that  John dreamed of.   John knew that our Country's best days lie ahead of us, but we must  seize the opportunities to enact change every day.   He understood that democracy is not the whim or edict of one person;  it is a constant, collective act of reinvention. We are a Nation  founded on a call to action--to strive daily for a more perfect union.   Every one of us has a role to play. As leaders we must lead and as  citizens we must vote.   May we all be renewed by the 56th Bloody Sunday anniversary and  recommit ourselves to the ideals of equality and justice for which the  foot soldiers marched. Let our words and actions stir the soul of our  Nation.   John gave us his final call to action: John said, ``Never give up,  never give in, keep the faith, keep your eyes on the prize.''   Let's get into good trouble.
