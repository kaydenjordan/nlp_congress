 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the CARS Act, which  will stop this executive overreach by the Biden administration by  preventing the implementation of regulations that seek to limit  consumer choice instead of allowing consumers to choose the vehicle  that best suits their needs.   The Environmental Protection Agency has produced a rule that would  effectively require two-thirds of all vehicles sold in the United  States to be fully electric in less than 9 years.   While I believe electric vehicles have their place in society, this  misguided EPA mandate would have an immediate detrimental impact on the  choices and the affordability of cars, trucks, and SUVs that  are available to my constituents.    Despite billions of dollars being spent on part of the Biden  administration's IIJA bill to expand our Nation's EV charging network,  at present the electric grid is incapable of supporting this, not to  mention the fact that according to the Department of Energy, the range  of EVs is reduced by over 40 percent in cold weather. I remind you that  I am from the State of Wisconsin. For the rural, cold climates common  in my district, EVs are simply not the answer at this time.   Even more troublesome is that biofuels were barely mentioned in the  IIJA, which means that the clean, renewable energy options to power our  country's transportation system are nearly forgotten by the Biden  administration, despite ethanol production supporting more than 300,000  jobs concentrated in rural areas and adding $43 billion to the U.S.  economic output in 2019 alone.   I am proud to also cosponsor the Flex Fuel Fairness Act which would  provide a meaningful incentive for automakers to manufacture flex-fuel  vehicles in addition to battery-powered electric vehicles. This would  offer more options to consumers and unlock increased use of lower- carbon liquid fuel blends which contain higher levels of ethanol,  including E85 and E30.   Flex-fuel vehicles are the exact type of domestically supported  transportation solution that Congress and the Federal Government should  be incentivizing. Let's encourage these vehicles to be used, not  Chinese-mined batteries.   Not only will the EPA's proposed regulation severely limit consumers'  choices for affordable vehicles that fit the need for average  Americans, an overreliance on EVs would have drastic consequences to  our national security. Up to 90 percent of the electric vehicle battery  supply chain comes from the Chinese Communist Party. For the  foreseeable future, until 2032, at least 67 percent of all forecasted  battery cell manufacturing will be controlled by China. In contrast to  China, the United States has 7 percent of the global battery production  capacity.                                time  1245    The batteries that power EV require critical minerals, including  lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese. The key component  here is cobalt.   Mr. Speaker, 73 percent of the global cobalt output is produced by  the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and that is mined by children.  The Chinese Communist Party controls over two-thirds of the global  production of cobalt.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we understand that if we go  through with this measure, then we are essentially sanctioning child  slavery. That is unforgivable.   In fact, this bill does something, something, something. It is for  the moms and dads who are driving their children to school. It is to  prevent these children from having to work in slavery. It also supports  our farmers who feed the world.
