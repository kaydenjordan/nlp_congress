 Madam Speaker, it is no secret that our country is  facing increasingly devastating disasters, including wildfires.   In my own home district, the SCU Lightning Complex fires of 2020  burned nearly 400,000 acres over 46 days across five counties,  destroying more than 2,000 structures and damaging others. That was the  fourth-largest wildfire recorded in California's modern history.   As chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation, I  hear about fires like this almost year-round from my colleagues, but it  is not just a Western United States problem. Fire risk areas are  growing exponentially to threaten new districts and new States every  year.   And fires don't rage only in Democratic districts. This calamity  knows no political divide.   As wildfires continue to worsen, our government has not acted with  enough urgency. It is clear that Congress needs to pass legislation to  better prevent and respond to wildfires.   Last month, I joined State and local officials to specifically  discuss this policy and operational gaps, and the systems that we have  in place obviously don't work as well as they should.   FEMA's current statutory authorities and operational practices limit  our ability to prepare for and recover from wildfires. That is why all  the California firefighters, chiefs, and leaders I met with support the  FEMA Improvement, Reform, and Efficiency Act, or FIRE Act.   We know that wildfires present a unique and increasing danger, and we  also know that policies written with hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes  in mind don't always translate well.   The FIRE Act would direct FEMA to create a process that uses the red  flag warnings we are all too familiar with to take predisaster measures  and predeploy resources to take disaster-specific damages into account  during recovery and the like.                                time  1300    It is commonsense legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to  support it.   I would like also to thank the co-leads on this bill--Congressmen  Thompson, Huffman, and Panetta--for recognizing the importance of this  legislation and for their hard work, as well as Senator Padilla for his  leadership in the Senate on this bill.   I thank Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for their efforts to  bring this to the floor. I would also like to recognize Ranking Member  Graves and, of course, Congressman LaMalfa for working with us on  reaching agreement on something that I think will be able to pass the  Senate.   This is a good bill. It will improve our response, and I hope we get  overwhelming support here today.
