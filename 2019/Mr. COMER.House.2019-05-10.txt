 Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of my  friend Mr. Jay Price of Casey County in the First Congressional  District of Kentucky.   After graduating from Western Kentucky University as an ag major, Jay  returned home to manage his family's beef cattle farm and teach  agriculture at Casey County High School. Jay devoted his career to  educating nearly three decades of young farmers. His students will not  only remember the skills they learned but the life lessons and guidance  he provided at every opportunity.   As an FFA adviser, teacher, and mentor, his support in and out of the  classroom had an outsized influence on thousands of young adults. By  connecting them with industry and State leaders, he ensured they were  well prepared to pursue remarkable educational and career  opportunities.   Jay also dedicated his time to advancing the prosperity of his fellow  farmers through his leadership in local and State organizations. His  peers recognized his profound influence on Kentucky agriculture and  inducted him as a member of the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association Hall  of Fame, along with many other accolades throughout his life.   His passion for the agriculture industry and his students is rivaled  only by his love for his family: his wife, Carol; his daughters, Lauren  and Lindsay; their husbands, Brian and Jon; and his  [[Page H3718]]  grandchildren Clay, Avery, and Hudson.   I join with his entire family--including his mother, siblings, and a  host of friends who he considered family--in celebrating and  remembering his lifetime of service to others.                            ____________________
