 Mr. Speaker, as a proud member of the International Union  of Painters and Allied Trades, as a co-chair of the Labor Caucus, and a  proud member of the Education and Labor Committee, I rise in strong  support of the National Apprenticeship Act.   With such high unemployment, the bill before us seeks to invest $3.5  billion over 5 years to expand access to registered apprenticeships  across America. Almost 1 million new apprenticeship opportunities will  result from the enactment of this bill, leading to good-paying, family- supporting jobs across the country.   So what are registered apprenticeships?   Well, they are a great way to earn and learn. You get paid for your  work while learning the skills you need to master your trade at the  same time. Not everyone chooses a path of higher education, but  everyone wants to earn a good family-supporting wage for their hard  work. Apprenticeships are a perfect way for many who fit this  definition. From medical work to construction and more, apprenticeships  mean advanced opportunities for so many.   My home State of Wisconsin is a pioneer in this area. We enacted the  Nation's first apprenticeship law in 1911. The results of our  experience back home have been clear: They lead to a stronger, smarter,  and more skilled workforce.   Federally, the case for supporting registered apprenticeships is  compelling. According to data from the Department of Labor, 94 percent  of people who complete a registered apprenticeship are employed upon  completion, and their average starting wage is above $70,000.   We were fortunate to support more than 14,000 apprenticeships in  Wisconsin last year for over 3,000 employers and over 200 occupations.  I look forward to that total growing dramatically following the  enactment of today's bill.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter of support for the  National Apprenticeship Act from the AFL-CIO.                                                         AFL-CIO,                                                   February 4, 2021.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO, urges you to support the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 (H.R. 447), scheduled for       floor consideration this week. H.R. 447 recognizes that       Registered Apprenticeship programs are the `gold standard' in       our nation's workforce development system, and we welcome       this effort to modernize a law that has not been meaningfully       updated since it was enacted 83 years ago.        Unions and our signatory employers have a long history of       establishing joint labor management partnerships to design       and implement Registered Apprenticeship programs, so we have       a deep interest in maintaining and strengthening our nation's       Registered Apprenticeship system. These programs provide good       jobs with good wages and benefits that increase as       apprentices build their skills. They provide a valuable       credential that can help secure future employment and       advancement along a rewarding career path, and the       opportunities they provide are particularly important for       women, people of color and veterans.        H.R. 447 authorizes significant new funding to expand       registered apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships, and youth       apprenticeships in the United States. It would codify and       streamline existing standards that are vital to support       apprentices, and would, for the first time, include youth       apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. The House       Education and Labor Committee estimates that H.R. 447 will       create over 1 million Registered Apprenticeship opportunities       over the next 5 years.        H.R. 447 would also codify the role of the Office of       Apprenticeship at the Department of Labor, and provide       funding streams to ensure oversight and technical assistance.       Importantly, it would expand Registered Apprenticeship       opportunities into new sectors of the workforce. The bill       also establishes standards for state apprenticeship agencies,       including a requirement that they develop a state plan to       support Registered Apprenticeships and provide technical       assistance. Finally, the bill strengthens the National       Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship, ensuring that experts       from industry and labor have a role in improving the program.        Registered Apprenticeships are America's most successful       federally authorized workforce development program, employing       94 percent of those who complete a program. H.R. 447 will       help ensure that these programs meet the highest possible       quality standards and support family sustaining jobs.        We urge you to support H.R. 447 and to oppose any       amendments that would weaken the bill approved for       consideration by the full House.            Sincerely,                                                 William Samuel,                                                           Director,                                                Government Affairs.
