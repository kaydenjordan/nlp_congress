 Madam Speaker, we have a bit of the tyranny of the  clock, as you know, so I am going to try to do this somewhat rapidly.   There has been a lot of speechifying today. I am frustrated because I  don't have an elegant or delicate way to say this, but people keep  making crap up. Let's actually walk through some basic math so we  understand something.   Does anyone here have any memory of last fall when a number of us  were coming behind these microphones getting ready to talk about the  winter that was coming. Do you remember the discussion of about how  high the power bills, the heating bills were going to be? It is because  fuel prices--hydrocarbon prices--didn't just go up because of the  Russian invasion.   If you look at the charts, this began functionally when the left took  power. It really began in 2018 and really took off when they had  unified control. It didn't just happen. As a matter of fact, there is a  number of charts out there and futures contracts that were basically  saying the prices you are seeing today at the gas pump--they just  showed up about 6 months early--that that is actually where we were  going because consumption and supply wasn't keeping up because of what  we have done to ourselves.   You see it already. Do you not remember last October and September  crossing $6 on natural gas? It was already coming at us and it was our  own fault. How does this craziness happen? We keep getting folks coming  behind the microphone and saying: It is because of the Keystone  pipeline; it is a little bit. It is because of some of the drilling  bans; it is a little bit.   It is mostly because over, particularly this last year, but also  going back when the left took power after the 2018 election, they  basically started to threaten capital markets. If you are a company and  you invest in hydrocarbons, I think the SEC should look into you. If  you're CalPERS or a pension fund and you invest in hydrocarbons, we are  going to look down  [[Page H1371]]  upon that. As a matter of fact, we are going encourage universities and  other pension funds no more investing in hydrocarbons.   What did you think was going to happen? When you actually see this  frustration and the absolute distorted rhetoric coming from the White  House--well, there are 9,000 drilling permits out there. I think most  of America already understand that is lunacy; you get a permit, you  find out if there are any hydrocarbons in the ground. But how do you go  to capital markets and get any money to stick that straw in the ground?  This continued.   Over and over, the Biden administration's executive orders missed the  mark. It was actually talking about the Treasury coming at anyone that  is putting capital markets into hydrocarbons. Understand what you are  paying at the gas pump, what you are paying to heat your house. You  voted for this.   If you voted for the left, if you voted for them in 2018, if you  voted for them in 2020, you voted for this. You voted for that price  because this is what they promised us. Do you remember the discussions  here, the debates here? We are going to make it so you can't raise  money to finance a pipeline, to finance new hydrocarbon extractions, to  finance natural gas.   What is so ironic about this--just quote after quote after quote.  Pension systems and others--the idea was strangle hydrocarbon  extraction, oil and gas, and make it so they don't have the capital to  open up new wells, to invest in more efficiencies. The left actually  got what they wanted.   Are they now willing to admit that they got what they wanted there?  We are now seeing $5 gasoline. You see the price of natural gas. Guess  what, congratulations, we burned 23 percent more coal last year because  they made natural gas so expensive; we moved from one fuel source that  was dramatically cleaner than coal, but you raised the price so high.  Remember, power generation is regulated. Power plant after power plant  after power plant around America moved back to coal.   So now you have the brain trust in the administration saying things  like: Well, go buy an electric car. Except that electric car is going  to be powered by coal because the dramatically cleaner burning fuel of  natural gas you have just made really expensive.   A couple of months ago we came here to the floor and talked about  natural gas and the concerns the left has said over it--well, what  about methane--showing them some breakthroughs of really inexpensive  ways to capture that methane.   There is a rational argument there. Methane is a 9-1, but has only  now a shorter half life of what is considered to be a greenhouse gas.  Instead of saying, hey, we are going to look for technologies that deal  with the problem there, the left's opinion is, well, let's wipe them  out because those who invest in green energy finance and write checks  to Democrats. The green mafia basically owns the Democrat Party.    Then you go look at other absurdities that is Democrat policy. I am  sorry I had to grab an older slide. Do you realize the amount of  baseload nuclear we have in this country that is going off line? You do  realize over this 10-year period the United States is going to get  dirtier? This is even before the left functionally raised the price of  natural gas so much that power plants moved back to coal.   We are moving so much clean baseload nuclear off the grid that it  doesn't even offset every bit of photovoltaic and wind we have put on  the grid.   We give lots of pretty speeches here. We do lots of virtue signaling,  but the math is the math is the math. The virtue signaling creating  policy has actually raised more greenhouse gases. Look what Germany did  by shutting down its baseload nuclear. They now burn massive amounts of  coal. They got dirtier.   You have heard speech after speech here today about how much we  despise Putin, but we also know his propaganda wing absolutely  supported the left's movement to strangle these hydrocarbons. This is  what you get when you make crappy policy. It didn't happen overnight.  It is going to take us years to fix this mess.   Can I beg the Democrats: Stop hurting people. Stop making the poor  poorer. Stop crushing the middle class. Come back to sensibility. Guess  what, there might be a bonus there, and that is all the coal that is  being burnt, all the dirty imports, you would actually get a benefit of  the greenhouse gases, but you got to come back and do math again.   Madam Speaker, I think I am up against my time and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
