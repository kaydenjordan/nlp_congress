 Madam President, in my new position of ranking  member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship,  each week I will have the honor of recognizing an outstanding Iowa  small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. It  is my privilege to recognize Guthrie County Quality Meats of Guthrie  Center, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week for the week of  February 13, 2023.   The hardship imposed on our Nation's small businesses by the COVID-19  pandemic will be remembered for centuries. Under such times of duress,  many business owners were forced to adapt their business model in order  to survive. Guthrie County Quality Meats founders Brett Rowley and  Grant Sheeder are examples of this adaptability, as they leaned upon  their agricultural expertise and created GC Quality Meats on March 2,  2021, in the midst of the pandemic. By the time these partners put  their heads together to open their business, Brett had extensive  experience in the meat packing industry, as he grew up working in his  father's packing plant in northwest Iowa. Grant, meanwhile, grew up in  the Guthrie County dairy industry. Grant's family began milking cows in  1996, and a decade later, his parents built a milk-bottling facility  where they bottled milk from 2006 to 2022. Both Grant and Brett watched  their respective industries change during the pandemic, as consumers  stayed away from grocery stores and other large-scale produce markets.  Seeing this shift in the business landscape, the two men decided to  pivot towards a home delivery service--and thus, Guthrie County Quality  Meats was born.   Guthrie County Quality Meats provides locally sourced meat including  beef, pork, chicken, and lamb for retail and custom orders in Guthrie  County and the surrounding area. From the business' inception, GC  Quality Meats has continued to grow. They recently finalized  construction on their new butchering facility in Guthrie Center. Since  completing their butchering center, the facility has seen great demand  and has been booked several weeks in advance. Clearly, Brett and Grant  had the right idea when they decided to open Guthrie County's very own  meat processor, as both men will acknowledge that it is a service the  county had been needing for quite some time.   In addition to their butchering facility, Guthrie County Quality  Meats has added a retail site to their business. Inside their store,  customers can find just about any meat and poultry sauce, spice, or  seasoning they might need. Moreover, both Brett and Grant pay special  mind to source all their meat locally and make sure that any product  offered inside their retail space has strong Iowa ties. This includes  locally baked pies, dried pasta, local honey, and salsa. In addition to  the other Iowa products offered in store, ice cream from Grant's  family's dairy, Sheeder Cloverleaf Dairy, is always readily available  on their shelves. Even as they find new ways to grow and expand their  meat processing venture, both Brett and Grant share the mission to  ensure that Guthrie County Quality Meats operates as a family business.   Needless to say, agriculture is a monumental part of Iowa's economy  and way of life. It gives me great pleasure to see two gentlemen from  different sides of the agricultural industry come together to  collaborate on a solution for the meat processing needs of Guthrie  County. Therefore, I want to commend Brett and Grant for their  innovative vision and drive to overcome the supply chain challenges  they faced when building their facilities, in order to bring their  business dream to reality. Congratulations to Brett Rowley and Grant  Sheeder and the entire team at Guthrie County Quality Meats. I look  forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
