Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials in the Record on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of this important piece of legislation. This bill  will get FDA the tools the agency needs to intercept illicit substances  coming through our country's international mail facilities. Illicit and  unapproved drugs entering the U.S. supply chain through these  facilities pose serious public health threats.   Hundreds of millions of parcels go through the IMF facilities each  year, and it has been reported that the number of packages processed by  the Nation's nine IMFs nearly doubled from 2013 to 2015. These  facilities now receive more than 275 million packages annually.   Although the FDA has increased the number of investigators it has in  the facilities, it is estimated that the FDA can only physically  inspect less than 0.06 percent of the packages that might contain drugs  or drug products.   In conjunction with H.R. 5228, led by Representative Pallone and  passed by the House yesterday, this bill will give the FDA the  flexibility and the tools the agency needs to effectively and  efficiently seize illicit or unapproved drugs, and to prohibit bad  actors from continuing to ship these deadly products into the country.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to help stop the  entrance of illegal opioids and other drugs that might harm Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard the mention of bipartisan work and  bipartisan support on these issues, and Chairman Walden is exactly  right.   Not only have Members worked in a bipartisan way, but also our staffs  have to answer the questions: How do we help to get the resources to  our local and our State officials? How do we help to remove barriers so  we can end this epidemic in our country?   Last year, 63,632 Americans lost their lives to drug abuse and drug  overdose, and 1,600 of those were Tennesseans. We can all tell you  these stories, and I tell you as a mom and as a friend, so many times  when you talk to families and talk to people who have been so affected  and so impacted by this, they talk about family members and coworkers  and individuals that they are in contact with every single day and how  we need to work on this issue with opioids, with fentanyl, with heroin,  with cocaine, these illicit drugs that are flooding our streets, as  well as the pills.   Now, last October, during a hearing when Dr. Gottlieb was before us  and we were conducting oversight with the FDA, one of the things that  he mentioned was there were some changes that they needed to see in  Federal law. The number one change they needed was permission to work  some changes in Federal statute for how they would work in these  international mail facilities.   As we have said, there are hundreds of millions of packages. As  Congressman Green said, they cannot get ahead of the work. So we have  come together. The Stop Illicit Drug Importation Act is something that  will be helpful to getting the job done and getting these drugs off the  streets. Indeed, they will never get to the streets. They will never  get to the streets because there will be the ability to stop them and  dispose of these drugs before they ever get to the streets.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
