 Madam Speaker, I rise today for International Women's Day  to acknowledge women in small business from New York's Third  Congressional District.   Pam Ocasio from Pam's Jamz--with a z--is a mom with a talent for  curating unique homemade jams and marmalades from local ingredients.  She is always at the local farmers market in Oyster Bay with a smiling  face and a can-do attitude.   Another wonder woman, Angela Carillo, is a mother of two from  Bethpage with an associate's degree in medical technology and a  bachelor's degree in biology. She put her chemistry skills to the test  in her basement studio in 2010 curating beautiful and fabulously  scented home soaps. I have seen her work at local craft fairs around  the district, and I must say, she certainly gives any major  manufacturer a run for their money.   Joey Bowen is a mother of two who built her business as a single mom.  Joey lives in Bethpage and hand makes stylish clear handbags. She  started in her living room and expanded to an international operation.  She now has storefronts around Nassau County and supports the local  economy and the workforce.    Cheers to all these women out there and for their extraordinary  accomplishments.                            ____________________
