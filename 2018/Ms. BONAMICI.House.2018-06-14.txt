 Mr. Speaker, it is almost Father's Day, a good time to  think about the fathers in our lives and in the families we are honored  to represent. I think about the families in Northwest Oregon, and I  know that too many are still facing challenges. Too many are still  struggling to make ends meet. Their paycheck, if they are fortunate to  have one, just isn't enough to pay the bills, and it is hard for them  to even think of saving for the future.   One policy that can make a big difference in the lives of families is  paid leave. It is an economic issue for working families; and we need  to recognize that both women and men need to be able to take paid time  off when a child is born, or to care for their children or other family  members when they need them.   In Oregon, our parental and family medical leave laws cover more  people and have stronger protections than current Federal law, and I  applaud those efforts; but there are still far too many workers across  the country who are not able to care for a sick child or aging parents  because they cannot pay their rent or buy groceries if they lose a day  of work.   According to the Department of Labor, only 15 percent of workers in  the United States have access to paid family leave through their  employers. And although some employers recognize the importance of  providing paid leave for all working people, most still do not.   Outdated gender norms in too many workplaces often pressure men,  especially those in jobs without paid leave, to limit their time away  from work for caregiving. We need to see a cultural shift in our  societal expectations about men as caregivers, and we need to dismantle  the stigma that being a caregiver is incompatible with success in the  workforce.   Congress should get serious about supporting families and enact a  meaningful paid family leave law. We should pass the FAMILY Act,  legislation that will provide much-needed financial security to working  people and their families and provide certainty for businesses.   A national paid family and medical leave program would help to foster  a healthier and more equitable society. It would help to bring our  Nation's policies more in line with the needs of our families and our  workforce, and it would be a very meaningful way to say Happy Father's  Day.                            ____________________
