 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4591, as amended, the VA  Electronic Health Record Transparency Act.   Since the very beginning of the Electronic Health Record  Modernization, or the EHRM, program, this committee has been requesting  accurate and up-to-date lifecycle cost estimates from VA. Despite our  requests, VA has never provided a credible lifecycle cost estimate.  VA's cost estimates could not withstand even the most basic scrutiny.  [[Page H6279]]    This bill would require quarterly reports on the costs of the EHRM  program. It would also capture the roughly $5 billion of costs the  Inspector General found were unaccounted for and any other costs that  VA has not been including.   Of course, cost is not everything. The electronic health record  program needs to help the VA medical staff better care for veterans.  That is why this bill would also require VA to report on performance  and safety metrics. These data points will allow us to evaluate the  program and determine whether it is making VA medical centers safer,  faster, and better.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipartisan work of the Technology  Modernization Subcommittee, and I am also pleased to be the original  cosponsor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4591,  as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5516, as amended, the  VITAL Assessment Act.   This bill is sponsored by, as was said, our newest member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, Congressman Jake Ellzey. With this bill,  he is fulfilling the promise he made on the campaign trail to put the  needs of our fellow veterans front and center. His bill will make a  number of improvements to the VA's Veterans Integration to Academic  Learning, or the VITAL program.   VITAL provides mental health support to student veterans on college  campuses. Preventing veteran suicide and supporting veterans as they  transition out of the military are two of our committee's highest  goals, and this bill would get us closer to realizing both of them.   I urge every Member to support H.R. 5516, as amended, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Ellzey), the main sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2433, the Burn Pit  Registry Enhancement Act. This bill is cosponsored by Congressmen Raul  Ruiz from California and Brad Wenstrup from Ohio. Dr. Ruiz and Dr.  Wenstrup are co-chairs of the House Burn Pit Caucus. I thank them for  their work on this bill and continued advocacy on behalf of the  veterans exposed to burn pits.   Many servicemembers and veterans are grappling with serious health  conditions that they believe are the result of the burn pit exposures.  That is why Congress required VA to create an Airborne Hazards and Open  Burn Pit Registry in 2013.   The registry was intended to provide a forum for servicemembers and  veterans to document their burn pit exposures and health status so that  the VA could better target research and outreach. The registry  continues to be an important tool for veterans worried about burn pit  and other toxic or environmental exposures.   Last Congress, two important stakeholders, Burn Pits 360 and VFW,  recommended family members be allowed to update the registry in the  event of the death of a servicemember or veteran listed on it. This  would ensure that the registry contains a more complete picture of the  possible effects of burn pit exposure. This bill would do that.   When a servicemember or a veteran listed in the registry passes away,  it would allow an immediate family member to report their death and  cause of death to the registry.   As ranking member, improving the care and benefits provided to  veterans who have experienced toxic exposure continues to be one of my  top priorities. There have been bipartisan bills introduced in the  House and Senate this Congress. One of those bills is my bill, the TEAM  Act.   And last week, VA announced some new initiatives aimed at improving  the presumptive process for toxic-exposed veterans. I still have many  outstanding questions about that announcement, and am concerned by the  stalled legislative efforts of the Democrat-controlled Congress.   Toxic-exposed veterans are sick and dying. We cannot let burn pits,  PFAS, or particulate matters become this generation's Agent Orange. We  cannot fail to take proactive action on behalf of the future  generations of warfighters.   I hope that we can soon come together in the House and the Senate in  a bipartisan manner to take meaningful, fiscally responsible, and  scientifically sound action to address toxic exposures. In the  meantime, I am pleased to support this bill today, and hope it has the  support of all of my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support this piece of legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4626, as amended, the VA  Assessment by Independent Measures Act, or AIM Act.   The AIM Act is sponsored by my friend and fellow Marine Corps  veteran, General Jack Bergman. General Bergman is the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Health, and I thank him for his dedication to  ensuring that the VA is providing good care for each one of our  Nation's veterans.   The AIM Act would require an independent assessment of the VA  healthcare system once every decade, starting in the year 2025.   When the VA was in the midst of a nationwide access and  accountability crisis in 2014, Congress passed the Choice Act to help  right the ship. The Choice Act included a provision requiring an  independent assessment of the VA healthcare system. That led to many of  the reforms that are occurring across the VA system today. Establishing  a mechanism for regular independent assessments will ensure that the VA  continues to improve in the decades ahead.   I appreciate Chairman Takano and his staff for working with me and  General Bergman while the AIM Act was pending in committee. I hope that  this bill will have the same level of bipartisan support today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5603, as amended, the  Protections for Student Veterans Act.   This bill would protect student veterans who have to withdraw from a  course of education under the GI Bill if they are called up for Active  Duty or for training. This change would protect students from receiving  a poor grade or an incomplete while they are doing their job to protect  this country.   The change proposed in this bill is needed, and it has my full  support.   I am also pleased that this bill, as amended, includes the text of  Congressman Cawthorn's bill, H.R. 4874, the Fly Vets Act. His bill  would close a longstanding loophole that allows public flight training  schools to charge an unlimited amount in tuition and fees for GI Bill  students.   This bill would allow students to utilize a revolutionary accelerated  tuition and fee model that would provide twice the amount of tuition  and fees per  [[Page H6285]]  month for 2 months of eligibility. This is commonsense legislation that  would protect both the student veteran and the taxpayer.   I thank Congressman Cawthorn for his hard work on this bill. I also  thank Congressmen Wenstrup and Levin for their work on this bill in  previous Congresses. I hope that this year we can get this needed  change across the finish line.   While we are talking about the GI Bill, I would like to take a few  minutes to discuss another matter. At least at the start of the  pandemic, we worked on a bipartisan effort to ensure that student  veterans' GI Bill housing allowance payments are not cut when their in- person classes converted to online learning due to COVID-19. The  current authorization expires on December 21, 2021.   Chairman Takano and Congressman Trone are advocating for a bill that  extends this protection, but it is not paid for. Instead, it relies on  emergency spending to cover the more than $200 million mandatory score  associated with the bill. I believe that is too high of a cost to  consider through emergency spending and must insist that we offset the  extension.   To that end, I introduced a bill that would achieve the policy  objective but pay for the cost of the bill with a regularly used  offset.   My bill also includes changes that are needed to ensure that GI Bill  students can attend foreign schools. It would also give U.S. schools  time to comply with the new reporting requirements passed last  Congress.   A coalition of 18 higher education groups has advocated for these  changes for several months and support my proposal. They understand  that if these changes are not made soon, many schools will be forced to  stop accepting students who are using the GI Bill.   I understand the chairman has recently received a letter from the  chancellor of the University of California at Riverside, who agrees  that this proposal must be offset.   Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox wrote that by passing the bill without an  offset, we would be ``no closer to a resolution on this critical  issue.''   The letter goes on to say that passing a bill out of the House  without an offset ``will jeopardize UCR's ability to continue to serve  our veteran students.''   The chancellor also stated that this fall UC Riverside supported  hundreds of military-connected students, including about 179 veterans  who could be impacted by inaction.   Unless I am mistaken, UC Riverside is in Chairman Takano's district.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from Chancellor  Wilcox.                                                      UC Riverside,                                        Office of the Chancellor,                                   Riverside, CA, November 12, 2021.      Hon. Mark Takano,      U.S. Representative,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Takano: I understand that you are       planning to bring H.R. 5545, the Responsible Education       Mitigating Options and Technical Extensions (REMOTE) Act, up       for a vote in the House next week. The bill includes critical       technical corrections to address unintended consequences       stemming from several provisions in the Isakson Roe Act and       the Training in High-Demand Roles to Improve Veteran       Employment (THRIVE) Act that went into effect on August 1,       2021. The bill would also extend certain COVID-related       flexibilities granted to the Secretary of the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA) in the wake of the pandemic.        As the bill is currently written, however, it does not       include an offset for the approximately $200 million cost for       the extension of COVID-19 flexibilities. I am deeply       concerned that without the inclusion of an offset, the bill       will not be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent and       we will be no closer to a resolution on this critical issue.        During the Fall of 2021, UC Riverside served 179 Veterans,       37 Reservists, 11 National Guard, and 15 Active Duty self-      identified members of the U.S. military branches. Designated       as a ``Military Spouse Friendly'' campus, UCR served over 350       dependents, and have utilized over $6M in Veterans benefits.        Without an offset for the extension of COVID-19       flexibilities, it will jeopardize UCR's ability to continue       to serve our Veteran Students, due to the compliance issues       that require fixes. I would also urge you to include language       to modify VA's current ``rounding out'' rule to ensure that       more veterans can maintain full-time benefits during the last       term of their program.        I respectfully request that your staff work to pass       bipartisan legislation next week that addresses these       concerns and can be quickly passed through both chambers and       signed into law.            Sincerely,                                                     Kim A. Wilcox,                                                        Chancellor.                                time  1300     At our full committee markup 2 weeks ago, I urged Chairman  Takano to work with me and our Senate colleagues to find a way forward  on the offset issue on a bipartisan basis.   However, last week I was told that Congressman Trone's bill would be  on the slate of bills, but the cost would not be offset. I registered  my concern and was glad to see that the un-offset bill will not be  considered under suspension of the rules today.   I do understand, however, that the majority intends to take  Congressman Trone's bill to the Rules Committee the week after next and  pass it out of the House un-offset through a rule.   Let me be clear, I support the policy, but I believe the cost of the  bill must be offset. Schools like UC Riverside clearly agree with me.  Even if the Democrats are able to get Congressman Trone's un-offset  bill through the House--and that is a big ``if''--I don't believe that  they can pass it in the Senate by unanimous consent.   It is the responsibility of the leaders of our committee to solve  this issue so that the bill can quickly make it to the President's  desk. Although the chairman may not like it, my approach is the only  way to get this done in time to help students in a fiscally responsible  manner.   The higher education community has told us that this extension needs  to be enacted by Thanksgiving. I think we can see that under the  majority's current plan, the deadline will be missed. After  Thanksgiving we have only 9 legislative days left before these  protections expire. We are simply running out of time.   I do not have a preference for whether we take up my bill or amend  Congressman Trone's bill to include the offset, but I urge the chairman  to come back to reality and stop playing political games with it so  that we can ensure that student veterans are protected in a fiscally  sound manner.   At the very least, I would advise the chairman not to let this  inaction impact thousands of student veterans across the country,  including the 179 right there in his own district.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, paying for something and doing the job that we  are supposed to be doing here is not political gamesmanship.   I said in my statement that I believe that we must continue to  provide for these veterans, but it is our fiduciary duty to do it in  the correct way. That is what I am asking for. I am also asking for it  because that way we know it will move through the Senate and work in a  bipartisan, bicameral manner to try to move it forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  the underlying bill that was discussed. I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 796, the Protecting Moms Who  Served Act.   This bill would require VA to improve the care that is provided to  veterans who are pregnant. More and more women are volunteering to  serve in the military and seeking services from VA as veterans.   As they grow their families, VA must provide them with high-quality,  easy-to-access, pre- and postpartum care.   Strengthening services to women veterans is one of my priorities as  the lead Republican on this committee, and I am proud to help do that  by supporting this bill today.   I thank Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth for sponsoring this bill on  behalf of our fellow veterans. I urge my colleagues to support it  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill. I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6288]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H6289]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4233, the Student  Veterans Counseling Centers Eligibility Act.   This bill would allow student veterans to access readjustment  counseling and peer support services at vet centers.   Student veterans have unique needs and stressors. This bill would  help them get the support they require to thrive in school and in their  post-military lives.   I am grateful to my good friend and committee colleague, Dr. Greg  Murphy, for introducing this bill. I thank him for his leadership on  behalf of student veterans, and I am confident this bill would benefit  them for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to support H.R. 4233  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Murphy), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 147, as amended, the  BRAVE Act.   Every year, nearly 200,000 servicemen and -women transition out of  Active Duty and into the civilian sector.   This bill would require the Department of Defense to provide  information on apprenticeship programs to separating servicemembers who  are practicing in the Transition Assistance Program.   The BRAVE Act would also require the Department of Labor to establish  a website that includes information on national apprenticeships and  those approved for the GI Bill benefits so it is readily available to  the transitioning servicemembers.   Last month's unemployment numbers showed that while the unemployment  rate for nonveterans decreased, the unemployment rate for veterans  increased slightly. This is concerning, and I am hopeful that improving  the way that we provide information to our veterans about available  apprenticeships may provide veterans with more opportunity for great  jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 147, as amended, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this  [[Page H6291]]  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3730, to create a VA  advisory committee on better serving veterans' needs in the  territories. For a number of Congresses, Congresswoman Radewagen,  Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon, Congressman Sablan, and other delegates  from the territories have honorably served their veterans and  constituents.   Committee staff has traveled with many of our delegates and  colleagues to the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto  Rico. We have seen firsthand the disparities and the difficulties that  their veterans face when trying to access healthcare and benefits from  the VA.   The combination of limited transportation options, the lack of local  resources, the overlapping Federal agency jurisdictions, and the  complexities around VA care in neighboring foreign nations make the  territories different from the rest of the Nation and difficult to work  in.   Unfortunately, the challenges that the veterans in the territories  face always seem to slide down to the bottom of VA's priority list.   While I am generally skeptical of new advisory committees, I believe  the voices of the veterans in the territories are not being heard, and  I share Congresswoman Radewagen's and Congressman Sablan's goal of  elevating their needs.   For those reasons, I support the bill, and I encourage my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
