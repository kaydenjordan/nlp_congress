 Madam Speaker, since 2011, National  School Choice Week has been recognized as the largest annual  celebration of opportunity and education in the world.   In North Carolina, over 2,313 school choice events are scheduled for  this week, including events in my district at the Quality Education  Academy High School in Winston-Salem and at the DT Early Learning  Center in Wilkesboro.   Unfortunately, the media continues to conjure up misleading claims  about school choice, and it is time we corrected the record. School  choice is not about picking winners and losers; it is about letting  families choose the educational options that meet the unique needs of  their children.   A high-quality education is an indispensable tool, and America's  children deserve nothing less than an education that empowers them to  reach their greatest potential.                            ____________________
