 Mr. President, today, as he is buried in the North Dakota  Veterans Cemetery just outside of his hometown of Mandan, ND, I honor  the life and patriotism of Navy Fireman 2nd Class Albert Renner. Like  so many young men of this ``greatest generation,'' he answered the call  to defend his country during World War II. On December 7, 1941, at the  age of 24, he made the ultimate sacrifice along with 2,402 other  soldiers and sailors during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He was  serving on the USS West Virginia, which sank after being hit by at  least seven torpedoes and two bombs.   Last year, aided by a positive DNA sent by his surviving siblings  several decades ago, Albert Renner's remains were finally positively  identified. On Tuesday, his body arrived at the Minneapolis airport. A  full military escort motorcade carrying his casket traveled the 400  miles home to Mandan. Many citizens, including veterans and fire and  police men and women, stopped along the highway to solemnly pay their  respects as the motorcade passed by.   Attending today's funeral service and burial are members of his  family who have traveled from across the Nation to pay their respects  to this beloved member of their family. Even though many of them never  met him, together they are mourning the lost blessings of Albert not  being a part of their family for the past 79 years.   Albert could have had a rewarding life on the family farm or in some  other profession. He could have had a wife and family and home of his  own. His burial service today is a poignant reminder of how the  sacrifice of heroes defending our Nation have an impact far into the  future on those who knew and loved them--and those who never will.   Navy Fireman 2nd Class Albert Renner died so Americans could live in  peace and prosperity. He is now back in his home State, lying in  eternal rest with other North Dakota heroes. I thank the many patriots  who are committed to identifying the remains of all unknown American  service members and bringing them home.   To the family of Navy Fireman 2nd Class Albert Renner, I join  citizens across our State and Nation in sending our sincere  condolences. It is heroes like Albert who have kept our communities,  State, Nation, and world safe. His life made a difference in the lives  of all of us. We are forever grateful.                            ____________________
