Each such report shall include, for       each such senior executive employee transferred during the       period covered by the report, the reason for the transfer and       any costs associated with the transfer.''.        Page 9, line 20, strike ``(i)'' and insert ``(j)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Taylor) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to the VA  Accountability First Act. This amendment would require the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs to submit a semi-annual report to Congress on the  reasons and costs of the transfer of any senior executive employees  within the Department.   Mr. Chairman, in my district and the surrounding area, we have the  fastest-growing veterans' population in the Nation, specifically, with  women veterans, Operation Enduring Freedom veterans, and Operation  Iraqi Freedom veterans. I am honored to serve in the district that has  the largest population of Active Duty and veterans in the country.   Our own VA center, where I personally receive care, was previously  rated as a one-star facility, the lowest rating available; this, by the  VA's own rating system. Now, I am pleased to say the center has made  strides and progress in many areas. However, the director in charge  during the time of poor performance was simply moved to another  facility to be a director there. We have to do better. We will do  better. The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 is a wonderful and  great start.   This amendment will contribute to more transparency, accountability,  and oversight. We must continually and consistently hold the VA  accountable for underperformance. Our veterans are sacred and deserve  the same commitment to high standards they upheld as servicemembers.   We should never defend mediocrity at the VA; rather, strive for  better service, care, and excellence.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe).                                time  1645     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe).                                time  1645     Mr. Chairman, I just want to state I thank the gentleman,  and I thank the gentleman on the other side, as well, for his support.  I think this is the right thing to do for transparency and for  accountability for our veterans in the VA.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Taylor).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 7 Offered by Ms. Tenney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7  printed in part A of House Report 115-39.
