 Mr. Speaker, a moment of silence is not enough.   I did not respond to the invitation of the gentleman from Texas to  come and stand here. I lost a young woman at Great Mills High School in  my district. I visited with her parents, I went to her funeral, and I  grieved with our community, but coming to this well and spending but a  moment for the thousands who have lost their lives is not enough. We  need to act.   The Governor of Texas thinks we ought to do something. The Governor  of Florida thought we should do something, and he did something.   We should bring to this floor legislation to try to stem this  violence. We will have disagreements as to what that may be, but a  moment of silence is not enough.                            ____________________
