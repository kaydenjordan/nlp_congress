 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to begin by congratulating our new  Senator from California for her first speech in the Chamber. I know it  is not her first official speech, but she is here on this important  night to talk about the state of public education in this country and  this confirmation process. So I thank her for her remarks. I also want  to thank the ranking member of the Education Committee of the Senate,  Senator Murray from Washington State, who is here tonight as well. I  know she has been here all day today and was here all day on Friday as  well, because the set of issues we are discussing are so important.   As I sat here listening to the Senator from California, I was  thinking about the work we have done recently on the committee on which  we both serve--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee-- with the leadership of Chairman Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee,  and Ranking Member Senator Murray, from Washington State, to pass a new  reauthorization of No Child Left Behind--a bill that if you said: Let's  have a rally on the steps of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind  the same, not a single person in the United States would have shown up  for that rally. It took this body 7 years--7 years after we were  supposed to reauthorize No Child Left Behind--to actually do the work.  But when we did the work, we were able to get it through the committee  once unanimously. This committee has on it, among other people, Senator  Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Senator Rand Paul from the Commonwealth  of Kentucky. They seldom agree on anything, but they agreed on that  bill. We got it out of the committee almost unanimously, and then  passed it on the floor of the Senate with over 80 votes. It passed with  a huge bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and it was  signed by the President. It was 7 years too late, but we were able to  do it in a bipartisan way--which is what education issues should always  require. It is a shame that tonight we are here with a partisan divide  because of the selection President Trump has made to lead the  Department of Education.   So I just want to say thank you again to Senator Murray for her  leadership.   Since our first days before we founded this country, education has  been an American value. In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere,  colonists recognized their collective responsibility to educate their  children. They wrote into law that children, both wealthy and poor,  must be taught to read and write, and to learn a skill, like  blacksmithing, weaving, or shipbuilding, to secure their economic  independence. As democracy took root in early America, public education  became not just an ideal but an imperative. An enlightened public, the  Founders believed, was essential to self-government.   Thomas Jefferson wrote that we must ``educate and inform the whole  mass of the people. . . . They are the only sure reliance for the  preservation of our liberty.''   Benjamin Franklin believed: ``The good education of Youth has been  esteemed by wise Men in all Ages, as the surest Foundation of the  Happiness both of private Families and of Common-wealths.''   With education, the common man would be able to select leaders wisely  and fight back against the tyrannical instincts of those in power. He  would be able to understand, maintain, and protect his rights, so that  government could not usurp authority and devolve into despotism.   In a country ``in which the measures of Government receive their  impression so immediately from the sense of the Community as in ours,''  George Washington explained, ``knowledge . . . is proportionally  essential.''   This set of beliefs represented a fundamental break from the  aristocratic ways of the old world. A republic that was ``for the  people'' and ``by the people'' required an educated people.   With this new world also came a new conviction that individuals could  determine their own future, that their birth or circumstance no longer  limited their potential. This foundational idea grew to become the  American dream: Every child, regardless of who her parents are or where  she came from, could achieve an education and grow up to achieve a  better life.   Over time, as our Republic became more and more democratic, as the  right to vote and lead was secured by African Americans and women,  education became the fundamental means by which Americans sought to  secure their liberty and their equality.   Perfecting our Union by expanding education has not come without  struggle, but we have often succeeded because we have recognized that  symbiotic relationship among the needs of our country and the success  of individual Americans and our aspiration to move forward. This  included the need for a universally literate workforce in the 1830s and  the creation of Horace Mann's Common School Movement; the demand at the  turn of the 20th century to replace out-of-date Latin schools with  progressive high schools that prepared students for the emerging  industrial workforce; the challenge of providing World War II veterans  with a career path and the creation of the GI bill for college  education; and the need to tear down the barriers of Jim Crow school  systems in the 1950s and 1960s.   Too often, as a country, we confronted these challenges too late and  at the tragic expense of our fellow American's potential. ``With all  deliberate speed'' has proven not fast enough, especially for children  living in places like the Mississippi Delta and South Central Los  Angeles.   At each of these turning points, we have asked for more from our  public schools. To their credit, our educators--teachers, specialists,  and principals--have risen to the challenge, many times much sooner  than the rest of us. They have helped us build a nation admired for our  forward progress, for opportunity, and for equality.   That is the American ideal from our founding until today. I come to  the floor tonight with a sense of urgency because our generation is at  risk of being the first American generation to leave less opportunity  to our children than we inherited. If we do that, we will have broken a  fundamental American promise to our children.   In our Nation, education is supposed to be at the heart of  opportunity, but today our education system fails far too many kids.  Schools that once were engines of opportunity and democracy are now too  often traps for intergenerational poverty.   As a result, only 3 out of 10 children born to very low-income  families in the United States will make it into the middle class or  higher. Only 4 out of 100 will make it to the top 20 percent of income  earners. Already, the United States has less social mobility than at  least 12 other developed countries--among them, Canada, Japan, and  Germany.   In America, children growing up in poverty here hear 30 million fewer  words than their more affluent peers by the time they reach  kindergarten. In fourth grade, only one in four of our students in  poverty is proficient in math, and fewer than that can read at  [[Page S725]]  grade level. As few as 9 will receive a bachelor's degree by age 25.   As a nation, we are falling behind the rest of the world. When George  Bush, the son, became President in 2000, we led the world in college  graduates. Today we are 16th in the world. American 15-year-olds score  lower than their peers in 14 countries in reading, 36 countries in  math, and 18 in science.   Much of the rest of the developed and developing world is figuring  out how to produce more and more educated citizens, while the United  States is standing still and therefore falling behind. We must refuse  to accept outcomes that are a tragedy for our children, a threat to our  economy, and an immeasurable risk to our democracy.   To make change, we need to stop treating America's children as if  they belong to someone else. To meet our children's needs, we must  invent a 21st century approach to education, a system for the delivery  of free, high-quality education built for the future, not for the past.   We must have the courage to shed old ways of thinking, abandon  commitments to outdated approaches, and explore new ideas. This  reenvisioned system must focus like a laser on what is best for kids,  not what is convenient for adults. It must be comprehensive and  integrated from early childhood to postsecondary education.   A 21st century system of public education must set high expectations,  demand rigor, and create meaningful accountability. This system must  embrace different kinds of schools and create a culture that is focused  on continuously learning from each other--among traditional, charter,  and innovation schools, and across districts, cities, and States.   We need to change fundamentally how we prepare, recruit, place,  train, retain, and pay teachers and school leaders. That entire system  belongs to a labor market that discriminates against women and said you  have two professional choices: one is being a teacher and one is being  a nurse. So why don't you come teach Julius Caesar every year for 30  years of your life in the Denver Public Schools, where we are going to  pay you a wage far lower than anybody else in your college class would  accept.   Those days are gone. We had discrimination in the labor market that  actually subsidized our school system because very often the brightest  students in their class--very often women--had no other career options  and therefore were willing to teach.   That whole system needs to be transformed in the 21st century. We  have 1.5 million new teachers whom we have to hire over the next 6 to 8  years in this country, and we have no theory about how to hire them or  how to keep them. Fifty percent of the people are leaving the  profession now in the first 5 years.   This new system of public education should embrace technology and  personalized learning. We must create space for innovation in school  autonomy, and we must also provide choice to parents and kids, but our  goal is not, and should not be, school choice for choice's sake.   For a youngster in a low-income family, there is no difference  between being forced to attend a lousy school and being given the  chance to choose among five lousy schools. That is no choice at all. It  is certainly not a meaningful one. The goal is, and must be, to offer  high-quality education at every public school so parents can choose  among grade schools in their neighborhood and throughout their cities  and towns.   We must refuse to accept the false choice I have heard over and over  again during this confirmation process that you either support school  choice in whatever form or you defend the status quo, just as we must  reject the idea that you cannot support public schools and advocate for  change.   This old rhetoric and manufactured political division will not work  for our kids. We need to rise above the narrow, small politics that  consume our attention and permit and prevent us from making tough  choices. Instead, we need to recognize that a 21st century education  can and should look very different than a 19th century education or a  20th century education, and no matter what approach or method of  delivery, it must be high quality.   The good news is, we know it is possible to reverse course and create  meaningful change. Several cities around the country have already begun  creating roadmaps to this 21st century approach. Denver is one of them.   In Denver, we made a deal--create a public choice system that  authorizes charters, creates innovation schools, and strengthens  traditional schools. We empowered schools through autonomy and worked  to create a culture of shared learning and innovation focused on all  ships rising. We demanded quality, and we implemented strong  accountability. High-performing schools were rewarded, replicated, and  expanded. Low-performing schools had to be improved or be shut down.   We made tough decisions. We closed schools. I sat in living rooms,  classrooms, and gymnasiums with parents urging them to demand more from  the school district, even if it meant that their child had to go to a  different school. Along with concerned citizens, teachers, and  principals, I went door-to-door to enroll kids in new schools.   Denver created innovative teacher and school leadership policies. We  tried to rethink the tired model of the last century and create a new  career for this one. That is why today in Denver you will find teachers  teaching other teachers and being paid for it, knowing that their job  is not only to educate their students but also to improve the honorable  craft of teaching so our kids can achieve even more.   We used the levers of Federal law, strong accountability, and civil  rights protections as the backbone of change. We cannot have made the  changes we did had it not been for the national demand for improvement  in our schools--the civil rights impulse that underlies the Federal  involvement in public education, as well as the courage of our  community to demand something better for our children. Denver has begun  to see the results of hard work.   Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools students' achievement  growth increased faster than the State's in both math and English. This  outcome was achieved by students qualifying for free and reduced-price  lunch and also students not qualifying for free and reduced-price  lunch. Latino and African-American students' achievement in English and  math grew faster than their counterparts' throughout the State.   Sixty-one percent more students graduated in 2016 than in 2006. We  have a long way to go, but I would suspect that if we could say of  every urban school district in America that we are graduating 60  percent more students this year than we were a decade ago, we would be  feeling a lot better about where we are headed as a country. In Denver,  over that time, the overall ontime graduation rate increased almost 30  points, and the ontime graduation rate for Latino students has doubled  since 2007.   Since 2006, Denver Public Schools' enrollment has increased--many  cities have lost enrollment--over 25 percent, making it the fastest  growing urban school district in America, partly because Denver has  grown but also because parents and kids and families have now found  schools that are responsive to their families' needs and supportive of  their children.   I am the first to say, and I always will be the first to say, that we  still have a lot of work to do to make sure the ZIP Code Denver's  children are born into doesn't determine the education they  receive. But cities like Denver are moving in the right direction. Now  we need to move a nation in the right direction.    Tonight, as we stand here in this marbled Chamber among these statues  that tie us to our past, I am thinking of our future. I am thinking of  the millions of poor children across time zones our Founders could not  have imagined, heading home after a long day at school, shifting their  backpacks of books to find a comfortable spot, sharpening pencils for  math and pastels for art, clearing a space on a busy dinner table for  homework. I am thinking about children teaching other children, older  brothers and sisters teaching their younger siblings, expecting that  they will have more opportunity than their parents. I am remembering  the naturalization ceremony I attended just last Friday at Dunn  Elementary School in Fort Collins, CO, where Kara Roth's fifth grade  class welcomed 26 new Americans from 13 countries to the United States.  I am thinking about  [[Page S726]]  teachers and principals and students--while we are here speaking--who  are up tonight, planning for tomorrow, and hoping for a future that  allows them to review at home before they teach tomorrow the best  lessons for teaching the productive and destructive forces of  volcanoes, what Scout learns in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' or the  mathematical reasoning that calls on us to invert the second fraction  when we divide. I am imagining a country that fulfills our generational  responsibility by providing quality early childhood education to every  American family who wants it--a K-12 school for every child to which  every Senator would be proud to send his or her child or grandchild and  access to college and skills training that prepare students for  economic success without shackling them to a lifetime of debt.   All of that leads me to comment briefly on President Trump's  nomination for Education Secretary. I have no doubt that Mrs. DeVos  sincerely cares about children. It is not her fault that President  Trump nominated her. So let me be clear that I am addressing the  President and not Mrs. DeVos when I say that this nomination is an  insult to school children and their families, to teachers and  principals, and to communities fighting to improve their public schools  all across this country.   Even with the limited questioning allowed at the education committee  hearing, it quickly became clear that Mrs. DeVos lacks the experience  and the understanding to be an effective Secretary of Education. The  bipartisan progress of American education achieved over the last 15  years was predicated on a deep commitment to three principles:  transparency, accountability and equity.   Mrs. DeVos's testimony and public record failed to establish her  commitment or competence to protect any of these foundational  principles. Her ``let a thousand flowers bloom'' approach asks American  school children to take a huge step backward to a world without the  high expectations and transparency that we need to give parents and  taxpayers the information they deserve on how our schools are  performing. Those high expectations, paired with the clear commitment  to accountability, ensure that our successful schools should be  replicated and our struggling schools should be held accountable for  improvement, regardless of whether it is a choice school or a district  school.   Finally, we know that the Secretary of Education holds the sacred job  of ensuring that every child in America gets the resources and the  support they deserve, regardless of their income, background, or  educational needs. This commitment to equity is at the core of the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Mrs. DeVos has shown no  evidence of her commitment to be the torch bearer for both excellence  and equity. Her ideology and dogmatic approach communicates a lack of  understanding and appreciation of the challenges we face and the depths  of solutions they demand.   A commitment to choice without a commitment to quality serves  ideology rather than improvement, and a commitment to competition  without a commitment to equity would forsake our democratic ideal that  a free, high quality public education must open the doors of  opportunity for all. For the first generation of students to whom that  promise feels elusive, they deserve an Education Secretary who has the  courage, competence, and commitment to orient our mighty education  system to build opportunity for all. Mrs. DeVos shows none of those  skills, and our young people cannot afford to wait 4 years for their  chance at the American dream.   Millions of Americans recognize this, which is why this nomination  has generated more controversy than any other. I look forward to  working with anyone--as I have over the years, including even Mrs.  DeVos--anyone interested in improving our children's opportunities and  taking seriously the future of our democracy. But I will not support  her nomination. I will vote no on this nomination and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the hour is late, or early in the morning,  and my colleague from Hawaii is here. Before I leave the floor, I want  to say how pleased I am to see the Senate actually debating the state  of education in America.   I said earlier today when I was here that if you are born poor in  this country, you arrive at kindergarten having heard 30 million fewer  words than your more affluent peers, and if you are born poor in this  country, by the time you get to the fourth grade, only about one in  four kids is proficient in mathematics, fewer than that are proficient  readers. What it all adds up to is that if you are poor in the United  States, your chances of getting a college degree by the time you turn  25 are about 9 in 100.   I often think about that when I am in this Chamber because there are  100 desks here, and if we were poor kids living in America, the desks  that would be occupied by college graduates would be the three desks  that my colleague from Hawaii is sitting at in the front row over  there, the four desks behind him, and then two more desks in the  following row. Every other desk in this Chamber if they were occupied  by poor children in this country, would be occupied by somebody who  didn't have a college degree.   Sometimes people say to me: Well, don't you know that not everybody  will go to college. College isn't for everybody. I find that when  people say that, they are often talking about other people's children,  not their own children. Even if that is true--and I do believe we  should build a robust system in this country that is not about a  college degree but is about acquiring skills and knowledge that can put  people on the path to acquiring a salary that is actually worth  something. In fact, the Presiding Offer and I have a bill together that  would allow students to use Pell grants for those kinds of educational  opportunities that may not get you to a college degree but will put you  on the pathway to acquiring greater skills.   I think it is very important that we have a system where people are  acquiring that kind of knowledge, but it also is true that it is, I  think, completely at war with who we are as Americans; that there is a  class of people in the United States, in the land of opportunity, who  because they are unlucky enough to be born poor, are unlucky enough to  go to schools that nobody in this Chamber would ever be content sending  their kid or their grandkid to.   In fact, if we had the results that we have for poor children in  America for the children and grandchildren of the Members of this body,  I am sure we would all leave and go back home and fix this problem. We  don't talk enough about the State of public education in this country.  We almost don't talk about it at all.   We just had a Presidential election in this country where the issue  didn't come up almost at all. I am glad we are having the debate, and I  strongly believe that the person President Trump has nominated is ill- equipped to help the country overcome the challenges we face in public  education and put us on the path we need to be on, which is a path that  says that we are going to provide in the United States robust, high- quality early childhood education for every family in America that  wants it.   We are going to have a system of public education in this country  that provides a K-12 school for every single child in America that is a  school that any Senator would be proud to send their kid. We are going  to make sure that every young person in the United States, and maybe  even people who aren't so young, has the ability to graduate from  college or acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the  21st century and do that without acquiring a mountain of debt that  requires them--in the case of people graduating now from colleges in  Colorado--to take 22 years of their lives to pay that debt back. It  doesn't make any sense.   This is the land of opportunity. The gateway to opportunity is a  high-quality education, and too many of our kids in this country in the  21st century don't have access to it. My hope is that when we get  through this debate, we can focus on the work that is happening in  places like Denver, CO, where we have seen, in just a 10-year period, a  60-percent increase in the number of kids who are graduating from high  school.   I am the first to say that we have a long way to go in Denver in  terms of making sure that a kid's ZIP Code doesn't determine the  education they get. I said earlier tonight and I believe if we could  say that every single city in America, every single urban district and  every single rural district where there are poor children and kids of  color going to school that we had increased the graduation rate over  the last 10 years by 60 percent, I think we would feel a lot better  about where we are headed as a country.   That is a fundamental challenge for this country. It is the most  important domestic issue we face, and I hope this debate tonight, this  24 hours we are spending on this nominee, is not the end of our debate.   As I said the other day in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, I think it would be a useful exercise for that committee to  spend the next year studying what is going on in public education in  this country, what is working well, what is not working well, and  figure out how we can work--the Federal Government can work--with  States, local governments, and local school districts to provide the  kind of opportunity that every kid in America deserves.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I see the majority leader of the Senate. I  will suspend until he has finished.    Mr. President, I too wish to congratulate my colleague  from South Carolina on his remarks. We don't share the same view on  this, but he is an important voice in the Senate, and I am glad that he  is a colleague on the Education Committee in the Senate.   As a matter of fact, the other day I said that I wish the President  had the sense to appoint him Education Secretary. The kids whom I used  to work for in the Denver Public Schools would have been very, very  well served by him.   The President, of course, is entitled to choose his team, and that is  partly  [[Page S952]]  what elections are about. The Attorney General, more than any other  Cabinet official, must be the people's lawyer, an advocate for the rule  of law above all else.   My office has received nearly 23,000 calls and emails opposing this  nomination. Many of them I cannot read today on the floor for fear of  violating the Senate rules. But it is clear from these comments that  young Coloradans who came to the United States and know no other  country but this country, who arrived here illegally, but, through no  fault of their own, fear they will be deported back to a country they  don't know--it is clear to me from the comments that I have received in  these letters that Coloradans in the LGBTQ community fear that an  Attorney General Sessions would turn a blind eye toward discrimination.  It is clear from these comments that Senator Sessions has not earned  the confidence of many Coloradans who may soon rely on him to protect  their rights and to identify abuses of constitutional power. And  Coloradans, many of whom I know, fought for equality and justice during  the civil rights movement, and fear that it will turn back much of the  progress we have made.   We have a disagreement about Senator Sessions' role before he came to  the Senate, but the fundamental reason I object to his nomination as  Attorney General is that he led the fight in 2013 against our  bipartisan effort to reform the broken immigration system in the United  States. And I sat here on this Senate floor night after night after  night listening to the Senator use fear and inaccuracies to derail our  best chance in years to fix this broken immigration system.   Now, in time, I have come to understand that people come to this  floor and they don't always--they are not always accurate in what they  say. Sometimes they don't mean to be accurate; sometimes they are just  mistaken. That was the first time I had ever heard that kind of  relentlessness, saying things that just weren't right. I am being  careful with my language because of last night's ruling.   He claimed that our bill--and, by the way, that bill, unlike almost  anything that has happened in this place in the 8 years that I have  been here--started out as a bipartisan effort, four Democrats and four  Republicans working together for 7 or 8 months in a room trying to  solve each other's issues.   There is a lot about the Senate today that the American people should  not and cannot be proud of, and I will come to that in a minute. But as  to the work of the Gang of 8, I would have been happy for people to  have seen what happened behind closed doors in those 7 months. It is  how the Senate ought to operate. It went to the Judiciary Committee  where Democrats and Republicans together amended the legislation. They  made it better. And then it came to the floor of the Senate and we had  more amendments, and it passed with 68 votes.   It still hasn't passed the House. It has never even gotten a vote on  the floor of the House of Representatives.   Senator Sessions claimed during that debate that our bill would have  ``dramatically increased incidence of criminal alien violence,  officially legalizing dangerous offenders, while handcuffing  immigration officers from doing their jobs.''   He claimed it would have legalized ``thousands of dangerous criminals  while making it more difficult for our officers to identify public  safety and national security threats.''   Senator Sessions claimed our bill would lead to a ``huge increase in  immigration,'' invite a flood of immigrants into our Nation who would  steal jobs from ``struggling American workers.''   These claims are demonstrably untrue. If our bill had become law, we  would have secured our borders, we would have bolstered internal  security, we would have better protected American workers, and we would  have strengthened our economy.   Contrary to his characterization of what was in that bill, the 2013  bill provided far greater security than President Trump's plan.   The first two words in the title of that bill were ``border  security.'' That has been completely ignored by the critics. It has  been completely ignored by people who want to make an issue out of this  in national campaigns. But the reality is it provided billions of  dollars toward new technologies to monitor the border. It called for  the building of a 700-mile fence. By the way, none of the rest of it  would come to pass until we took care of the border.   Nearly 20,000 new Border Patrol agents--four times more than ordered  by President Trump and double the current number--and not paid for by  raising taxes on the American people at our border with Mexico, not  paid for in a way that would destroy our trading relationship with  Mexico, but paid for by fees that people were paying as they were  becoming lawful in the United States of America. It had protections in  the bill for American workers to ensure that employers hired American  labor first. I know he objected to this, and I understand we had a  difference of opinion, but the bill included a tough but fair path to  citizenship, requiring people to go through background checks as part  of a long path to citizenship.   During the Presidential campaign, Senator Sessions advised President- Elect, now-President Trump on immigration policy. In fact, my  understanding is the President's immigration Executive orders-- including one being challenged in court--mirror Senator Sessions'  positions. These positions are antithetical to our history, to our  values, to whom we are as a country.   Last Friday was the highlight of my year. I got on a plane and I left  Washington--that was pretty good in and of itself--to go home to  Colorado. On Friday, I went to Dunn Elementary School in Fort Collins,  CO, where Kara Roth's fifth grade class welcomed 26 new Americans from  13 countries to the United States. It is an International Baccalaureate  program in this elementary school. This is an annual event.   We were there in the gym, and the fifth graders were there singing; a  young girl had won an essay contest on ``What it Meant to be in  America.'' There was a color guard. Kids came in wearing their Boy  Scout uniforms to post the colors, the American flag, and the flag of  Colorado. The fourth graders were there watching what they would be  doing next year as fifth graders.   There was no need for a politician to tell anybody in that room that  America is an exceptional country. No politician needed to say that to  the fifth graders in Mrs. Roth's class who were studying the  Constitution and studying immigration. We certainly didn't need to tell  that to the immigrants from all over the world. I think I mentioned,  they were from 13 different countries.   One of the great parts of the ceremony was when they asked people to  stand up to the country from which they came, and fifth graders also  stood up if they were from that country. There were kids from China;  there were kids from Mexico standing up in this fifth grade class;  incredibly, three kids from Libya whose parents are at the university  in some capacity in Fort Collins.   As always in these naturalization ceremonies, people had tears in  their eyes because as one of them once said to me at another time in  Colorado, his dream had come true the minute he became a citizen of the  United States because he knew his children would be citizens of the  United States of America. Everybody in the room knew that.   What is important for us is these fifth graders' perspective on  American government, on democracy, and on the history of this Republic  I think probably may not be quite exactly right because they, thank  goodness, have been untarnished by special interests, untarnished by  campaign money and partisan fighting, and power struggles that have  nothing to do with the American people or their priorities.   Their view of what the essence of self-government is all about is  really what it is all about. It is really what we are supposed to be  doing here: a commitment to a republic and democracy, a commitment to  the rule of law, a commitment to the separation of powers. The stuff  they are reading in their little Constitution just like this one is  what this place is supposed to be about. It is supposed to be what we  are doing here. It is the reason why I am objecting to this nomination.    The Denver Post editorialized yesterday, stating the  obvious horrible truth here:         American journalists have been killed reporting on       terrorists. They've been beheaded. . . . To suggest that some       kind of shared bias exists throughout American newsrooms so       strong that it compels journalists to hide truth and thereby       endanger the public is as dangerous as it is demonstrably       untrue.    That is right. It is dangerous. It is dangerous for the leader of the  free world to be saying that journalists are crooks; that the facts  they are publishing in newspapers and online are untrue when they are  true. It is dangerous when we are engaged in an experiment of self- government that goes back about 240 years to the founding of this  country to refute things that are absolutely true as false and to claim  that the reason they are being raised is because people lack integrity;  that journalism is all about false news.   The White House put out a list of, I think it was in the seventies,  of terrorist attacks they claim had never been reported, and newspaper  after newspaper after newspaper had to run lists of the events that the  White House described as unreported and then have links to the stories  in their own newspapers and other newspapers that had reported on  terrorists. As the Denver Post noted, and it is worth remembering this,  there are journalists who have lost their lives trying to cover this  story to have us better understand what is happening in the Middle  East, what the threat of terror looks like, and have been beheaded on  television because they took that risk.   With respect to the judges, for years it has been so painful around  here to get anybody confirmed. I see these folks who are lawyers who  have to put their law practice on hold for something that should be the  greatest reflection of achievement of their life, being appointed to a  Federal district court in this country, and who wait and wait and wait  because of the unconscionable delay and disputes and partisan bickering  that happens here instead of getting people on the court to do the job  that they need to do.   Now we are going to be in the business of accusing judges and the  judiciary of being crooked, of not following the law, of just playing  politics. I think it is really important for us--not just Democrats but  also Republicans--and I know my colleague is here from Florida. I wish  to say in this body how much I appreciated his comments last night. He  may not appreciate that I am saying that, but I appreciate his comments  because a lot of what he said I completely agree with.   I know it has become fashionable to tear down rather than work to  improve the democratic institutions which generations of Americans have  built. This place didn't get here by accident. It is not a fluke. The  Founding Fathers would be shocked--shocked--to know this Republic still  exists. They would be proud. I think they would be proud of the  progress we have made, but they would be shocked, at the time they were  compromising with one another--slave owners and abolitionists,  compromising to create this Republic that had never existed in an  expanse as big as the Thirteen Colonies geographically or with as many  people in the Thirteen Colonies geographically--for them to see this  about 240 years later from coast to coast, 330 million people, the  strongest military on the planet, the strongest economy on the planet,  a place where people want to come--just as my mother and her parents  came--to build opportunity for the next generation. That is incredibly  special in the history of humankind. As I think my colleague from  Florida was saying last night, we need to treat it with a little more  care.   I am not just talking about the Senate. I am talking about our  responsibility to provide oversight for this administration. I am  talking about the importance for us to set an example for the children  I saw last Friday at the naturalization ceremony, just as they are  setting an example for us.   None of us is going to be here forever. We have a lot of work to do.  There are a lot of people here and around the world who are counting on  us to pull ourselves together and start making this place work.  [[Page S954]]    I will finish by saying that I think in this world of social media,  it is also critically important for us to remember the importance of  edited content and the work that journalists do. There is not a class  of school kids whom I don't impose at least that thought on, as they  think about the research they are doing for their papers and the work  we need to do as Senators.   I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. Thank you for allowing me  to speak on this floor. It is a great privilege to be here, but it is a  privilege we need to exercise in a way that actually reflects the  values of this country and the expectations that the American people  have for us to address their priorities.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
