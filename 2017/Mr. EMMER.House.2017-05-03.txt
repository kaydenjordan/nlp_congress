 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a Minnesota  National Guard unit for recently receiving the prestigious John J.  Stanko Army National Guard Unit of the Year Award.   During their deployment, which included soldiers spread across  multiple locations, the Bravo Company 2 of the 211th General Support  Aviation Battalion completed more than 300 missions across Afghanistan,  enduring some of the most difficult and dangerous environments  imaginable. Additionally, they moved an incredible 1 million pounds of  cargo and participated in high-risk missions and deliberate operations  to support forces on the ground.   Due to their overall excellent performance, the Bravo Company  soldiers have been awarded three Bronze Stars, several Air Medals,  eight Combat Action Badges, three Meritorious Service Medals, five Army  Commendation Medals, and 14 Army Achievement Medals.   The Bravo Company's achievements have earned them the reputation as  one of the best Army aviation units serving in Afghanistan. We are  proud to know that these soldiers call Minnesota their home.   I want to thank these soldiers for their brave service to our Nation,  their unwavering dedication to their unit, and the honorable way in  which they have served. You are the reason the United States Armed  Forces are the best in the world.  [[Page H3079]]                                ____________________
