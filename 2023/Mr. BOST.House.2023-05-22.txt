 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 366) to amend title 38, United States Code, to treat certain  individuals who served in Vietnam as a member of the armed forces of  the Republic of Korea as a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United  States for purposes of the provision of health care by the Department  of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 366         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Korean American Vietnam       Allies Long Overdue for Relief Act'' or the ``Korean American       VALOR Act''.       SEC. 2. PROVISION OF CERTAIN BENEFITS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO                     SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF                     KOREA.         Section 109 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(d)(1) Any person described in paragraph (2) is eligible       for the benefits specified in subsection (a) to the same       extent and under the same conditions (including with respect       to applicable reciprocity requirements) as a discharged       member of the armed forces of a government specified in such       subsection who is eligible for such benefits under such       subsection.        ``(2) A person described in this paragraph is a person whom       the Secretary determines served in Vietnam as a member of the       armed forces of the Republic of Korea at any time during the       period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7,       1975, or such other period as determined appropriate by the       Secretary for purposes of this subsection.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R.  366.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Ranking Member Takano's bill,  H.R. 366, the Korean American VALOR Act.   This bill would allow Korean veterans who served during the Vietnam  war and later became American citizens to be eligible for VA  healthcare. VA has been providing healthcare services to ally veterans  through government agreements since World War I. These Korean-American  veterans deserve the same opportunity.   Korean-American veterans share similar needs with the veterans they  served alongside with in Vietnam. They suffer from PTSD and Agent  Orange exposure, among other injuries and illnesses. These veterans  have earned access to proper care through the VA. Ranking Member  Takano's bill will do exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the  vitally important alliance between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea.  As such, this bill is a fitting tribute to thank the Korean-American  veterans for their service. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  366.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, we do need to remember that this is a perfect  week to do this when Memorial Day is coming up, and we are honored to  make sure that these veterans are recognized in the way they should be  and that they do receive healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1669) to amend title 38, United States Code, to make permanent  the high technology pilot program of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 8. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``November 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``April 30,       2032''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R.  1669, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Representative Ciscomani's  bill, H.R. 1669, as amended. The bill would enhance the fund, the VET- TEC pilot program at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VET-TEC  pilot program was coauthored by Speaker McCarthy and Congressman Ro  Khanna in the Forever GI Bill in 2017.   Now, this program provides post-9/11 GI Bill-style benefits to  veterans so they can attend short-term training that leads to jobs in  the information technology sector. The education and employment program  has been a wildly successful program. It has helped thousands of  veterans not only find a job, but a career and a promising future in  the technology sector.   This program is an example of a government program that truly works  for our veterans. VET-TEC has an 80 percent graduation rate, a 62  percent employment rate, and an average salary of $65,000 a year.  Veterans using this program are going into careers with the best tech  companies in the world.   The reason this program works as well as it has, I think, is that the  schools only receive the full amount of the tuition and fees when the  student gets a job in the tech industry.   Now, this level of accountability is honestly something I think we  should be looking at for other Federal Government programs. Thousands  of veterans achieving the career of their dreams has proven to me that  it is time to expand VET-TEC.   Now, Representative Ciscomani's bill makes important changes to the  pilot program to make it even stronger so that it can continue to help  even more veterans find their American Dream. Improving VET-TEC program  has the full support of the VA and many veteran service organizations.   Three weeks ago, VET-TEC providers told us that the program had run  out of funds and they are no longer allowed to accept new students.  Over 2,500 student veterans will miss out on the chance for a better  career this year if Congress is unable to fix this problem. It goes  without saying, the time is short and the need to help our veterans  continue to access this training is great.   Even with record-high inflation and soaring interest rates, because  of the Biden administration, veterans using this program have shown  that they can still achieve high-paying jobs.   Representative Ciscomani's bill, as amended, also includes several  other bipartisan bills, including General Jack Bergman's bill, H.R.  234, which would allow survivors of veterans to receive the burial  allowance benefit if their loved one passes away at home while  receiving VA Hospice care, rather than in a VA facility.   Representative Arrington's bill, H.R. 1169, would also allow veterans  to receive their GI Bill electronic notifications virtually.   Representative Obernolte's bill, H.R. 746, would include nondegreed  pilot programs into the Veterans Readiness and Employment program.   Representative Van Orden's bill, H.R. 1798, would protect the spouses  of servicemembers from GI Bill debt.   Representative Kiggan's bill, H.R. 1635, would eliminate a nearly 70- year-old rule that limits the GI Bill payments that survivors and  dependents receive in the Philippines.   With the inclusion of these bills in H.R. 1669, we would make great  improvements in how our veterans can use the GI Bill benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Student Veterans of America, Veterans of  Foreign War, The American Legion, the VET-TEC Working Group, and  Disabled American Veterans for supporting the proposed legislation  today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1669, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, while I understand the concerns expressed by  the minority, I point out that the program has been a huge success in  helping veterans gain meaningful employment.   We have been very successful in recent years in reducing veterans'  unemployment, and now is not the time for us to take our foot off the  gas. I believe a successful education program, such as this one, is one  of the best ways to reduce veteran homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, I would also point out that the minority has had ample  time and opportunity to express their concerns of legislation hearing  on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am getting to my answer.    Mr. Speaker, they were also given a chance to submit markup  at a full committee markup, and yet, the first time I have heard these  concerns was late last week.   The bill, through regular order, as amended, was offered for the  minority Representative, Mr. McGarvey, to reduce the length of time in  the program. That amendment was accepted and included in the bill.   The length of the program was subject to bipartisan agreement. I  recognize that the minority has valid concerns about spending and  limited resources that we have worked with. The problem was made worse  with the passage of the Toxic Exposure Fund, the PACT Act, that  requires mandatory spending for many of the VA programs.   Mr. Speaker, I repeat my plea that my friends on the other side of  the aisle join me in developing a resolution to the issue.    Mr. Speaker, I will address veterans homelessness, as I  have always said I would. It is very concerning to me. We are currently  working on a package to address the issue, but I am not going to pit  one group of veterans against another. I would like my friends in the  minority to work with me to develop legislation to address veteran  homelessness in a bipartisan, fiscally responsible way over the next  few months.   The answer is yes, we will work with you, but we have got to actually  sit down and work together to figure out the problem of the expense and  knowing how it is and where it is that we make the investment that  still balances. That is the answer that I will give to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I will, and we will, work on this priority.  What we can do is chew gum and walk at the same time, and that means we  can go ahead and not only work on homelessness but also this bill, as  important as it is. I appreciate the gentleman's concern, but believe  me, our side of the aisle has just as much concern about our homeless  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani), the sponsor of the main part of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, one thing that needs to be very, very clear,  the Bergman bill does not have a TEF issue, a toxic exposure fund  issue. That is where the concerns are.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2479]]                                     time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to say a couple of things that I have said on  this House floor before. I am going to say them again.   The gentleman referred to our cutting veterans. Actually, we are  increasing over the President's budget. We will get more into that  later this week in committee.   Let me also say this, Mr. Speaker. I will repeat my plea right now  that our friends on the other side of the aisle join me in developing a  solution to an issue that he has decided is not anything more than a  political ploy, trying to say that we are going to cut benefits by  straightening this problem out.   We are not. We will not. Let me say this again on this floor:  Veterans are not being cut, period.   This is a good piece of legislation. It is bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all the people on our side of the aisle and  on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 777) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2023, the rates of  compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the  rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of  certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 777         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2023'' or the ``Veterans' COLA       Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2023, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2023, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.        (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving       spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a)       through (d) of section 1311 of such title.        (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--      Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of       such title.        (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2023, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2024.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on S.  777.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 777. I appreciate Senator  Tester and Senator Moran for their leadership on this important bill. I  also thank Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Chairman Luttrell and Ranking Member Pappas for leading the House  companion to S. 777.   Our bipartisan collaboration on this legislation each year is vitally  important. The Veterans' COLA Act of 2023 would increase the rates of  compensation for our veterans and their survivors to keep pace with  inflation and the rising cost of living.   Many veterans fought for our country and came back with visible and  invisible injuries. Their disability compensation benefits provide  financial security for service-disabled veterans and their families.   Mr. Speaker, veterans should not have to worry whether their earned  benefits can cover their basic needs. They should not have to choose  between gas to get to work or groceries for their family.   However, unfortunately, because of the Biden inflation problem that  has occurred because of out-of-control spending, this is a reality for  thousands of veterans' families. The least we can do for them is to  provide a cost-of-living adjustment this year so they can continue to  pay their bills and put food on their tables.   I am proud to support this bill today, and I hope all my colleagues  will join me in sending this bill to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Luttrell), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am ready to close,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also encourage all of our Members to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
