 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  February as Career and Technical Education Month. Each year, this month  highlights the benefits of a skills-based education and the valuable  contributions that CTE students make to the American workforce.   A one-size-fits-all approach to education is not an effective way to  prepare students for the workforce. We are  [[Page H594]]  doing students a great disservice when we only promote what is  considered a traditional college experience.   My appreciation for CTE came at an early age. My father, after  leaving the Navy, went through a CTE program, which led him to a job as  a tool and die maker. Eventually, he decided to start his own business,  which became quite successful.   As co-chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, and a  senior member of the Committee on Education and Labor, I have also  supported, and will continue to support, CTE programs that provide  learners of all ages with career-ready skills.   From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE  programs work to develop America's most valuable resource, its people.   CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving  students choose in pursuit of industry certification and hands-on  skills that they can use right out of school, in skill-based education  programs, or in college.   Congress recognized the importance of CTE when we passed the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act,  which helps close the skills gap by modernizing the Federal investment  in CTE programs and connecting educators with industry stakeholders.  This bill was later signed into law by President Trump in 2018.   While this is a major milestone, there is still more work to be done.  That is why I am supporting additional pieces of legislation on the  horizon to keep updating and promoting workforce development throughout  our Nation. These include:   The Skills Renewals Act, which creates a flexible skills training  credit in the amount of $4,000 per person that may be applied to cover  the cost of a wide range of training programs that build skills  expected to be in high demand by employers in the coming months.   There is also the Skills Investment Act, which enhances the Coverdell  education savings accounts--tax-advantaged savings accounts for  educational expenses--so American workers can use the accounts to pay  for their skills-based learning, career training, and workforce  development.   And lastly, the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act, which creates a  $10 million pilot program within the Department of Education to award  competitive grants to education-employer partnerships for the  development and implementation, and/or expansion of postsecondary CTE  programs that integrate cybersecurity education into curricula  preparing students for careers in critical infrastructure sectors.   COVID-19 has demonstrated the need for CTE. Many of those who have  been deemed as life-essential employees are those who have made their  way to those jobs through the Career and Technical Education pathway.  It gives people from all walks of life an opportunity to succeed and  restores rungs on the ladder of opportunity.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage my colleagues to  join my co-chair and I, Mr. Langevin, on the bipartisan Career and  Technical Education Caucus, to help us equip individuals of all ages  with the skills necessary to fill jobs now and in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and thank Robby Sneltzer of Venango County, Pennsylvania.   Robby is a 9-year-old Oil City resident with a kind heart. This  holiday season, Robby decided to help his neighbors in need by starting  a donation drive.   With the help of his stepmother, Angel, Robby began to collect  donations of toiletries, snacks, ponchos, hats, and hand sanitizer,  stuffing backpacks full of these much-needed items for those in need.   Robby's relatives pitched in with donations, as well as Hasson  Heights Elementary School and Hope Pediatrics. The backpacks were  donated to The Pointe. The Pointe is a drop-in center promoting  recovery and community awareness for individuals who struggle with  mental health difficulties.   Angela Proper, executive director of The Pointe, said: ``When Robby  brought them in and we piled them up, it was pretty amazing.''   I would like to personally thank Robby for his support of his  community. Acts of kindness like these make our world a better place.                            ____________________
