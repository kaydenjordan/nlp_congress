 Mr. President, I first thank our distinguished leader  from Illinois, not only for his eloquence and passion but his  unfettered commitment to the young people who were brought here as  children, who maybe had never set foot in the country their parents  came from and may not know the language. They are here, and a promise  was made to them in our country.   I spoke yesterday on the floor about two young people from Michigan.  We have 10,000 young people in Michigan--some serving in the military,  some in jobs, some in school--who don't know any other country. They  love our country, and they just want our country to keep its promise to  them. That is what I view it as, keeping our promises. So I thank the  Senator.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to speak about keeping promises  to a very important group of Americans as well; that is, our men and  women who are serving us as veterans and serving us in the military.   Representing Michigan in the U.S. Senate is a great honor. I know it  is for all of us. One of the best parts of the job is being able to  work on behalf of Michigan's veterans.   From the Civil War to the World Wars, to the Korean war, to Vietnam,  the Cold War, the Gulf war, and our fight against terrorism, Michigan's  veterans have given us their all. Our veterans have always been the  first in line to defend our democracy. That is why they should never be  at the back of any line--for a job, healthcare, housing, or a world- class education.   Unfortunately, there are times when our veterans aren't getting the  benefits they deserve, have earned, and have been promised. When that  happens, it is our duty to fight for those who fought for us. That is  why, in 2014, Congress passed something called the Veterans Access,  Choice, and Accountability Act, called the Veterans Choice Program.   This legislation aimed to reduce wait times and provide medical  services to veterans in their communities after we heard of very  serious issues and horrible situations that had occurred for veterans  in some parts of our country.   The Veterans Choice Act was created to meet a real need--getting our  veterans prompt healthcare in locations that are convenient for them.  This program is especially critical for veterans in rural communities  throughout Michigan as well as throughout the country--people in rural  areas who were previously required to travel long distances, hours and  hours, for services.   However, since it was enacted, providers across my State and in many  parts of the country have not been getting paid, rural hospitals have  pulled out, and this program in Michigan has not been working.   Worst of all, too many Michigan veterans and veterans across the  country are struggling to get the appointments and the healthcare they  need. That is why, last week, I introduced a bill I am calling the  Veterans Deserve Better Act.   This bill will help our veterans in three ways to be able to correct  what is occurring right now in Michigan with a private contractor--a  private provider  [[Page S8165]]  who has not been doing the job. I have talked to the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs who understands the problem and agrees this has to be  fixed.   My bill will improve the scheduling process for veterans seeking  healthcare. They shouldn't have to wait weeks or months to be able to  get an appointment with a doctor.   Our military operates under the simple creed, ``Leave no person  behind,'' but far too many of our veterans in need of healthcare are  languishing in a system that simply isn't accountable to them. Through  this private contracting process, that certainly has been the case.   My bill would require the VA, and any outside contractors who are  setting up healthcare appointments through the Veterans Choice Program,  to provide veterans with more and better information, and if veterans  are still struggling to get appointments, they will be told exactly how  to file a complaint so it can get fixed.   Second, my legislation will hold third-party contractors accountable.  We have excellent service through our VA medical facilities, but this  new system--which is supposed to make it better, quicker, and faster-- has not been working, and third-party contractors, at least in  Michigan, have not been held accountable.   The VA will track all appointments made through outside contractors  who must schedule appointments within 5 days. Any appointments not  scheduled within 5 days will be sent to the VA for followup.   Within 30 days of this legislation being signed, third-party  contractors will be required to submit a list of the veterans who have  been waiting for more than 15 days for their appointments. I know of  many waiting much longer. We don't leave soldiers on the battlefield.  We shouldn't leave veterans to fight alone to get their healthcare  needs met.   Third, this legislation ensures that Veterans Choice Program  providers receive prompt payment or denial of payment. If payment is  denied, the healthcare provider will need to be told why and what  information they need to submit in order to get the claim processed.   The VA will also be required to submit a report to Congress on the  number of unpaid claims to Veterans Choice Program providers and to  take action on those claims within 45 days.   What do I mean by providers? I am talking about our hospitals in  northern Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, in the northwest side of the  State, and the northeast side of the State signed up under this program  to be able to provide the care for someone who is more than 40 miles  away from a VA medical center; then, they find they are not getting  paid for their services to the tune of millions and millions of  dollars.   Veterans who have served their country and the medical providers who  treat them deserve nothing less than getting this system right.  Appointments should be made quickly, payments should be made for  service, and there has to be continual accountability. Unfortunately,  we know they aren't always getting what they need.   One of those veterans is Jerry, a former National Guardsman who was  stationed in Greenville, MI, on the west side of the State. He now  lives in Sumner Township in Gratiot County.   Last January, Jerry received a scary diagnosis. He had a lesion on  his brain. He needed to see a specialist right away. Veterans Choice  was supposed to make an appointment for Jerry to see an  endocrinologist, but when he showed up for the appointment,  unbelievably, he discovered he was mistakenly sent to a urologist.  After that, Veterans Choice sent Jerry to a family practitioner who had  no record that he even had an appointment. It was 2 days off of work  and travel to visit doctors that Jerry should have never been sent to  in the first place.   By this time, Jerry was understandably very upset. He reached out to  my office, and I am glad he did, so we could help. We were able to  contact Veterans Choice on his behalf and get him the appointment he  needed with the right specialist. Now, this is after his spending 5  months--5 months--trying to get to the right doctor. There is no excuse  for this.   However, Jerry's issues weren't over. When he saw the same specialist  a second time, Jerry learned the doctor had never been reimbursed for  his previous visit. As Jerry said, ``It shouldn't take five months to  see a specialist, especially with something this scary and serious. And  I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not Veterans Choice will pay  for my care that I have earned.''   Yes, Jerry, you have earned and been promised that care.   Jerry is exactly right. Unfortunately, he is not alone in Michigan--I  know this from talking to colleagues in other areas--particularly with  this same provider. I have heard from many other Michigan veterans who  can't get appointments, are getting the wrong appointments, are having  to travel long distances to appointments--which, this was supposed to  stop veterans from having to drive long distances for appointments--or  whose healthcare providers aren't being paid for their services and  then deciding they don't want to participate in the Veterans Choice  Program.   My colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee are working on  comprehensive reforms to the Veterans Choice Program, and we are  staring down another funding deadline. It is important this gets done,  and we need to do it right away. We need to fix the problems veterans  are having to deal with on a daily basis. I am looking forward to  working with colleagues to fix this as quickly as possible. Our  veterans deserve better. It is time we pass this legislation and make  sure they get it.   I would like to end with the words of a man who knew something about  service and sacrifice on behalf of our country.   Before he was President, before he was a member of this very Chamber,  John F. Kennedy was a veteran who served in the U.S. Navy during World  War II. On August 2, 1943, the PT boat he commanded was struck by a  Japanese destroyer in the South Pacific. The entire crew ended up in  the water, and two of his men died. Although Lieutenant Kennedy badly  injured his back in the collision, he helped his men find safety on an  island several miles away, where they were rescued a week later.  Kennedy later was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his  leadership. He once said: ``As we express our gratitude, we must never  forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live  by them.''   I believe that is our responsibility. It is not enough to praise our  veterans on special days, although they have certainly earned every  word of praise. Instead, we must work together to uphold each and every  promise we have made to them.   Veterans like Jerry and so many others have always been first in line  to defend us. It is time to make sure they are not at the back of the  line when it comes to getting the healthcare they need.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different subject, talking about  keeping promises; that is, other people who are counting on us to be  able to act in order to get their healthcare.   We have had 81 days since the funding ended for the Children's Health  Insurance Program and community health centers. Each State is a little  different because of the various combinations of funding and so on,  which meant not everyone lost care immediately right after. There are  three States this month, others in the first of the year, and so on.   I literally received just a few moments ago a notice from our State  saying it is very likely that if we don't act, in January, families in  Michigan are going to get a notice that what we call MIChild, which  provides healthcare for 100,000 children in Michigan of working  families who don't qualify for help through Medicaid or other  assistance--they are working and maybe at work they are getting  healthcare, but it doesn't cover their children, or maybe they are not  getting healthcare, and they want to at least be able to cover their  children, that is what MIChild is all about.    It has been 81 days since the deadline of September 30, which stopped  the Federal funding from going forward. This affects 9 million children  nationwide and 100,000 children in Michigan.  [[Page S8166]]  In addition to that, community health centers across the country serve  25 million patients every year; 300,000 of them are veterans, and 7.5  million of them are children.   I had the opportunity last Friday to visit two wonderful facilities-- one in Flint, which is in Genesee County, and one in western Wayne  County--and see the great work they do and talk to some of the people  who were there to get care. People are counting on community health  centers and they are counting on the Children's Health Insurance  Program in order to make sure they have the care they need for  themselves and their families.   It is important that we act. We could act right now. This is  bipartisan. We passed a bipartisan bill out of the Finance Committee in  September, before the deadline. I want to thank the chairman, Senator  Hatch, and the ranking member, Senator Wyden. I was pleased to join  with them. We passed it out of committee with only one ``no'' vote. We  have bipartisan support to get this done. Senator Blunt and I offered a  bill that is bipartisan and has had the support of 70 Members of this  body in signing a letter saying to continue funding for community  health centers.   Our plan all along was to pass the children's health insurance bill  out of committee in September and add health centers and then pass it  before the deadline so that it would take away the anxiety, worry, and  fear that families now have about what is going to happen.   Every day that goes by, people are worried about what is going to  happen. Are they going to be able to take their child to the doctor, be  able to get their asthma treatments, handle their juvenile diabetes,  cancer treatments, or the normal things that happen to kids every day?   I am not sure if there will be any votes today. We could, today, pass  the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers  and let families across America know they are going to be able to have  the medical care they need for themselves and their children coming  into the new year.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
