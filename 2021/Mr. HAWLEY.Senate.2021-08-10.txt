 Mr. President, I ask that my amendment be called up, No.  2734, and that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of hiring more law  enforcement officers across this country--100,000 more, to be precise.  And here is why. We are in the midst of an unprecedented crime wave in  this country, a crime wave of violent crime, and our families and our  children are in the crosshairs.   This past year, the murder rate in this country rose, year over year,  higher than anytime in six decades. This past year, the FBI reports  that fatal felony attacks on law enforcement officers spiked by over 50  percent. In St. Louis, MO, my home State, 262 residents were killed in  2020. That is the highest number in over half a century.   Cops are being targeted. Families are being targeted. Children aren't  safe on the streets. We need to take action now to put more law  enforcement officers on our streets to protect our families.   Now, I recognize that my friends across the aisle say they don't want  to defund the police. That is outstanding. Let's go a step further.  Let's fund them. Let's put 100,000 new cops on the streets right now to  protect our families, to protect our children.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
