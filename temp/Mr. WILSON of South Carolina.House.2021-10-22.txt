 Madam Speaker, Tim Murtaugh, a visiting  fellow at The Heritage Foundation, correctly wrote: ``President Joe  Biden is drowning in a sea of crises of his own creation, and Americans  are the ones who are paying the price.   ``There's an ongoing humanitarian and national security calamity at  the southern border.   ``Thirteen U.S. servicemembers are dead, and an unknown number of our  citizens remain stranded in Afghanistan following Biden's disastrous  withdrawal.   ``Americans are not taking the millions of jobs available . . . as  many have chosen the option of being paid by the government to stay  home instead of working.   ``And energy prices continue to rise, helping to drive mounting  inflation . . .   ``Such a callous dismissal of real-world issues . . . simply feeds  the prevailing belief that Biden simply is bad at his job.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to America.   Our thoughts and prayers are with South Carolina Senate Finance  Chairman Hugh Leatherman for a speedy recovery.                            ____________________
