 Mr. Speaker, in light of this unprecedented natural  disaster in Houston and Louisiana, along the Gulf Coast, I want to urge  my colleagues to provide the resources necessary to help them recover.  We need to move quickly and we need to move responsibly, and I just  urge my colleagues to act, and act now.   I am very proud of my fellow Texans for the way they have responded.  I am proud of the leadership at the local level, at the State level,  and I am proud, mostly, of the overwhelming, loving response of  reaching out, neighbor helping neighbor, friends and folks in their  community taking this responsibility head-on, not waiting on the  Federal Government. We have a role, and the Federal Government ought to  do all that we can to help those.   Texas is a special place, Mr. Speaker. As you know, these folks are  very self-reliant. They are committed to their communities, and they  are committed to loving thy neighbor. It is not just a memory verse, it  is a way of life in Texas.   So, again, our thoughts and prayers are with our friends back home. I  know my colleagues and neighbors in west Texas, in District 19, have  sent first responder vehicles and personnel, food, and supplies. Dyess  Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, has sent, for example, 12 tons of  supplies and food. So we are with you guys. We love you.   As Trump said, ``Texans can handle anything.'' He is right.   God bless Texas, and God bless America.
