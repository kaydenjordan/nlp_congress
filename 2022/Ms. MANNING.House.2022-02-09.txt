 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Global Respect Act, including my amendment to ensure accountability for  torture.   As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am proud to work with  my colleagues, Chairman Meeks and Congressman Cicilline, to protect and  defend human rights and uphold our values around the world.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would require the President to  identify and impose visa sanctions on foreign individuals responsible  for human rights violations against LGBTQ-plus people.   My amendment would direct sanctions against those responsible for one  of the most horrific acts of violence: torture. No one should face  violence because of who they are or who they love.                                time  0945    We must hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights  accountable no matter what. This important legislation ensures that the  United States continues to protect the human rights of all people,  including LGBTQ people targeted by some of the world's worst and most  oppressive regimes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Global  Respect Act.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the late  Commissioner Carolyn Coleman, a loving mother, grandmother, and a  remarkable trailblazer for civil rights.   She had a lifelong commitment to activism, from her first heroic  actions at the Savannah sit-in, to her years of advising Governor Hunt  on legislation to benefit minorities. She made history as Guilford  County's first African-American chairwoman in 2005, where she continued  to serve her community for the next two decades.   Commissioner Coleman recently earned the North Carolina Association  of Black County Officials Frederick Douglass award for her work feeding  the community during the pandemic, a testament to her unwavering  commitment to service.   She was never the center of attention, but when she spoke, all eyes  immediately went to her. Her thoughtful words had the power to change  minds and encourage others to join her calls to action. Her influence  made a consistent and admirable impact on the community.   Carolyn Coleman paved the way for progress, with a kind heart and a  relentless spirit. She will be deeply missed by the Triad community,  but she leaves behind an incredible legacy and a loving family. May her  memory be a blessing for all who knew her.                            ____________________
