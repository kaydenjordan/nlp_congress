 Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend for yielding.   I believe that despite the opposition from our friends on the other  side, that this amendment has bipartisan support.   I thank my good friend Congressman Earl Blumenauer for introducing  this important amendment with me to prohibit the Department of Justice  from interfering with State cannabis programs.   I especially appreciate that Congressman Blumenauer ensured that the  amendment covers the District of Columbia, as well as the territories,  in prohibiting the Department of Justice from using its funds to  prevent jurisdictions from implementing their own medical and adult-use  marijuana laws.   The District has insisted that Congress cease interfering with our  desire to commercialize adult-use marijuana, and I appreciate that D.C.  is included with the other States that have the same goal.   This amendment is the breakthrough the District has long sought so  that cannabis, as with all other issues, is treated, for the people who  live in the Nation's capital, who pay the highest taxes per capita in  the United States, with equality that is due them.   Here, with this bill, as with all other matters, we so insist.   Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend for yielding and for cosponsoring  this amendment with me.
