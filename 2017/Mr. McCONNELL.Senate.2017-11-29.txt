 Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No.  165, S. 1519.    Madam President, during the last decade, hard-working  American families have tried to get ahead, but they too often faced  insurmountable barriers. The economy was sluggish, paychecks were  stagnant, and jobs and opportunities stayed literally out of reach. The  people we represent deserve a whole lot better than that, and it is  time for us to deliver. It is time to take our feet off the brakes and  get our economy going again and growing again. We could do that through  tax reform.   Every American who has ever interacted with the IRS already knows  that our Tax Code is broken. Rates are too high, deductions and  loopholes are too complex to understand, and it is too easy for well- connected elites to take advantage. Passing tax reform is the single  most important thing we can do right now to shift the economy into high  gear and deliver much-needed relief to American families.   The Senate Finance Committee has developed a bill that is the result  of literally years of work, dozens of hearings, and a full committee  markup. I once again commend Chairman Hatch for his leadership of this  committee and thank him for producing legislation to unleash the  potential of our economy, to create jobs, and to keep them right here  in America.   Throughout this process, we have kept middle-class families at the  center of our efforts. We want to make their taxes lower, simpler, and  fairer. That is why our plan would give the typical family of four with  a median income a tax cut of close to $2,200 a year. A single parent  raising his or her child on a modest income could also see a tax cut of  nearly $1,400. These are real savings that can help families plan for  their future and actually get ahead.   The Finance Committee's tax reform proposal also provides substantial  relief to small businesses. We want to make it easier for them to grow,  to invest, and, of course, to hire. The bill also will remove  incentives for corporations to ship jobs and investments overseas.   Finally, our tax reform proposal delivers relief to low- and middle- income Americans by repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate tax. For  too long, families have suffered under an unpopular tax from an  unworkable law. Repealing this ObamaCare tax will help those who need  it most.   Yesterday, the Senate Budget Committee, under Chairman Mike Enzi's  leadership, reported out a bill, including our proposal to reform the  Tax Code. I thank Chairman Enzi and the members of the Budget Committee  for their outstanding work to get us to  [[Page S7368]]  this important moment. They have been strong advocates for tax reform,  and I appreciate their efforts. The committee's report also included  Chairman Murkowski's plan to further develop Alaska's oil and gas  potential in an environmentally responsible way. Her legislation, which  has the support of her Alaska colleague, Senator Sullivan, was designed  to create good jobs, provide new sources of energy, and strengthen our  national security. Now they will both advance to the Senate floor.   Today, the Senate will take the next important step toward fixing the  Tax Code and helping middle-class families keep more of their hard- earned money. Members will vote to begin debate on this once-in-a- generation opportunity to reform our Tax Code so it works for the  middle class. I encourage any Member who thinks we need to fix the  problems of our outdated Tax Code to vote to proceed to this  legislation. Anyone who thinks that rates are too high or that  loopholes are too prominent should vote to begin debate. To Members who  have ideas about how to make the bill better, I would urge them to vote  for the motion to proceed and offer their amendments. I believe my  mandate from the people of Kentucky is to vote yes, and I certainly  intend to do so.   The bottom line is this: We must vote to begin debate because once we  do, we will be one step closer to taking more money out of Washington's  pocket and putting more money into the pockets of the hard-working men  and women we represent. This is our chance. This is our chance to  deliver relief for the people who sent us here, and the way we can do  that is by voting to proceed to the bill. Every Member will have the  opportunity later today to answer the calls of American families by  voting to begin debate. I will vote yes on the motion to proceed, and I  would urge all of my colleagues to do the same.                          Nomination of David Stras    Now on another matter, Madam President, our colleague Senator  Grassley has done an outstanding job of processing the Senate's  judicial nominees, beginning with the President's selection of Judge  Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court. Chairman Grassley and  members of the Judiciary Committee continue their important work today  as the committee holds a hearing for three more of the President's  judicial nominees, including two well-qualified nominees to our circuit  courts, Justice David Stras and Mr. Stuart Kyle Duncan.   The committee's hearing today is particularly important because it  means that one member of this body--in this case, the junior Senator  from Minnesota--cannot singlehandedly block the committee from  considering an extraordinarily well-qualified nominee to serve on our  circuit court. That nominee is Justice David Stras of the Minnesota  Supreme Court.   Justice Stras is an extremely qualified and widely admired member of  Minnesota's highest court. He was raised by a single mother. He is the  grandson of a survivor of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.   Justice Stras graduated first in his class from the University of  Kansas Law School. He clerked on the court of appeals and the U.S.  Supreme Court. He worked for several years in private practice until he  joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota Law School. He was  appointed to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 2010, and in 2012,  Minnesota voters elected him to a full term on their highest court.   His reputation in the Minnesota legal community is impeccable. It is  no wonder that the American Bar Association--hardly a rightwing  organization--gave him its highest rating, unanimously ``well  qualified.''   Nevertheless, the junior Senator from Minnesota does not support  Justice Stras receiving so much as a hearing. That approach is  untenable in light of the recent actions of our Democratic colleagues.  A little more than 4 years ago, they eliminated the supermajority  requirement for ending debate on lower court nominees. They did so,  they said, because they believed that a minority of the Senate should  not be able to prevent the confirmation of a nominee who enjoyed the  support of a majority of this body.   Perhaps our Democratic colleagues now feel buyer's remorse over the  change to the Senate rules they jammed through this body, but they  should not be allowed to use the committee's blue-slip courtesy--which  is neither a committee rule nor a Senate rule--as another way to block  the consideration of nominees with majority support. As Chairman  Grassley has pointed out, that approach is not the way the blue-slip  courtesy was first used, nor is it the way the vast majority of the  Judiciary Committee chairmen have used it.   After Senate Democrats have changed the Senate's rules to prevent 41  Senators from stopping a nominee, our Democratic colleagues surely  cannot now think it is tenable to give just one Senator absolute power  to do so. They decided that 41 Senators ought not to be able to stop a  nominee. How can they now argue that one Senator should be able to, in  effect, block all the nominees?   In this case, the junior Senator from Minnesota acknowledges that it  is ``undeniably true'' that Justice Stras is a ``committed public  servant whose tenure as a professor at the University of Minnesota  underscores just how much he cares about the law.'' Yet our colleague  objects to the committee even considering his nomination. Why does he  want to block a widely respected and accomplished State supreme court  justice from his own State whom his constituents actually support?  Because our colleague doesn't agree with the U.S. Supreme Court  Justices whom the nominee admires, one of whom the nominee happened to  clerk for.   I applaud Chairman Grassley for not allowing the blue-slip courtesy  to be abused in this fashion, and I look forward to learning more about  Justice Stras's views from today's hearing.
