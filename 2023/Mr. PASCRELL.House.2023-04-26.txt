 Mr. Speaker, for months the other side has held our  economy hostage. Today, we have their ransom demands. This rip-off  kills millions of jobs, guts working family benefits, and sabotages tax  fairness.   Now, I have listened today, and many times both sides are saying the  same thing, reading off the same page. They all can't be right.   Look at the facts. This is not about deficits. This shakedown lets  wealthy tax cheats off scot-free and balloons the deficit by $120  billion. Please respond to that: $120 billion deeper in debt. Do not  fall for this total sham. Today's smorgasbord of policy goals is a  cynical distraction from the horrifying impacts of this extortion.  [[Page H2031]]    Mr. Speaker, Social Security, Medicare, veterans' care, and  homeownership are at stake. I am sorry to say we have come to this.
