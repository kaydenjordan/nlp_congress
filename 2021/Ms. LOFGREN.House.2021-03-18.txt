 Mr. Speaker, imagine this: You are 17 years old. You  have worked hard, and you are the valedictorian of your high school  class, the quarterback on the football team. You go down to apply for  your driver's license, and you find out for the first time that you  were actually not born in the United States and that you are  undocumented.   There is no possibility for you to get right with the law, but you  did nothing wrong. You don't even remember the place that you were  born.   That is the circumstance that tens of thousands of young people find  themselves in, and this bill allows those young people to get right  with the law--they have done nothing wrong--and go on to become the  full Americans that they are except for their paperwork.   It does something else that is important, which is it recognizes that  there is a group of people who are here under visas, but because the  Senate messed up--that is a term of art--the per country cap bill that  this House passed by 365 votes in the last Congress, there is a huge  backlog from large countries so long that the dependents of lawful  temporary visa holders age out. They have no remedy, just as the other  Dreamers. They can't go back to the country they were born in because  their parents are legally here. They have no capacity to become the  full Americans that they are. This also resolves that problem.   It is distressing to hear the rhetoric about the border. In fact, the  uptick at the southern border began last April, and it relates to  hurricanes and disorder in three Central American countries.   We need to pay attention to what is going on in those three  countries, and that is something the Biden administration is taking  steps to do to solve that problem where it starts. I will just note  that nobody is escaping from Costa Rica. It is the disorder in three  countries that needs to be resolved.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``yes'' on this bill.    Madam Speaker, our country has come through a pandemic,  and many of us have suffered, but there is one thing that we can be  grateful for, and that is that the food chain was never disrupted.   Throughout the pandemic, we could go to the grocery store and there  would be food in that store. For that, we need to thank the farmers of  this country. But we also need to thank the farmworkers of this  country, a majority of whom are undocumented and a majority of whom  have been here more than 10 years.   What this bill does and how it was formed is important. I want to  thank Representatives   Dan Newhouse,  Mike Simpson, Doug LaMalfa, and  many others on the Republican side of the aisle. I worked with   Jim  Costa,   Jimmy Panetta, and many others to try to see if we could come  together to come up with solutions for the challenges that we face in  farm country.   We pulled together growers and the farmworkers union to talk together  for solutions. It took us almost a year of growers and the farmworkers  union, and Republicans and Democrats, sitting around a table to come up  with this bill.   It has basically three provisions.   The first recognizes that we have had undocumented farmworkers in our  [[Page H1550]]  fields for decades. It allows them to get a certified agricultural  worker card so that they can work without fear. That is a temporary  worker status. They can renew it, travel, pay taxes, and continue  forever in that status. After working for a long period of time, they  and their families have the option of applying for legal permanent  residence if they choose.   The second provision streamlines an existing program, the H-2A  program, so that we will have a legal supply of farmworkers in the  future. Both labor and employers agreed to those streamlines.   The final provision says that if we have a system that works, then we  need to enforce that system. We are going to have the E-Verify system  used in agriculture after this bill is fully implemented.   Who is in favor of this? The Arizona Nursery Association, California  Farm Bureau Federation, Georgia Milk Producers, Michigan Greenhouse  Growers Council, Minnesota Milk Producers Association, Ohio Produce  Growers Marketing Association, Texas Association of Dairymen, and  hundreds of other growers.

Madam Speaker, I ask that we come together and pass this  bill. America will be stronger and better if we do.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  both sides?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    No, I do not.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There has been a lot of rhetoric today about the border, and I think  it is important to address some of it.   First, let's get the facts straight. The uptick in apprehensions at  the southern border began in April 2020, last year, long before we knew  President Biden was even going to become the Democratic nominee, much  less the President.   During the pandemic, the Trump administration did something that  troubled me a great deal and that I objected to. They ignored the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act. That was a bipartisan bill.  Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey was the lead on the Republican  side. I worked on it on our side along with others. It had a very  precise protocol for what to do when an unaccompanied child presented  at the border, a potential trafficking victim.   Instead of following that protocol, the prior administration would  simply take that child, an 11- or 12-year-old little girl, and turn her  back into Mexico, not knowing what would happen to her.   Now, those children who have been in squalid camps for the last year  are being addressed pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.  It is correct that we have had more children present than we were  prepared to deal with, and there was a scramble to take care of those  children properly. But it has nothing to do with the Farm Work  Modernization Act.   I listened with some interest to the suggestion that there needs to  be a change in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection  Act provisions of this bill. Currently, H-2A employers must comply with  the H-2A program requirements, which largely meet or exceed MSPA. The  primary difference is that the DOL stands in the place of the foreign  farmworker in bringing forward cases of alleged violation of the H-2A  program.   The Fair Labor Standards Act and a number of other Federal and State  laws apply to the H-2A program, but it is worth noting that any H-2A  employer that employs one or more domestic workers who perform seasonal  or temporary agricultural work is already covered under MSPA, and that  would be close to like all employers. This bill would formally place  all employers of H-2A workers under MSPA, impacting only those who hire  no domestic employees.   The idea that there needs to be a right to cure has merit, except it  is already addressed in this bill because it requires mandatory  mediation. If there is a problem that can be fixed, it will be fixed in  the mediation system. That is quite new.   The other thing to point out is that there are no attorney's fees  provided for in the bill or in MSPA, so the idea that somehow this is a  windfall for the trial bar is simply incorrect.   There is a great Q&A truth setting in a publication called Hoard's  Dairyman, ``What the Farm Workforce Act could mean.'' I include the  article in the Record.                   [From Hoard's Dairyman, Mar. 15, 2021]                   What the Farm Workforce Act Could Mean                               (By Bob Gray)         The Farm Workforce Modernization Act, bipartisan bill H.R.       1603, was reintroduced this week by Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren       (D-Calif.) and Congressman Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.). It could       be taken up by the full House this week.        Here are some additional details about the bill. Most of       this information came from the four Republican leads--      Representatives Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Mike Simpson (R-      ldaho), Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), and Doug LaMalfa (R-      Calif.). Before reading further, I want to reiterate,       however, that this is a bipartisan bill with support from       both sides of the aisle.        The Farm Workforce Modernization Act (FWMA) expands the       current H-2A seasonal worker program to include full-time,       year-round workers for dairy and other agricultural       businesses.        The bill is not perfect, but it is a very good start in       providing an extremely important piece of the legislative       reform needed by dairy farmers. Right now, as you all know,       we have no program. We have never had an immigration worker       program in the past.        When the bill goes before the House next week, you will       hear various pros and cons about it in the press. Therefore,       I thought it would be useful to include a ``Facts and Myths''       sheet about the legislation so you can fully understand its       provisions and not be misled by information that is       incorrect.            This is what the Farm Workforce Modernization Act does         Simplifies H-2A by reducing duplicative paperwork--only one       filing needed instead of three.        Bureaucracy is reduced even further for many farmers with       staggered labor needs. Farmers can file one petition for the       entire season, allowing for staggered entry of H-2A workers.        Modernizes recruitment by allowing employers to post job       openings on an online job registry. No classified ads are       required.        Reduces labor costs by freezing wages for one year and       capping wage growth thereafter. The adverse effect wage rate       is replaced in later years.        Makes available 60,000 year-round H-2A visas over the first       three years, growing annually by 12.5%. Dairy is guaranteed       at least half of these visas, and any unused visas are       available for other agriculture industries.        Stabilizes the existing workforce by giving legitimate       farmworkers a chance to get a five-year Certified Agriculture       Worker (CAW) visa to work in U.S. agriculture. As long as the       worker continues to meet minimum days in agriculture       annually, the worker can continue to work in the U.S. with       unlimited five-year renewals. CAWs can cross the border as       they need without restriction.        CAWs can earn the opportunity to apply for a green card by       paying a penalty and continuing to work in agriculture for at       least eight years. If a CAW can prove 10 years of prior work       in agriculture, they can apply for a green card after four       years.                               Myths and facts         MYTH: This bill will codify wage surveys into law and       result in multiple wage classes. Under this bill, wages will       be much higher than the current Adverse Effect Wage Rate       (AEWR).        FACT: This bill provides for greater certainty and       granularity in wages. First, this bill applies a one-year       freeze of wages across all categories at the current year's       rate. After the one-year freeze, all wage rates are then       limited in any increases year over year to 3.25% with the       ability to decrease 1.5%. (Exception: If the resulting wage       is less than 110% of the federal or state minimum wage, then       the wage could increase an additional percentage point to       4.25%.) After year 10, the AEWR requirement ends, and the       Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor must develop a new wage       standard with input from stakeholders. If Congress fails to       act to control and reform AEWR, some estimates have shown       AEWR rates could rise 7% to 8% annually in the coming years.        MYTH: Adjusted workers are treated immediately as U.S.       workers, thus requiring employers to hire them. This       displaces previous H-2A workers.        FACT: This bill includes a provision that allows employers       to prioritize their longtime H-2A workers over new Certified       Agriculture Workers (CAWs). CAWs have a requirement to work       in agriculture that no domestic worker has. Because of that       requirement and proven experience in agriculture work, CAWs       do receive preference over new foreign agriculture workers.       There is no expansion of the current workforce; CAW workers       are already here and working in agriculture. The bill       eliminates the legal chaos farmers and workers face today.        MYTH: This bill does not allow agricultural associations to       file as agents on behalf of their members.        FACT: This bill does not affect the ability of associations       to file as agents. The bill allows associations to file as       agents, or as a joint or sole employer of workers.        MYTH: This bill provides no relief for dairies or year-      round agriculture.        FACT: This bill creates year-round access to the H-2A       program for dairy and other agricultural sectors that       desperately need workers but have previously been unable to       utilize the program. Without this bill, year-round       agriculture has no access to a legal foreign workforce.        MYTH: This bill would create new funding for the Legal       Services Corporation.        FACT: There is no new funding in this bill for the Legal       Services Corporation.        MYTH: This bill requires farmworker housing to meet       Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)       standards.        FACT: Farmworker housing is already required to meet OSHA       standards, and DOL requires annual approved inspections       before approving a certification. The bill makes no changes       to that requirement, and in fact, reduces the inspection to       every two years. The bill provides $11 billion in additional       funds to  [[Page H1559]]       offset costs for grower-provided and other farmworker       housing.        MYTH: This bill establishes a new bureaucratic complaint/      investigation process that allows anyone to file a complaint.        FACT: There is no new process established in this bill. It       simply codifies existing regulations.        MYTH: The bill requires more reporting on employer       recruitment efforts.        FACT: There are no additional reporting requirements in       this bill, and requirements for recruitment efforts have been       simplified and modernized.        MYTH: This bill creates a new private right of action for       H-2A workers under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural       Worker Protection Act (MSPA).        FACT: Currently, H-2A employers must comply with the H-2A       program requirements, which largely meet or exceed MSPA. The       primary difference is that DOL stands in the place of the       foreign farmworker in bringing forward cases of alleged       violations of the H-2A program, the Fair Labor Standards Act       (FLSA), and a number of other federal and state laws. In       addition, any H-2A employer that employs one or more domestic       worker who performs seasonal or temporary agricultural work       is also currently covered under MSPA. The bill would formally       place all employers of H-2A workers under MSPA (impacting       only those who currently hire no domestic employees for       seasonal or temporary work) while creating a new mandatory       mediation requirement for any claim not just filed under MSPA       but extended it to claims under the H-2A program and FLSA.       Mandatory mediation could help reduce litigation costs and       attorney fees for growers, in part by resolving frivolous       claims before reaching the court room.        MYTH: This bill gives workers up to two years to file a       legal claim against an employer, even after the worker has       returned to their home country.        FACT: Under current statue, H-2A workers already get this.       There is nothing new in this bill. Many state-based claims       have longer statute of limitations.        MYTH: This bill gives the Department of Labor (DOL) a new       ability to sue on behalf of employees.        FACT: Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), DOL       already has this ability. There is nothing new in this bill.        MYTH: To overcome a denial of labor certification, this       legislation places the burden of proof on employers to show       that domestic workers were turned away for lawful reasons.        FACT: Nothing new is in this bill. This provision already       exists under current law.        MYTH: This bill permits very limited appeals and does not       grant de novo appeals of denials or Notice of Disagreement       (NOD).        FACT: This bill allows employers to quickly fix application       deficiencies, as with current law. The bill, however,       improves this process by creating a new emergency procedure       for farmers so issues are fixed faster and workers are not       delayed. It also allows for post-certification modifications.        MYTH: This bill establishes a new requirement for employers       to provide housing for domestic workers outside of a 50-mile       distance.        FACT: The bill does not change any current housing       requirements. As with current law, the requirement to provide       housing applies only to U.S. workers who live outside of the       normal commuting distance for the area.        MYTH: The bill makes no meaningful reform to the high       housing costs in the H-2A program.        FACT: The bill makes historic investments in farmworker       housing while reducing employer costs in providing such       housing, including to H-2A workers. The bill provides $1       billion to rehabilitate existing housing, triples federal       funding for USDA Section 514/516 rural housing and grant       programs, and doubles funding for the Section 521 rental       assistance program. The bill also reduces the cost of       providing housing to H-2A workers by making operating       assistance subsidies available to 514/516 property owners who       house H-2A workers.        MYTH: Mandatory E-Verify just for agriculture means       thousands of year-round employers will have no access to       labor whatsoever.        FACT: This bill provides a way for the current workforce to       get right with the law, which means they would be compliant       with E-Verify. As noted above, the bill provides employers       with two avenues for hiring new year-round workers. The E-      Verify requirement would only apply to new hires and is       phased in, beginning three years after enactment.        MYTH: Illegal farmworkers, their spouses, and all their       dependents are provided a special, expedited path to legal,       permanent residence and will move out of agriculture and into       other jobs in the economy.        FACT: This bill does not create an immediate path to       permanent residence. First, it creates a temporary legal       status that can only be renewed with significant agricultural       work. Second, the bill provides the option of earning       permanent residence through continued agricultural work, but       it would take at a minimum five to 10 years to earn such       status, depending on the amount of past agricultural work the       worker could demonstrate. These significant past and future       work commitments would ensure the stability of American       agriculture for years to come. Spouses and dependents receive       the same protections that currently exist in the H-2A       program.        MYTH: The bill puts AEWR into law after 2029 with no       increase or decrease in caps. Keeping the AEWR for another 10       years and preserving it in statute means employers will see       no relief.        FACT: After year 10, the AEWR requirement ends, and the       Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor must develop a new wage       standard with input from stakeholders.        MYTH: The bill provides new authority for the DOL to award       back wages, penalties, and damages and/or to debar employers       from the program for five years or permanently.        FACT: The DOL already has authority to temporarily debar       bad actors. This bill would give the DOL new authority to       permanently debar individuals who have previously been       debarred and are habitual violators of the program's       requirements.    We have labored long and hard, those of us in our  bipartisan group that worked to solve a problem that our country has,  which is we need a stable workforce in the agricultural sector.   I thank last year's chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Collin  Peterson, for the work that he did on this bill; this year's chair who  also supports this bill, Mr. Scott; as well as the ranking member who  said that he would vote for it even though there are some things he  would like to change. It is a compromise, and it was worked on for  almost over a year to get to this point.   We believe that having a legal workforce in agriculture that will  give stability is not only good for those workers, but it is good for  their employers, and it is good for America.   We believe that making sure that there is a future flow of a legal  workforce not only into farms but now into dairy is good for America  because we think immigration ought to be legal. It ought to be  regularized. It ought to be orderly. That is what this bill would  accomplish.   Finally, there has been a lot of talk about enforcement. This bill  has enforcement in it. When the bill is implemented, we will have a  strategy in a legal way to meet the needs of agriculture in America. If  we have that as law, we ought to enforce that law. That is why, on a  bipartisan basis, we agreed that E-Verify ought to be applied to this  whole sector.   This is a package that will make America stronger. It is fair to  farmworkers. It is fair to farmers. And it is good for America. I hope  that people will vote for it on both sides of the aisle. So many of us  worked together to bring it to this point.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
