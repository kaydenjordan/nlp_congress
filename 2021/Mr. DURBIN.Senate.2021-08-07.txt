 I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock),  is necessarily absent.    Madam President, it was in 1957 that there was a world  event that changed my life and the lives of many others. I was just a  kid in high school at the time. In fact, I wasn't quite in high school.  But the Russians decided to launch a satellite called Sputnik, and that  satellite, the size of a basketball, which emitted a tone as it flew  through space, scared the world, all of us, to the point where the  United States of America did something that was controversial but we  felt was necessary.   We decided that the Federal Government of the United States would  loan money to students like Durbin to go to college because we were  afraid of the Russians, and we knew that, if they had the scientific  advantage of us, it could mean we would lose a war, which no one wants  that to ever happen. So we created here in Washington something called  the National Defense Education Act. I am sure that was carefully chosen  to remind people that what we were doing was defending the country by  loaning money to people like Durbin to go to college, and I took  advantage of it.   Those National Defense Education Act loans had terms that most of us  from that era remember very well. You didn't pay anything on your loan  balance for the first year you were out of college, and then you had 10  years to pay it off at 3 percent interest.   Of course, those of us who took out the loans for college--in my  case, for law school as well--amassed this great debt and worried, when  the day came for graduation, whether we would ever be able to pay it  off. I remember saying to my wife: Loretta, they have just got all the  National Defense Education Act loans. They put them all together, and I  am afraid to tell you what has happened. We have a debt of $8,000 for  college and law school.   Students today don't believe that number, but that was the number,  and it scared us to death that we wouldn't be able to pay it off in 10  years. Naturally, we did, and many others did as well, and the National  Defense Education Act really became the pillar of the emergence of  higher education in America.   Of course, there were those who cheated the system, and stories were  rampant. Whether they were all true, I am not sure. There was the story  of the doctor who graduated from medical school and, before he went  into his lucrative practice, filed for bankruptcy and discharged all  his Federal loans, Federal student loans. I don't know if that ever  happened, but it certainly was part of the urban legend around the  National Defense Education Act.   So, over the years, there were efforts made to change the National  Defense Education Act to avoid abuse, and one of the things that was  decided was that that loan to go to school would not be dischargeable  in bankruptcy.   You have to ask the basic question of how many debts are not  dischargeable in bankruptcy. There are only a few: alimony, child  support, criminal fines, taxes, and maybe one other. But I think a  student loan is the only one of that bunch that is a consumer loan that  you can't discharge in bankruptcy.   Over the years, the terms of the loans and the number of years that  you were held back from filing bankruptcy changed. Ultimately, the  decision was made that you could effectively never discharge student  loans in bankruptcy.   We held a hearing on student loan debt in the Senate Judiciary  Committee this week, and I am sorry Senator Cornyn has left the floor,  but he and I have introduced a bill which has a good chance, I think.   We know that student loans are the fastest growing category of  household debt in America--45 million student borrowers in our country.  In a little under a decade, student loan debt has ballooned from $1  trillion to $1.7 trillion. The average student borrower now carries  $30,000 in debt, and many, especially those who are swindled by the  for-profit colleges, owe well over $100,000.   Americans of all ages are plagued by the debt. We have heard cases of  grandmothers who have said to their granddaughters, ``Well, of course,  I will cosign your student loan,'' to learn that when the student, the  granddaughter, defaulted, Grandma was responsible for it. For some, it  is holding them back from buying a first home, starting a family, a  business. For others, it means delaying retirement because of this  debt.   This is not an individual misfortune. The student debt crisis is a  threat to our economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has  warned that student loan debt may be a drag on our economy by  preventing Americans from basic, fundamental consumer purchases of  cars, savings accounts for retirement--otherwise, the economic growth  of our country.   So we had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and we examined how  difficult it is for student borrowers to get financial relief. These,  as I said, are one of the very few categories of debt you cannot  discharge in bankruptcy. You see, if you buy a home or a car and you  fall on really hard times, you can declare bankruptcy and have all  those debts discharged. If you like to gamble and you are not very good  at it and you end up running up great debt on your credit card and you  file for bankruptcy, your gambling debts through your credit cards can  be discharged. You can even buy a yacht and have that debt discharged  if you haven't paid it off. But if you are a student borrower who,  despite your best efforts, falls on hard times--lured into debt,  perhaps, by attending a worthless for-profit college--a fresh start is  not in the cards for you.   We had Diane Barta testify before the committee. She is from Richmond  Hill, GA, 50 years old, a mother of two. She has over $120,000 in  student loan debt, much of it taken out for a worthless degree she  received from for-profit school Ashford University. I mentioned that to  Senator Grassley during the hearing because Ashford University is a  curious story.   A small Catholic college in Iowa was about to go out of business, and  the nuns were persuaded that there was a company that wanted to buy it.  So they sold the campus to this company called Ashford University.  Ashford had no intention of reopening the campus. What they basically  did was start an online operation, claiming the accreditation and the  worthiness and the credibility of the previous college.   Well, we looked into it. In fact, it was Tom Harkin of Iowa, over 10  years ago, who investigated it and found out that Ashford was a fraud.  It was just generating huge profits for their CEO and a few others, not  providing anything nearly resembling higher education.   Ms. Barta was a good person who worked hard. She had two degrees-- from a community college and then from another college--before she went  for a master's degree at Ashford University. That was her downfall. She  talked about how she had to file for bankruptcy in 2012 after her  husband lost his job as a commercial plumber. She managed to get relief  for most of her debts but certainly could not get discharged from her  student loans that she had taken out at Ashford University, this  notorious for-profit school.   Other student borrowers had their own stories. We have all heard  them.   Angela, from Florida, wrote:         I'm a single parent and was on a single income living       paycheck to paycheck. I've had the stress of these student       loans haunting me for well over a decade now. . . . I am       still being haunted.    Lisa, in Nevada, wrote that she had given up her passion, teaching--I  repeat: teaching--because she needed to find a higher income job to pay  off her student loans.    She wrote:         It is absolutely disheartening that when you try to better       yourself in this country you're punished and not rewarded.    One more story.   Ann, from Washington State, declared bankruptcy in 2000 because her  student loan payments were so high she couldn't afford to pay her  bills.   She wrote:         I never go on vacations. I never married or had children       for fear of burdening [them] with [my] debt. . . . I'm facing       retirement with [that] threat [still looming over] my future.       . . . Social Security checks will be garnished for my student       loan.   [[Page S6000]]     This is clearly a crisis. Fortunately, both Republican and Democratic  members of the Judiciary Committee agree that we need to do something.  Congress has a responsibility to solve this problem. Wouldn't it be  worth a headline somewhere, on some website, that we actually solved a  problem like this?   Before 1976, student loans were treated like any other type of loan  in bankruptcy. If you were facing financial ruin, you could get relief.  Congress got the idea that student borrowers were running to bankruptcy  court right after they had taken off their gowns and mortarboards and  trying to wiggle out of their financial obligations. That is more  anecdote than fact, but it was prevalent. Still, Congress began passing  laws that made it harder to discharge student loans.   Since 1998, student borrowers could only discharge Federal student  loans by proving they suffered from something called undue hardship.  Well, you would think the cases I just read to you would be undue  hardship, wouldn't you, people so deeply in debt that they can't get  out of it and are forced to make life choices that are terrible?   Here is the issue: It is nearly impossible to prove undue hardship  and discharge your student debt. That is your only escape now. In fact,  in 2017, the Wall Street Journal found only four cases--four cases--in  the entire country of bankruptcy judges discharging student debt for  undue hardship.   For years, I have asked the Department of Education, the collection  Agency, to change the way they challenge these undue hardship cases. I  am still pushing on them, but Congress needs to do its part.   Another witness who joined us on Tuesday was my State attorney  general, Kwame Raoul. He has been an advocate for student borrowers for  a long time. He talked about these students being deceived and  defrauded by these schools, particularly the for-profit colleges and  universities.   Well, we have decided to do something about it. We have introduced a  bill called the FRESH START Through Bankruptcy Act. It will allow  struggling borrowers to seek a bankruptcy discharge for their Federal  student loans after a waiting period of 10 years. That is a long time.  If you can't pay off that loan in 10 years and you believe there is no  other recourse, you could file for bankruptcy and have it discharged.   Our bill also includes another provision. I want to thank Jack Reed  of Rhode Island, our colleague here. He introduced the original bill  with this concept. It includes important provisions to hold accountable  educational institutions, particularly these notorious for-profit  colleges with consistently high default rates and low repayment rates.   There are two numbers you need to remember--and that is it--to  understand for-profit colleges and universities: Eight. What percentage  of American high school graduates go to for-profit colleges and  universities? Eight percent.   Next question: What percentage of student loan defaults in the United  States are by students from for-profit colleges and universities?  Thirty.   Eight percent of high school grads and thirty percent of student loan  defaults. Why? Because these notorious, awful schools drag these young  people into debt they can never get out from under. If they so-call  finish and graduate from these schools, they find that they can't get  the jobs that were promised. Their lives are virtually ruined. So we  are basically saying it is time that these schools be held accountable.   At this point, the FRESH START bankruptcy will provide a meaningful  timeline to student borrowers who have no other options. It is a  breakthrough.   This is the first bipartisan bill the Senate has had, in my memory,  to restore student borrowers' ability to discharge their loans in  bankruptcy.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn, Republican of Texas. We kind of  jokingly say, you know, it is one of those situations where you are on  stage, announcing your bill, and you turn to one another and say: Have  we both read this bill? Well, we have, and we understand it.   We are also going to consider an element that was raised during the  hearing by one of our expert witnesses of defining what ``undue  hardship'' is. Right now, it appears the courts couldn't recognize it  in any form. There certainly are cases.   I talked about a quadriplegic veteran--disabled, unable to work--who  was lured into one of these for-profit school scams and ends up in  debt. Shouldn't they be able to discharge that student loan? There is  no question they will be able to find some great-paying job in the  future. They struggled to basically face up to their illnesses, and we  hope that they have the very best future, but even then, it is tough to  get out from under the debt.   I hope this is a first of many steps that we will take in the  committee and other places, on a bipartisan basis, to deal with this  challenge.   One other point. One way for students to avoid becoming buried in  student loan debt in the first place is to be very careful,  particularly of for-profit colleges and universities, and secondly,  take advantage of the affordable alternative community colleges.  Community colleges are an underused superpower of our economy. They  help students gain the knowledge and skills they need to thrive, and  they prepare workers to compete in the 21st century.   I totally support President Biden's plan to build back better and  provide every high school graduate to be able to continue their studies  through community college, without debt. The same goes for displaced  workers who want to learn new skills to get a better job to support  their futures. Americans will be able to obtain 2-year degrees or  specialized certificates without taking on mountains of debt.   In the greatest country in the world, a college education shouldn't  be a luxury; it should be guaranteed to everyone. That is the only way  we can launch a new dream of American prosperity and truly build back  better after this pandemic.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the information of Members, we are  planning to have a vote at 5 o'clock today on the confirmation of  Eunice Lee to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I wanted Members to  make their plans accordingly.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I just would like to add a word and thank  the Senator from Maryland for his leadership, and the Senator from New  York for supporting this, and to reflect for a moment on the comments  of the objector, the Senator from Kentucky.   His exact words were: We have got to learn to live with this.   Unfortunately, people are not living with this; they are getting  infected and dying. And to accept the status quo and somehow make it a  partisan issue--that it is the Democratic Governors who are responsible  for what is going on here--is a sad oversimplification. In fact, it is  tragic.   We know what is happening. We have a new variant of this COVID-19  virus that has emerged because it is still on the loose and it is  changing by the day. We think the Delta variant is dangerous, maybe  dramatically more contagious than the original virus.   We know that even people who have been vaccinated can unknowingly  transmit this disease, the new Delta variant, and we know that it has  taken a deadly toll on 90 percent of the patients who were not  vaccinated and were subjected to the illness that came about.   I just want to say, in general, I couldn't agree more with Senator  Schumer and Senator Cardin that restaurants in our cities are really  the lifeblood. Whether it is my hometown of Springfield, IL, or  Chicago, which I am honored to represent, I will tell you that these  restaurants are still struggling, and as they struggle, our cities  struggle.   And people that I know really measure where we are, as an American  nation, recovering by the vibrancy of these restaurant businesses, the  ones that are our favorites and bring us together.   They have done their part. We should do our part to give them a  helping hand. Let's get through this pandemic together. We are  certainly not going to do it by saying that we have to accept the Delta  variant and that whatever else follows is just the natural course of  things.   We have it within our power to change that. More vaccinations and  more careful use of masks and social distancing will make a  difference--can make a real difference in this country. Until we come  to grips with that reality, we are going to continue to face these  devastating disappointments.   Again, I thank the Senator from Maryland for bringing this before us.  I hope he will continue to offer it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
