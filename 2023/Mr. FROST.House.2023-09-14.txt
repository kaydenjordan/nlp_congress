 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the American people are  getting a front-row seat at the circus that Speaker Kevin McCarthy and  extremists in the Republican Party are unleashing on our country.   We are 15 days away from a government shutdown that will impact  millions of working people, and Speaker Kevin McCarthy cannot even get  his own party to pass any significant pieces of legislation.   The cherry on top of all of this is that, instead of getting to work  to fund the government, they are trying to impeach Hunter Biden, who, I  think--spoiler alert--is not the President of the United States.   This Speaker doesn't even have the votes for impeachment, doesn't  have the votes to fund the government. It is unclear whether or not he  even has the votes to keep his own job.   Kevin McCarthy doesn't even know what Kevin McCarthy stands for  because it sure looks like his morals and beliefs about how this place  should run apply only when other people are holding the gavel.   So America, 15 days from now, when our country comes to a halt,  remember who did this to you: Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the extremist  House Republicans who care more about themselves and their politics  than you.
