 Madam President, I rise today to discuss a topic far too  many of my colleagues have also had to face--yet another fatal mass  shooting in their State. This time it was in Annapolis, MD, in our  State capital.   Exactly 2 weeks ago, on June 28, at about 2:30 p.m., a 38-year-old  man who had a longstanding spurious grudge against the Capital Gazette  newspaper made good on his sworn threats. He entered the newspaper  offices, headed to the newsroom, and by the time he was done, he had  shot and killed five employees of this community newspaper.   The Capital Gazette is the local paper of record in Annapolis. It is  one of the oldest, continuously published newspapers in the United  States. It traces its roots back to the Maryland Gazette, which began  publishing in 1727, and to the Capital, which was founded in 1884.   This loss of life is personal to so many in Annapolis and around our  State. You need to understand that the Capital Gazette is as much a  part of the fabric of Annapolis as the State government it covers. It  is perhaps embodied in Thomas Jefferson's famous quote: ``Were it left  to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers  or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to  prefer the latter.''   Just 2 weeks ago, a man with a shotgun--a man who had made known his  threats against this paper--purposefully entered the building which  houses the Capital Gazette and killed people.   Let me take a moment to mourn those lost and to thank the first  responders who first appeared on the scene literally 60 seconds after  the first 911 call. Location means everything in  [[Page S4925]]  so many areas. On this day, 2 weeks ago, the fact that there were Anne  Arundel County police officers down the street from the Capital Gazette  offices at the time the shooting started most definitely saved lives.  According to the Annapolis police chief, Timothy Altomare, within 2  minutes, the Anne Arundel County Police Department, the Annapolis  Police Department, and the Anne Arundel County Sheriff's Office had  rushed into the offices and into the newsroom to apprehend the gunman.   State and Federal law enforcement--including the FBI, the ATF, and  many others--arrived soon thereafter to support local officials in  their efforts to clear the building and meticulously investigate the  scene. I want to thank each and every one of those law enforcement  officers, from the individuals who rushed into the newsroom not knowing  what danger they might encounter to those helping get others to safety,  to those gathering the evidence to ensure nothing was lost in the  bustle and chaos of the moment, and to those diverting traffic so that  people could be safely evacuated and the investigators could do their  jobs safely. I thank each and every professional who did their job and  contributed to this emergency response.   We often say about our first responders that when we run from  trouble, they run to it in order to save our lives. We owe our first  responders our thanks and our admiration for the manner in which they  handled this assignment under extreme circumstances.   Unfortunately, when faced with an individual intent on killing, lives  were lost despite the swift response by law enforcement. Among them was  Gerald Fischman, 61, who was an editor with more than 25 years of  service with the Capital Gazette and was known at the newspaper and  throughout the community for his brilliant mind and writing. Most  often, it was his voice and his insightfulness that came through on the  editorial pages of the Capital Gazette.   Fischman was described by Rick Hutzell, the Capital Gazette's editor,  as ``someone whose life was committed to protecting our community by  telling hard truths.''   Rob Hiaasen, 59, was a columnist, editor, teacher, and storyteller  who brought compassion and humor to his community-focused reporting.  Rob was described as a coach and mentor to many. According to former  Baltimore Sun columnist Susan Reimer, he was ``so happy working with  young journalists. . . . He wanted to create a newsroom where everyone  was growing.''   John McNamara, 56, was a skilled writer and avid sports fan, who  combined these passions in his 24-year career as a sports reporter at  the Capital Gazette.   Former Capital Gazette sports editor Gerry Jackson said of McNamara-- or ``Mac,'' as he went by:         He could write. He could edit. He could design pages. He       was just a jack of all trades and a fantastic person.    Rebecca Smith, 34, was a newly hired sales assistant known for her  kindness, compassion, and love for her family. ``Becca,'' as she was  known, was described by a friend of her fiance as ``the absolute most  beautiful person'' with ``the biggest heart'' and called her death ``a  great loss to this world.''   Wendi Winters, 65, was a talented writer. She built her career as a  public relations professional and journalist. She was well-known for  her profound reporting on the lives and achievements of people within  the community. She was a ``proud Navy Mom'' and Navy daughter.   As we learn more about the details of the shooting from the  survivors, it is clear that Wendi herself saved lives during the  attack. According to the Capital Gazette editorial that ran this past  Tuesday, Wendi confronted and distracted the gunman with whatever she  could find around her. The paper noted:         Wendi died protecting her friends, but also in defense of       her newsroom from a murderous assault. Wendi died protecting       freedom of the press.    My heartfelt condolences and prayers continue to go out to the  families of those who were killed in this attack. They did not send  their loved ones off to work that day knowing it would be the last day  they would see them alive. It isn't right, and it never should have  happened.   The surviving staff members also deserve our praise for their  resilience and dedication to their mission as journalists and their  respect for their fallen colleagues. During and after the attack, staff  continued to report by tweets, sharing information to those outside,  taking photos and documenting information as they would at other crime  scenes. Despite their grief, shock, anger, and mourning, surviving  staff--with the help from their sister publication, the Baltimore Sun,  Capital Gazette alumni, and other reporters who wanted to lend a hand  to fellow journalists--put out a paper the following day, Friday, and  they have done so every day since. This is known as grace under  pressure.    Fittingly, the editorial page the day after the shooting was  purposely left blank with just a few words. The few words were:         Today, we are speechless. This page is intentionally left       blank to commemorate victims of Thursday's shootings at our       office.    The staff promised that on Saturday the page would ``return to its  steady purpose of offering our readers informed opinion about the world  around them, that they might be better citizens.''   It has been incredible to witness the unity, compassion, and  resilience of the Capital Gazette staff, the city of Annapolis, and  Anne Arundel County.   I want to repeat one quote from the Capital Gazette editorial page  that bears repeating:         Wendi Winters died protecting her friends, but also in       defense of her newsroom from a murderous assault. Wendi died       protecting freedom of the press.    Wendi Winters and her colleagues died protecting freedom of the  press.   As Americans, we have certain rights and responsibilities granted to  us through the Constitution, which establishes the rule of law in this  country. Freedom of the press is central to the very first amendment of  the Constitution, and it has often been under attack, figuratively  speaking, since our Nation's founding.   Today, those attacks have become more frequent and more literal,  spurred on by dangerous rhetoric that has nearly created an ``open  season'' on denigrating the media and harassing reporters and editors  from doing their job: answering questions that need to be asked,  investigating the stories that need to be uncovered, and bringing  needed transparency to the halls of power, whether they are in  Annapolis, Washington, DC, or elsewhere around the world. This rhetoric  has gone beyond the pale and it must stop.   Journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of  being violently attacked while doing their job.   On this day, 2 weeks ago, just as the public was learning about the  shooting at the Capital Gazette, I stopped in for a meeting one of my  staffers was having with a group of students to talk about gun violence  and school safety. Since what happened in Parkland--and we recently had  an episode in our own State--I have been meeting with students on a  frequent basis just to hear their concerns. In all circumstances, the  students have expressed to me their fear and frustration with regard to  how safe they feel in their schools. Some are angry, and all of them  want to know when the adults will finally start acting like adults and  do something to keep them and their country safe. Without fail,  students have told me that ``thoughts and prayers'' simply are not  enough. Thoughts and prayers will not protect them from bullets, and  they want Congress to act.   Some of my colleagues have bought into the false rhetoric that there  is nothing we can do about these acts of violence. But students in  Maryland and around the country know that is not true, and so do the  American people. A recent CNN poll found that 70 percent of Americans  now back tougher gun safety laws. These responses get higher with each  deadly incident.   Congress must act now to address the epidemic of gun violence in this  country. Let's reinstate the assault weapon ban now. We can ban bump  stocks now. Let us assure that all gun purchases have completed  background checks.   I understand that the weapon used in the Annapolis shootings was a  shotgun. It would not have been covered under these new laws. But the  fact remains that if we pass sensible gun safety laws, we will save  lives.  [[Page S4926]]    I do want to say clearly that ``doing something'' does not mean  arming educators or bringing more guns into our schools. Teachers are  hired to teach, not to be security guards. Instead of putting guns in  the hands of educators, we need to get them out of the hands of  attackers in the first place.   Let me conclude with these words of one of the survivors of the  Capital Gazette shooting. Reporter Selene San Felice shared her  thoughts in a July 1 opinion piece for the paper. She recounted the  moments of the shooting and shared pretty succinctly what she thinks  needs to happen next in this country. Selene wrote:         I watched John McNamara die. I had to step over Wendi       Winters to escape . . .        If your help ends at thoughts and prayers, I don't want       them. What I want is action.        I'm not just talking to the president, or our governor, or       our elected officials. I'm talking to every single person in       this nation.        We must do better. We must vote better. We must push for       legislation so that this doesn't feel normal.        Rob Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman, Wendi Winters, John McNamara,       Rebecca Smith and thousands of people are dead because of       shootings like the one I lived through.        The man who killed the people I love bought this gun       legally. His record of stalking and harassment had been       expunged. But even if it hadn't been, he still could have       bought the gun he used to shoot Rebecca, Wendi, Rob, Gerald       and John.        This is not political. I'm not asking for change as a       liberal media puppet. I'm asking for something to be done for       the sake of our humanity.    I think, quite frankly, Selene is speaking for many, many people in  our community. We need to act. Now. For Rebecca, Wendi, Rob, Gerald,  John, and the thousands of other innocent people who have been lost to  needless gun violence, Congress must act. We must show that we can  protect the American people, which is perhaps the most important task  we have as lawmakers.   We cannot stand by and pretend we are helpless and powerless to  prevent another tragedy. We can do something powerful today.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  service and achievements of COL Edward P. Chamberlayne upon his  retirement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   Colonel Chamberlayne has been a valued member of the Army Corps for  the past 25 years. He has served with distinction from Germany to  Afghanistan to Iraq, where he participated in crucial route clearance  operations during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Colonel Chamberlayne's  accomplishments have earned him the Bronze Star Medal among numerous  other decorations, but his most crucial mission, from my perspective,  has been his service as the 67th commander of the Baltimore District.   The commander of the Baltimore District leads more than 1,200  employees in the protection and restoration of Maryland's military  installations, waterways, infrastructure, and environment. Under  Colonel Chamberlayne's leadership, the Baltimore District has  maintained 290 miles of Federal channels and 148 miles of Federal flood  protection levees; managed 15 reservoirs and the Washington Aqueduct,  which supplies an average of 150 million gallons of drinking water  daily; constructed 500 acres of oyster reefs in Maryland; restored  1,140 acres of environmentally fragile remote island habitat; completed  aerostat pads for a missile defense system; coordinated tens of  millions of dollars in dredging and restoration projects throughout the  State of Maryland and streamlined the aquaculture permitting process.   Colonel Chamberlayne's vision and skills in navigating the budget  forces within his own agency have brought many local projects to  fruition. From dredging, construction, beach replenishment, habitat  restoration, and permitting, Colonel Chamberlayne and his team have  significantly improved the infrastructure, environment, business  climate, regional partnerships, and economic development opportunities  throughout the State of Maryland.   The State of Maryland has benefitted tremendously from Colonel  Chamberlayne's service. Therefore, it is my honor to recognize the  contributions of COL Edward P. Chamberlayne in his role as commander of  the Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, and to thank him for  his years of dedicated service to our country and his tremendously  positive impact on the State of Maryland.                            ____________________
