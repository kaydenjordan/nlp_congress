 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Early in my service, I got out of the car in the parking garage to  walk into Cannon, and Mr. Lewis walked up behind me. I turned and he  said: ``Good morning, my brother.'' I opened the door to try to point  for him to enter first, and he said: ``You first, my brother.''   I often heard him refer to my colleagues as ``my brother'' or ``my  sister,'' and for a while I actually was fooled into thinking that was  because he hadn't yet learned our named. But that wasn't it. He knew.  It was more a sign of respect and affection and mutuality.   No one has ever walked in this Chamber on this floor, before, now, or  in the future, who will ever command the love and reverence of him,  because he was a great man.   Godspeed to you in your journey, John Robert Lewis, my brother.
