 Madam Speaker, we have all seen the horrific images coming  out of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha and the surrounding areas, where  hundreds of civilians have been killed, left lying in the street by  Russian forces.   Bucha residents have recounted watching their family members being  raped or shot right in front of them by the Russian forces, but we know  this horrific brutality is occurring throughout Ukraine in every region  where the Russian Army is positioned.   It is difficult to find words to express the unacceptable brutality  that the photos and videos from Bucha have laid evidence of. Russian  President Vladimir Putin has cemented himself in history as an evil war  criminal.   I would like to use the remainder of my time for a brief moment of  silence  [[Page H4422]]  to remember these victims and their families in Bucha and across  Ukraine, realizing that historically, in this 21st century, this is the  test of our time, and the world is watching.                            ____________________
