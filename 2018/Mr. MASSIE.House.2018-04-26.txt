 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize outstanding  students in my district from Highlands High School in Fort Thomas.  These exceptional students competed in the ``We the People'' State- level competition, and they will represent our State at the national  competition here in D.C. this weekend. This is their 15th State  championship win.   The ``We the People'' program is directed by the Center for Civic  Education, and its goal is to increase students' knowledge of  constitutional history and government--I think some of my colleagues  could stand to participate in this program--and to provide a foundation  in civics education that will prepare them for future leadership roles.   The program sponsors student debates and hearings. This year, some of  the national hearing questions for discussion include: What are  classical republicanism and natural rights philosophy, and how did they  influence the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the  Bill of Rights? How has the relationship among the three branches of  government changed in the course of the history of our country? It has  changed quite a bit.   I am proud of my constituent students' hard work and dedication. I  wish them the very best of luck in this competition this weekend and  congratulate them for their outstanding work representing the State of  Kentucky.                    President Macron's Brand of Socialism     Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I let the statements  and the speech of our guest yesterday go unanswered. The President of  France was here, right at this microphone, delivering his own brand of  socialism. It is new and improved.   We have all seen the inefficiencies of socialism play out in Europe  over the decades and the horrors of national socialism. But the French  President has a new brand of socialism that we are all supposed to be  enamored with. I would call it global socialism, maybe even global  corporate socialism.   I hope none of my colleagues were seduced by his ideas. Ironically,  they are motivated by fear, an irrational fear of the carbon dioxide  molecule. Carbon dioxide is a necessary ingredient for all life on this  planet.   For instance, let me give you the equation for photosynthesis.  Basically, plants take six CO2 molecules and react them with  six water molecules, in the presence of sunlight, to create one sugar  molecule and six oxygen molecules.   Take CO2 off this planet, and what happens? Nearly  everything dies and we die.   So I think it is very interesting that this new socialism has a twist  to it, this global socialism, and that is, it is motivated by an  irrational fear of one of the two chemical compounds that form the  basis of our food chain. Very ironic.   It is also motivated by something else that the Europeans have had a  penchant for for centuries, that has bankrupted nearly every country  over there, and that is a penchant for war, for interventionism. Nearly  all of them, at one point or time, have sought to build an empire.   So the President of France was over here saying that we should also  be interventionists; that we need to get involved in the Middle East  more; that we need to be involved in all of the countries.   I reject this. I would urge my colleagues to stick with the plan we  have got. Stick with the policy that we have had since the beginning of  this country. Stick with the Constitution. Stick with capitalism. Stick  with the idea that if you build something you own it, and reject  European socialism.                            ____________________
