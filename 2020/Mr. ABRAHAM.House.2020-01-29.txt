 Mr. Speaker, the $3 trillion healthcare industry  continues to crush the middle class. Americans are paying more than  ever and getting ever less as they struggle to access care. The cost of  care for both workers and employers is outpacing wage growth.   What drives the cost of care in America today is lack of  transparency, consolidation, and overregulation that is leading to  administrative glut. The time is now to confront these cost drivers.  President Trump has addressed these exact issues in recent months.  [[Page H643]]    Obtaining coverage has allayed the fears as costs rise, yet coverage  itself keeps costs hidden and high. Our opaque, third-party payment  system has obscured the true cost of receiving care from patients and  physicians alike.   Prices are rising with no end in sight. We see examples of it every  day, people who believe they are covered because they have insurance  only to find out that, in some cases, they are just as vulnerable as  those who are uninsured. The current system allows people who have  insurance to end up paying more for a CT, for example, than if they had  just paid cash.   This process and complexity of billing can allow this to happen. This  lack of transparency in our healthcare system is a culprit, and it  harms patients, physicians, pharmacists, and others who rely on it.   Consolidated hospital systems, the completely unregulated  pharmaceutical middlemen, PBMs, and the insurance companies that are  tied to both hospitals and PBMs have been increasingly profiting. These  corporate giants have no motivation to offer transparency and  discounts.   Costs remain deliberately hidden until the patient receives a bill.  The number of healthcare administrators has grown more than 4,000  percent between 1970 and 2020. Consequently, spending on healthcare has  increased 3,200 percent.   Is there any other conclusion than to tie rising costs to  administrative glut? No. Administrative glut is largely to manage the  regulations that our government has put in place, regulations that make  healthcare more complex than the tax code. It is past time to cut the  glut.   Medicine's malignant mergers, both vertical and horizontal, are  creating behemoth healthcare systems like CVS, where insurance  companies, PBM, pharmacy, and drive-by clinics are all together. This  leads to patients being forced to go somewhere to receive their drugs  and, in some cases, are told that they have to purchase brand-name  drugs even when the generic equivalent is available. It is not about  what is a better deal for the patient but what is a better deal for the  PBMs and their ilk.   Americans are paying more than ever for coverage that limits their  choices and doesn't always provide them access to care. The bloated  bureaucratic special interests must be unveiled and Americans must  educate themselves on cost drivers to forge sustainable solutions.   We need to focus on returning to a patient-centered healthcare  system. Some people are starting to do this with things like direct  primary care, which provides the patient with an array of services for  a fixed cost that is actually transparent.                                time  1030    We need a system that allows patients to choose and fosters  competition. The only way we are going to get a system like that is by  shining a light on the shadows of our healthcare system. The answer is  not more government, not more regulation but, rather, a concerted  effort by Congress to bring our healthcare system out into the sunshine  and to allow our sunshine to shine on these hidden practices; these  practices are actually causing our prices to go up. No longer can we  allow patients to bear the brunt of this complicated and very, very  complex system.   The time is now to follow healthcare's money trail, unwind existing  laws, or enact new laws that demand cost transparency, cut  administrative glut, stop consolidation, and bring regulatory relief.  Your health depends on it.                            ____________________
