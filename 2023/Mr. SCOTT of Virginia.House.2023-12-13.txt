 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1147, the Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act.   School meals are critical to reducing child hunger and providing  children with the healthy food they need. Milk, offered as part of  these meals, can help deliver essential nutrients that are vital to a  child's development. That is why it is so important that we provide  students with the most nutritious milk options.   Child nutrition standards for school meals, including milk options,  are guided by the science-based Dietary Guidelines for Americans, or  the DGAs, which are periodically updated based on recommendations from  child nutrition experts and input from the public.   The latest DGAs, along with the American Heart Association, American  Academy of Pediatrics, the Physicians Committee for Responsible  Medicine, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and over a dozen  other public  [[Page H6890]]  health advocates, agree that fat-free and low-fat milk are the  healthiest options for children.   Regrettably, H.R. 1147 attempts to legislate nutrition standards and  disregard the evidence-based recommendations made by the DGAs.  Furthermore, the bill would undermine the Biden administration's  ongoing rulemaking to better align school nutrition standards with the  latest science.   This bill would allow schools participating in the National School  Lunch Program to offer whole milk and reduced-fat milk, violating the  current science-based standards that protect children's health.   Whole milk contains far more saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories  than fat-free and low-fat milk. Conversely, fat-free and low-fat milk  options offer the same vital nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D,  vitamin A, protein, and potassium, as whole milk.   Nutrition standards must be guided by scientists, not politicians. If  someone wants to offer one study or another to be considered, use the  DGA process, not the political process. This bill needlessly inserts  politics into a science-based process.   Lastly, I am disappointed by the majority's decision to depart from  precedent by moving a child nutrition bill outside of a comprehensive  child nutrition reauthorization. Rather than improve our Nation's child  nutrition programs holistically, the majority has decided to prioritize  interfering with evidence-based nutrition standards for our children's  school meals.   For that reason, Mr. Chair, I oppose the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, we received a letter from the National Alliance for  Nutrition and Activity, which says in part that the passing of H.R.  1147 ``would be a departure from the longstanding tradition of  establishing food and nutrition standards for Federal child nutrition  programs based upon the findings of independent reviewers and the  scientific community. There are evidenced-based strategies to increase  school meal consumption--and, by extension, potentially school milk  consumption--that do not involve weakening nutrition standards. Changes  to school nutrition standards should be guided by the Dietary  Guidelines, not special interests, and as such, we strongly urge you to  put children's interests first and uphold the science-based process and  oppose the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2023. Our children  deserve no less.''

Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Alliance for Nutrition and Activity.                                              National Alliance for                                            Nutrition & Activity,                                                  December 11, 2023.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, House Committee on Education and the Workforce, House           of Representatives.      Hon. Robert ``Bobby'' Scott,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Education and the           Workforce, House of Representatives.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: The       undersigned members of the National Alliance for Nutrition       and Activity, the nation's largest nutrition advocacy       coalition, strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 1147/S. 1957, the       Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2023. H.R. 1147/S. 1957       would allow school meals to offer full-fat (whole) and       reduced-fat flavored and unflavored milk, and arbitrarily       exempt full-fat and reduced-fat milk from current saturated       fat limits in school meals, both of which are inconsistent       with the recommendations of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines       for Americans (DGAs).        School meal standards, by law, must be aligned with the       Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are reviewed and       revised every five years. The DGAs recommend full-fat (whole)       milk only for children under the age of two, and fat-free and       low-fat milk after that. In addition, the DGAs recommend       saturated fat should account for less than 10 percent of       calories per day. As such, both the National School Lunch       Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) meal       patterns allow only fat-free and low-fat milk and require       that less than 10 percent of calories in the meal come from       saturated fat over the week. Earlier this year, the U.S.       Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposed  [[Page H6892]]       updates to the school nutrition standards to more closely       align with the 2020-2025 DGAs, which did not change the       saturated fat limit nor increase the milkfat allowed to be       served in school meals. Singling out milk--in this case,       whole and reduced-fat milk--to be exempt from the       recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines is a slippery slope       for allowing--special interests to carve out exemptions in       school meal program rules. Allowing the change in the service       of whole and reduced-fat milk will negate the progress that       has been made in the planning and service of healthier foods       to children in schools.        Milk is an important part of a well-balanced diet. Milk       contains nutrients of concern, such as vitamin D and calcium.       However, unlike fat-free and low-fat milk, full-fat milk       contains too much saturated fat to be part of a healthy food       pattern. According to USDA data, one cup of whole milk       contains around 4.5 grams of saturated fat. Full fat milk is       so high in saturated fat that the government prohibits its       labels from claiming that calcium can reduce the risk of       osteoporosis; fat-free and low-fat milk, however, can make       these claims. By allowing full-fat milk in lunch and       adjusting saturated fat allowances accordingly, H.R. 1147/S.       1957 would allow an additional 4.5 grams of saturated fat       daily in school meals beyond the science-based limit that is       currently in place.        School meal nutrition standards were strengthened       significantly in 2012. These updates were an overwhelming       success, particularly for children in who are part of       households with fewer financial resources. A 2021 study found       that school meals are the single most healthy source of       nutrition for children--more nutritious than grocery stores,       restaurants, worksites, and others. Yet even with the current       nutrition standards that limit saturated fat in school meals,       most children, on average, still consume more saturated fat       than is recommended. According to the DGA, more than 80       percent of children ages 5-8 years, more than 85 percent of       youth ages 9-13, and over 75 percent of youth ages 14-18       consume too much saturated fat. Allowing full-fat milk in       schools would only worsen this problem.        The fat content of school milk is neither the cause nor the       solution to the decades-long decline in fluid milk       consumption in the United States and the struggles of the       dairy industry. According to a 2013 Economic Research Service       (ERS) report, younger generations consume less milk than       preceding generations, but this trend is not exclusive to       schoolchildren. According to the ERS economists,       ``individuals born in the 1970s, for example, drank less milk       in their teens, 20s, and 30s than individuals born in the       1960s did at the same age points. Those born in the 1980s and       1990s, in turn, appear likely to consume even less fluid milk       in their adulthood than those born in the 1970s.'' Rather       than acknowledging the fact that 36 percent of Americans       experience lactose malabsorption, (with African Americans,       American Indians, Asian Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos       experiencing at higher rates than non-Hispanic White       Americans), H.R. 1147 perpetuates the cumbersome requirement       that students must obtain a doctor's note documenting a       disability to receive a substitute for fluid milk, while       arbitrarily increasing access to the less-healthy full-fat       milk.        We thank you for your attention to this matter. Passing       H.R. 1147/S. 1957 would be a departure from the long-standing       tradition of establishing food and nutrition standards for       federal child nutrition programs based upon the findings of       independent reviewers and the scientific community. There are       evidence-based strategies to increase school meal       consumption--and by extension, potentially school milk       consumption--that do not involve weakening nutrition       standards. Changes to school nutrition standards should be       guided by the Dietary Guidelines, not special interests, and       as such, we strongly urge you to put children's interests       first and uphold the science-based process and oppose the       Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2023. Our children deserve       no less.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining on both sides.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and I have enjoyed  working together on many different bills, but on this bill, we happen  to disagree. He has presented evidence on the floor that, instead of  being considered by Members of Congress, really ought to be considered  by the experts in the normal scientific process.                                time  1430    If the schoolchildren get the benefit of his studies, then tell it to  the experts and not the politicians. I would hope that we would stick  with the scientific process, as we are doing. Let's stick with the DGAs  and not the political process in changing the process by trying to  convince Members of Congress who are subject to political pressures on  one side or another. So I would hope that we would stick to that  process and not the political process.   If we have studies, then show it to the experts and not the  politicians.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is  remaining on both sides.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues are  attempting to make school meals less healthy by ignoring the latest  science and undermining President Biden's work to strengthen school  meal nutrition.   The latest DGAs have already made clear that fat-free milk and low- fat milk are the healthiest options for children. If anybody has  studies or research to the contrary, they should submit it to the  experts in the normal process rather than politicians.   This bill goes against the dairy industry's recent commitment to  ensuring students have access to the healthiest dairy options  consistent with the DGAs.   Mr. Chairman, we should be committed to ensuring that students have  access to the healthiest dairy options in accordance with science-based  guidelines, but H.R. 1147 contradicts this commitment by interfering  with the independent process that aligns child nutrition standards with  the latest science.   I am also disappointed that we are considering a bill that does  nothing to meaningfully address child nutrition or hunger. This is in  stark contrast to the comprehensive science-based reauthorization of  the Federal child nutrition programs that committee Democrats advanced  last Congress to, among other things, strengthen evidence-based  nutrition standards for school meals beyond just milk.   The bottom line is that Congress should not inject politics into  child nutrition standards at the expense of nutritious meals that our  children need to grow healthy.   Mr. Chair, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1147, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, nothing in this bill prevents schools from offering  organic milk under current law. As the main barrier for schools  offering organic milk is cost, nothing in this amendment provides  additional funding or support to help schools offer organic milk, if  they prefer.   Fundamentally, this amendment does not fix the flaws of the  underlying bill. It invites Congress to legislate on specific foods  served in school meals at the expense of evidence-based recommendations  from experts.   According to those experts, milk is the top source of saturated fat  in American diets. Whole and 2 percent milk can raise bad cholesterol,  the cause of heart disease, and contains more fat, saturated fat,  cholesterol, and calories than 1 percent and fat-free milk.   This has led to organizations such as the CDC to recommend nutrient- rich 1 percent or fat-free milk instead of 2 percent or whole milk.   For children aged 2 and up, the inclusion of whole milk in the bill  disregards the healthy dietary patterns backed by the dietary  guidelines for Americans, the scientific, evidence-based comprehensive  set of nutrition recommendations.   Over 60 organizations have expressed concerns over attempts to bring  whole milk back into school meal programs. Regardless of whether milk  is organic, inclusion of whole milk in this bill is detrimental to  American youths' health and well-being, and the amendment fails to  alter that fact.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the underlying bill and oppose the amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, nobody disputes that the dairy industry is a crucial  part of domestic supply chains and provides an important economic  benefit to the tune of over $753 billion to the U.S. economy.   In 2022, just five States--California, Wisconsin, Idaho, Texas, and  New York--collectively produced more than 50 percent of the U.S. annual  milk supply.   School breakfast and school lunch programs are already required to  purchase domestic agricultural commodities and food products. Although  exemptions exist, milk is produced in sufficient quantities in the U.S.  and at competitive prices to severely restrict the ability of any  school to purchase foreign-produced milk.   To this end, the amendment does not fix the flaws in the underlying  bill and makes no meaningful improvements to buy-American policies.   We can make sure that Chinese milk is not breaching our supply chain  with continued monitoring and enforcement of present law. A recent  report found that Chinese seafood has been served in schools,  highlighting the need for additional diligence in enforcing present  law.   I do not support the underlying legislation, and I oppose the  amendment as being unnecessary.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   I just reiterate that present law requires domestic purchase, and so  this is unnecessary. If Chinese milk has gotten into the supply, we  need to monitor that. It violates present law. To suggest that we are  ignoring science, the underlying bill ignores science. That is the  purpose of the underlying bill.   I hope that we reject this amendment and reject the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, current law requires that school meals and beverages  offered under the school meal programs be consistent with the dietary  guidelines for Americans, the DGAs, which are drafted by an advisory  committee of experts. These are evidence-based recommendations set to  provide nutritional guidance to ensure children receive the most  nutritious meals possible.   This amendment would effectively undermine the unbiased evidence- based guidelines of DGAs by prohibiting USDA from doing its work and  replacing that process with a process where evidence will be presented  to politicians and we get to decide the science. It is critical that  actual scientists and experts make the recommendations and guide the  process in determining options in schools and that regulations are  updated to align with current DGAs.   Experts, not Members of Congress, should be the ones determining the  nutrition standards to ensure that our children get the healthiest  meals possible.   This amendment, like the underlying bill, reinforces the precedent  for Congress to legislate on specific foods, at the behest of one  industry or another, that would be served in schools.   There is a reason that the school lunch program does not contain  specific nutrition standards for foods and beverages, and that is to  ensure that nutrition standards can adapt to the latest science and  expert recommendations. Both this amendment and the underlying bill  upset this policy and open the program to politicization in favor of  district interests and single-food lobbies over the health and well- being of our children.   Dozens of organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition &  Dietetics, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart  Association, and a lot of others have urged Congress not to interfere  with that process and to respect the science-based process.   For these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   I include in the Record a letter signed by dozens of organizations  opposing this changing the science and the process.                                                    March 20, 2023.      Hon.

Dear Chairs Murray, Heinrich, Granger, and Harris, and       Ranking Members Collins, Hoeven, DeLauro, and Bishop: As you       craft the fiscal year (FY) 2024 Agriculture, Rural       Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related       Agencies spending bill, the undersigned organizations urge       you to oppose any policy riders blocking implementation of       stronger nutrition standards in the National School Lunch and       School Breakfast Programs.        We strongly support the U.S. Department of Agriculture       (USDA)'s proposed rule to strengthen nutrition standards       consistent with the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans       (``Child Nutrition Programs: Revisions to Meal Patterns       Consistent With the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans'').       We must preserve and build on the progress schools and the       food industry have made over the past decade to meet science-      based nutrition standards. These improvements are an amazing       success story and one of the most important public health       achievements in a generation. For children in poverty, the       risk of obesity declined substantially each year after       implementation of stronger nutrition standards in 2012 such       that obesity prevalence would have been 47 percent higher in       2018 if the nutrition standards had not been updated.       Additionally, a 2021 study found that school meals are the       single most healthy source of nutrition for children--more       nutritious than grocery stores, restaurants, worksites, and       others. Research shows that children like the healthier       school meals and while food waste remains a problem in this       country, the amount of food wasted in schools has not changed       since the standards were updated in 2012, according to the       USDA's largest and nationally representative study of school       meals. For many children participating in the program, school       breakfast and lunch are the only meals they receive that day.        Despite the overwhelming success of the nutrition       standards, improvements are still needed to align school       meals with the Dietary Guidelines, which the current proposed       rule aims to do. The USDA issued a proposal that is       pragmatic, flexible, gradual, and most important--achievable.       The rule proposes, for the first time, to reduce added       sugars, with product-based limits for the top sources of       added sugars beginning School Year 2025-2026, and to phase       into a limit of added sugars averaged over the week beginning       School Year 2027-2028. These standards are critical: among       children, excessive intake of added sugars has been       associated with poor diet quality, cavities, and increased       risk of cardiovascular disease, yet more than 92 percent of       schools exceed the Dietary Guidelines limit for added sugars       for breakfast and 69 percent exceed it for lunch.        Further, sodium reduction is paramount to protect       children's health: nine out of ten children consume too much       sodium, putting them at risk of hypertension and       cardiovascular disease into adulthood. The USDA proposes new,       gradual 10-percent sodium reduction levels every two school       years for breakfast (through School Year 2027-2028) and lunch       (through School Year 2029-2030). The USDA also maintains at       least 80 percent of the weekly grains offered are whole       grain-rich.        The rule aims to align dietary patterns for sodium and       whole grains with the recommendations of the Dietary       Guidelines, but the USDA recognized that a gradual,       incremental approach to meeting those recommendations is more       feasible for schools and the food industry to implement. For       instance, children up to age 8 would still consume close to       their day's worth of sodium (83 percent) from just breakfast       and lunch combined. Sodium and whole grain-rich standards       have been the subject of many riders over the past decade,       causing confusion and stymying industry innovation and       improvements to children's health. The USDA has listened to       Congress; the proposals in this rule on sodium and whole       grains are within the spirit of those previous riders.        This gradual, incremental approach was crafted by the USDA       to be feasible for schools and the food industry. And these       standards are feasible. The largest food companies have many       K-12 products that meet  [[Page H6907]]       the USDA's proposed added sugars, sodium, and whole grain-      rich standards. Further, schools have been able to meet, and       in some cases, exceed the current nutrition standards during       the pandemic. In the first-of-its-kind study, a nationally       representative study of elementary schools found that meals       were meeting existing nutrition standards in 2022, and for       sodium, average sodium decreased and the vast majority of       schools were close to or already meeting future sodium-      reduction levels on par with this rule. There are plenty of       examples where schools have reduced sodium beyond the USDA's       requirements or provided more whole grains and still been       able to serve healthy, delicious, and culturally-relevant       foods to their students.        Opponents of the rule claim that the meal nutrition       standards cannot be strengthened due to labor shortages,       supply chain disruptions, and other issues facing school food       service programs. These are real challenges but require       different solutions than stalling progress for healthier       school meals. Over the past decade, the USDA and Congress       have learned that schools need the additional assistance to       meet stronger standards and they have also recognized current       pandemic-related constraints, and therefore have committed       millions of dollars to helping schools provide healthier       meals while weathering these challenges. In September 2022,       the USDA launched its $100 million Healthy Meals Incentive       Initiative with the stated goal of improving the nutritional       quality of school meals. Of that, $30 million is available       for small and rural schools and $50 million will go toward       working with food manufacturers on innovative solutions to       increase the availability of nutritious school foods.       Congress has also increased technical assistance funding each       year for the past three fiscal years (FY) ($1 million in FY       2021; $2 million in FY 2022 and 2023), with $1 million of       that funding being directed to assist with sodium       reduction efforts in FY 2022-2023. These investments will       be transformational, but the impact of inflation on school       nutrition programs means schools still struggle to make       ends meet. Therefore, increased meal reimbursement rates       will be critical to the future success of school meals       programs.        Beyond riders blocking implementation of the new proposed       standards, there are other ongoing attempts to undermine       evidence-based nutrition standards. For instance, the       proposed rule allows for potatoes to be served in breakfast       up to four out of the five school days, if a school chose to       serve vegetables in place of fruit in breakfast. Therefore       the existing breakfast potato rider--which allows schools to       serve potatoes before other vegetables at breakfast--does not       need to be included in the spending bill. Further, we are       similarly concerned about attempts to bring whole milk into       the school meals program. The Dietary Guidelines is explicit       in its recommendation that everyone 2 years and older should       limit their intake of saturated fat and choose fat-free or 1-      percent low-fat milk instead of 2-percent reduced-fat or       whole milk. The proposed rule reiterates this, while       providing flexibilities for flavored 1-percent milk. Yet       continued industry attempts to circumvent the science       persist.        Finally, there are evidence-based strategies to increase       school meal consumption that do not involve weakening       nutrition standards, for instance, enabling students to have       sufficient time to eat (at least 20 minutes of seat time)       with longer lunch periods, having recess before lunch,       serving lunch at an appropriate time of day, presenting food       in an appetizing and easily eaten way, making the cafeteria       inviting, and limiting competitive foods (snacks and       beverages sold in vending machines and a la carte) during the       school day. While some of these strategies cannot be       addressed at the federal level, we encourage you to support       these efforts.        In conclusion we urge you to oppose any riders that block       or weaken stronger nutrition standards for children.

Mr. Chair, this amendment would make it  impossible to update the science based on new evidence. We should be  basing our decisions on science, not what somebody tells us at the gas  station. I hope that we defeat the amendment and the underlying bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I condemn anti-Semitism in all forms. Moreover, calls  for genocide of the Jewish people have no place in reasonable  discourse, and I condemn that, too. I did not think such a statement  would be necessary, but in today's context, it is necessary.   These sentiments were shared repeatedly by Claudine Gay of Harvard,  Sally Kornbluth of MIT, and Elizabeth Magill of the University of  Pennsylvania during their testimony last week.   Unfortunately, because of a 5-minute exchange toward the end of the  hearing that was clipped and shared online without full context during  the hours-long hearing, these university presidents' commitment to  fighting anti-Semitism has been called into question.   This is because, during the clip, they answered the question asked.  They made the mistake of believing the hearing was a serious attempt to  ascertain what could be done to promote student safety on campus in  light of the tension between the First Amendment protections of freedom  of speech on the one hand and the criminal code, title VI, and campus  code of conduct on the other.   Some speech, such as threats, can be so severe as to be criminal.  Other speech could establish a hostile environment on campus in  violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   Universities can establish codes of conduct prohibiting some speech  while respecting the First Amendment, but any speech involved in a  First Amendment analysis is likely to be reprehensible. The fact that  it might be protected does not make the speech any less reprehensible  and does not suggest that you even agree with it.   A call for genocide of Jewish people is obviously reprehensible in  all contexts, but whether or not it is constitutionally protected  depends on context.   Don't take my word for it. Read the article published recently in The  Harvard Crimson authored by Harvard law professor Charles Fried,  formerly the Solicitor General during the Reagan administration.   In the article, Professor Fried states: ``When asked whether they  would discipline students (or, I suppose, faculty) if they called for  genocide of Jews, each president responded that the answer depends on  the context of the utterances.''   He goes on by saying: ``I have taught at Harvard Law School since  1961 and began practicing before the Supreme Court in 1985--for 4 years  as Solicitor General of the United States--and I would have felt  professionally obligated to answer as the presidents did. It does  depend on context.   ``In the 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled  unanimously that `constitutional guarantees of free speech and free  press do not permit a State to forbid or prescribe advocacy of the use  of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to  inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite  or produce such action.'''   He continues: ``Speech itself is, indeed, well protected.''   The three university presidents head private institutions that are  not bound in every aspect by Federal constitutional restraints, but  each institution, in various ways, has declared itself committed to  protecting First Amendment values over the years.   It is not surprising that their presidents would have answered that  whether they would discipline or expel students for advocating genocide  depends on the context. If one seeks to follow constitutional  principles, answering this question certainly does depend on the  context.   That is what Professor Fried said. That is the kind of analysis  applied to any freedom of speech question. It is even being applied to  former President Trump today. Was his speech on January 6, 2021, a  crime of inciting violence or was it protected speech?   Incredibly, the university presidents were directed to give a one- word answer, yes or no, and they responded as Professor Fried said he  would have been professionally obligated to do: It depends on context.   Regrettably, they took the question as an opportunity to seriously  discuss the constitutional implications of a complex question. That was  a big mistake. For that mistake, we are considering a resolution to  condemn them and ask them to resign.   I also think it is important to put this resolution in context  because, in 2017, after white supremacists walked through the campus of  the University of Virginia shouting, ``Jews will not replace us,''  Democrats on the committee requested a hearing on that incident and  nothing happened. Meanwhile, the one who declared there were ``good  people on both sides'' has been enthusiastically endorsed.   We need to do everything the law allows to address anti-Semitism,  [[Page H6909]]  Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination on  college campuses. This resolution is not a serious effort to advance  that cause. I, therefore, oppose this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  December 8 statement from the Foundation for Individual Rights and  Expression, a group invited by the majority in 2018 to testify at a  hearing examining the First Amendment rights on campus and a group that  authors the free speech ranking the majority cited several times at the  committee hearing, titled, ``University Presidents Were Right to  Condemn Hate Speech and Defend Free Speech.''                         [From FIRE, Dec. 8, 2023]     Special Post: Stephen Rohde, `University Presidents Were Right to  Condemn Hate Speech and Defend Free Speech'--First Amendment News 403.1                         (by Ronald K. L. Collins)         When it comes to speech on college campuses, the problem is       one with a vintage flavor. Simply recall (if you can) what       Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in his 1957 opinion in Sweezy       v. New Hampshire (a case successfully argued by professor       Thomas Emerson): ``The essentiality of freedom in the       community of American universities is almost self-evident.''        Note that it was a plurality opinion--and note also his use       of the word ``almost.'' In other words, doubts lingered.        Four decades later, in a book way ahead of its time, the       late Robert M. O'Neil awakened our world to free speech       issues that would define the world in decades to come. The       book was ``Free Speech in the College Community.'' In it, Bob       (a free speech champion and friend) wrote:        When the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of       Teaching surveyed university presidents for a study in the       late 1980s entitled campus tensions, more than half the       respondents noted that racial intimidation or harassment was       a serious problem on their campuses. The National Institute       Against Prejudice and Violence, which has the most detailed       database, cited at least 250 campuses at which acts of racial       hatred occurred in the period 1986-89. The institute has       elsewhere reported that one in five minority students       encounters some form of physical or psychological racial       harassment at least once a year.        And so the same problem resurfaces, but now in a new       context, growing out of the Israel-Hamas War and the free       expression issues raised by it: those of antisemitism and       hate speech. In a recent Politico Magazine interview,       professor Eugene Volokh said:        I'm worried that there is pro-Palestinian speech being       suppressed. I'm worried that there's some pro-Israeli speech       being suppressed . . . I also think that there are some       things that are being too much tolerated.        Mindful of all of the above and much more, what follows is       an op-ed by Stephen Rohde, author of ``American Words of       Freedom: The Words That Define Our Nation'' and ``Freedom of       Assembly,'' regarding the recent hearings on campus       antisemitism and the reactions to statements by the       university presidents on the matter.        At a contentious congressional hearing on December 5, the       presidents of three major universities unequivocally       condemned antisemitism and hate speech while standing firm in       defense of free speech. In a furious backlash, elected       officials, alumni, students and donors have unleashed       scathing criticism, going so far as to open a congressional       investigation and demand that all three resign.        The three presidents, Elizabeth Magill of the University of       Pennsylvania, Claudine Gay of Harvard, and Sally Kornbluth of       Massachusetts Institute of Technology, testified before the       House Committee on Education and the Workforce at a hearing       entitled ``Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting       Antisemitism.''        The episode reveals not only how little our elected       officials and the American people understand about the       concept of protected free speech at our colleges and       universities; it shows how, in a free society, confidence in       the value of protecting all ideas and viewpoints--even those       we despise--is eroding.                   Nadine Strossen's `non-emergency speech'         Public colleges and universities are bound by the First       Amendment. Private colleges and universities, in their       written policies and handbooks (and in some states by       legislation), generally guarantee students and faculty       members the right to academic freedom and freedom of speech       comparable to the First Amendment.        In her new book ``Free Speech: What Everyone Needs to       Know,'' Nadine Strossen, who served for 17 years as national       president of the ACLU, provides a useful summary of current       First Amendment law:        The First Amendment permits government to outlaw the speech       that is the most dangerous, consistent with the ``emergency''       principle: speech that, considered in its overall context,       directly, imminently causes or threatens specific serious       harm . . . [on the other hand, the] First Amendment outlaws       the censorship that is the most dangerous: restrictions based       solely on disfavor of the speaker's ideas, or on generalized,       speculative fear that the speech might indirectly contribute       to some future harm.        Strossen calls the latter ``non-emergency speech.''        While non-emergency speech may potentially cause harm,       Strossen explains that ``it is dangerous to grant government       the added latitude to punish speech with a less direct,       imminent connection to potential harm'' because       ``predictably, government (which is accountable to       majoritarian and other powerful interest groups)       disproportionately exercises any such discretion to suppress       minority voices and views.''        Strossen's warning applies equally to public universities       (which are an arm of the government) as well as to private       universities, which rely on the support of the federal and       state governments as well as donors and alumni, and who may       be inclined to suppress unpopular views in order to protect       their funding.        Consequently, whether students should be expelled or       disciplined for expressing their views goes far beyond simply       looking at the words they speak. It requires a serious       examination of the context and circumstances surrounding the       speech. The chants of protesters at a large rally screaming       ``Kill all the Jews,'' while unspeakably vile and       contemptible, would not ``directly and imminently'' cause or       threaten specific serious harm when considered in their       overall context.        Yet the same words spoken by someone holding a gun on the       steps of a Jewish student center do pose a ``direct and       imminent threat'' and should be stopped and punished by       campus authorities and/or the government. What students say       in the classroom should be treated differently than what they       say at a campus rally or debate. Angry threats made to       individual students should be treated differently than the       same words written on a flyer or in an op-ed in the campus       newspaper.                    The plight of Penn's President Magill         Members of Congress and other critics of the college       presidents apparently couldn't be bothered with the nuances       of these complex issues. In the midst of complaints that the       presidents failed to adequately condemn antisemitism, scant       attention has been paid to their opening remarks.        For example, Penn President Magill couldn't have been more       forceful in her condemnation of antisemitism. Given the       misleading and unfair criticism to which she was subjected       and the immediate calls for her resignation, her balanced and       comprehensive opening statement deserves to be considered in       detail.        After summarizing her impressive credentials prior to       becoming Penn's president (executive vice president and       provost of the University of Virginia, dean of Stanford Law       School, professor of law at the University of Virginia, law       clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg),       she immediately and forcefully stated that she and Penn:        . . . are horrified by and condemn Hamas's abhorrent       terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th. There is no       justification--none--for those heinous attacks. The loss of       life and suffering that are occurring in Israel and Gaza       during the ensuing war are heartbreaking. The pain extends to       our campus. I know it from my daily conversations with our       students, faculty, and staff, as well as parents and alumni.        Magill said she valued the opportunity to reaffirm her and       Penn's ``unyielding opposition to antisemitism, and to       outline the urgent, university-wide actions we are taking to       combat this centuries-old and resurgent threat.'' She also       said her ``first priority is to members of the Penn community       and, above all, to their safety and support.'' She continued:  [[Page H6913]]         I must also ensure that our academic mission thrives; that       academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas endure; and       that we swiftly address any violation of the Law or our       University's policies. These are the priorities Penn is       seeking to achieve in the actions I will discuss today.        She noted that prior to October 7, ``antisernitism''--a       pernicious, viral evil--was already rising in our society,       and global events have dramatically accelerated the surge. No       place is immune, and campuses, including ours, have recently       experienced an unacceptable number of antisemitic incidents.       We are combating this evil head-on with immediate action.''       She described how she ``condemned antisemitism publicly,       regularly, and in the strongest terms possible,'' and wanted       to:        reiterate my and Penn's commitment to combating it. For       decades our Division of Public Safety has learned from and       worked with the Anti-Defamation League office in       Philadelphia, and we are working closely with them, as well       as local, state, and federal law enforcement to promptly       report and investigate antisemitic acts against any member of       the Penn community. Where we have been able to identify       individuals who committed these acts in violation of existing       University policy or law, we have initiated disciplinary       proceedings and referred these matters to law enforcement       where appropriate.        President Magill went into detail about how Penn has       ``acted decisively to ensure safety throughout and near       campus.'' Then she pointed out that like many communities       around the world:        Penn has also experienced protests, rallies, and vigils       related to the terrorist attack and the subsequent war.       Protest--and all it entails--has long been a feature of       university life. Penn's approach to protest is guided by the       U.S. Constitution, outlined in decades-old open expression       policies, and supported and upheld by trained Open Expression       Observers. We recognize the right of peaceful protest and       assembly, and we give broad protection to free expression--      even expression that is offensive. At the same time, we have       zero tolerance for violence or speech intended to incite it.       Our public safety officers are present at every protest,       rally, or vigil, trained in de-escalation techniques, and, if       necessary, they are ready to act.        Magill also talked about ``the challenges of fostering       robust debate during difficult times,'' how ``in addition to       respecting the right of protest, Penn is offering many ways       for students to come together in classrooms and in small       groups to discuss these issues,'' how ``educating citizens       requires engagement with real-world challenges and hard       topics--topics that often inspire passionate responses,'' and       how ``university leadership must provide guardrails that       encourage free and open expression while also ensuring a       secure environment.''        She outlined Penn's new ``Action Plan to Combat       Antisemitism'' and she announced that she had created a new       student advisory group on the Jewish student experience.        Magill also noted the:        ``rising harassment, intimidation, doxing, and threats       toward students, faculty, and staff based on their identity       or perceived identity as Muslim, Palestinian, or Arab. Some       have lost family members in this war, and many are worried       about the safety of their loved ones in the region. Many are       also afraid for their own safety, and the horrifying shooting       of three Palestinian students in Vermont has only deepened       their fears.''        She said she was ``appalled by and have publicly condemned       these acts of harassment, threats, and intimidation. We are       investigating all allegations, even when threats have come       from outside our campus. We are providing resources and       advice to assist individuals with online doxing, harassment,       and threats.''        And she has created a Presidential Commission on Countering       Hate and Building Community ``to empower our campus leaders       to address antisemitism, Islamophobia, and hate in all forms,       and to lay the groundwork for a stronger, more connected       community.''        Magill ended her opening statements by reiterating that:        ``[h]igher education institutions create knowledge, share       it for good, and educate the next generation--missions that       have never been more essential,'' and noting that on Penn's       campus today many people are ``engaged in serious and       respectful conversation--despite disagreement--about       difficult topics, including those related to the Israel-Hamas       war.''    Representative Elise Stefanik: `does calling for the genocide of Jews            Violate Penn's Rules or Code of Conduct? Yes or No?'         Most of the attacks on Magill focused on her exchange with       Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York.       Stefanik noted that ``there had been marches where students       had chanted support for intifada, an Arabic word that means       `uprising' and that many Jews hear as a call for violence       against them.''        Stefanik asked Magill, ``Does calling for the genocide of       Jews violate Penn's rules or code of conduct? Yes or no?''        Magill replied, `'If the speech turns into conduct, it can       be harassment.''        Stefanik pressed the issue: ``I am asking, specifically:       Calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute       bullying or harassment?''        Magill, who joined Penn last year with a pledge to promote       campus free speech, replied, ``If it is directed and severe,       pervasive, it is harassment.''        Stefanik responded: ``So the answer is yes.''        Trying to give complete rather than glib answers, Magill       said, ``It is a context-dependent decision, congresswoman.''       Stefanik then exclaimed, ``That's your testimony today?       Calling for the genocide of Jews is depending upon the       context?''        After some more back and forth, Magill said, ``It can be       harassment,'' to which Stefanik responded, ``The answer is       yes.''        Given the totality of Magill's testimony, it is astonishing       and disappointing that Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania said       he found her statements ``unacceptable.'' According to The       New York Times, he said:        ``It should not be hard to condemn genocide, genocide       against Jews, genocide against anyone else,'' and ``I've said       many times, leaders have a responsibility to speak and act       with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple       test. . . . There should be no nuance to that--she needed to       give a one-word answer.        Shapiro, who is a nonvoting member of Penn's board, urged       the trustees to meet soon. CNN has reported that the board       held an emergency meeting on Wednesday, December 6. No       outcome has been announced.        ``It's unbelievable that this needs to be said: Calls for       genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we       represent as a country,'' said White House spokesman Andrew       Bates, according to The New York Times.        The Times also reported that Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of       Pennsylvania, did not mince words. ``President Magill's       comments yesterday were offensive, but equally offensive was       what she didn't say,'' he said in a statement. ``The right to       free speech is fundamental, but calling for the genocide of       Jews is antisemitic and harassment, full stop.''        Senator John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, described       the testimony as ``a significant fail . . . There is no `both       sides-ism' and it isn't `free speech,' it's simply hate       speech,'' he said in a statement. ``It was embarrassing for a       venerable Pennsylvania university, and it should be reflexive       for leaders to condemn antisemitism and stand up for the       Jewish community or any community facing this kind of       invective.''            Did Magill's critics actually listen to her testimony?         Did these officials actually listen to Magill's testimony       or did they just rely on truncated news reports and angry       social media posts? In fact, Magill repeatedly and       unequivocally condemned antisemitism and the Hamas attacks,       and she said that calling for the genocide of Jews could       constitute harassment under Penn's policies.        The Times also reported that Marc Rowan, the chief of       Apollo Group and the board chair at the Wharton School--      Penn's business school--wrote to the university's board of       trustees asking them to rescind their support for Magill.       ``How much damage to our reputation are we willing to       accept?'' he wrote. ``The call for fundamental change at       UPenn continues.''        Within 24 hours, a petition demanding Magill's resignation       had attracted more than 3,000 signatures. Did Rowan and the       3,000 who signed the petition actually listen to all of her       testimony before taking the extraordinary step of calling for       her resignation?        Now Congress is threatening all three universities with a       full-fledged investigation reminiscent of the HUAC and       McCarthy hearings of the 1940s and 1950s that looked into       communists and their ``sympathizers,'' questioning college       professors under oath about their teaching, writing, and       politics. Many were fired or forced to sign loyalty oaths.        On Thursday, Rep. Virginia Foxx, chair of the House       Committee on Education & the Workforce, told Fox News:        ``[T]he Committee is opening a formal investigation into       the learning environments at Harvard, UPenn, and MIT and       their policies and disciplinary procedures. This       investigation will include substantial document requests, and       the Committee will not hesitate to utilize compulsory       measures including subpoenas if a full response is not       immediately forthcoming.''        Stefanik is quoted as saying that after ``this week's       pathetic and morally bankrupt testimony by university       presidents when answering my questions, the Education and       Workforce Committee is launching an official Congressional       investigation with the full force of subpoena power into       Penn, MIT, and Harvard and others.''        Ominously, she did not specify what other colleges and       universities would be targeted. ``We will use our full       Congressional authority to hold these schools accountable for       their failure on the global stage,'' she added.        Facing this barrage of threats and criticism, with her job       on the line, Magill relented and apologized for her       testimony:        ``In that moment, I was focused on our university's       longstanding policies aligned with the U.S. Constitution,       which say that speech alone is not punishable . . . I was not       focused on, but I should have been, the irrefutable fact that       a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of       the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It's       evil--plain and simple. In my view, it would be harassment or       intimidation.''                     Enter Harvard President Claudine Gay         Harvard's president, Claudine Gay, has also come under fire       from donors, students  [[Page H6914]]       and alumni over her statements about whether calls for       genocide of Jews would be a breach of Harvard's code of       conduct. Gay testified that this type of speech was       ``personally abhorrent to me'' and ``at odds with the values       of Harvard.'' But she added that Harvard gives ``a wide berth       to free expression, even of views that are objectionable,''       and takes action ``when speech crosses into conduct that       violates our policies'' governing bullying, harassment or       intimidation.        The Times reports that Jacob Miller, the student president       of Harvard Hillel, said that ``the testimony yesterday was a       slap in the face, because there was a very easy clear right       answer and she opted not to say that.'' Bill Ackman, the       billionaire hedge fund manager and Harvard alumnus, called on       all three presidents to resign, citing the exchanges over       genocide. ``It depends on the context' and whether the speech       turns into conduct,' that is, actually killing Jews,'' he       wrote on X. ``This could be the most extraordinary testimony       ever elicited in the Congress. They must all resign in       disgrace. If a CEO of one of our companies gave a similar       answer, he or she would be toast within the hour.''        The day after the hearing, Harvard released this statement       from Gay:        ``There are some who have confused a right to free       expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for       violence against Jewish students. Let me be clear: Calls for       violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any       religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at       Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be       held to account.''        Her statement did not say what would constitute a threat,       or whether chants of ``There is only one solution: intifada,       revolution'' would meet the definition, as Stefanik argued       during the hearing.                                   On Fire         The Times quoted a spokesman for the Foundation for       Individual Riqhts and Expression, a free speech advocacy       group, who explained that whether speech rises to the level       of harassment ``is a complicated and fact-intensive issue''       that stems from a pattern of targeted behavior. ``For       example, it's hard to see how the single utterance       Representative Stefanik asked about during the hearing--no       matter how offensive--would qualify given this requirement,''       the spokesman said.        FIRE is correct. Take, for example, Harvard's ``University-      Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities.'' It begins by       declaring that the ``central functions of an academic       community are learning, teaching, research and scholarship''       and that by ``accepting membership in the University, an       individual joins a community ideally characterized by free       expression, free inquiry, intellectual honesty, respect for       the dignity of others, and openness to constructive change.       The rights and responsibilities exercised within the       community must be compatible with these qualities.''                              The Harvard Policy         The Harvard policy explains that the ``rights of members of       the University are not fundamentally different from those of       other members of society,'' suggesting that First Amendment       norms apply, while adding that the University ``has a special       autonomy and reasoned dissent plays a particularly vital part       in its existence.'' All members of the University ``have the       right to press for action on matters of concern by any       appropriate means'' and the University ``must affirm, assure       and protect the rights of its members to organize and join       political associations, convene and conduct public meetings,       publicly demonstrate and picket in orderly fashion, advocate       and publicize opinion by print, sign, and voice.''        Furthermore, the University:        places special emphasis, as well, upon certain values which       are essential to its nature as an academic community. Among       these are freedom of speech and academic freedom, freedom       from personal force and violence, and freedom of movement.       Interference with any of these freedoms must be regarded as a       serious violation of the personal rights upon which the       community is based.        Finally, the policy makes clear ``that intense personal       harassment of such a character as to amount to grave       disrespect for the dignity of others be regarded as an       unacceptable violation of the personal rights on which the       University is based.''        It is immediately apparent--and should have been apparent       to the White House, members of Congress, Governor Shapiro,       and the rest of the critics--that Magill and Gay were       accurately reflecting the complex analysis required to       determine when free speech crosses the line into prohibited       harassment, threats, or violence.        Magill was indeed correct that ``if the speech turns into       conduct, it can be harassment,'' that ``if it is directed and       severe, pervasive, it is harassment,'' and therefore, calling       for the genocide of Jews ``can be harassment.''        She had the audacity to explain that it would depend on all       the facts and circumstances.        Gay was indeed correct that calls for the genocide of Jews       are ``personally abhorrent'' and ``at odds with the values of       Harvard.'' And she was also correct that Harvard gives ``a       wide berth to free expression, even of views that are       objectionable,'' and takes action ``when speech crosses into       conduct that violates our policies'' governing bullying,       harassment or intimidation.        Apparently, her sin was trying to explain freedom of speech       to Congress and the American people.        The Supreme Court and federal law make clear that for       speech in the educational setting to constitute       ``harassment'' sufficient to result in expulsion or other       discipline, it must be ``so severe, pervasive, and       objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim's       access . . . to an educational opportunity or benefit.''        Had Stefanik and her colleagues taken the time to       familiarize themselves with the current law on free speech       and framed their questions in terms of the legal definition       of ``harassment,'' they would have found common agreement       with all three presidents. Had all the critics done their       homework instead of spreading misunderstanding about free       speech on campus, they would have embraced and applauded how       these university presidents skillfully condemned what they       called the ``pernicious, viral evil'' of antisemitism and the       ``abhorrent'' calls for genocide of Jews, while upholding       ``academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas'' which       ensure ``a wide berth to free expression, even of views that       are objectionable.''           Enter the American Association of University Professors         The American Association of University Professors' policy,       On Freedom of Expression and Campus Speech Codes, adopted       almost thirty years ago, reminds us that ``[f]reedom of       thought and expression is essential to any institution of       higher learning'' in order to inspire ``vigorous debate on       those social, economic, and political issues that arouse the       strongest passions. In the process, views will be expressed       that may seem to many wrong, distasteful, or offensive. Such       is the nature of freedom to sift and winnow ideas.''        On a campus ``that is free and open, no idea can be banned       or forbidden. No viewpoint or message may be deemed so       hateful or disturbing that it may not be expressed. Hostility       or intolerance to persons who differ from the majority       (especially if seemingly condoned by the institution) may       undermine the confidence of new members of the community.''       The AAUP notes:        In response to verbal assaults and use of hateful language,       some campuses have felt it necessary to forbid the expression       of racist, sexist, homophobic, or ethnically demeaning       speech, along with conduct or behavior that harasses. Several       reasons are offered in support of banning such expression.       Individuals and groups that have been victims of such       expression feel an understandable outrage. They claim that       the academic progress of minority and majority alike may       suffer if fears, tensions, and conflicts spawned by slurs and       insults create an environment inimical to learning.        And while these ``arguments, grounded in the need to foster       an atmosphere respectful of and welcoming to`all persons,       strike a deeply responsive chord in the academy,'' the AAUP       acknowledges ``both the weight of these concerns and the       thoughtfulness of those persuaded of the need for regulation,       rules that ban or punish speech based upon its content cannot       be justified.''        The AAUP continues, `An institution of higher learning       fails to fulfill its mission if it asserts the power to       proscribe ideas--and racial or ethnic slurs, sexist epithets,       or homophobic insults almost always express ideas, however       repugnant. Indeed, by proscribing any ideas, a university       sets an example that profoundly disserves its academic       mission.''        The AAUP cites what the Supreme Court stated when it       rejected criminal sanctions for offensive words:        [W]ords are often chosen as much for their emotive as their       cognitive force. We cannot sanction the view that the       Constitution, while solicitous of the cognitive content of       individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive       function which, practically speaking, may often be the more       important element of the overall message sought to be       communicated.        The AAUP further warns that a college or university:        sets a perilous course if it seeks to differentiate between       high-value and low-value speech, or to choose which groups       are to be protected by curbing the speech of others. A speech       code unavoidably implies an institutional competence to       distinguish permissible expression of hateful thought from       what is proscribed as thoughtless hate.        Moreover, the AAUP says, ``banning speech often avoids       consideration of means more compatible with the mission of an       academic institution by which to deal with incivility,       intolerance, offensive speech, and harassing behavior,'' such       as adopting and invoking ``a range of measures that penalize       conduct and behavior, rather than speech--such as rules       against defacing property, physical intimidation or       harassment, or disruption of campus activities,'' the       development of ``courses and other curricular and co-      curricular experiences designed to increase student       understanding and to deter offensive or intolerant speech or       conduct,'' and condemning ``manifestations of intolerance and       discrimination, whether physical or verbal.''        The AAUP concluded by noting that:        [to] some persons who support speech codes, measures like       these--relying as they do on suasion rather than sanctions--      may seem inadequate. But freedom of expression requires       toleration of ``ideas we hate,'' as Justice Holmes put it.       The underlying principle does not change because the demand       is to silence a hateful speaker, or because it comes from       within the academy. Free speech  [[Page H6915]]       is not simply an aspect of the educational enterprise to be       weighed against other desirable ends. It is the very       precondition of the academic enterprise itself.                         The Free Speech Golden Rule         Aryeh Neier, former executive director of Human Rights       Watch, was born in Nazi Germany and became a refugee at two       years old when his family fled in 1939. He was national       director of the ACLU at the time of the Skokie controversy       when the ACLU defended the right of American Nazis to conduct       a march in that predominantly Jewish community.        In his book ``Defending My Enemy: American Nazis, the       Skokie Case, and the Risks of Freedom,'' he explained why a       Jew would defend the Nazis:        Because we Jews are uniquely vulnerable, I believe we can       win only brief respite from persecution in a society in which       encounters are settled by power. As a Jew, therefore,       concerned with my own survival and the survival of the Jews--      the two being inextricably linked--I want restraints placed       on power. The restraints that matter most to me are those       that ensure that I cannot be squashed by power, unnoticed by       the rest of the world. If I am in danger, I want to cry out       to my fellow Jews and to all those I may be able to enlist as       my allies. I want to appeal to the world's sense of justice.       I want restraints that prohibit those in power from       interfering with my right to speak, my right to publish, or       my right to gather with others who also feel threatened.       Those in power must not be allowed to prevent us from       assembling and joining our voices together so we can speak       louder and make sure that we are heard. To defend myself, I       must restrain power with freedom, even if the temporary       beneficiaries are the enemies of freedom.        It is high time elected officials and other critics of free       speech begin to embrace and defend the Free Speech Golden       Rule: Protect the free speech of others as you would have       them protect your free speech.        We are going down a very dangerous path if we set a       precedent and empower government officials or college       administrators to silence, expel, discipline, or criminally       punish students for uttering hateful speech that most of us       find vile and shameful but that falls short of legally       proscribable incitement, true threats, or harassment. Armed       with such awesome powers of censorship, there is no telling       when different government officials or different college       administrators with different political agendas will find       what the rest of us say to be vile and shameful and silence       and punish us.        To defend ourselves, we must restrain power with freedom,       even if the temporary beneficiaries are the enemies of       freedom.     Mr. Speaker, the statement says that Gay was  indeed correct on calls for genocide of Jews were personally abhorrent  and at odds with the values at Harvard. She was also correct that  Harvard gives wide berth to free expression, even to views that are  objectionable and takes action when free speech crosses into conduct  that violates our policies. Apparently, her sin was trying to explain  freedom of speech to Congress and the American people.   The Supreme Court and Federal law makes clear that speech in  educational settings constitutes harassment sufficient to result in  expulsion or other discipline must be so severe, pervasive, and  objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim's access to  the educational opportunity.   Had Stefanik and her colleagues taken time to familiarize themselves  with the current law on free speech and frame their questions in terms  of the legal definition of harassment, they would have found common  agreement with all three presidents.   Mr. Speaker, I condemn anti-Semitism. I condemn calls for genocide of  Jewish people. I guess in this context, that has to be repeated over  and over again. I am also concerned about the polarization of college  campuses and the disturbing rise of discrimination and incidents on  college campuses.   As I have noted, I am skeptical of the majority's newfound concerns  about anti-Semitism on college campuses because, as I said in 2017,  after white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia  grounds shouting, ``Jews will not replace us,'' I do not recall the  same level of outrage. In fact, I note the endorsement of the one who  declared that there were good people on both sides. I wrote a letter to  the majority requesting a congressional hearing at that time, and our  calls went unanswered.   Mr. Speaker, I concede that the university presidents' testimony last  week, when taken out of context, fell under the First Amendment trap  that when you suggest that speech is protected, therefore, you must  agree with it. No, you can believe that speech is protected but also  believe that it is reprehensible. Calling for genocide of Jews is  reprehensible in all contexts, but it could also be protected.   Mr. Speaker, they answered the question the way Professor Fried said  that he would have been professionally obligated to respond, but  answering the question as posed should not warrant calls for his  resignation.   We need to do everything we can do under the law to address anti- Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, and other forms of  discrimination. This resolution fails to do anything to establish  standards that can address reprehensible divisions in our society and  on college campuses.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled, ``President  Gay Was Right: Context Matters.''                  President Gay Was Right: Context Matters                             (By Charles Fried)         Since their appearances before the House Committee on       Education and the Workforce, the presidents of Harvard, the       University of Pennsylvania, and MIT have been subject to a       barrage of hostile criticism in the media, including from       constitutional scholars known for their advocacy for free       speech.        When asked whether they would discipline students (or, I       suppose, faculty) if they called for the genocide of Jews,       each president responded that the answer depends on the       context of the utterances.        I have taught at Harvard Law School since 1961 and began       practicing before the Supreme Court in 1985--for four years       as Solicitor General of the United States--and I would have       felt professionally obligated to answer as the presidents       did. It does depend on the context.        In the 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court       ruled unanimously that ``constitutional guarantees of free       speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or       prescribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation       except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or       producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or       produce such action.''        Now, many--perhaps most--constitutional democracies do not       go this far, and courts in some nations, including Canada,       France, Germany, and South Africa, have allowed criminal       prosecution for what may compendiously be called hate speech.       But our Supreme Court has never deviated from its principle       of incitement.        Even in the case that strayed the furthest from this       standard--the 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law       Project, which upheld the statute that makes it a federal       crime to knowingly provide ``material support or resources to       a foreign terrorist organization''--Chief Justice John       Roberts '76 was careful to carve out free speech from the       ruling.        In that decision, he wrote that, under the statute,       Americans ``may say anything they wish on any topic'' so long       as they do not speak or write ``to, under the direction of,       or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows       to be terrorist organizations.'' The three dissenters would       have gone further in protecting the organizations' speech.        To be clear, governments may withhold benefits from       American members of foreign terrorist organizations under       certain circumstances, and certainly governments may declare       official positions condemning such organizations and their       principles. But none of this includes criminal sanctions.        Speech itself is, indeed, well-protected.        The three university presidents head private institutions       that are not bound in every respect by federal constitutional       constraints. But each institution in various ways has       declared itself committed to protecting First Amendment       values over the years. So it is not surprising that their       presidents would have answered that whether they would       discipline or expel students for advocating genocide depends       on the context.        If one seeks to follow constitutional principles, answering       this question certainly does depend on the context.        In 1991, prompted by an incident in which Harvard students       hung Confederate flags outside their dorm windows, University       President Derek C. Bok penned an essay defending the rights       of the students to display offensive messages.        He directly linked Harvard's free speech guidelines to       First Amendment principles, writing that he had ``difficulty       understanding why a university such as Harvard should have       less free speech than the surrounding society--or than a       public university.''        I must admit that I have never seen such flags in recent       times. Yet, even today, under the circumstances Bok faced, if       I were a university president pressed to answer yes or no       whether the student speech in question would subject the       students to discipline, I would have to reply that, yes, it       depends on the context.        The lead questioner, Representative Elise M. Stefanik '06,       sought to lay a rhetorical trap for the three university       presidents. But I doubt Stefanik is as principled as she       purports to be.        Were the facts of the event before President Bok 30 years       ago to recur and the administration to fail to discipline the       display of Confederate flags, would Representative Stefanik       have had the same reaction? I doubt it.   [[Page H6916]]          Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
