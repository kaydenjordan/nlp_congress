 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today I wish to start off by just  sharing a few words about our former colleague, Senator Fritz  Hollings--Ernest F. Hollings, to be precise--of South Carolina. He  passed away this weekend at his home in Isle of Palms.   With Fritz Hollings, the people of South Carolina, the Senate, have  lost a giant. Hollings was the longest serving junior Senator in  American history--behind, of course, Strom Thurmond--representing his  constituents for 38 years in the Senate.   Before that, he was a Governor, State legislator, and World War II  veteran. Public service was his life's calling. He championed education  reform, increasing teachers' pay, a national voice in the fights  against hunger and poverty.   He was brought up in the old Jim Crow days, with a great deal of  segregation, but as he went through South Carolina, he realized how  terrible that was and began to move in the opposite direction.   He was an original. You could always go over to Fritz Hollings. Even  when I was a younger legislator, he would pay attention, and he would  have something very interesting to say.   Everyone talks about the days of blow-dried, look-alike Senators.  Fritz Hollings certainly wasn't one of them. He was an original, and we  were all much better for it.   So Fritz, we will miss you, and our thoughts go with your family, as  do our prayers and well wishes.
