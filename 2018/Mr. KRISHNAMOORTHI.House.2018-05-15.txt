 Mr. Speaker, the U.S. State Department uses  maternal mortality rates as one of its key metrics for evaluating how  much a country values its women. By our own standards, the United  States is failing that test as we rank just 47th for maternal mortality  rate--the highest of any developed nation--and we remain one of the few  countries that is actually seeing its rate of maternal mortality  increase.   Our medical technology leads the world, and we spend more on  healthcare than any other nation, but what we need is a commitment--a  national commitment--to bringing together the experts, stakeholders,  and, yes, resources to end preventable maternal deaths.   That is why I am proud to have introduced the Ending Maternal  Mortality Act with Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler. Our legislation  requires Federal health officials to develop a national strategy to  combat maternal mortality with the goal of halving the rate of maternal  mortality in the next decade and eliminating preventable maternal  deaths entirely in the next 20 years.                            ____________________
