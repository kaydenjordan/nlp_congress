 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize National  Police Week and honor the law enforcement officers who selflessly serve  and protect our communities. Law enforcement professionals at all  levels, from local police forces to sheriff's departments, to State  police and Federal law enforcement agencies, leave home each day not  knowing what challenges they will experience, but they are ready to  face danger head-on.   National Police Week is a solemn occasion to honor those who  tragically lost their lives while performing their duties. Sadly, last  year proved to be particularly dangerous for officers, and 2020 was one  of the deadliest years for law enforcement officers in recent memory.  The COVID-19 pandemic certainly played a part in that unfortunate  reality.   This year, the names of 394 officers killed in the line of duty have  been etched into the walls of the National Law Enforcement Memorial.  The deaths of 185 of those individuals were COVID-19 related, including  Sergeant James Dancy of the North Little Rock Police Department.
