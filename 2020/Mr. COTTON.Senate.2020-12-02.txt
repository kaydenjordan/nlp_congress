 Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate has just  passed the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, 96 to 1, a bill that  will bring relief to many Americans suffering from a terrible disease.   ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. People with ALS  tragically lose the ability to control their muscles, leading to  paralysis and, ultimately, death. There is no cure.   Many are familiar with ALS because of the baseball legend who  succumbed to it at the height of his career, Lou Gehrig. Others know  Lou Gehrig's disease because it has touched them or a neighbor or a  loved one.   I have been fortunate to know several people with ALS. One of my  earliest supporters in my first campaign was the great Tommy May of  Pine Bluff. Tommy, amazingly, has lived with ALS for nearly 15 years,  beating the odds with courage and good humor. Given the gift of time,  he devoted his energy to finding a cure for ALS, serving as a trustee  on the national ALS Association board. ALS advocates are lucky to have  a fighter like Tommy on their side.   I have also been fortunate to know Kip Jackson of Little Rock and  Thomas Galyon of Rogers and others. Sadly, these ALS advocates have  passed away, but I know how pleased they would be to see this bill  cross the finish line today.   ALS is not like other diseases. It typically appears, without  warning, later in life. Its life expectancy within 16 months is only 50  percent--no better than a coin toss. In other words, ALS strikes fast,  and it strikes hard.   People with ALS typically apply for disability benefits through  Social Security. There is a problem. Disability has a 5-month waiting  period. This waiting period is meant to ensure that applicants aren't  suffering from a temporary affliction, and under most circumstances, it  is appropriate.   But, of course, ALS isn't temporary. For those who have it, given the  odds they face, every month counts. That is why, years ago, Senator  Whitehouse and I introduced the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act,  which will waive this 5-month period for people with ALS. This will  ensure they have rapid access to Social Security in the early days of  their diagnosis, so they don't have to worry about benefits and can  focus instead on the things that really matter during what could be  their final months on Earth.   On their behalf, I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his  partnership over the years. I want to thank Senator Braun for what he  has done to help get this bill across the finish line today. I am  pleased so many of our colleagues supported this bill.   I want to explain briefly my position on the amendment offered by  Senator Grassley. I support the amendment in concept, but I opposed the  amendment today because the original purpose of this bill has always  been to address ALS specifically.   I will support Senator Grassley's language in future legislation, but  to pass this bill in the final days of the 116th Congress, the Senate-- and especially in the days ahead in the House--it was vital that we  send the unamended bill to the House.   I look forward to working with Senator Grassley in the next Congress  to ensure the sustainability of both the Social Security Disability and  the ALS trust fund. He has been a great partner in protecting these  vital programs, and I know he will be in the future.   Finally, I want to close by quoting Lou Gehrig's final address at  Yankee Stadium in 1939. He had just received his fatal diagnosis. He  didn't focus on the hardships that lay in his future. Instead, he  famously exclaimed:         I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the       Earth. . . . I might have been given a bad break, but I have       an awful lot to live for.    The same could be said of every person living with ALS today. They  have an awful lot to live for, and this bill will help them live.   I yield the floor.
