 First, I want to thank my colleagues for all of the good  work so far on the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act. We  were very productive last week, and I hope this week can be equally so.   Today, we will begin our work by holding two floor votes, one on  Senators Cornyn and Casey's outbound investment screen amendment and  then a vote on the Round-Tester farmlands amendment. Both of these  amendments have been in the works for months, and I intend to vote in  their favor. I urge my colleagues to do so as well.   I know there are concerns on both sides of the aisle with some of the  text in both amendments. Senators Cornyn, Casey, Rounds, Tester, and I  are all committed to working through these concerns in the conference  process.   Tomorrow, we will vote on the Warnock-Budd amendment designed to halt  debt collector harassment of our servicemembers. Again, I appreciate  the cooperation of Senators on both sides as we worked to lock in these  votes.   And today and tomorrow, Leader McConnell, Chair Reed, Ranking Member  Wicker, and I will also work on assembling a second managers' package  of amendments.   I hope this effort is successful. It will require everyone to work  together, and we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   Concurrently, we will also keep working on additional floor votes  that we might need to finish the NDAA this week. We have a chance to  show the American people that the Senate can work productively on our  national defense, in stark contrast to the partisan race to the bottom  that we saw over in the House.   But the work isn't finished yet. We are going to keep negotiating a  path forward, and the Senate will continue working on the NDAA until  the job is done. I thank both sides for their efforts.                          Business Before the Senate    Mr. President, now on other Senate business, as we move forward with  the  [[Page S3504]]  NDAA here on the floor, appropriators also continue working in  committee. Last week, the Appropriations Committee marked up and  approved three more bills, and, this week, they will hold another  markup on Thursday. Just like the NDAA, I am proud to say the  appropriations process has been largely bipartisan, precisely as it  should be.   And, finally, with so much going on this week, I want to remind my  colleagues that we will be holding our third all-Senators briefing on  AI, following up on our classified briefing earlier this month. I thank  all of my colleagues for making the time to attend these AI briefings.   Today, I also wish to recognize the efforts of the Judiciary  Committee, which this afternoon is holding its own hearing on AI  regulation. They join the work of many other committees that have moved  quickly this year to begin focusing on AI in a very serious way.   The Senate will continue ramping up our focus on AI policy when we  begin hosting our Insight Forums later this fall.   So, once again, thank you to my colleagues for their good work on  this pressing matter.                           Inflation Reduction Act    Mr. President, now on the IRA and its 1-year anniversary. We are  approaching the 1-year anniversary of the passage of the Inflation  Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act, known as the IRA, was one  of the most consequential pieces of legislation passed in decades, and  in just one year it is already paying huge dividends for the American  people, for our economy, and for our environment.   Since we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, costs are down for  families. For the first time ever, we made it possible for Medicare to  negotiate the price of prescription drugs. Vaccines are free for  Medicare beneficiaries. A cap on out-of-pocket drug spending for  seniors is just a few months away. No one will pay more than $2,000 a  year for expensive drugs that they need to save their lives.   And, of course, after a lot of hard work, we also capped the price of  insulin for seniors on Medicare to $35--only $35--a month. Since then,  Ely Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also lowered insulin costs for  everybody.   And we hope to build on all of this work with additional legislation  later this year. Every American deserves to have affordable insulin,  not just those on Medicare. Let's not forget that the patent for  insulin expired a long time ago. It was invented in 1921 or 1922--I  believe it was--by a Canadian inventor who sold the patent for only a  dollar. So there is no need to have insulin at the exorbitant high  price that it is for those not on Medicare.   The Inflation Reduction Act has also helped countless Americans  manage their energy costs. The tax credits and rebates on energy  efficiency are helping Americans keep their homes warmer in the winter  and cooler in the summer, all at a more affordable price, while at the  same time reducing our carbon emissions.   And a few weeks ago, we saw that inflation slowed down to just 3  percent, the lowest it has been in over 2 years. In fact, since we  passed the Inflation Reduction Act, inflation has been cut by more than  half on an annual basis, and wage growth is still continuing to grow.  It is now significantly above inflation, meaning workers are taking  home more while spending less. That is the emblem of an economy that  America needs.   And, of course, the IRA is also paving the way for millions-- millions--of new good-paying green jobs. The IRA produced a boom in  clean energy investment with nearly 80 new clean energy manufacturing  facilities announced across the country.   So when you put it all together, the Inflation Reduction Act is a  shining example of the Democratic agenda in action: lower costs for  families, higher wages for workers, and millions--millions--of new  good-paying jobs for years to come.   Democrats are proud of the progress we have made in implementing our  agenda and will keep working until every American feels the benefits.       Honoring Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson    Mr. President, finally, on a sad anniversary, yesterday marked 25  years since Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut of the  Capitol Police were killed in the line of duty while defending the  Capitol Building.   It was a dark day in the history of the Capitol, and it would have  been even darker if not for the heroics of Detective Gibson and Officer  Chestnut. In the face of grave danger, they acted with extreme valor  and courage, undoubtedly saving the lives of many others in the  building that day.   We are grateful for their sacrifice 25 years ago and grateful for the  work the Capitol Police do every day to keep the Capitol Complex and  those who work here safe.   And we pray that their families have some degree of peace, even  though they have huge holes in their heart with these terrible losses.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.
