 You know, the president knows who he's talking       to when he tweets or when he makes statements. He knows who       he is talking to. He knows what he wants them to do. And the       fact that he said the things, he has been saying the things       he has been saying since the election, and encouraging       people, there is no surprise, again, at what happened       yesterday.   No surprise. Think about that. No surprise. The President had every  reason to know that this would happen because he assembled the mob, he  summoned the mob, and he incited the mob. He knew when he took that  podium on that fateful morning that those in attendance had heeded the  words and they were waiting for his orders to begin fighting.   And that, of course, brings me, my fellow managers, to what happened  here in this building. As Lead Manager Raskin stated, my colleagues are  going to walk through the events of January 6 and the evidence in very  great detail. They are painful to watch and to recount, and I am not  going to repeat the evidence now.   But I do want to be clear about what also happened during that  terrible attack, and that is this: that President Trump, once again,  failed us because when the violence erupted, when we and the law  enforcement officials protecting you were under attack, as each of you  were being evacuated from this Chamber from a violent mob, as we were  being evacuated from the House, he could have immediately and  forcefully intervened to stop the violence. It was his duty as  Commander in Chief to stop the violence, and he alone had that power,  not just because of his unique role as Commander in Chief but because  they believed that they were following his orders. They said so.   (Text of videotape presentation.)         President Trump!        President Trump!        Fight for Trump!        Fight for Trump!        Fight for Trump!        We were invited by the President of the United States!        I thought I was following my President. I thought I was       following what we were called to do. President Trump       requested that we be in DC on the 6th.    You heard it from them. They were doing what he wanted them to do.  They wouldn't have listened to you, to me, to the Vice President of the  United States who they were attacking. They didn't stop in the face of  law enforcement, police officers fighting for their lives to stop them.  They were following the President. He alone, our Commander in Chief,  had the power to stop them and he didn't.   You will hear evidence tonight, tomorrow, throughout the trial, about  his refusal as Commander in Chief to respond to numerous desperate  pleas on the phone, across social media, begging him to stop the  attack. And you will see his relentless attack on Vice President Pence,  who was at that very moment hiding with his family as armed extremists  were chanting, ``Hang Mike Pence,'' calling him a traitor.   You will see that even when he did finally, 3\1/2\ hours into the  attack, tell these people to go home in peace, he added, as Lead  Manager Raskin said, I will quote:         You're very special. We love you.    Think for a moment--just a moment--of the lives lost that day, of the  more than 140 wounded police officers, and ask yourself if, as soon as  this had started, President Trump had simply gone onto TV, just logged  onto Twitter and said ``Stop the attack.'' If he had done so with even  half as much force as he said ``Stop the steal,'' how many lives would  we have saved? Sadly, he didn't do that.   At the end of the day, the President was not successful in stopping  the certification. That we know, thanks to the bravery of our law  enforcement and to the bravery of the Senators in this  [[Page S620]]  room, each of you who still fulfilled your constitutional duty even  under the threat of mortal peril. But there can be no doubt of the  grave harm that he caused to our elected leaders; to us, our families;  to all who work at the Capitol, our staff, your staff; to our brave  Capitol police, who defend us tirelessly with little thanks, who  believed that they had a Commander in Chief who would defend and  protect them, instead put them in harm's way; to those killed for  heeding his command; to our democracy and the system, which ensures  that we have a President elected by the people; to our national  security and our standing in the world. The harm was real. The damage  was real.   Five people lost their lives on that terrible, tragic day. A woman  was shot dead 50 feet from where we later certified the election  results. And for those who question just how bad it was, criminal  complaints recently unsealed by the Department of Justice are more than  revealing. You all see one of these documents on the screen. In the  charging affidavit of one of the leaders of the Proud Boys, we learned  that members of this group ``said that they would have killed . . .  Mike Pence if given the chance.''   In another, we learned of the tweet in realtime while they were in  the building stating:         We broke into the Capitol . . . we got inside, we did our       part. . . . We were looking for Nancy [Pelosi] to shoot her       in the friggin' brain but we didn't find her.    And for anyone who suggests otherwise, these defendants themselves  have told you exactly why they were here. You will se this in the  trial, that in the halls of the Capitol, on social media, in news  interviews, and in charging documents, they confirmed they were  following the President's orders. You can see some of the statements on  that screen, one who said:         Trump wants all able-bodied patriots.    Another:         President Trump is calling us to FIGHT! . . . This isn't a       joke.    Another:         I thought I was following my President. I thought I was       following what we were called to do.        Our President wants us here.        We wait and take orders from [the] president.    He made them believe, over many weeks, that the election was stolen  and they were following his command to take back their country.   As I prepared for today--yesterday, this trial--one memory that I  couldn't shake: It was on the night of January 6 and the feeling of  walking back onto the House floor and seeing many of you there. I  remember us finishing our task at 4 in the morning, and as I walked off  the floor, I was so grateful--so grateful--for the opportunity to thank  the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, for his actions,  for standing before us and asking us to follow our oath and our faith  and our duty.   We only got a couple of hours of sleep that morning. Early the next  day, I called my dad, who came to this country, as I mentioned, as an  immigrant 40 years ago, and I told him that the proudest moment, by  far, of serving in Congress, for me, was going back on to the floor  with each of you to finish the work that we had started.   I am humbled to be back with you today. And just as on January 6,  when we overcame that attack on our Capitol, on our country, I am  hopeful that at this trial, we can use our resolve and our resilience  to, again, uphold our democracy by faithfully applying the law,  vindicating the Constitution, and holding President Trump accountable  for his actions.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Senators, Representatives Joaquin Castro and Eric  Swalwell will now show the evidence of President Trump's long campaign  to delegitimize his electoral defeat and to galvanize his supporters to  help him retain his power at any cost.   So we are going to go, at this point, step by step to explain the  progression all the way up until the attack.   Mr. Manager CASTRO. Good afternoon, you all. My name is Joaquin  Castro. I represent San Antonio in the United States Congress. There is  a saying that ``[a] lie can travel halfway around the world before the  truth has a chance to put on its shoes.'' That was before the internet.   The point of that saying is the lie can do incredible damage and  destruction, and that is especially true when that lie is told by the  most powerful person on Earth, our Commander in Chief, the President of  the United States.   This attack did not come from one speech, and it didn't happen by  accident. The evidence shows clearly that this mob was provoked over  many months by Donald J. Trump. And if you look at the evidence, his  purposeful conduct, you will see that the attack was foreseeable and  preventable.   I will start by discussing President Trump's actions leading up to  the election when he set up his big lie. Beginning in the spring of  2020, President Trump began to fall behind in the polls, and by July,  President Trump had reached a new low. He was running 15 points behind  his opponent, and he was scared.   He began to believe that he could legitimately lose the election, so  he did something entirely unprecedented in the history of our Nation.  He refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power. Here is what he  said:   (Text of videotape presentation.)         Mr. WALLACE: Can you give a direct answer you will accept       the election?
